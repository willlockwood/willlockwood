[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Challenged in this case is the validity of regulations promulgated by appellant Secretary of the Interior that prohibit commercial transactions in parts of birds legally killed before the birds came under the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 444 U. S. 54</a></p><p> protection of the statutes.  The regulations provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>50 CFR \xc2\xa7 21.2(a) (1978):</p>\n<p>"Migratory birds, their parts, nests, or eggs, lawfully acquired prior to the effective date of Federal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act . . . may be possessed or transported without a Federal permit, but may not be imported, exported, purchased, sold, bartered, or offered for purchase, sale, trade, or barter. . . ."</p>\n<p>50 CR \xc2\xa7 22.2(a) (1978):</p>\n<p>"Bald eagles, alive or dead, or their parts, nests, or eggs lawfully acquired prior to June 8, 1940, and golden eagles, alive or dead, or their parts, nests, or eggs lawfully acquired prior to October 24, 1962, may be possessed, or transported without a Federal permit, but may not be imported, exported, purchased, sold, traded, bartered, or offered for purchase, sale, trade or barter. . . ."</p>\n<p>Appellees are engaged in the trade of Indian artifacts:  several own commercial enterprises, one is employed by such an enterprise, and one is a professional appraiser.  A number of the artifacts are partly composed of the feathers of currently protected birds, but these artifacts existed before the statutory protections came into force.  After two of the appellees who had sold "preexisting" artifacts were prosecuted for violations of the Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] appellees brought this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief in the District Court for the District of Colorado.  The complaint alleged that the statutes do not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 444 U.

S. 56</a></p><p> regulatory prohibition of commerce in the parts of protected birds, without regard to when those birds were originally taken.  Appellees respond that such  a prohibition serves no purpose, arguing that statutory protection of wildlife is not furthered by an embargo upon traffic in avian artifacts that existed before the statutory safeguards came into effect.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Our point of departure in statutory analysis is the language of the enactment.  <em>See Southeastern Community College v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html">442 U. S. 397</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html#405">442 U. S. 405</a></span> (1979).  "Though we may not end with the words in construing a disputed statute, one certainly begins there."  F. Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes 16 (1947).</p>\n<p>The terms of the Eagle Protection Act plainly must be read as appellant Secretary argues.  The sweepingly framed prohibition in \xc2\xa7 668(a) makes it unlawful to "take, possess, sell, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import" protected birds.  Congress expressly dealt with the problem of preexisting bird products by qualifying that general prohibition with the proviso that "nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit <em>possession or transportation</em>" of bald or golden eagle parts taken prior to the effective date of coverage under the Act.  (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p>In view of the exhaustive and careful enumeration of forbidden acts in \xc2\xa7 668(a), the narrow limitation of the proviso to "possession or transportation" compels the conclusion that, with respect to preexisting artifacts, Congress specifically declined to except any activities other than possession and transportation from the general statutory ban.  To read a further exemption for preexisting artifacts into the Eagle Protection Act, "we would be forced to ignore the ordinary meaning of plain language."  <em>TVA v. Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/case.html">437 U. S. 153</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/case.html#173">437 U. S. 173</a></span> (1978).  Nor can there be any question of oversight or drafting error.  Throughout the statute, the distinct concepts of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 444 U. S. 57</a></p><p> possession, transportation, taking, and sale or purchase are treated with precision.  The broad proscriptive provisions of the Eagle Protection Act were consistently framed to encompass a full catalog of prohibited acts, always including sale or purchase.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 668(a), 668(b), 668b(b).  In contrast, the exemptions created were specifically limited to possession or transportation, \xc2\xa7 668(a), [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] taking, \xc2\xa7 66a, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] or taking, possession, or transportation, <em>ibid.</em> [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>That this precise use of terminology was intentional is clear from the legislative history.  An explanatory letter from the Department of Agriculture that was adopted in the Senate Report on the bill defines the reach of the Eagle Protection Act to make it unlawful to</p>\n<p>"take, possess, sell, purchase, transport, or otherwise deal with the bald eagle . . . with the proviso to the effect that it will not apply to the <em>possession or transportation</em> of any such eagle . . . taken prior to the effective date of the bill."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 1589, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 1 (1940).  (Emphasis added.)  Further, when Congress amended the Eagle Protection Act in 1962 to cover golden eagles, it once again excepted only possession and transportation of preexisting artifacts from the general ban.  76 Stat. 1246.  And it is particularly relevant that Congress has twice reviewed and amended the statute without rejecting the Department\'s view that it is authorized to bar the sale of preexisting artifacts. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>Cf. NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/267/case.html">416 U. S. 267</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/267/case.html#275">416 U. S. 275</a></span> (1974). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="58">Page 444 U. S. 58</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The prohibition against the sale of bird parts lawfully taken before the effective date of federal protection is fully consonant with the purposes of the Eagle Protection Act.  It was reasonable for Congress to conclude that the possibility of commercial gain presents a special threat to the preservation of the eagles because that prospect creates a powerful incentive both to evade statutory prohibitions against taking birds and to take a large volume of birds.  The legislative draftsmen might well view evasion as a serious danger because there is no sure means by which to determine the age of bird feathers; feathers recently taken can easily be passed off as having been obtained long ago. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellees argue that, even if the age of feathers cannot be ascertained, it is still possible to date the Indian artifacts of which the feathers are a constituent.  Thus, they contend that the goal of preventing evasion of the statute could have been achieved by means less onerous than a general sales ban:  for example, by requiring documentation and appraisal of feathered artifacts.  The short answer is that this legislation is not limited to the sale of feathers as part of artifacts; it broadly addresses sale or purchase of feathers and other bird parts in any shape or form.  The prohibitions of the statute were devised to resist any evasion, whether in the sale of feathers as part of datable artifacts or in the sale of separate undatable bird products.  Moreover, even if there were alternative ways to insure against statutory evasion, Congress was free to choose the method it found most efficacious and convenient. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="59">Page 444 U. S. 59</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"[T]he legislature . . . is authorized to pass measures for the protection of the people . . . in the exercise of the police power, and is itself the judge of the necessity or expediency of the means adopted. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/31/case.html">211 U.

S. 40</a></span> (1908).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The fundamental prohibition in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act is couched in language as expansive as that employed in the Eagle Protection Act.  Title 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 703 provides that</p>\n<p>"[u]nless and except as permitted by regulations made as hereinafter provided in this subchapter, it shall be unlawful . . . to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture, or kill, possess, offer for sale, sell, offer to barter, barter, offer to purchase, purchase, deliver for shipment, ship, export, import, cause to be shipped, exported, or imported, deliver for transportation, transport or cause to be transported, carry or cause to be carried, or receive for shipment, transportation, carriage, or export"</p>\n<p>protected birds.  But the Migratory Bird Treaty Act contains no explicit exception for the possession or transportation of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="60">Page 444 U. S. 60</a></p><p> bird parts obtained before the federal protection became effective:  that exception is created by the Secretary\'s regulation.  50 CFR \xc2\xa7 21.2 (1978).  Unlike our analysis under the Eagle Protection Act, therefore, reliance upon the negative inference from a narrow statutory exemption for the transportation or possession of preexisting artifacts is precluded. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Nevertheless, the text, context, and purpose of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act support the Secretary\'s interpretative regulations of that enactment.</p>\n<p>On its face, the comprehensive statutory prohibition is naturally read as forbidding transactions in all bird parts, including those that compose preexisting artifacts.  While there is no doubt that regulations may exempt transactions from the general ban, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] nothing in the statute requires an exception for the sale of preexisting artifacts.  And no such statutory exception can be implied.  When Congress wanted an exemption from the statutory prohibition, it provided so in unmistakable terms.  <em>Cf.</em> 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 711. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The structure and context of this enactment -- to the extent that they enlighten -- also suggest congressional understanding that regulatory authorities could ban the sale of lawfully </p><p><a class="page-number" name="61">Page 444 U. S. 61</a></p><p> taken birds, except where otherwise expressly instructed by the statute.  If Congress had assumed that lawfully taken birds could automatically be sold under the Act, it would have been unnecessary to specify in \xc2\xa7 711 that it is permissible under certain circumstances to sell game birds lawfully bred on farms and preserves. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Furthermore, Congress could not have been unaware that a traditional legislative tool for enforcing conservation policy was a flat proscription on the sale of wildlife, without regard to the legality of the taking.  At the time, a number of States, for example, simply prohibited or restricted possession or sale of wildlife during seasons closed to hunting.  <em>See New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/31/case.html#40">211 U. S. 40</a></span>.  Also before Congress was the Canadian law implementing the Migratory Bird Treaty, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] and that law itself contained a provision barring the purchase, sale, or possession of protected bird parts "<em>during the time</em> when the capturing, killing, or taking of such bird, nest, or egg is prohibited by law," 55 Cong.Rec. 5412 (1917). [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  (Emphasis added.)  The Canadian sale ban -- of which Congress was aware -- thus applied not to illegally taken birds, but rather to all protected birds during the season in which hunting was prohibited.  Against this background, the absence of a statutory exemption for preexisting avian artifacts implies that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act was intended to embrace the traditional conservation technique of banning transactions in protected birds, whenever taken. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="62">Page 444 U. S. 62</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Related statutes may sometimes shed light upon a previous enactment.  <em>Cf. United States v. Aluminum Co. of America,</em> 148 F.2d 416, 429 (CA2 1945) (L. Hand, J.).  Other conservation legislation enacted by Congress has employed the enforcement technique of forbidding the sale of protected wildlife without respect to the lawfulness of the taking.  The Eagle Protection Act is a notable example.  The more recent Endangered Species Act of 1973, as originally framed, prohibited the sale of products or parts of endangered species, without an exception for those products legally held for commercial purposes at the time of the Act\'s passage. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  <em>See</em> 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1538 ; <em>United States v. Kepler,</em> 531 F.2d 798 (CA6 1976); <em>Delbay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Department of Commerce,</em> 409 F.Supp. 637, 641-642, 644 (DC 1976); <em>see also</em> H.R.Rep. No. 94-823, pp. 3-4 (1976) (discussing an amendment to the Endangered Species Act).  And when Congress has meant to exempt lawfully taken items from the retroactive application of statutory prohibitions, it has taken care to do so explicitly, <em>see</em> 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1372 (Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972); 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 153(b) (Endangered Species Act of 1973), or it has specifically amended the statute for that purpose, see 90 Stat. 911, amending 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1539 (Endangered Species Act); 92 Stat. 3760, amending 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1538 and 1539 (Endangered Species Act).  In contrast, Congress has never established a preexisting artifacts exception to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, even though it has amended the statute on several occasions.

S. 63</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We are therefore persuaded that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act empowers the Secretary of the Interior to bar commercial transactions in covered bird parts in spite of the fact that the parts were lawfully taken before the onset of federal protection.  We see no indication to the contrary. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  It follows </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 444 U.

Resolution of each case, however, ultimately calls as much for the exercise of judgment as for the application of logic.\n</em></p>\n<p>The regulations challenged here do not compel the surrender of the artifacts, and there is no physical invasion or restraint upon them.  Rather, a significant restriction  has been imposed on one means of disposing of the artifacts.  But the denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking.  At least where an owner possesses </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 444 U.

In this case, it is crucial that appellees retain the rights to possess and transport their property, and to donate or devise the protected birds.</p>\n<p>It is, to be sure, undeniable that the regulations here prevent the most profitable use of appellees\' property.  Again, however, that is not dispositive.  When we review regulation, a reduction in the value of property is not necessarily equated with a taking.  <em>Compare Goldblatt v.

At any rate, loss of future profits -- unaccompanied by any physical property restriction -- provides a slender reed upon which to rest a takings claim.  Prediction of profitability is essentially a matter of reasoned speculation that courts are not especially competent to perform.  Further, perhaps because of its very uncertainty, the interest in anticipated gains has traditionally been viewed as less compelling than other property-related interests.  <em>Cf., e.g.,</em> Fuller &amp; Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages (pt. 1), 46 Yale L.J. 52 (1936). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 444 U.

The fact that eagles could be taken, possessed, sold, and purchased in the Territory of Alaska in no way undercut the general ban on sales in the 48 States; we do not read the pre-1959 Alaska exemption as a license to sell Alaska eagles in the rest of the country, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>We are also unpersuaded by appellees\' argument that the Eagle Protection Act does not apply to feathers that have lost their "identities" as elements in artifacts.  This contention is bottomed on the statutory use of the word bird "part" instead of bird "product."  The distinction between the terms is immaterial:  for example, when Congress amended the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to specify that it applied to bird products as well as bird parts, Pub.L. 93-300, 88 Stat.190, the Senate Report indicated that the change was a clarification, rather than a substantive change in the reach of the law.

Originally, the legislation implementing a Migratory Bird Convention between Great Britain (on behalf of Canada) and the United States, the Act now implements similar treaties between this country and other nations.  <em>See generally</em> Coggins &amp; Patti, The Resurrection and Expansion of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 50 Colo.L.Rev. 165, 169-174 (1979); M.

Pub.L. 9359, 90 Stat. 911, amending 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1539.  The amendment was circumscribed in scope, and merely authorized, but did not order, the Secretary of Commerce to grant exemptions for pre-Act animal products.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>In arguing the position that the statute prevents only the sale of illegally taken birds, appellees rely upon the language of the 1972 Migratory Bird Convention with Japan, incorporated into the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1974. Pub.L. 93-300, 88 Stat.190.  The Convention provides that</p>\n<p>"[a]ny sale, purchase or exchange of these [migratory] birds or their eggs, <em>taken illegally,</em> alive or dead, and any sale, purchase or exchange of the products thereof or their parts shall . . . be prohibited."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  But the language of the Convention, like the terms of the other Conventions, does not carry great weight in the interpretation of the statute.  There are material variations in the particulars of each of the Conventions, <em>see</em> Coggins &amp; Patti, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F11" name="T11">n</a> 11, at 173-174; Bean, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F11" name="T11">n</a> 11, at 70-73; it is therefore hazardous to look to any single Convention for definitive resolution of a statutory construction problem.  Furthermore, inasmuch as the Conventions represent binding international commitments, they establish minimum protections for wildlife; Congress could and did go further in developing domestic conservation measures.  <em>See id.</em> at 74-76.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>Our interpretation of the statute does not depart from any course of construction adopted by other courts.  Although appellees argue that several courts have determined that lawfully taken birds may be sold under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, we do not read the cases as supporting appellees\' position.  Two of the cited cases, <em>United States v. Hamel,</em> 534 F.2d 1354 (CA9 1976) (per curiam), and <em>United States v. Blanket,</em> 391 F.Supp. 15 (WD Okla.1975), neither decide nor imply a decision as to the statutory question posed here.  Language favorable to appellees in <em>United States v. Aitson,</em> No. 74-1588 (CA10, July 21, 1975), is merely dictum in an unpublished opinion.  Contrast also <em>United States v. Richards,</em> 583 F.2d 491 (CA10 1978).  <em>United States v. Marks,</em> 4 F.2d 420 (SD Tex.1925), did hold it impermissible to punish the sale of birds taken before the Migratory Bird Treaty Act was passed.  But that ruling rested upon the court\'s view that Congress\' authority to regulate the birds must rest wholly upon the treaty, rather than the commerce power.  Whatever the logic of that ruling, the underlying assumption that the national commerce power does not reach migratory wildlife is clearly flawed.  <em>See, e.g., Hughes v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html">441 U. S. 322</a></span> (1979).  Thus, only two early District Court cases, both authored by the same judge, sustain the statutory proposition advanced by appellees.  <em>United States v. Fuld Store Co.,</em> 262 F. 836 (Mont.1920); <em>In re Informations Under Migratory Bird Treaty Act,</em> 281 F. 546 (Mont.1922).  The cases involved no more than a cursory inquiry into the statute, and we find them unconvincing.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, heightened restrictions on the sale or purchase of migratory bird parts were appropriate in light of congressional recognition of the danger to wildlife posed by commercial exploitation.  The 1960 amendments to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act specifically addressed that problem by stiffening penalties for the taking of protected birds with intent to sell and for the sale of protected birds.  74 Stat. 866; <em>see</em> H.R.Rep. No. 1787, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. (1960); S.Rep. No. 1779, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. (1960).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Although this argument appears to have been cast in the District Court in terms of economic substantive due process, before this Court, appellees have used the terminology of the Takings Clause.</p>\n<p>The Secretary has raised the question of appellees\' standing to assert a takings claim with respect to their artifacts.  He asserts that appellees have not clearly stated that they acquired their property interest in the bird artifacts before the sales ban came into force.  If they have not, the Secretary argues, then the</p>\n<p>"value of any artifacts purchased by appellees after the effective date of the Act had already been diminished by the applicability of the Act."</p>\n<p>Brief for Appellants 30.  This contention is misplaced.  Even assuming that appellees have not sufficiently alleged pre-effectiveness possession, they have standing to urge their constitutional claim.  Because the regulation they challenge restricts their ability to dispose of their property, appellees have a personal, concrete, live interest in the controversy.  <em>See Baker v. Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html">369 U. S. 186</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#204">369 U. S. 204</a></span> (1962).  The timing of acquisition of the artifacts is relevant to a takings analysis of appellees\' investment-backed expectations, but it does not erect a jurisdictional obstacle at the threshold.  Of course, there is no standing to assert a takings claim by those who are merely employed in selling artifacts owned by others.  All appellees, however, may face future criminal prosecutions for violations of the statutes, and that, of itself, suffices to give them standing to litigate their interest in the construction of the statutes.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>It should be emphasized that, in <em>Pennsylvania Coal,</em> the loss of profit opportunity was accompanied by a physical restriction against the removal of the coal.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>It is not significant that the statute considered in <em>Everard\'s Breweries</em> had been passed under the Eighteenth (Prohibition) Amendment.
