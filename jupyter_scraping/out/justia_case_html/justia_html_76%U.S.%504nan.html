This was determined at the last term in the case of <em>The Alicia.</em> <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/76/504/case.html">*</a></span>  In that case, the record had not been filed, and a motion was made to docket and dismiss.  That motion was denied, on the ground that the court could not take jurisdiction.  In this case, the record has been filed, and the cause has been docketed here.  The order therefore must be that the cause be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p>*  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/571/case.html#572">74 U.
