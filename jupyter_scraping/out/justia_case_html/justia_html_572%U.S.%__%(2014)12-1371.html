The District Court agreed, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d must entail violent contact and that one can cause bodily injury without violent contact, e.g., by poisoning.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed on a different rationale.  It held that the degree of physical force required for a conviction to constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d is the same as that required for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x94namely, violent force\xe2\x80\x94and that Castleman could have been convicted for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s conviction qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (a)\xc2\xa0Section 922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d requirement is satisfied by the degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction\xe2\x80\x94namely, offensive touching.  Congress presumably intends to incorporate the common-law meaning of terms that it uses, and nothing suggests Congress intended otherwise here.  The Sixth Circuit relied upon Johnson v. United States,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133\n, in which the common-law meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d was found to be a \xe2\x80\x9ccomical misfit,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 145, when read into ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  But Johnson resolves this case in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor: The very reasons for rejecting the common-law meaning in Johnson are reasons to embrace it here.  First, whereas it was \xe2\x80\x9cunlikely\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress meant to incorporate in ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition \xe2\x80\x9ca phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 141, it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate the misdemeanor-specific meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in defining a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, whereas the word \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone \xe2\x80\x9cconnotes a substantial degree of force,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 140, that is not true of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d in a nondomestic context.  Third, whereas this Court has hesitated to apply ACCA to \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels \xe2\x80\x98armed career criminals,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Begay v. United States,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137\n, there is no anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery offenses together with others whom \xc2\xa7922(g) disqualifies from gun ownership.  In addition, a contrary reading would have made \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) inoperative in at least ten States when it was enacted.

Castleman pleaded guilty to \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury to\xe2\x80\x9d the mother of his child, and the knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.  First, a \xe2\x80\x9cbodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d must result from \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  The common-law concept of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses even its indirect application, making it impossible to cause bodily injury without applying force in the common-law sense.  Second, the knowing or intentional application of force is a \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force.  Leocal v. Ashcroft,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, distinguished.

Whereas it was \xe2\x80\x9cunlikely\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress meant to incorporate in the definition of a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98violent felony\xe2\x80\x99 a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141, it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate that misdemeanor-specific meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in defining a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, whereas the word \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone \xe2\x80\x9cconnotes a substantial degree of force,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 140,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] that is not true of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cDomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d is not merely a type of \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d; it is a term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d in a nondomestic context.

For example, in an opinion that we cited with approval in Johnson, the Seventh Circuit noted that it was \xe2\x80\x9chard to describe .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as \xe2\x80\x98violence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca squeeze of the arm [that] causes a bruise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Flores v.

If a seemingly minor act like this draws the attention of authorities and leads to a successful prosecution for a misdemeanor offense, it does not offend common sense or the English language to characterize the resulting conviction as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence discounts our reference to social-science definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d including those used by the organizations most directly engaged with the problem and thus most aware of its dimensions.  See post, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  It is important to keep in mind, how-ever, that the operative phrase we are construing is not \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d; it is \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A).  \xe2\x80\x9cPhysical force\xe2\x80\x9d has a presumptive common-law meaning, and the question is simply whether that presumptive meaning makes sense in defining a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        A third reason for distinguishing Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d is that unlike in Johnson\xe2\x80\x94where a determination that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime was a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d would have classified him as an \xe2\x80\x9carmed career criminal\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the statute here groups those convicted of \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crimes of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d with others whose conduct does not warrant such a designation.  Section 922(g) bars gun possession by anyone \xe2\x80\x9caddicted to any controlled substance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7922(g)(3); by most people who have \xe2\x80\x9cbeen admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7922(g)(5)(B); by anyone who has renounced United States citizenship, \xc2\xa7922(g)(7); and by anyone subject to a domestic restraining order, \xc2\xa7922(g)(8).  Whereas we have hesitated (as in Johnson) to apply the Armed Career Criminal Act to \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels \xe2\x80\x98armed career criminals,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Begay v. United States,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137,\n146 (2008)\n, we see no anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery offenses together with the others whom \xc2\xa7922(g) disqualifies from gun ownership.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        An additional reason to read the statute as we do is that a contrary reading would have rendered \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) inoperative in many States at the time of its enactment.  The \xe2\x80\x9cassault or battery laws\xe2\x80\x9d under which \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic abusers were .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. routinely prosecuted\xe2\x80\x9d when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), and under which many are still prosecuted today, Hayes, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 427, fall generally into two categories: those that prohibit both offensive touching and the causation of bodily injury, and those that prohibit only the latter.  See Brief for United States 36\xe2\x80\x9338.  Whether or not the causation of bodily injury necessarily entails violent force\xe2\x80\x94a question we do not reach\xe2\x80\x94mere offensive touching does not.  See Johnson, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 139\xe2\x80\x93140.  So if offensive touching did not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A), then \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) would have been ineffec-tual in at least 10 States\xe2\x80\x94home to nearly thirty percent of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s population[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]\xe2\x80\x94at the time of its enactment.  See post, at 6, and n. 5 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (acknowledging that \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) would have been inapplicable in California and nine other States if it did not encompass offensive touching); App. to Brief for United States 10a\xe2\x80\x9316a (listing statutes prohibiting both offensive touching and the causation of bodily injury, only some of which are divisible); cf.

United States,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575 (1990)\n, and Shepard v. United States,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13 (2005)\n.  We begin with Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s categorical approach, under which we look to the statute of Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s conviction to determine whether that conviction necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cha[d], as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Tennessee statute under which Castleman was convicted made it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9ccommi[t] an assault .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. against\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cfamily or household member\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s case, the mother of his child.

A threat under \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x9313\xe2\x80\x93101(2) maynot necessarily involve a deadly weapon, and the merely reckless causation of bodily injury under \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x9313\xe2\x80\x93101(1) may not be a \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But we need not decide whether a domestic assault conviction in Tennessee categorically constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d because the parties do not contest that \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x9313\xe2\x80\x93101 is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98divisible statute,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Descamps v.

Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932); see Shepard, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 26.  Here, that analysis is straightforward: Castleman pleaded guilty to having \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally or knowingly cause[d] bodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d to the mother of his child, App. 27, and the knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, a \xe2\x80\x9cbodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d must result from \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under Tennessee law, \xe2\x80\x9cbodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d is a broad term: It \xe2\x80\x9cincludes a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement; physical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x93106(a)(2) (1997).  Justice Sca-lia\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence suggests that these forms of injury ne-cessitate violent force, under Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s definition of that phrase.  Post, at 3.  But whether or not that is so\xe2\x80\x94aquestion we do not decide\xe2\x80\x94these forms of injury do necessitate force in the common-law sense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court thought otherwise, reasoning that one can cause bodily injury \xe2\x80\x9cwithout the \xe2\x80\x98use of physical force\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for example, by \xe2\x80\x9cdeceiving [the victim] into drinking a poisoned beverage, without making contact of any kind.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a.  But as we explained in Johnson, \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d is simply \xe2\x80\x9cforce exerted by and through concrete bodies,\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to \xe2\x80\x9cintellectual force or emotional force.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 138.  And the common-law concept of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses even its indirect ap-plication.  \xe2\x80\x9cForce\xe2\x80\x9d in this sense \xe2\x80\x9cdescrib[es] one of the elements of the common-law crime of battery,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 139,  and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he force used\xe2\x80\x9d in battery \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be applied directly to the body of the victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 W. LaFave, Substan-tive Criminal Law \xc2\xa716.2(b) (2d ed. 2003).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] battery may be committed by administering a poison or by infecting with a disease, or even by resort to some intangible substance,\xe2\x80\x9d such as a laser beam.

It is impossible to cause bodily injury without applying force in the common-law sense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, the knowing or intentional application of force is a \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force.  Castleman is correct that under Leocal v. Ashcroft,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2004)\n, the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconveys the idea that the thing used (here, \xe2\x80\x98physical force\xe2\x80\x99) has been made the user\xe2\x80\x99s instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 37.  But he errs in arguing that although \xe2\x80\x9c[p]oison may have \xe2\x80\x98forceful physical properties\xe2\x80\x99 as a matter of organic chemistry, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. no one would say that a poisoner \xe2\x80\x98employs\xe2\x80\x99 force or \xe2\x80\x98carries out a purpose by means of force\xe2\x80\x99 when he orshe sprinkles poison in a victim\xe2\x80\x99s drink,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  The \xe2\x80\x9cuseof force\xe2\x80\x9d in Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s example is not the act of \xe2\x80\x9csprinkl[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the poison; it is the act of employing poison knowingly as a device to cause physical harm.  That the harm occurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick or punch), does not matter.  Under Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s logic, after all, one could say that pulling the trigger on a gun is not a \xe2\x80\x9cuse of force\xe2\x80\x9d because it is the bullet, not the trigger, that actually strikes the victim.  Leocal held that the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force must entail \xe2\x80\x9ca higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 9; it did not hold that the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d somehow alters the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cforce.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Because Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s indictment makes clear that the use of physical force was an element of his conviction, that conviction qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We are not persuaded by Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s nontextual arguments against our interpretation of \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, Castleman invokes \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history to suggest that Congress could not have intended for the provision to apply to acts involving minimal force.  But to the extent that legislative history can aid in the inter-pretation of this statute, Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on it is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Castleman begins by observing that during the debate over \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), several Senators argued that the provision would help to prevent gun violence by perpetrators of severe domestic abuse.  Senator Lautenberg referred to \xe2\x80\x9cserious spousal or child abuse\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cviolent individuals\xe2\x80\x9d; Senator Hutchison to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98people who batter their wives\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; Senator Wellstone to people who \xe2\x80\x9cbrutalize\xe2\x80\x9d their wives or children; and Senator Feinstein to \xe2\x80\x9csevere and recurring domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  142 Cong. Rec. 22985\xe2\x80\x9322986, 22988.  But as we noted above, see supra, at 2, the impetus of \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) was that even perpetrators of severe domestic violence are often convicted \xe2\x80\x9cunder generally applicable assault or battery laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hayes, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 427.  So nothing about these Senators\xe2\x80\x99 isolated references to severe domestic violence suggests that they would not have wanted \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) to apply to a misdemeanor assault conviction like Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Castleman next observes that \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) is the product of a legislative compromise.  The provision originally barred gun possession for any \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d defined as any \xe2\x80\x9cfelony or misdemeanor crime of violence, regardless of length, term, or manner of punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  142 Cong. Rec. 5840.  Congress rewrote the provision to require the use of physical force in response to the concern \xe2\x80\x9cthat the term crime of violence was too broad, and could be interpreted to include an act such as cutting up a credit card with a pair of scissors,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 26675.  See Hayes, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 428.  Castleman would have us conclude that Congress thus meant \xe2\x80\x9cto narrow the scope of the statute to convictions based on especially severe conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 24.  But all Congress meant to do was address the fear that \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) might be triggered by offenses in which no force at all was directed at a person.  As Senator Lautenberg noted, the revised text was not only \xe2\x80\x9cmore precise\xe2\x80\x9d than the original but also \xe2\x80\x9cprobably broader.\xe2\x80\x9d  142 Cong.

Castleman is correct that our \xe2\x80\x9cconstruction of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for fair warning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Crandon v. United States,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 152,\n160 (1990)\n.  But \xe2\x80\x9cthe rule of lenity only applies if, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose, there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute, such that the Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  Barber v.

But Castleman has not challenged the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), either on its face or as applied to him, and the meaning of the statute is sufficiently clear that we need not indulge Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s cursory nod to constitutional avoidance concerns.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Castleman\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for having \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally or knowingly cause[d] bodily injury to\xe2\x80\x9d the mother of his child qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See Dept. of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), J.

I write separately, however, because I reach that conclusion on narrower grounds.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our decision in Johnson v. United States,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133 (2010)\n, is the natural place to begin.  Johnson is significant here because it concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase \xe2\x80\x98physical force\xe2\x80\x99 means violent force\xe2\x80\x94that is, force capable of caus-ing physical pain or injury to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at140 (second emphasis added).  This is an easy case ifthe phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d has the same meaning in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the provision that defines \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), as it does in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the provision interpreted in Johnson, since it is impossible to cause bodily injury without using force \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of\xe2\x80\x9d producing that result.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        There are good reasons to give the phrase Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  One is the presumption of consistent usage\xe2\x80\x94the rule of thumb that a term generally means the same thing each time it is used.  Although the presumption is most commonly applied to terms appearing in the same enactment, e.g., IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 21\n\xe2\x80\x9334 (2005), it is equally relevant \xe2\x80\x9cwhen Congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d Smith v. City of Jackson,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228,\n233 (2005)\n(plurality opinion); see also Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools,\n\n412 U.\xc2\xa0S. 427,\n428 (1973)\n (per curiam).  This case is a textbook candidate for application of the Smith-Northcross branch of the rule.  The \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d clauses at issue here and in Johnson are worded in nearly identical fashion: The former defines a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d as an offense that \xe2\x80\x9chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii), while the latter defines a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d as an offense that \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  And both statutes are designed to promote public safety by deterring a class of criminals from possessing firearms.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s arguments fail to overcome the presumption of consistent usage.  In respondent\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d cannot mean \xe2\x80\x9cany force that produces any painor bodily injury,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 25, because \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) defines a violent crime and one can in-flict all sorts of minor injuries\xe2\x80\x94bruises, paper cuts,etc.\xe2\x80\x94by engaging in nonviolent behavior.  Respondent therefore reasons that \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires force capa-ble of inflicting \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d bodily injury.  That requirement is more demanding than both of the plausible mean-ings of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d we identified in Johnson: common-law offensive touching (which Johnson rejected) and force capable of causing physical pain or injury, serious or otherwise.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 138\xe2\x80\x93140.  It would be surpassing strange to read a statute defining a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d as requiring greater force than the similarly worded statute in Johnson, which defined a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d and respondent does not make a convincing case for taking that extraordinary step.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For these reasons, I would give \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d the same meaning in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) as in Johnson.  The rest of the analysis is straightforward.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 27, categorically involves the use of \xe2\x80\x9cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person,\xe2\x80\x9d 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 140, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 domestic-assault conviction qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]I would reverse the judgment below on that basis and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Unfortunately, the Court bypasses that narrower interpretation of \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in favor of a much broader one that treats any offensive touching, no matter how slight, as sufficient.  That expansive common-law definition cannot be squared with relevant precedent or statu-tory text.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We have twice addressed the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of provisions that define a class of violent crimes.  Both times, we concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d means violent force.  In Johnson, we thought it \xe2\x80\x9cclear that in the context of a statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x98violent felony,\xe2\x80\x99 the phrase \xe2\x80\x98physical force\xe2\x80\x99 means violent force.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 140.  And we held that common-law offensive touching\xe2\x80\x94the same type of force the Court today holds does constitute \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is not sufficiently violent to satisfy the Armed Career Criminal Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  See id., at 140\xe2\x80\x93144.  Our analysis in Johnson was premised in large part on our earlier interpretation of the generic federal \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716.  In Leocal v. Ashcroft,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n11 (2004)\n, we observed that \xc2\xa716(a)\xe2\x80\x94which defines a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94comprehends \xe2\x80\x9ca category of vio-lent, active crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  The textual similarity between \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d clause and the clauses at issue in Johnson and Leocal thus raises the question: Why should the same meaning not apply here?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court gives four responses that merit discussion, none of which withstands scrutiny.  First, the Court invokes the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98settled principle of interpretation that, absent other indication, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 4 (quoting Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3)).  That principle is of limited relevance, since the presumption of consistent statutory meaning is precisely \xe2\x80\x9cother indication\xe2\x80\x9d that \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) does not incorporate the common-law meaning.  Anyway, a more accurate formulation of the principlecited by the Court is that when \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a word is obviouslytransplanted from another legal source, whether thecommon law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Sekhar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934) (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947); emphasis added).  Section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted after the statutes involved in Johnson and Leocal,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] and its \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d clause is quite obviously modeled on theirs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, the Court asserts that any interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d that excludes offensive touching \xe2\x80\x9cwould have rendered \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) inoperative in many States at the time of  its enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9.  But there is no interpretive principle to the effect that statutes must be given their broadest possible application, and \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) without offensive touching would have had application in four-fifths of the States.  Although domestic violence was \xe2\x80\x9croutinely prosecuted\xe2\x80\x9d under misdemeanor assault or bat-tery statutes when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), United States v. Hayes,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415,\n427 (2009)\n, and such statutes generally prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cboth offensive touching and the causation of bodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9conly the latter,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9, it does not follow that interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d to mean violent force would have rendered \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) a practical nullity.  To the contrary, \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) would have worked perfectly well in 38 of the 48 States that had misdemeanor assault or battery statutes at the time of \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  At that point, 19 States had statutes that covered infliction of bodily injury but not offensive touching,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>] and 19 more had statutes that prohibited both of types of conduct, but did so in a divisible manner\xe2\x80\x94thus making it possible to identify the basis for a conviction by inspecting charging documents and similar materials, see Descamps v. United States, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x938).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  That leaves only 10 States whose misdemeanor assault or battery statutes (1) prohibited offensive touching, and (2) were framed in such a way that offensive touching was indivisible from physical violence.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  The fact that \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) would not have applied immediately in 10 States is hardly enough to trigger the presumption against ineffectiveness\xe2\x80\x94the idea that Congress presumably does not enact useless laws.  Compare Hayes, supra, at 427 (rejecting an interpretation that supposedly would have rendered \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a dead letter\xe2\x80\x99 in some two-thirds of the States\xe2\x80\x9d).  I think it far more plausible that Congress enacted a statute that covered domestic-violence convictions in four-fifths of the States, and left it to the handful of nonconforming States to change their laws (as some have), than that Congress adopted a meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d that included the slightest unwanted touching.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Third, the Court seizes on the one and only meaningful distinction between \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) and the other provisions referred to above: that it defines a violent \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d or an undifferentiated \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  We properly takeaccount of the term being defined when interpreting \xe2\x80\x9can unclear definitional phrase.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Stevens,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460,\n474 (2010)\n; but see Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 687\n\xe2\x80\x93719 (1995) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  But when we do so, we consider the entire term being defined, not just part of it.  Here, the term being defined is \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Applying the term-to-be-defined canon thus yields the unremarkable conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the type of force involved in violent misdemeanors (such as bodily-injury offenses) rather than nonviolent ones (such as offensive touching).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Fourth, and finally, the Court seeks to evade Johnson and Leocal on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98domestic violence\xe2\x80\x99 encompasses a range of force broader than that which con-stitutes \xe2\x80\x98violence\xe2\x80\x99 simpliciter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6, n. 4.  That isto say, an act need not be violent to qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  That absurdity is not only at war with the English language, it is flatly inconsistent with defini-tions of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d from the period surrounding \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  At the time, dictionaries defined \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d as, for instance, \xe2\x80\x9c[v]iolence between members of a household, usu. spouses; an assault or other violent act committed by one member of a household against another,\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1564 (7th ed. 1999), and \xe2\x80\x9c[v]iolence toward or physical abuse of one\xe2\x80\x99s spouse or domestic partner,\xe2\x80\x9d American Heritage Dictionary 534 (4th ed. 2000).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  Those definitions, combined with the absence of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d entries in earlier dictionaries, see, e.g., Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 484 (6th ed. 1990); American Heritage Dictionary 550 (3d ed. 1992), make it utterly implausible that Congress adopted a \xe2\x80\x9cterm of art\xe2\x80\x9d definition \xe2\x80\x9cencompassing acts that one might not characterize as \xe2\x80\x98violent\xe2\x80\x99 in a nondomestic context,\xe2\x80\x9d ante,at 7.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s inventive, nonviolent definition fares no better when judged against other accepted sources of meaning.  Current dictionaries give \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d the same meaning as above: ordinary violence that occurs in a domestic context.  See, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 533 (5th ed. 2011) (\xe2\x80\x9c[p]hysical abuse of a household member, especially one\xe2\x80\x99s spouse or domestic partner\xe2\x80\x9d).  The same goes for definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9dfound in other federal statutes.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Indeed, Congress defined \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d in another section of the same bill that enacted \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii).

The amicus brief provides a series of definitions\xe2\x80\x94drawn from law-review articles, foreign-government bureaus, and similar sources\xe2\x80\x94that include such a wide range of nonviolent and even nonphysical conduct that they cannot possibly be relevant to the meaning of a statute requiring \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force,\xe2\x80\x9d or to the legal meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d (as opposed to the meaning desired by private and governmental advocacy groups).  For example, amici\xe2\x80\x99s definitions describe as \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d acts that \xe2\x80\x9chumiliate, isolate, frighten, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [and] blame .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. someone\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cacts of omission\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive monitoring of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, repeated accusations of infidelity, and controlling with whom she has contact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for NationalNetwork to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae 5\xe2\x80\x938, and nn. 7, 11.  The offerings of the Departmentof Justice\xe2\x80\x99s Office on Violence Against Women areequally capacious and (to put it mildly) unconventional.  Its publications define \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca patternof abusive behavior .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. used by one partner to gainor maintain power and control over another,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ndermining an individual\xe2\x80\x99s sense of self-worth,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cname-calling,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdamaging one\xe2\x80\x99s relationship withhis or her children.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., Domestic Violence, onlineat http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/domviolence.htm (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 21, 2014, and available in the Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Of course these private organizations and the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s (nonprosecuting) Office are entitled to define \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d any way they want for their own purposes\xe2\x80\x94purposes that can include (quite literally) giving all domestic behavior harmful to women a bad name.  (What is more abhorrent than violence against women?)  But when they (and the Court) impose their all-embracing definition on the rest of us, they not onlydistort the law, they impoverish the language.  When everything is domestic violence, nothing is.  Congress will have to come up with a new word (I cannot imagine what it would be) to denote actual domestic violence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s definitions ought to be deemed unreliable in toto on the basis of their extravagant extensions alone (falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus), the Court chooses to focus only upon the physical actions that they include, viz., \xe2\x80\x9c[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching, biting, [and] hair pulling.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  None of those actions bears any real resemblance to mere offensive touching, and all of them are capable of causing physical pain or injury.  Cf. Johnson, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 143 (identifying \xe2\x80\x9ca slap in the face\xe2\x80\x9d as conduct that might rise to the level of violent force).  And in any event, the Department of Justice thankfully receives no deference in our interpreta-tion of the criminal laws whose claimed violation the Department of Justice prosecutes.  See Gonzales v. Oregon,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 243,\n264 (2006)\n (citing Crandon v. United States,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 152,\n177 (1990)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)).  The same ought to be said of advocacy organizations, such as amici, that (unlike dictionary publishers) have a vested interest in expanding the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d in order to broaden the base of individuals eligible for support services.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This is a straightforward statutory-interpretation case that the parties and the Court have needlessly complicated.  Precedent, text, and common sense all dictate that the term \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force,\xe2\x80\x9d when used to define a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d requires force capable of causing physical pain or bodily injury.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Respondent argues at length that Tenn.

In Johnson v. United States,\n\n559 U.

I disagreed and concluded that the phrase incorporated the well-established meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d under the common law of battery, which did not require violent force.  See id., at 146 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals in the present case understand-ably followed the reasoning of Johnson, but now this Court holds that Johnson actually dictates that the identical statutory language be interpreted in exactly the same way that the Johnson majority rejected.
