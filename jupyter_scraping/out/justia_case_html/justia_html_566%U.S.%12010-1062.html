The order asserts that the Sacketts\xe2\x80\x99 property is subject to the Act, and that they have violated its provisions by placing fill material on the property; and on this basis it directs them immediately to restore the property pursuant to an EPA work plan.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Clean Water Act prohibits, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge of any pollutant by any person,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71311, without a permit, into the \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71344\xe2\x80\x94which the Act defines as \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71362(7).  If the EPA determines that any person is in violation of this restriction, the Act directs the agency either to issue a compliance order or to initiate a civil enforcement action.  \xc2\xa71319(a)(3).  When the EPA prevails in a civil action, the Act provides for \xe2\x80\x9ca civil penalty not to exceed [$37,500] per day for each violation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  \xc2\xa71319(d).  And according to the Government, when the EPA prevails against any person who has been issued a compliance order but has failed to comply, that amount is increased to $75,000\xe2\x80\x94up to $37,500 for the statutory violation and up to an additional $37,500 for violating the compliance order.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe particulars of this case flow from a dispute about the scope of \xe2\x80\x9cthe navigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d subject to this enforcement regime.  Today we consider only whether the dispute may be brought to court by challenging the compliance order\xe2\x80\x94we do not resolve the dispute on the merits.  The reader will be curious, however, to know what all the fuss is about.  In United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., \n\n474 U.\xc2\xa0S. 121 (1985)\n, we upheld a regulation that construed \xe2\x80\x9cthe navigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cfreshwater wetlands,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 124, themselves not actually navigable, that were adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters.  Later, in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 159 (2001)\n, we held that an abandoned sand and gravel pit, which \xe2\x80\x9cseasonally ponded\xe2\x80\x9d but which was not adjacent to open water, id., at 164, was not part of the navigable waters.  Then most recently, in Rapanos v. United States, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 715 (2006)\n, we considered whether a wetland not adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters fell within the scope of the Act.  Our answer was no, but no one rationale commanded a majority of the Court.  In his separate opinion, The Chief Justice expressed the concern that interested parties would lack guidance \xe2\x80\x9con precisely how to read Congress\xe2\x80\x99 limits on the reach of the Clean Water Act\xe2\x80\x9d and would be left \xe2\x80\x9cto feel their way on a case-by-case basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 758 (concurring opinion).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Sacketts are interested parties feeling their way.  They own a 2\xe2\x88\x953-acre residential lot in Bonner County, Idaho.  Their property lies just north of Priest Lake, but is separated from the lake by several lots containing permanent structures.  In preparation for constructing a house, the Sacketts filled in part of their lot with dirt and rock.  Some months later, they received from the EPA a compliance order.

The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulations provide that, once the EPA has issued a compliance order with respect to certain property, the Corps will not process a permit application for that property unless doing so \xe2\x80\x9cis clearly appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 CFR \xc2\xa7326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe issuance of the compliance order also marks the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98consummation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking process.  Bennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., \n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103, \n113 (1948)\n).  As the Sacketts learned when they unsuccessfully sought a hearing, the \xe2\x80\x9cFindings and Conclusions\xe2\x80\x9d that the compliance order contained were not subject to further agency review.  The Government resists this conclusion, pointing to a portion of the order that invited the Sacketts to \xe2\x80\x9cengage in informal discussion of the terms and requirements\xe2\x80\x9d of the order with the EPA and to inform the agency of \xe2\x80\x9cany allegations [t]herein which [they] believe[d] to be inaccurate.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 22\xe2\x80\x9323, \xc2\xb62.11.  But that confers no entitlement to further agency review.  The mere possibility that an agency might reconsider in light of \xe2\x80\x9cinformal discussion\xe2\x80\x9d and invited contentions of inaccuracy does not suffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe APA\xe2\x80\x99s judicial review provision also requires that the person seeking APA review of final agency action have \xe2\x80\x9cno other adequate remedy in a court,\xe2\x80\x9d \n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7704.  In Clean Water Act enforcement cases, judicial review ordinarily comes by way of a civil action brought by the EPA under \n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71319.  But the Sacketts cannot initiate that process, and each day they wait for the agency to drop the hammer, they accrue, by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s telling, an additional $75,000 in potential liability.  The other possible route to judicial review\xe2\x80\x94applying to the Corps of Engineers for a permit and then filing suit under the APA if a permit is denied\xe2\x80\x94will not serve either.  The remedy for denial of action that might be sought from one agency does not ordinarily provide an \xe2\x80\x9cadequate remedy\xe2\x80\x9d for ac- tion already taken by another agency.  The Government, to its credit, does not seriously contend that other available remedies alone foreclose review under \xc2\xa7704.  Instead, the Government relies on \xc2\xa7701(a)(1) of the APA, which excludes APA review \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that [other] statutes preclude judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Clean Water Act, it says, is such a statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNothing in the Clean Water Act expressly precludes judicial review under the APA or otherwise.  But in determining \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether and to what extent a particular statute precludes judicial review,\xe2\x80\x9d we do not look \xe2\x80\x9conly [to] its express language.\xe2\x80\x9d  Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 340, \n345 (1984)\n.  The APA, we have said, creates a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption favoring judicial review of administrative action,\xe2\x80\x9d but as with most presumptions, this one \xe2\x80\x9cmay be overcome by inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 349.  The Government offers several reasons why the statutory scheme of the Clean Water Act precludes review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government first points to \n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71319(a)(3), which provides that, when the EPA \xe2\x80\x9cfinds that any person is in violation\xe2\x80\x9d of certain portions of the Act, the agency \xe2\x80\x9cshall issue an order requiring such person to comply with [the Act], or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall bring a civil action [to enforce the Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government argues that, because Congress gave the EPA the choice between a judicial proceeding and an administrative action, it would undermine the Act to allow judicial review of the latter.  But that argument rests on the question-begging premise that the relevant difference between a compliance order and an enforcement proceeding is that only the latter is subject to judicial review.  There are eminently sound reasons other than insulation from judicial review why compliance orders are useful.  The Government itself suggests that they \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[e] a means of notifying recipients of potential vio- lations and quickly resolving the issues through volun- tary compliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 39.  It is entirely consistent with this function to allow judicial review when the recipient does not choose \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary compliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Act does not guarantee the EPA that issuing a compliance order will always be the most effective choice.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government also notes that compliance orders are not self-executing, but must be enforced by the agency in a plenary judicial action.  It suggests that Congress therefore viewed a compliance order \xe2\x80\x9cas a step in the deliberative process[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. rather than as a coercive sanction that itself must be subject to judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 38.  But the APA provides for judicial review of all final agency actions, not just those that impose a self-executing sanction.  And it is hard for the Government to defend its claim that the issuance of the compliance order was just \xe2\x80\x9ca step in the deliberative process\xe2\x80\x9d when the agency rejected the Sacketts\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to obtain a hearing and when the next step will either be taken by the Sacketts (if they comply with the order) or will involve judicial, not administrative, deliberation (if the EPA brings an enforcement action).  As the text (and indeed the very name) of the compliance order makes clear, the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberation\xe2\x80\x9d over whether the Sacketts are in violation of the Act is at an end; the agency may still have to deliberate over whether it is confident enough about this conclusion to initiate litigation, but that is a separate subject.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government further urges us to consider that Congress expressly provided for prompt judicial review, on the administrative record, when the EPA assesses administrative penalties after a hearing, see \xc2\xa71319(g)(8), but did not expressly provide for review of compliance orders.  But if the express provision of judicial review in one section of a long and complicated statute were alone enough to over- come the APA\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reviewability for all final agency action, it would not be much of a presumption at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe cases on which the Government relies simply are not analogous.  In Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, supra, we held that the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, which expressly allowed milk handlers to obtain judicial review of milk market orders, precluded review of milk market orders in suits brought by milk consumers.  467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 345\xe2\x80\x93348.  Where a statute provides that particular agency action is reviewable at the instance of one party, who must first exhaust administrative remedies, the inference that it is not reviewable at the instance of other parties, who are not subject to the administrative process, is strong.  In United States v. Erika, Inc., \n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 201 (1982)\n, we held that the Medicare statute, which expressly provided for judicial review of awards under Part A, precluded review of awards under Part B.  Id., at 206\xe2\x80\x93208.  The strong parallel between the award provisions in Part A and Part B of the Medicare statute does not exist between the issuance of a compliance order and the assessment of administrative penalties under the Clean Water Act.  And in United States v. Fausto, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 439 (1988)\n, we held that the Civil Service Reform Act, which expressly excluded certain \xe2\x80\x9cnonpreference\xe2\x80\x9d employees from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s review scheme, precluded review at the instance of those employees in a separate Claims Court action.  Id., at 448\xe2\x80\x93449.  Here, there is no suggestion that Congress has sought to exclude compliance-order recipients from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s review scheme; quite to the contrary, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case is premised on the notion that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s primary review mechanisms are open to the Sacketts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Government notes that Congress passed the Clean Water Act in large part to respond to the inefficiency of then-existing remedies for water pollution.  Compliance orders, as noted above, can obtain quick remediation through voluntary compliance.  The Government warns that the EPA is less likely to use the orders if they are subject to judicial review.  That may be true\xe2\x80\x94but it will be true for all agency actions subjected to judicial review.  The APA\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of judicial review is a repudiation of the principle that efficiency of regulation conquers all.  And there is no reason to think that the Clean Water Act was uniquely designed to enable the strong-arming of regulated parties into \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary compliance\xe2\x80\x9d without the opportunity for judicial review\xe2\x80\x94even judicial review of the question whether the regulated party is within the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  Compliance orders will remain an effective means of securing prompt voluntary compliance in those many cases where there is no substantial basis to question their validity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe conclude that the compliance order in this case is final agency action for which there is no adequate remedy other than APA review, and that the Clean Water Act does not preclude that review.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\nIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The original statute set a penalty cap of $25,000 per violation per day.

Any piece of land that is wet at least part of the year is in danger of being classified by EPA employees as wetlands covered by the Act, and according to the Federal Government, if property owners begin to construct a home on a lot that the agency thinks possesses the requisite wetness, the property owners are at the agency\xe2\x80\x99s mercy.  The EPA may issue a compliance order demanding that the own- ers cease construction, engage in expensive remedial measures, and abandon any use of the property.  If the owners do not do the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s bidding, they may be fined up to $75,000 per day ($37,500 for violating the Act and another $37,500 for violating the compliance order).  And if the owners want their day in court to show that their lot does not include covered wetlands, well, as a practical matter, that is just too bad.  Until the EPA sues them, they are blocked from access to the courts, and the EPA may wait as long as it wants before deciding to sue.  By that time, the potential fines may easily have reached the millions.  In a nation that values due process, not to mention private property, such treatment is unthinkable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision provides a modest measure of re- lief.  At least, property owners like petitioners will have the right to challenge the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional determination under the Administrative Procedure Act.  But the combination of the uncertain reach of the Clean Water Act and the draconian penalties imposed for the sort of violations alleged in this case still leaves most property owners with little practical alternative but to dance to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s tune.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tReal relief requires Congress to do what it should have done in the first place: provide a reasonably clear rule re- garding the reach of the Clean Water Act.  When Con- gress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, it provided that the Act covers \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(7).  But Congress did not define what it meant by \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d; the phrase was not a term of art with a known meaning; and the words themselves are hopelessly indeterminate.  Unsurprisingly, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers in- terpreted the phrase as an essentially limitless grant of authority.  We rejected that boundless view, see Rapanos v. United States, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 715\n\xe2\x80\x93739 (2006) (plurality opinion); Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 159\n\xe2\x80\x93174 (2001), but the precise reach of the Act remains unclear.  For 40 years, Congress has done nothing to resolve this critical ambiguity, and the EPA has not seen fit to promulgate a rule providing a clear and sufficiently limited definition of the phrase.  Instead, the agency has relied on informal guidance.  But far from providing clarity and predictability, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s latest informal guidance advises property owners that many jurisdictional determinations concerning wetlands can only be made on a case-by-case basis by EPA field staff.
