The Court begins, as always, with the text.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Congress added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA in 1996.  At that time, the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d included \xe2\x80\x9cthe engaging in sexual contact with a person who is below a specified age or who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Merriam-Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary of Law 454.  By providing that the abuse must be \xe2\x80\x9cof a minor,\xe2\x80\x9d the INA focuses on age, rather than mental or physical incapacity.  Accordingly, to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor, the statute of conviction must prohibit certain sexual acts based at least in part on the age of the victim.  Statutory rape laws, which are one example of this category of crimes, generally provide that an older person may not engage in sexual intercourse with a younger person under the \xe2\x80\x9cage of consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reliable dictionaries indicate that the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d age of consent in 1996 was 16, and it remains so today.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The Government argues that sexual abuse of a minor includes any conduct that is illegal, involves sexual activity, and is directed at a person younger than 18.  For support, it points to the 1990 Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary, which defined sexual abuse of a minor as \xe2\x80\x9c[i]llegal sex acts performed against a minor by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance\xe2\x80\x9d and defined \xe2\x80\x9c[m]inor\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n infant or person who is under the age of legal competence,\xe2\x80\x9d which in \xe2\x80\x9cmost states\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9c18.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the generic federal offense does not correspond to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s definition, for three reasons.  First, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s definition is inconsistent with its own dictionary\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a special relationship of trust exist between the victim and offender.  Second, in the statutory rape context, \xe2\x80\x9cof a minor\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the age of consent, not the age of legal competence.  Third, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s definition turns the categorical approach on its head by defining the generic federal offense as whatever is illegal under the law of the State of conviction.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d) The structure of the INA, a related federal statute, and evidence from state criminal codes confirm that, for a statutory rape offense based solely on the age of the participants to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor under the INA, the victim must be younger than 16.  The INA lists sexual abuse of a minor as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated\xe2\x80\x9d felony, \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and lists it in the same subparagraph as \xe2\x80\x9cmurder\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crape,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(A), suggesting that it encompasses only especially egregious felonies.  A different statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72243, criminalizes \xe2\x80\x9c[s]exual abuse of a minor or ward.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 2243 was amended to protect anyone under age 16 in the same omnibus law that added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA, suggesting that Congress understood that phrase to cover victims under (but not over) age 16.  Finally, a significant majority of state criminal codes set the age of consent at 16 for statutory rape offenses predicated exclusively on the age of the participants.

We begin, as always, with the text.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 1101(a)(43)(A) does not expressly define sexual abuse of a minor, so we interpret that phrase using the normal tools of statutory interpretation.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur analysis begins with the language of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Leocal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n8 (2004)\n; see also <i>Lopez</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47,\n53 (2006)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe everyday understanding of\xe2\x80\x9d the term used in \xc2\xa71101 \xe2\x80\x9cshould count for a lot here, for the statutes in play do not define the term, and so remit us to regular usage to see what Congress probably meant\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA in 1996, as part of a comprehensive immigration reform act.  See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, \xc2\xa7321(a)(i),\n\n110Stat.\n3009\xe2\x80\x93627.  At that time, the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d included \xe2\x80\x9cthe engaging in sexual contact with a person who is below a specified age or who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Merriam-Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary of Law 454 (1996).  By providing that the abuse must be \xe2\x80\x9cof a minor,\xe2\x80\x9d the INA focuses on age, rather than mental or physical incapacity.  Accordingly, to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor, the statute of conviction must prohibit certain sexual acts based at least in part on the age of the victim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Statutory rape laws are one example of this category of crimes.  Those laws generally provide that an older person may not engage in sexual intercourse with a younger person under a specified age, known as the \xe2\x80\x9cage of consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.</i>, at 20 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cage of consent\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe age at which a person is deemed competent by law to give consent esp. to sexual intercourse\xe2\x80\x9d and cross-referencing \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory rape\xe2\x80\x9d).

Around the time sexual abuse of a minor was added to the INA\xe2\x80\x99s list of aggravated felonies, that dictionary defined \xe2\x80\x9c[s]exual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[i]llegal sex acts performed against a minor by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x9d and defined \xe2\x80\x9c[m]inor\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n infant or person who is under the age of legal competence,\xe2\x80\x9d which in \xe2\x80\x9cmost states\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9c18.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 997, 1375.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Sexual abuse of a minor,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Government accordingly contends, \xe2\x80\x9cmost naturally connotes conduct that (1) is illegal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than 18 years old.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 17.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We are not persuaded that the generic federal offense corresponds to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s definition.  First, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed definition is flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in the very dictionary on which it relies; the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed definition does not require that the act be performed \xe2\x80\x9c<i>by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1375 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis added).  In any event, as we explain below, offenses predicated on a special relationship of trust between the victim and offender are not at issue here and frequently have a different age requirement than the general age of consent.  Second, in the context of statutory rape, the prepositional phrase \xe2\x80\x9cof a minor\xe2\x80\x9d naturally refers not to the age of legal competence (when a person is legally capable of agreeing to a contract, for example), but to the age of consent (when a person is legally capable of agreeing to sexual intercourse).  Third, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s definition turns the categorical approach on its head by defining the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor as whatever is illegal under the particular law of the State where the defendant was convicted.  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s preferred approach, there is no \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d definition at all.  See <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 591 (requiring \xe2\x80\x9ca clear indication that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Congress intended to abandon its general approach of using uniform categorical definitions to identify predicate offenses\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.</i>, at 592 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe think that \xe2\x80\x98burglary\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa7924(e) must have some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various States\xe2\x80\x99 criminal codes\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The structure of the INA, a related federal statute, and evidence from state criminal codes confirm that, for a statutory rape offense to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor under the INA based solely on the age of the participants, the victim must be younger than 16.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Surrounding provisions of the INA guide our interpretation of sexual abuse of a minor.  See A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 167 (2012).

Moreover, the INA lists sexual abuse of a minor in the samesubparagraph as \xe2\x80\x9cmurder\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crape,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(A)\xe2\x80\x94among the most heinous crimes it defines as aggravated felonies.  \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  The structure of the INA therefore suggests that sexual abuse of a minor encompasses only especially egregious felonies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A closely related federal statute,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72243, provides further evidence that the generic federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor incorporates an age of consent of 16, at least in the context of statutory rape offenses predicated solely on the age of the participants.  Cf. <i>Leocal</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, n.\xc2\xa09 (concluding that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716 in an Act passed \xe2\x80\x9cjust nine months earlier\xe2\x80\x9d provided \xe2\x80\x9cstron[g] suppor[t]\xe2\x80\x9d for our interpretation of \xc2\xa716 as incorporated into the INA); <i>Powerex Corp.</i> v. <i>Reliant Energy Services, Inc.</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224,\n232 (2007)\n.  Section 2243, which criminalizes \xe2\x80\x9c[s]exual abuse of a minor or ward,\xe2\x80\x9d contains the only definition of that phrase in the United States Code.  As originally enacted in 1986, \xc2\xa72243 proscribed engaging in a \xe2\x80\x9csexual act\xe2\x80\x9d with a person between the ages of 12 and 16 if the perpetrator was at least four years older than the victim.  In 1996, Congress expanded \xc2\xa72243 to include victims who were younger than 12, thereby protecting anyone under the age of 16.  \xc2\xa72243(a); see also \xc2\xa72241(c).  Congress did this in the same omnibus law that added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA, which suggests that Congress understood that phrase to cover victims under age 16.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  See Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7121(7), 321,\n\n110Stat.\n3009\xe2\x80\x9331, 3009\xe2\x80\x93627.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner does not contend that the definition in \xc2\xa72243(a) must be imported wholesale into the INA, Brief for Petitioner 17, and we do not do so.  One reason is that the INA does not cross-reference \xc2\xa72243(a), whereas many other aggravated felonies in the INA are defined by cross-reference to other provisions of the United States Code, see, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(H) (\xe2\x80\x9can offense described in section 875, 876, 877, or 1202 of Title 18 (relating to the demand for or receipt of ransom)\xe2\x80\x9d).  Another is that \xc2\xa72243(a) requires a 4-year age difference between the perpetrator and the victim.  Combining that element with a 16-year age of consent would categorically exclude the statutory rape laws of most States.  See Brief for Respondent 34\xe2\x80\x9335; cf. <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 594 (declining to \xe2\x80\x9cconstru[e] \xe2\x80\x98burglary\xe2\x80\x99 to mean common-law burglary,\xe2\x80\x9d because that \xe2\x80\x9cwould come close to nullifying that term\xe2\x80\x99s effect in the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9cfew of the crimes now generally recognized as burglaries would fall within the common-law definition\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, we rely on \xc2\xa72243(a) for evidence of the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor, but not as providing the complete or exclusive definition.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As in other cases where we have applied the categorical approach, we look to state criminal codes for additional evidence about the generic meaning of sexual abuse of a minor.  See <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 598 (interpreting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bur-glary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 according to \xe2\x80\x9cthe generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Duenas-Alvarez</i>, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 190 (interpreting \xe2\x80\x9ctheft\xe2\x80\x9d in the INA in the same manner).  When \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d was added to the INA in 1996, thirty-one States and the District of Columbia set the age of consent at 16 for statutory rape offenses that hinged solely on the age of the participants.  As for the other States, one set the age of consent at 14; two set the age of consent at 15; six set the age of consent at 17; and the remaining ten, including California, set the age of consent at 18.  See Appendix, <i>infra</i>; cf. ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7213.3(1)(a) (1980) (in the absence of a special relationship, setting the default age of consent at 16 for the crime of \xe2\x80\x9c[c]orruption of [m]inors\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  A significant majority of jurisdictions thus set the age of consent at 16 for statutory rape offenses predicated exclusively on the age of the participants.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Many jurisdictions set a different age of consent for offenses that include an element apart from the age of the participants, such as offenses that focus on whether the perpetrator is in some special relationship of trust with the victim.  That was true in the two States that had offenses labeled \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d in 1996.  See Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa711.41.438 (1996) (age of consent for third-degree \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d was 16 generally but 18 where \xe2\x80\x9cthe offender occupie[d] a position of authority in relation to the victim\xe2\x80\x9d); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17\xe2\x80\x93A, \xc2\xa7254(1) (1983), as amended by 1995 Me. Laws p. 123 (age of consent for \xe2\x80\x9c[s]exual abuse of minors\xe2\x80\x9d was 16 generally but 18 where the victim was \xe2\x80\x9ca student\xe2\x80\x9d and the offender was \xe2\x80\x9ca teacher, employee or other official in the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. school .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in which the student [was] enrolled\xe2\x80\x9d).  And that is true in four of the five jurisdictions that have offenses titled \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d today.  Compare, <i>e.g.</i>, D.\xc2\xa0C. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x933001 (2012), 22\xe2\x80\x933008 (2016 Cum. Supp.) (age of consent is 16 in the absence of a significant relationship) with \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x933009.01 (age of consent is 18 where the offender \xe2\x80\x9cis in a significant relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with the victim); see also Brief for Respondent 31 (listing statutes with that title).  Accordingly, the generic crime of sexual abuse of a minor may include a different age of consent where the perpetrator and victim are in a significant relationship of trust.  As relevant to this case, however, the general consensus from state criminal codes points to the same generic definition as dictionaries and federal law: Where sexual intercourse is abusive solely because of the ages of the participants, the victim must be younger than 16.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The laws of many States and of the Federal Government include a minimum age differential (in addition to an age of consent) in defining statutory rape.  We need not and do not decide whether the generic crime of sexual abuse of a minor under\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(A) includes an additional element of that kind.  Petitioner has \xe2\x80\x9cshow[n] something <i>special</i> about California\xe2\x80\x99s version of the doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that the age of consent is 18, rather than 16\xe2\x80\x94and needs no more to prevail.  <i>Duenas-Alvarez</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 191.  Absent some special relationship of trust, consensual sexual conduct involving a younger partner who is at least 16 years of age does not qualify as sexual abuse of a minor under the INA, regardless of the age differential between the two participants.  We leave for another day whether the generic offense requires a particular age differential between the victim and the perpetrator, and whether the generic offense encompasses sexual intercourse involving victims over the age of 16 that is abusive because of the nature of the relationship between the participants.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, petitioner and the Government debate whether the Board\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of sexual abuse of a minor is entitled to deference under <i>Chevron</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n.  Petitioner argues that any ambiguity in the meaning of this phrase must be resolved in favor of the alien under the rule of lenity.  See Brief for Petitioner 41\xe2\x80\x9345.  The Government responds that ambiguities should be resolved by deferring to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  See Brief for Respondent 45\xe2\x80\x9353.  We have no need to resolve whether the rule of lenity or <i>Chevron </i>receives priority in this case because the statute, read in context, unambiguously forecloses the Board\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Therefore, neither the rule of lenity nor <i>Chevron</i> applies.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We hold that in the context of statutory rape offenses focused solely on the age of the participants, the generic federal definition of \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(A) requires the age of the victim to be less than 16.
