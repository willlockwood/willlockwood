FEGLIA permits an employee to name a beneficiary of life insurance proceeds, and specifies an \xe2\x80\x9corder of precedence\xe2\x80\x9d providing that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s death benefits accrue first to that beneficiary ahead of other potential recipients.  \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa78705(a).  A Virginia statute revokes a beneficiary designation in any contract that provides a death benefit to a former spouse where there has been a change in the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s marital status.  Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(A) (Section A).  In the event that this provision is pre-empted by federal law, a separate provision of Virginia law, Section D, provides a cause of action rendering the former spouse liable for the principal amount of the proceeds to the party who would have received them were Section A not pre-empted.  \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWarren Hillman named then-spouse, respondent Judy Maretta, as the beneficiary of his Federal Employees\xe2\x80\x99 Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) policy.  After their divorce, he married petitioner Jacqueline Hillman but never changed his named FEGLI beneficiary.  After Warren\xe2\x80\x99s death, Maretta, still the named beneficiary, filed a claim for the FEGLI proceeds and collected them.  Hillman sued in Virginia court, seeking recovery of the proceeds under Section D.  Maretta argued in response that Section D is pre-empted by federal law.  The parties agreed that Section A is pre-empted.  The Virginia Circuit Court found Maretta liable to Hillman under Section D for the FEGLI policy proceeds.  The State Supreme Court reversed, concluding that Section D is pre-empted by FEGLIA because it conflicts with the purposes and objectives of Congress.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Section D of the Virginia statute is pre-empted by FEGLIA.

Crosby, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 372\xe2\x80\x93373.  Two previous cases govern the analysis of the relationship between Section D and FEGLIA here.  In Wissner v. Wissner, \n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 655\n, a California court granted a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s widow, who was not the named beneficiary of a policy under the federal National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 (NSLIA), an interest in the insurance proceeds as community property under state law.  This Court reversed.  Because NSLIA provided that the insured had a right to designate a beneficiary and could change that designation at any time, the Court reasoned that Congress had \xe2\x80\x9cspoken with force and clarity in directing that the proceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 658.  The Court addressed a similar question regarding the federal Servicemen\xe2\x80\x99s Group Life Insurance Act of 1965 (SGLIA) in Ridgway v. Ridgway, \n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 46\n.  There, a Maine court imposed a constructive trust on insurance proceeds paid to a servicemember\xe2\x80\x99s widow, the named beneficiary, and ordered that they be paid to the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s first wife as required by a divorce decree.  Holding the constructive trust pre-empted, the Ridgway Court explained that Wissner controlled and that SGLIA made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe insured service member possesses the right freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter that choice at any time by communicating the decision in writing to the proper office.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 56.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0The reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with equal force here.  NSLIA and SGLIA are strikingly similar to FEGLIA, which creates a scheme that gives highest priority to an insured\xe2\x80\x99s designated beneficiary, \xc2\xa78705(a), and which underscores that the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d of designation \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be waived or restricted,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 CFR \xc2\xa7843.205(e).  Section D interferes with this scheme, because it directs that the proceeds actually belong to someone other than the named beneficiary by creating a cause of action for their recovery by a third party.  FEGLIA establishes a clear and predictable procedure for an employee to indicate who the intended beneficiary shall be and evinces Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to accord federal employees an unfettered freedom of choice in selecting a beneficiary and to ensure the proceeds actually belong to that beneficiary.  This conclusion is confirmed by another provision of FEGLIA, \xc2\xa78705(e), which creates a limited exception to the order of precedence by allowing proceeds to be paid to someone other than the named beneficiary, if, and only if, the requisite documentation is filed with the Government before the employee\xe2\x80\x99s death, so that any departure from the beneficiary designation is managed within, not outside, the federal system.  If States could make alternative distributions outside the clear procedure Congress established, \xc2\xa78705(e)\xe2\x80\x99s narrow exception would be transformed into a general license for state law to override FEGLIA.

FEGLIA provides that an employee may designate a beneficiary to receive the proceeds of his life insurance at the time of his death.  \xc2\xa78705(a).  Separately, a Virginia statute addresses the situation in which an employee\xe2\x80\x99s marital status has changed, but he did not update his beneficiary designation before his death.  Section 20\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D) of the Virginia Code renders a former spouse liable for insurance proceeds to whoever would have received them under applicable law, usually a widow or widower, but for the beneficiary designation.  Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D) (Lexis Supp. 2012).  This case presents the question whether the remedy created by \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D) is pre-empted by FEGLIA and its implementing regulations.

Pursuant to the authority granted to it by FEGLIA, OPM entered into a life insurance contract with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.  See \xc2\xa78709; 5 CFR \xc2\xa7870.102 (2013).  Individual employees enrolled in the Federal Employees\xe2\x80\x99 Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program receive coverage through this contract.  The program is of substantial size.

The order of precedence is also described on the form that employees use to designate a beneficiary.  See Designation of Beneficiary, FEGLI Program, SF 2823 (rev. Mar. 2011) (Back of Part 2).  And the enrollment form advises employees to update their designations if their \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ntentions [c]hange\xe2\x80\x9d as a result of, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage [or] divorce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1998, Congress amended FEGLIA to create a limited exception to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s right of designation.

Although FEGLIA contains an express pre-emption provision, see \xc2\xa78709(d)(1), the court below considered only whether Section D is pre-empted under conflict pre-emption principles.  We limit our analysis here to that holding.  State law is pre-empted \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent of any conflict with a federal statute.\xe2\x80\x9d   Crosby v.

See In re Burrus, \n\n136 U.\xc2\xa0S. 586\n\xe2\x80\x93594 (1890).  There is therefore a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption against pre-emption\xe2\x80\x9d of state laws governing domestic relations, Egelhoff v.

See Brief for Petitioner 25.  There is some force to Hillman\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a significant legislative interest in a large federal program like FEGLIA is to enable its efficient administration.  If Hillman is correct that administrative convenience was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 only purpose, then there might be no conflict between Section D and FEGLIA: Section D\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action takes effect only after benefits have been paid, and so would not necessarily impact the Government\xe2\x80\x99s distribution of insurance proceeds.

Brief for Respondent 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  If Maretta is correct, then Section D would directly conflict with that objective, because its cause of action would take the insurance proceeds away from the named beneficiary and reallocate them to someone else.

In two previous cases, we considered federal insurance statutes requiring that insurance proceeds be paid to a named beneficiary and held they pre-empted state laws that mandated a different distribution of benefits.  The statutes we addressed in these cases are similar to FEGLIA.  And the impediments to the federal interests in these prior cases are analogous to the one created by Section D of the Virginia statute.

Congress had enacted NSLIA to \xe2\x80\x9caffor[d] a uniform and comprehensive system of life insurance for members and veterans of the armed forces of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wissner, 338 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 658.

Id., at 658.  In pertinent part, NSLIA provided that the insured \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall have the right to designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the insurance [within a designated class], .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at all times have the right to change the beneficiary or beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

The California court\xe2\x80\x99s decision could not stand, we found, because it \xe2\x80\x9csubstitute[d] the widow for the mother, who was the beneficiary Congress directed shall receive the insurance money.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 659.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Ridgway, we considered a similar question regarding the federal Servicemen\xe2\x80\x99s Group Life Insurance Act of 1965 (SGLIA), Pub.

As in Wissner, the applicable provisions of SGLIA made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe insured service member possesses the right freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter that choice at any time by communicating the decision in writing to the proper office.\xe2\x80\x9d  454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 56 (citing Wissner, 338 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 658).  We also noted that SGLIA estab- lished an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98order of precedence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which provided that the benefits would be first paid to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0such \xe2\x80\x98beneficiary or bene-ficiaries as the member .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may have designated by [an appropriately filed] writing received prior to death.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 52 (quoting \n\n38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7770(a) (1976 ed.)).  Notwithstanding \xe2\x80\x9csome small differences\xe2\x80\x9d between SGLIA and NSLIA, we concluded that SGLIA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunqualified direc-tive to pay the proceeds to the properly designated bene-ficiary clearly suggest[ed] that no different result was intended by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 57.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with equal force here.  The statutes we considered in these earlier cases are strikingly similar to FEGLIA.  Like NSLIA and SGLIA, FEGLIA creates a scheme that gives highest priority to an insured\xe2\x80\x99s designated beneficiary.  \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa78705(a).  Indeed, FEGLIA includes an \xe2\x80\x9corder of precedence\xe2\x80\x9d that is nearly identical to the one in SGLIA: Both require that the insurance proceeds be paid first to the named beneficiary ahead of any other potential recipient.  Compare ibid. with \n\n38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7770(a) (1976 ed.) (now \xc2\xa71970(a) (2006 ed.)).  FEGLIA\xe2\x80\x99s implementing regulations further underscore that the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d of designation \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be waived or restricted.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 CFR \xc2\xa7843.205(e).  In FEGLIA, as in these other statutes, Congress \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98spok[e] with force and clarity in directing that the proceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ridgway, 454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 55 (quoting Wissner, 338 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 658; emphasis added). \n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection D interferes with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 scheme, because it directs that the proceeds actually \xe2\x80\x9cbelong\xe2\x80\x9d to someone other than the named beneficiary by creating a cause of action for their recovery by a third party.  Ridgway, 454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 55; see Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D).  It makes no difference whether state law requires the transfer of the proceeds, as Section A does, or creates a cause of action, like Section D, that enables another person to receive the proceeds upon filing an action in state court.  In either case, state law displaces the beneficiary selected by the insured in accordance with FEGLIA and places someone else in her stead.  As in Wissner, applicable state law \xe2\x80\x9csubstitutes the widow\xe2\x80\x9d for the \xe2\x80\x9cbeneficiary Congress directed shall receive the insurance money,\xe2\x80\x9d 338 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 659, and thereby \xe2\x80\x9cfrustrates the deliberate purpose of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that a federal employee\xe2\x80\x99s named beneficiary receives the proceeds.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOne can imagine plausible reasons to favor a different policy.  Many employees perhaps neglect to update their beneficiary designations after a change in marital status.  As a result, a legislature could have thought that a default rule providing that insurance proceeds accrue to a widow or widower, and not a named beneficiary, would be more likely to align with most people\xe2\x80\x99s intentions.  Or, similarly, a legislature might have reasonably believed that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s will is more reliable evidence of his intent than a beneficiary designation form executed years earlier.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut that is not the judgment Congress made.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t   Rather than draw an inference about an employee\xe2\x80\x99s probable intent from a range of sources, Congress established a clear and predictable procedure for an employee to indicate who the intended beneficiary of his life insurance shall be.  Like the statutes at issue in Ridgway and Wissner, FEGLIA evinces Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to accord federal employees an unfettered \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of choice\xe2\x80\x9d in selecting the beneficiary of the insurance proceeds and to ensure the proceeds would actually \xe2\x80\x9cbelong\xe2\x80\x9d to that beneficiary.  Ridgway, 454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 56.  An employee\xe2\x80\x99s ability to name a beneficiary acts as a \xe2\x80\x9cguarantee of the complete and full performance of the contract to the exclusion of conflicting claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wissner, 338 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 660.  With that promise comes the expectation that the insurance proceeds will be paid to the named beneficiary and that the beneficiary can use them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is further confirmation that Congress intended the insurance proceeds be paid in accordance with FEGLIA\xe2\x80\x99s procedures.  Section 8705(e)(1) of FEGLIA provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny amount which would otherwise be paid .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. under the order of precedence\xe2\x80\x9d shall be paid to another person \xe2\x80\x9cif and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation.\xe2\x80\x9d  This exception, however, only applies if the \xe2\x80\x9cdecree, order, or agreement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is received, before the date of the covered employee\xe2\x80\x99s death, by the employing agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa78705(e)(2).  This provision allows the proceeds to be paid to someone other than the named beneficiary, but if and only if the requisite documentation is filed with the Government, so that any departure from the beneficiary designation is managed within, not outside, the federal system.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co., \n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 608\n\xe2\x80\x93617 (1980).  Section 8705(e) creates a limited exception to the order of precedence.  If States could make alternative distributions outside the clear procedure Congress established, that would transform this narrow exception into a general license for state law to override FEGLIA.  See TRW Inc. v.

The anti-attachment provisions in NSLIA and SGLIA were identical, and each broadly prohibited the \xe2\x80\x9cattachment, levy, or seizure\xe2\x80\x9d of insurance proceeds by any legal process.  \n\n38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7454a (1946 ed.)

The premise of Hillman\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that FEGLIA\xe2\x80\x99s assignment provision suggests that an employee has a less substantial interest in who ultimately re- ceives the proceeds.  But an employee\xe2\x80\x99s ability to assign a FEGLI policy in fact highlights Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to allow an employee wide latitude to determine how the proceeds should be paid, whether that is to a named beneficiary that he selects, or indirectly through the assignment of the policy itself to someone else.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, Hillman attempts to distinguish Ridgway and Wissner because Congress enacted the statutes at issue in those cases with the goal of improving military morale.

Because one of the purposes of the Federal Employees\xe2\x80\x99 Group Life Insurance Act of 1954 (FEGLIA) is to implement the expressed wishes of the insured, I would hold that a state law is pre-empted if it effectively overrides an insured\xe2\x80\x99s actual, articulated choice of beneficiary.  The challenged provision of Virginia law has that effect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy way of background, Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(A) (Lexis Supp. 2012) provides that the entry of a divorce de-cree automatically revokes an insured\xe2\x80\x99s prior designa- tion of his or her former spouse as the beneficiary of the policy.  And where, as in this case, the insured remarries after the divorce and dies before making a new FEGLIA designation, the proceeds, under \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa78705(a), are automatically paid to the insured\xe2\x80\x99s former spouse.  Under the provision of Virginia law at issue here, the surviving spouse is entitled to recover those proceeds from the former spouse.  See Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D).  Section 20\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D) apparently requires this result even if the in-sured manifests a clear contrary intent, such as by providing specifically in a recent will that the proceeds are to go to another party\xe2\x80\x94for example, the insured\xe2\x80\x99s children by the former marriage.  Because \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D) overrides the insured\xe2\x80\x99s express intent (whether that intent is expressed via a beneficiary designation or through other reliable means), I agree that it is pre-empted by FEGLIA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tInterpreted in light of our prior decisions in Wissner v. Wissner, \n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 655 (1950)\n, and Ridgway v. Ridgway, \n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 46 (1981)\n, FEGLIA seems to me to have two primary purposes or objectives.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe first is administrative convenience.  It is easier for an insurance administrator to pay insurance proceeds to the person whom the insured has designated on a specified form without having to consider claims made by others based on some other ground.  But \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D) does not affect the initial payment of proceeds.  It operates after the funds are received by the designated beneficiary, and it thus causes no inconvenience for those who administer the payment of FEGLIA proceeds.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second purpose or objective is the effectuation of the insured\xe2\x80\x99s expressed intent above all other considerations.  That was the basis for the decisions in Wissner and Ridgway, as I understand them.  In both cases, there was a conflict between a person whom the insured had desig-nated as his beneficiary and another person whose claim to the proceeds was not based on the insured\xe2\x80\x99s expressed intent, and in both cases, the Court held in favor of the designated beneficiary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe present case bears a similarity to Wissner and Ridgway in that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim depends upon a state stat-ute that automatically alters the ultimate recipient of a divorced employee\xe2\x80\x99s insurance proceeds.  To be sure, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s provision may well reflect the unexpressed preferences of the majority of insureds whose situations are similar to that of the insured in this case\xe2\x80\x94that is, individuals who, after divorce and remarriage, fail to change a prior designation of a former spouse as the beneficiary of the policy.  But FEGLIA prioritizes the insured\xe2\x80\x99s expressed intent.  And it is telling that, on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s theory, she would still be entitled to the insurance proceeds even if, for example, the insured had died shortly after executing a new will leaving those proceeds to someone else.  This shows that her claim is based on something other than a manifestation of the insured\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  Because \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D) operates as a blunt tool to override the insured\xe2\x80\x99s express declaration of his or her intent, it conflicts with FEGLIA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of prioritizing an insured\xe2\x80\x99s articulated wishes above all other considerations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn affirming the decision below, the Court goes well beyond what is necessary and opines that the party designated as the beneficiary under a FEGLIA policy must be allowed to keep the insurance proceeds even if the in-sured\xe2\x80\x99s contrary and expressed intent is indisputable\xe2\x80\x94for example, when the insured writes a postdivorce will specifically leaving the proceeds to someone else.  See ante, at 11.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s explanation is as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cCongress sought to ensure that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s intent would be given effect only through the designation of a beneficiary or through the narrow exceptions specifically provided in the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid., n.\xc2\xa03.  In other words, Congress wanted the designated beneficiary\xe2\x80\x94rather than the person named in a later will\xe2\x80\x94to keep the proceeds because Congress wanted the named beneficiary to keep the proceeds.  Needless the say, this circular reasoning does not explain why Congress might have wanted the designated beneficiary to keep the proceeds even when that is indisputably contrary to the insured\xe2\x80\x99s expressed wishes at the time of death.  I am doubtful that any purpose or objective of FEGLIA would be honored by such a holding, but it is not necessary to resolve that question in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I concur in the judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970671">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 11\xe2\x80\x931221\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tJACQUELINE HILLMAN, PETITIONER v.

As I have noted before, courts assessing whether state and federal law conflict should not engage in a freewheeling inquiry into whether state law undermines supposed federal purposes and ob-jectives.

FEGLIA provides that life insurance benefits are paid according to a particular \xe2\x80\x9corder of precedence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa78705(a); see also 5 CFR \xc2\xa7870.801(a) (2013).

If the insured fails to designate a beneficiary, FEGLIA provides a specific order in which benefits must be distributed: next to \xe2\x80\x9cthe widow or widower of the employee\xe2\x80\x9d; absent a widow or widower, to \xe2\x80\x9cthe child or children of the employee and descendants of [the] deceased children\xe2\x80\x9d; and so on.  Ibid.; ante, at 2.  The insured has the right to change his beneficiary designation \xe2\x80\x9cat any time without the knowledge or consent of the previous beneficiary,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his right cannot be waived or restricted.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 CFR \xc2\xa7870.802(f).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection D directly conflicts with this statutory scheme, because it nullifies the insured\xe2\x80\x99s statutory right to designate a beneficiary.  The right to designate a beneficiary encompasses a corresponding right in the named beneficiary not only to receive the proceeds, but also to retain them.  Indeed, the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to designate a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x94as well as the term \xe2\x80\x9cbeneficiary\xe2\x80\x9d itself\xe2\x80\x94would be meaningless if the only effect of a designation were to saddle the nominal beneficiary with liability under state law for the full value of the proceeds.  But Section D accomplishes exactly that: It transforms the designated beneficiary into a defendant in state court, a defendant who is now liable to the individual the State has designated as the true beneficiary.  While Hillman does not insist that the in-surer should have mailed the check to her (as opposed to Maretta, the designated beneficiary), Section D requires, in effect, this very result.  See ante, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9c[Section D] displaces the beneficiary selected by the insured in accordance with FEGLIA and places someone else in her stead\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the right to designate a beneficiary means anything, we must conclude that Section D directly conflicts with FEGLIA\xe2\x80\x99s order of precedence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe direct conflict between Section D and FEGLIA is also evident in the fact that Section D\xe2\x80\x99s only function is to accomplish what Section A would have achieved, had Section A not been pre-empted.  Section A provides that, \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cupon the entry of a decree of annulment or divorce from the bond of matrimony .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , any revocable beneficiary designation contained in a then existing written contract owned by one party that provides for the payment of any death benefit to the other party is revoked.  A death benefit prevented from passing to a former spouse by this section shall be paid as if the former spouse had predeceased the decedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(A) (Lexis Cum. Supp. 2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tBoth parties agree that FEGLIA pre-empts this provision.  Brief for Petitioner 4\xe2\x80\x935; Brief for Respondent 2; see also 283 Va. 34, 52, 722 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 32, 35 (2012).  And for good reason: if an insured has designated his former spouse as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy, Section A purports to \xe2\x80\x9crevok[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that  designation in the event of divorce or annulment.  By purporting to so alter FEGLIA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory order of precedence, Section A is clearly pre-empted by federal law.  Tellingly, it is precisely in this context\xe2\x80\x94and only in this context\xe2\x80\x94that Section D operates.  See \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(D).  Of course, Section D does not preclude the direct payment of benefits to the designated beneficiary; however, it accomplishes the same prohibited result by transforming the designated party into little more than a passthrough for the true beneficiary.  This cannot be squared with FEGLIA.
