The District Court denied their challenges, and respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0In concluding that this case was not moot, the Court of Appeals relied upon this Court\xe2\x80\x99s class action precedents, most prominently <i>Gerstein</i> v. <i>Pugh,</i>\n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103.  That reliance was misplaced.  <i>Gerstein </i>was a class action respecting pretrial detention brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  The named class representatives\xe2\x80\x99 individual claims had apparently become moot before class certification.  This Court held that the case could nonetheless proceed, explaining that due to the inherently temporary nature of pretrial detention, no named representative might be in custody long enough for a class to be certified.  <i>Gerstein </i>does not support a freestanding exception to mootness outside the class action context.  It belongs to a line of cases that this Court has described as turning on the particular traits of Rule 23 class actions.  See, <i>e.g., Sosna </i>v. <i>Iowa</i>,\n\n419 U. S. 393; <i>United States Parole Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Geraghty</i>,\n\n445 U. S. 388; <i>Genesis HealthCare</i>,\n\n569 U. S. 66.  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure establish for criminal cases no vehicle comparable to the civil class action, and this Court has never permitted criminal defendants to band together to seek prospective relief in their individual cases on behalf of a class.  Here, the mere presence of allegations that might, if resolved in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 favor, benefit other similarly situated individuals cannot save their case from mootness.  See <i>id.</i>, at 73.  That conclusion is unaffected by the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision to recast respondents\xe2\x80\x99 appeals as petitions for supervisory mandamus.

Respondents claim that the exception applies because Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman will again violate the law, be apprehended, and be returned to pretrial custody.  But this Court has consistently refused to \xe2\x80\x9cconclude that the case-or-controversy requirement is satisfied by\xe2\x80\x9d the possibility that a party \xe2\x80\x9cwill be prosecuted for violating valid criminal laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Shea</i> v. <i>Littleton,</i>\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 488, 497.  Respondents argue that this usual refusal to assume future criminal conduct is unwarranted here given the particular circumstances of Sanchez-Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s and Patricio-Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s offenses.  They cite two civil cases\xe2\x80\x94<i>Honig</i> v. <i>Doe,</i>\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305, and <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Rogers,</i>\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 431\xe2\x80\x94in which this Court concluded that the expectation that a litigant would repeat the misconduct that gave rise to his claims rendered those claims capable of repetition.  But <i>Honig </i>and <i>Turner </i>are inapposite because they concerned litigants unable, for reasons beyond their control, to prevent themselves from transgressing and avoid recurrence of the challenged conduct.  Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman, in contrast, are \xe2\x80\x9cable\xe2\x80\x94and indeed required by law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to refrain from further criminal conduct.  <i>Lane </i>v. <i>Williams</i>, \n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624, 633, n.\xc2\xa013.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the use of such restraints was unconstitutional, even though each of the four criminal cases had ended prior to its decision.  The question presented is whether the appeals were saved from mootness either because the defendants sought \xe2\x80\x9cclass-like relief\xe2\x80\x9d in a \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional class action,\xe2\x80\x9d or because the challenged practice was \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It is the responsibility of the United States Marshals Service to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide for the security .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the United States District Courts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7566(a).  To fulfill that duty, the United States Marshal for the Southern District of California requested that the judges of that district permit the use of full restraints on all in-custody defendants during nonjury proceedings.  When \xe2\x80\x9cfull restraints\xe2\x80\x9d are applied, \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant\xe2\x80\x99s hands are closely handcuffed together, these handcuffs are connected by chain to another chain running around the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s feet are shackled and chained together.\xe2\x80\x9d  859 F.\xc2\xa03d 649, 653 (CA9 2017) (en banc).  In support of his proposal, the Marshal cited safety concerns arising from understaffing, past incidents of violence, and the high volume of in-custody defendants produced in the Southern District.  The judges agreed to the Marshal\xe2\x80\x99s request, with modifications providing that a district or magistrate judge may require a defendant to be produced without restraints, and that a defendant can request that this be done.  See App. 78\xe2\x80\x9379.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents Jasmin Morales, Rene Sanchez-Gomez, Moises Patricio-Guzman, and Mark Ring were among the defendants produced by the Marshals Service for pretrial proceedings in full restraints.  They raised constitutional objections to the use of such restraints in their respective cases, and to the restraint policy as a whole.  They noted that the policy had resulted in the imposition of full restraints on, for example, a woman with a fractured wrist, a man with a severe leg injury, a blind man, and a wheelchair-bound woman.  The District Court denied their challenges.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, but before the court could issue a decision, their underlying criminal cases came to an end.  Morales, Sanchez-Gomez, and Patricio-Guzman each pled guilty to the offense for which they were charged: Morales, to felony importation of a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7952 and 960; Sanchez-Gomez, to felony misuse of a passport, in violation of\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71544; and Patricio-Guzman, to misdemeanor illegal entry into the United States, in violation of\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325.

Those rulings were reaffirmed on rehearing en banc.  859 F.\xc2\xa03d 649.  The en banc court understood the \xe2\x80\x9cmain dispute\xe2\x80\x9d before it to be a challenge to the policy itself, not just to the application of that policy to respondents.  <i>Id.,</i> at 655.  The court then construed respondents\xe2\x80\x99 notices of appeal as petitions for mandamus, which invoked the court\xe2\x80\x99s supervisory authority over the Southern District.  <i>Id.,</i> at 657.  The case was, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, a \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional class action\xe2\x80\x9d involving \xe2\x80\x9cclass-like claims\xe2\x80\x9d seeking \xe2\x80\x9cclass-like relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 655, 657\xe2\x80\x93658.  In light of that understanding, the Court of Appeals held that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s civil class action precedents kept the case alive, even though respondents were no longer subject to the restraint policy.  <i>Id.,</i> at 657\xe2\x80\x93659 (citing <i>Gerstein</i> v. <i>Pugh</i>,\n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103, 110\xe2\x80\x93111, n. 11 (1975)).

By the time this Court heard the case, the named representatives\xe2\x80\x99 claims were moot, and the record suggested that their interest might have lapsed even before the District Court certified the class.  See <i>id.,</i> at 110\xe2\x80\x93111, n.\xc2\xa011.

See <i>ibid.</i> (citing <i>Sosna </i>v. <i>Iowa</i>,\n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393, 402, n. 11 (1975)).  The Court nevertheless held that the case remained live.  As we explained, pretrial custody was inherently temporary and of uncertain length, such that we could not determine \xe2\x80\x9cthat any given individual, named as plaintiff, would be in pretrial custody long enough for a district judge to certify the class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gerstein</i>, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 110\xe2\x80\x93111, n.\xc2\xa011.  At the same time, it was certain that there would always be some group of detainees subject to the challenged practice.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Given these circumstances, the Court determined that  the class action could proceed.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>Swisher </i>v.  <i>Brady</i>,\n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 204, 213\xe2\x80\x93214, n. 11 (1978) (employing same analysis in a class action challenging juvenile court procedures).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals interpreted <i>Gerstein </i>to cover all \xe2\x80\x9ccases sufficiently similar to class actions\xe2\x80\x9d in which, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the inherently transitory nature of the claims,\xe2\x80\x9d the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterests would expire before litigation could be completed.\xe2\x80\x9d  859 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 658.  <i>Gerstein</i> was an action brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, but the Court of Appeals decided that such \xe2\x80\x9ca procedural mechanism to aggregate the claims\xe2\x80\x9d was not a \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary prerequisite\xe2\x80\x9d for application of the <i>Gerstein </i>rule.  859 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 659 (alteration omitted).

In an effort to continue her case on behalf of others, the plaintiff turned to <i>Sosna </i>and its progeny, including <i>Gerstein</i>.  But those cases, we explained, were \xe2\x80\x9cinapposite,\xe2\x80\x9d not least because \xe2\x80\x9cRule 23 actions are fundamentally different from collective actions under the FLSA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Genesis HealthCare</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 74.  Such collective actions, we stressed, do not \xe2\x80\x9cproduce a class with an independent legal status, or join additional parties to the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 75.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case, which does not involve <i>any </i>formal mechanism for aggregating claims, is even further removed from Rule 23 and <i>Gerstein</i>.  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure establish for criminal cases no vehicle comparable to the FLSA collective action, much less the class action.  And we have never permitted criminal defendants to band to- gether to seek prospective relief in their individual criminal cases on behalf of a class.  As we said when declining to apply nonparty preclusion outside the formal class action context, courts may not \xe2\x80\x9crecognize .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a common-law kind of class action\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccreate <i>de\xc2\xa0facto</i> class actions at will.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>Sturgell</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 880, 901 (2008) (alterations omitted); see <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Bayer Corp.</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 299, 315\xe2\x80\x93316 (2011) (same); <i>Pasadena City Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Spangler</i>,\n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 424, 430 (1976) (rejecting in mootness context the idea that \xe2\x80\x9cthe failure to obtain the class certification required under Rule 23 is merely the absence of a meaningless \xe2\x80\x98verbal recital\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court below designated respondents\xe2\x80\x99 case a \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional class action\xe2\x80\x9d because respondents were pursuing relief \xe2\x80\x9cnot merely for themselves, but for all in-custody defendants in the district.\xe2\x80\x9d  859 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 655, 657\xe2\x80\x93658.

Supervisory mandamus refers to the authority of the Courts of Appeals to exercise \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory control of the District Courts\xe2\x80\x9d through their \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary power to issue writs of mandamus.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>La Buy</i> v. <i>Howes Leather Co.</i>,\n\n352 U.\xc2\xa0S. 249, 259\xe2\x80\x93260 (1957).  There is no sign in our scant supervisory mandamus precedents that such cases are exempt from the normal mootness rules.  See generally <i>Will</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 90 (1967); <i>Schlagenhauf</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n379 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104 (1964); <i>La Buy</i>,\n\n352 U.\xc2\xa0S. 249.  Indeed, as the court below acknowledged, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]upervisory mandamus cases require live controversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  859 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 657.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondents do not defend the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.  See Brief for Respondents 58 (arguing that this Court need not reach the functional class action issue and should \xe2\x80\x9cdiscard[ ]\xe2\x80\x9d that label); Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (respondents\xe2\x80\x99 counsel agreeing that they \xe2\x80\x9chave not made any effort to defend\xe2\x80\x9d the functional class action approach).  In respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view, functional class actions and <i>Gerstein</i>\xe2\x80\x99s rule<i> </i>are beside the point because two respondents\xe2\x80\x94Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman\xe2\x80\x94retain a personal stake in the outcome of their appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman are no longer in pretrial custody.  Their criminal cases, arising from their illegal entry into the United States, ended in guilty pleas well before the Court of Appeals issued its decision.  Respondents contend, however, that the claims brought by Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman fall within the \xe2\x80\x9cexception to the mootness doctrine for a controversy that is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kingdomware Technologies, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A dispute qualifies for that exception only \xe2\x80\x9cif (1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully liti- gated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Rogers</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 431, 439\xe2\x80\x93440 (2011) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The parties do not contest that the claims at issue satisfy the first prong of that test, but they sharply disagree as to the second.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents argue that Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman meet the second prong because they will again violate the law, be apprehended, and be returned to pretrial custody.  But we have consistently refused to \xe2\x80\x9cconclude that the case-or-controversy requirement is satisfied by\xe2\x80\x9d the possibility that a party \xe2\x80\x9cwill be prosecuted for violating valid criminal laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Shea</i> v. <i>Littleton</i>,\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 488, 497 (1974).  We have instead \xe2\x80\x9cassume[d] that [litigants] will conduct their activities within the law and so avoid prosecution and conviction as well as exposure to the challenged course of conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Spencer </i>v. <i>Kemna</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 15 (1998) (reasoning that a claim regarding a parole revocation order was moot following release from custody because any continuing consequences of the order were \xe2\x80\x9ccontingent upon [the claimant] violating the law, getting caught, and being convicted\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Honig</i> v. <i>Doe</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305, 320 (1988) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e generally have been unwilling to assume that the party seeking relief will repeat the type of misconduct that would once again place him or her at risk of that injury.\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Lane </i>v. <i>Williams</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624, 632\xe2\x80\x93633, n.\xc2\xa013 (1982) (concluding that case was moot where the challenged parole revocation could not \xe2\x80\x9caffect a subsequent parole determination unless respondents again violate state law, are returned to prison, and become eligible for parole\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents argue that this usual refusal to assume future criminal conduct is unwarranted here given the particular circumstances of Sanchez-Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s and Patricio-Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s offenses.  They cite two civil cases\xe2\x80\x94<i>Honig</i> v. <i>Doe</i> and <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Rogers</i>\xe2\x80\x94in which this Court concluded that the expectation that a litigant would repeat the misconduct that gave rise to his claims rendered those claims capable of repetition.  Neither case, however, supports a departure from the settled rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Honig</i> involved a disabled student\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to his suspension from school for disruptive behavior.  We found that given his \xe2\x80\x9cinability to conform his conduct to socially acceptable norms\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgovern his aggressive, impulsive behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d it was \xe2\x80\x9creasonable to expect that [the student would] again engage in the type of misconduct that precipitated this suit\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbe subjected to the same unilateral school action for which he initially sought relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  484 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 320\xe2\x80\x93321.  In <i>Turner</i>, we determined that an indigent person repeatedly held in civil contempt for failing to make child support payments, who was at the time over $13,000 in arrears, and whose next hearing was only five months away, was destined to find himself in civil contempt proceedings again.  The challenged denial of appointed counsel at his contempt hearing was thus capable of repetition.  See 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 440.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents contend that Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman, like the challengers in <i>Honig </i>and <i>Turner</i>, are likely to find themselves right back where they started if we dismiss their case as moot.  Respondents cite a Sentencing Commission report finding that in 2013 thirty-eight percent of those convicted and sentenced for an illegal entry or illegal reentry offense \xe2\x80\x9cwere deported and subsequently illegally reentered at least one time.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States Sentencing Commission, Illegal Reentry Offenses<i> </i>15 (2015) (cited by Brief for Respondents 51).  Respondents emphasize the economic and familial pressures that often compel individuals such as Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman to repeatedly attempt to enter the United States.  And respondents note that both men, after  their release, actually <i>did</i> cross the border into the United States, were apprehended again, and were charged with new illegal entry offenses.  All this, respondents say, adds up to a sufficient showing that Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of repetition\xe2\x80\x9d require- ment.  Because the Court of Appeals was not aware that Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman had subsequently reentered the United States illegally, respondents invite us to remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We decline to do so because <i>Honig </i>and <i>Turner </i>are inapposite.  Our decisions in those civil cases rested on the litigants\xe2\x80\x99 inability, for reasons beyond their control, to prevent themselves from transgressing and avoid recurrence of the challenged conduct.  In <i>Honig</i>, such incapacity was the very reason the school sought to expel the student.  And in <i>Turner</i>, the indigent individual\xe2\x80\x99s large outstanding debt made him effectively incapable of satisfying his imminent support obligations.  Sanchez-Gomez and Patricio-Guzman, in contrast, are \xe2\x80\x9cable\xe2\x80\x94and indeed required by law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to refrain from further criminal conduct.  <i>Lane</i>,<i> </i>455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 633, n.\xc2\xa013.  Their personal incentives to return to the United States, plus the elevated rate of recidivism associated with illegal entry offenses, do not amount to an inability to obey the law.  We have consistently refused to find the case or controversy requirement satisfied where, as here, the litigants simply \xe2\x80\x9canticipate violating lawful criminal statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Shea</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S.,  at 496.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">None of this is to say that those who wish to challenge the use of full physical restraints in the Southern District lack any avenue for relief.
