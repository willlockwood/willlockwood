JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We have once again a case that presents "the perennial problem of the validity of a state tax for the privilege of carrying on, within a state, certain activities" related to a corporation\'s operation of an interstate business.  <em>Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/80/case.html">335 U. S. 80</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/80/case.html#85">335 U. S. 85</a></span> (1948). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The issue is whether Louisiana, consistent with the Commerce Clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3, may impose a fairly apportioned and nondiscriminatory corporation franchise tax on appellant, Colonial Pipeline Co., a corporation engaged exclusively in interstate business, upon the "incident" of its "qualification to carry on or do business in this state or the actual doing of business within this state in a corporate form."  No question is raised as to the reasonableness of the apportionment of appellant\'s capital deemed to have been employed in Louisiana, and it is not claimed that the tax is discriminatory.  The Supreme Court of Louisiana sustained the validity of the tax.  289 So.2d 93 (1974).  We noted probable jurisdiction, 417 U.S. 966 (1974).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellant is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Atlanta, Ga.  It is a common carrier of liquefied petroleum products, and owns and operates a pipeline system extending from Houston, Tex., to the New York City area.  This 3,400-mile pipeline links the oil refining complexes of Texas and Louisiana with the population centers of the Southeast and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 421 U. S. 102</a></p><p> Northeast.  Appellant daily delivers more than one million gallons of petroleum products to 14 States and the District of Columbia.  Approximately 258 miles of the pipeline are located in Louisiana.  Over this distance within Louisiana, appellant owns and operates several pumping stations which keep the petroleum products flowing at a sustained rate, and various tank storage facilities used to inject or withdraw petroleum products into or from the line.  A workforce of 25 to 30 employees -- mechanics, electricians, and other workers -- inspect and maintain the line within the State.  During the tax years in question, 1970 and 1971, appellant maintained no administrative offices or personnel in Louisiana, although it had once maintained a division office in Baton Rouge.  Appellant does no intrastate business in petroleum products in Louisiana.</p>\n<p>On May 9, 1962, appellant voluntarily qualified to do business in Louisiana, although it could have carried on its interstate business without doing so.  La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 12:302 H (1969); <em>see</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>infra.</em>  Thereupon, the Collector of Revenue imposed the Louisiana franchise tax on appellant\'s activities in the State during 1962.  At that time, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 47:601, the Louisiana Franchise Tax Act, expressly provided:</p>\n<p>"The tax levied herein is due and payable for <em>the privilege of carrying on or doing business,</em> the exercising of its charter or the continuance of its charter within this state, or owning or using any part or all of its capital or plant in this state. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 421 U. S. 103</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellant paid the tax and sued for a refund.  The Louisiana Court of Appeal, First Circuit, held that, in that form, \xc2\xa7 601 was unconstitutional as applied to appellant because, being imposed directly upon "the privilege of carrying on or doing [interstate] business," it violated the Commerce Clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3.  <em>Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Mouton,</em> 228 So.2d 718 (1969).  The Supreme Court of Louisiana refused review.  255 La. 474, 231 So.2d 393 (1970). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Following this decision, the Louisiana Legislature amended La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 47:601 by Act 325 of 1970.  The amendment excised from \xc2\xa7 601 the words:  "The tax levied herein is due and payable for the privilege of carrying on or doing business," and substituted:  "The qualification to carry on or do business in this state or the actual doing of business within this state in a corporate form," as one of three "alternative incidents" upon which the tax might be imposed.  The other two "incidents" -- the exercise of the corporate charter in the State, and the employment there of its capital, plant, or other property -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 421 U. S. 104</a></p><p> were carried forward from the earlier version of the statute. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  <em>See</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>The Collector of Revenue then renewed his efforts to impose a tax on appellant, this time for doing business "in a corporate form" during 1970 and 1971.  Again, appellant paid the tax and sued for a refund.  The Louisiana District Court and the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, concluded that the 1970 amendment made no substantive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 421 U. S. 105</a></p><p> change in \xc2\xa7 601, which it construed as still imposing the tax directly upon the privilege of carrying on or doing an interstate business, and held that amended \xc2\xa7 601 was therefore unconstitutional as applied to appellant.  275 So.2d 834 (1973).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Louisiana reversed.  The court recognized that</p>\n<p>"[t]he pertinent Constitutional question is whether, as applied to a corporation whose exclusive business carried on within the State is interstate, this statute violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution."</p>\n<p>289 So.2d at 97.  But the court attached controlling significance to the omission from the amended statute of the "primary operating incident [of the former version], <em>i.e.,</em> <em>the privilege of carrying on or doing business,\'" <em>id.</em> at 96, and the substitution for that incident of doing business in the corporate form.  The court held:\n</em></p>\n<p>"The thrust of the [amended] statute is to tax not the interstate business done in Louisiana by a foreign corporation, but the doing of business in Louisiana in a corporate form, including \'each and every act, power, right, privilege or immunity exercised or enjoyed in this state, as an incident to or by virtue of the powers and privileges acquired by the nature of such organizations. . . .\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 97.  Accordingly, the court concluded that amended \xc2\xa7 601 applied the franchise tax to foreign corporations doing only an interstate business in Louisiana, not as a tax upon</p>\n<p>"the general privilege of doing interstate business, but simply [as a tax upon] the corporation\'s privilege of enjoying in a corporate capacity the ownership or use of its capital, plant or other property in this state, the corporation\'s privilege of exercising and continuing its corporate character in the State of Louisiana, and the corporation\'s use of its corporate form to do business in the State."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 100.  Upon that premise, the court validated the levy as a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="106">Page 421 U. S. 106</a></p><p> constitutional exaction for privileges enjoyed by corporations in Louisiana and for benefits furnished by the State to enterprises carrying on business, interstate or local, in the corporate form, whether as domestic or foreign corporations.  The court reasoned:</p>\n<p>"The corporation, including the foreign corporation doing only interstate business in Louisiana, enjoys under our laws many privileges separate and apart from simply doing business, such for instance as the legal status to sue and be sued in the Courts of our State, continuity of business without interruption by death or dissolution, transfer of property interests by the disposition of shares of stock, advantages of business controlled and managed by corporate directors, and the general absence of individual liability, among others."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The fact that the corporate form of doing business is inextricably interwoven in a foreign corporation\'s doing interstate business in the State does not, in our view, detract from the fact that the local incident taxed is the form of doing business, rather than the business done by that corporation.  And it is our view that the local incident is real and sufficiently distinguishable so that taxation thereof does not, under the controlling decisions of the United States Supreme Court, violate the Commerce Clause."</p>\n<p>"The statute does not discriminate between foreign and local corporations, being applicable, as it is, to both.  Nor do we believe that the State\'s exercise of its power by this taxing statute is out of proportion to Colonial\'s activities within the state and their consequent enjoyment of the opportunities and protection which the state has afforded them."</p>\n<p>"Furthermore we believe that the State has given </p><p><a class="page-number" name="107">Page 421 U. S. 107</a></p><p> something for which it can ask return.  The return, tax levy in this case, is an exaction which the State of Louisiana requires as a recompense for its protection of lawful activities carried on in this state by Colonial, activities which are incidental to the powers and privileges possessed by it by the nature of its organization, here, . . . the local activities in maintaining, keeping in repair, and otherwise in manning the facilities of their pipeline system throughout the 258 miles of its pipeline in the State of Louisiana."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 100-101. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court is, of course, not bound by the state court\'s determination that the challenged tax is not a tax on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>"The State may determine for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 421 U. S. 108</a></p><p> itself the operating incidence of its tax.  But it is for this Court to determine whether the tax, as construed by the highest court of the State, is or is not \'a tax on interstate commerce.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Memphis Steam Laundry v. Stone,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/389/case.html">342 U. S. 389</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/389/case.html#392">342 U. S. 392</a></span> (1952).  We therefore turn to the question whether the tax imposed upon appellant under amended \xc2\xa7 601, as construed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, is or is not a tax on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>It is a truism that the mere act of carrying on business in interstate commerce does not exempt a corporation from state taxation.</p>\n<p>"It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business."</p>\n<p><em>Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/250/case.html">303 U. S. 250</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/250/case.html#254">303 U. S. 254</a></span> (1938).  Accordingly, decisions of this Court, particularly during recent decades, have sustained nondiscriminatory, properly apportioned state corporate taxes upon foreign corporations doing an exclusively interstate business when the tax is related to a corporation\'s local activities and the State has provided benefits and protections for those activities for which it is justified in asking a fair and reasonable return. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>General Motors Corp. v. Washington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/436/case.html">377 U. S. 436</a></span> (1964); <em>Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/80/case.html">335 U. S. 80</a></span> (1948).  <em>Cf. Spector Motor Service v. O\'Connor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/602/case.html">340 U. S. 602</a></span> (1951).  <em>General Motors Corp., supra,</em> states the controlling test:</p>\n<p>"[T]he validity of the tax rests upon whether the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 421 U. S. 109</a></p><p> State is exacting a constitutionally fair demand for that aspect of interstate commerce to which it bears a special relation.  For our purposes, the decisive issue turns on the operating incidence of the tax.  In other words, the question is whether the State has exerted its power in proper proportion to appellant\'s activities within the State and to appellant\'s consequent enjoyment of the opportunities and protections which the State has afforded. . . .  As was said in <em>Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/311/435/case.html">311 U. S. 435</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/311/435/case.html#444">311 U. S. 444</a></span> (1940), \'[t]he simple but controlling question is whether the state has given anything for which it can ask return.\'"</p>\n<p>377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/436/case.html#440">377 U. S. 440</a></span>-441.  Amended \xc2\xa7 601, as applied to appellant, satisfies this test.  First, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that the operating incidences of the franchise tax are the three localized alternative incidences provided in \xc2\xa7 601:  (1) doing business in Louisiana in the corporate form; (2) the exercise of a corporation\'s charter or the continuance of its charter within the State; and (3) the owning or using any part of its capital, plant, or other property in Louisiana in a corporate capacity.  We necessarily accept this construction of amended \xc2\xa7 601 by Louisiana\'s highest court.  289 So.2d at 97.  Second, the court found that the powers, privileges, and benefits Louisiana bestows incident to these activities were sufficient to support a tax on doing business in the corporate form in that State.  We perceive no basis upon which we can say that this is not, in fact, the case.  Our pertinent precedents therefore require affirmance of the State Supreme Court\'s judgment.</p>\n<p><em>Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, supra,</em> sustained a similar franchise tax imposed by Mississippi on a foreign pipeline corporation engaged exclusively in an interstate business even though the company had not qualified in Mississippi.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 421 U. S. 110</a></p><p> Memphis Natural Gas Co., a Delaware corporation, owned and operated a natural gas pipeline extending from Louisiana, through Arkansas and Mississippi, to Memphis and other parts of Tennessee.  Approximately 135 miles of the pipeline were located in Mississippi, and two of the corporation\'s compressing stations were located in that State.  The corporation engaged in no intrastate commerce in Mississippi, and had only one customer there.  It had not qualified under the corporation laws of Mississippi.  It had neither an agent for the service of process nor an office in that State, and its only employees there were those necessary for the maintenance of the pipeline.  The corporation paid all <em>ad valorem</em> taxes assessed against its property in Mississippi.  In addition to these taxes, however, Mississippi imposed a "franchise or excise tax" upon all corporations "doing business" within the State.  The statute defined "doing business" in terms that suggest it may have been the model for \xc2\xa7 601, that is,</p>\n<p>"[to] mean and [to] include each and every act, power or privilege exercised or enjoyed in this State, as an incident to, or by virtue of the powers and privileges acquired by the nature of such organization."</p>\n<p>335 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/80/case.html#82">335 U. S. 82</a></span>. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Supreme Court of Mississippi held, as did the Supreme Court of Louisiana here, 289 So.2d at 101, that the tax was</p>\n<p>"\'an exaction . . . as a recompense for . . . protection of . . . the local activities in maintaining, keeping in repair, and otherwise manning the facilities of the system throughout the 135 miles of its line in this State.\'  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 421 U.

In affirming the judgment of that court, Mr. Justice Reed, in a plurality opinion, said:"</p>\n<p>"We think that the state is within its constitutional rights in exacting compensation under this statute for the protection it affords the activities within its borders.  Of course, the interstate commerce could not be conducted without these local activities.  But that fact is not conclusive.  These are events apart from the flow of commerce.  This is a tax on activities for which the state, not the United States, gives protection, and the state is entitled to compensation when its tax cannot be said to be an unreasonable burden or a toll on the interstate business."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/80/case.html#96">335 U. S. 96</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is even more compelled in the instant case, since appellant voluntarily qualified under Louisiana law, and therefore enjoys the same rights and privileges as a domestic corporation.  La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 12:306(2) (Supp. 1975). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The Louisiana Supreme Court defined </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 421 U. S. 112</a></p><p> appellant\'s powers and privileges as including</p>\n<p>"the legal status to sue and be sued in the Courts of our State, continuity of business without interruption by death or dissolution, transfer of property interests by the disposition of shares of stock, advantages of business controlled and managed by corporate directors, and the general absence of individual liability. . . ."</p>\n<p>289 So.2d at 100.  These privileges obviously enhance the value to appellant of its activities within Louisiana.  <em>See Southern Gas Corp. v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/148/case.html">301 U. S. 148</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/148/case.html#153">301 U. S. 153</a></span> (1937); <em>Stone v.

The argument is without merit.  <em>Spector</em> held invalid under the Commerce Clause a Connecticut tax based expressly "upon [the corporation\'s] franchise for the privilege of carrying on or doing business within the state. . . ."  Similarly, <em>Railway Express I</em> invalidated Virginia\'s "annual license tax" imposed on express companies expressly "for the privilege of doing business" in the State.  Thus both taxes, as express imposts upon the privilege of carrying on an exclusively interstate business, contained the same fatal constitutional law that led the Louisiana Court of Appeal to strike down the levy against appellant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 421 U.

The tax cannot be said to be imposed upon appellant merely or solely for the privilege of doing interstate business in Louisiana.

Thus, I find it difficult to reconcile <em>Spector Motor Service v. O\'Connor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/602/case.html">340 U.

Stone,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/80/case.html">335 U. S. 80</a></span> (1948).  If, however, the Court\' decisions of the past are consistent -- and if there is consistency between what the Louisiana Legislature and that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 421 U. S. 115</a></p><p> State\'s courts have done in Colonial\'s 1969 case and in the present one -- then, for me, the legal distinctions this Court and the Louisiana courts (under the compulsion of our decisions) have drawn are too fine-spun and far too gossamer.  They fail to provide what taxpayers and the lawyers who advise them have a right to expect, namely, a firm and solid basis of differentiation between that which runs afoul of the Commerce Clause and that which is consistent with that Clause.  It makes little constitutional sense -- and certainly no practical sense -- to say that a State may not impose a fairly apportioned, nondiscriminatory franchise tax with an adequate nexus upon the conduct of business in interstate commerce, but that it may impose that same tax upon the conduct of business in interstate commerce "in a corporate form" or, for that matter, in partnership or individual form.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-31.  Certainly to the lay mind, or to any mind other than the purely legal, these are distinctions with little substantive difference and this is taxation by semantics.</p>\n<p>I therefore feel that the Court should face the issue and make the choice.  I would make that choice in favor of <em>Memphis Gas,</em> as buttressed by the philosophy and holding of <em>Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/450/case.html">358 U.

I would hold that, in this day, when the realities of "Our Federalism" <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/100/case.html">*</a></span> have become apparent, and when the ability of our States and of the Federal Government to coexist have matured, a state franchise tax that does not threaten interstate commerce by being discriminatory, or unfairly apportioned, or devoid of sufficient nexus, passes constitutional muster under the Commerce Clause, and may be imposed in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 421 U.

Yet the Court says that Louisiana can nonetheless impose this franchise tax upon the appellant because it is for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce "in [the] corporate form."<l=>*  Under this reasoning, the State could impose a like franchise tax for the privilege of carrying on an exclusively interstate business "in the partnership form" -- or, for that matter, in the form of an individual proprietorship.  For whatever its form, the exclusively interstate business would still be "owning or using [a] part of its capital, plant or other property in Louisiana," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/100/case.html#109">421 U.

S. 114</a></span>.</l=></p>\n<p>The fact is that Louisiana has imposed a franchise tax upon the appellant for the privilege of carrying on an exclusively interstate business.  Under our established precedents, such a tax is constitutionally impermissible.  <em>Spector Motor Service v.

I could understand if the Court today were forthrightly to overrule these precedents and hold that a state franchise tax upon interstate commerce is constitutionally valid, so long as it is not discriminatory.
