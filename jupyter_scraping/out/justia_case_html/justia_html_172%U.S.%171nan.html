That the County Assessor of Bernalillo County in the year 1895, under the direction of the Board of County Commissioners of said county, placed on the assessment roll an assessment of property against the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company for the year 1893.  A true and correct copy of the assessment roll, showing such assessment so placed thereon, is filed with this as a part hereof, and as Exhibit 1, which said exhibit shows the taxes levied, together with the values and penalties.  That at the time the said assessor, under the instructions of said board, placed upon said assessment roll certain property claimed to be taxable property belonging to said railroad company, which was omitted from taxation for the year 1894.  A true and correct copy of the assessment so made is shown by Exhibit 2, herewith filed and made a part hereof."</p>\n<p>"That the said assessor at the same time placed upon said </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 172 U.

Exhibit 3 also shows the description of the property as returned by the receivers."</p>\n<p>"That all the property so placed upon the assessment roll by the assessor, outside of that returned by the receivers, was placed upon said assessment roll without the knowledge or consent of the receivers, or of said railroad company.  That the entire property placed upon the assessment roll by said assessor, outside of the property returned by the receivers, constituted and constitutes an actual part and portion of the roadbed and railroad track thereon situated on the right of way of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company in Bernalillo County, in the Territory of New Mexico, and constitutes the railroad used and occupied by the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company under its charter and in accordance with the provisions thereof, and the machine shops, station buildings, water tanks, section houses, and other buildings of like character connected with, and a part of, the machinery used in the operation of said railroad.  That each and every item of property described in the assessments so placed upon the said assessment roll, outside of the property returned by the receivers, is property that is actually and permanently attached to the right of way and station grounds of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company, and constitutes an actual part and portion of the superstructure placed upon said right of way by said railroad company for its railroad, and for its machine shops, turntables, sidetracks, switches, water tanks, station buildings, and other buildings of the same class and character, actually used and needed in the operation of said railroad, and that no part of the same was at the time of the placing of said assessment upon said assessment rolls by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="176">Page 172 U. S. 176</a></p><p> assessors, detached from the actual right of way and station grounds of said railroad company, but, on the contrary, was firmly affixed thereto.  That it was described as it was by the assessor in placing the same upon the assessment roll for the purpose of escaping the exemption from taxation contained in the second section of the Act of Congress approved July 27, 1866, known as the \'Charter of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company,\' the assessor desiring to assess everything placed on the right of way separate from the right of way, no matter how permanently attached and affixed to the right of way."</p>\n<p>"That during the year 1893, there were no receivers in possession of said property, and that said railroad was being operated by the railroad company itself, and if any property was omitted to be returned for taxation which ought to have been returned to the Assessor of Bernalillo County, it was the fault and neglect of the railroad company itself, and not the fault and neglect of the receivers afterwards appointed."</p>\n<p>"That at Albuquerque, upon the reservations and station grounds, there were situated the largest machine shops of the said railroad company, the general office building, and such buildings as pertain to the headquarters of a railroad company.  Said buildings and reservation constitute the headquarters of the Western Division of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company, and, since the appointment of receivers, of the receivers operating the same."</p>\n<p>"That the assessor, in placing each of these three assessments upon the assessment rolls as stated, added to the actual value of the property one-fourth of such value as a penalty for the failure on the part of the receiver to return such property for taxation."</p>\n<p>"That in 1893, the railroad company, and in 1894 and 1895 the receivers, omitted all property that was firmly and fixedly attached to the right of way of said railroad company and to station grounds under the honest belief that the same constituted a part of the right of way and was exempt from taxation."</p>\n<p>Subsequently the case came on to be heard, upon the intervening petition of the territory and the answer thereto </p><p><a class="page-number" name="177">Page 172 U. S. 177</a></p><p> of the United States Trust Company and of the receiver,  C. W. Smith, and the agreed statement of facts.  Upon the hearing, the judge of the district court ordered the receiver to pay to the Treasurer of the County of Bernalillo the sum of $43,254.70, the amount ascertained by a special master to be the aggregate of the taxes levied upon the additional assessments and penalties.  An appeal was taken from this order by the United States Trust Company, and also by the receiver, C. W. Smith, who had obtained from the court permission to take such an appeal.  The order appealed from was reversed upon hearing before the supreme court of the territory, the court determining that the additional assessments placed upon the rolls were illegal and void.

An appeal was taken from this order by the United States Trust Company, and also by the receiver, C. W. Smith, who had obtained from the court permission to take such an appeal.  The order appealed from was reversed upon hearing before the supreme court of the territory, the court determining that the additional assessments placed upon the rolls were illegal and void.  An application was made for a rehearing, which the court denied, and an appeal was taken to this Court.</p>\n<p>The sections of the Act of July 27, 1866, with which we are concerned are inserted in the margin; [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] also sections 2807, 2822, 2834, and 2835 of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="180">Page 172 U.

S. 181</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McKENNA, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The right of way is granted to the extent of two hundred feet on each side of the railroad, including necessary grounds for station buildings, workshops, etc.  What, then, is meant by the phrase "the right of way"?  A mere right of passage, says appellant.  <em>Per contra,</em> appellee contends that the fee was granted, or, if not granted, that such a tangible and corporeal property was granted that all that was attached to it became part of it and partook of its exemption from taxation.</p>\n<p>To support its contention, appellant urges the technical meaning of the phrase "right of way," and claims that the primary presumption is that it was used in its technical sense.  Undoubtedly that is the presumption, but such presumption must yield to an opposing context and the intention of the legislature otherwise indicated.  Examining the statute, we find that whatever is granted is exactly measured as a physical thing, not as an abstract right.  It is to be two hundred feet wide, and to be carefully broadened so as to include grounds for the superstructures indispensable to the railroad.</p>\n<p>The phrase "right of way," besides, does not necessarily mean the right of passage merely.  Obviously, it may mean one thing in a grant to a natural person for private purposes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 172 U. S. 182</a></p><p> and another thing in a grant to a railroad for public purposes, as different as the purposes and uses and necessities, respectively, are.</p>\n<p>In <em>Keener v. Union Pacific Railway,</em> 31 F. 128, MR. JUSTICE BREWER defined the words "right of way" as follows:</p>\n<p>"The term \'right of way\' has a two-fold significance.  It sometimes is used to mean the mere intangible right to cross -- a right of crossing, a right of way.  It is often used to otherwise indicate that strip which the railroad company appropriates for its use, and upon which it builds its roadbed."</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice Blatchford said in <em>Joy v. St. Louis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/138/1/case.html#44">138 U. S. 44</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"Now the term \'right of way\' has a two-fold signification.  It is sometimes used to describe a right belonging to a party -- a right of passage over any tract, and it is also used to describe that strip of land which railroad companies take upon which to construct their roadbed."</p>\n<p>That is, the land itself, not a right of passage over it.  So, this Court in <em>Texas Railway Co. v. Roberts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/152/114/case.html">152 U. S. 114</a></span>, passing on a grant to one of the branches of the Union Pacific Railway Company of a right of way two hundred feet wide, decided that it conveyed the fee.  The effect of this decision is attempted to be avoided by saying that the distinction between an easement and the fee was not raised.  The action was ejectment, and was brought in Kansas, and under the law of that state, title could be tried in ejectment.  Title was asserted by Roberts, who was plaintiff in the state court, and this Court evidently considered it involved in the case.  The language of Mr. Justice Field, who delivered the opinion of the Court, would be unaccountable else.  The difference between an easement and the fee would not have escaped his attention and that of the whole Court, with the inevitable result of committing it to the consequences which might depend upon such difference.</p>\n<p>Washburn, in his work on Easements, on page 10, says:  "Whether the thing granted be an easement in land or the land itself may depend upon the nature and use of the thing granted."  To sustain this view, the learned author cites <em>Jamaica Pond Aqueduct Corporation v. Chandler,</em> 9 Allen, 159.  In that case, the court said:</p>\n<p>"Whenever a grant is made of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 172 U. S. 183</a></p><p> right or easement in lands which fall within the class sometimes described as \'noncontinuous\' -- that is, where the use of the premises by the grantee for the purpose designated in the deed will be only intermittent and occasional, and does not embrace the entire beneficial occupation and improvement of the land -- the reasonable interpretation is that an easement in the soil, and not the fee, is intended to be conveyed.  Among the most prominent of this class of easements is a way."</p>\n<p>An ordinary way, of course, the court meant, one the use of which would be noncontinuous -- only intermittent and occasional; but a way not of that character, whose use would be continuous, not occasional, and which would embrace the entire beneficial occupation and improvement of the land, might require the fee for its enjoyment -- certainly would require more than a mere right of passage.  "Unlike the use of a private way -- that is, discontinuous -- the use of land condemned by a railroad company is perpetual and continuous."  <em>New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Railroad v. Trimmer,</em> 53 N.J.L. 1, 3.</p>\n<p>But if it may not be insisted that the fee was granted, surely more than an ordinary easement was granted -- one having the attributes of the fee, perpetuity and exclusive use and possession; also the remedies of the fee, and, like it, corporeal, not incorporeal, property.</p>\n<p><em>In Smith v. Hall,</em> 72 N.W. 427, the Supreme Court of Iowa says, speaking of the right of way of a railroad:</p>\n<p>"The easement is not that spoken of in the old law books, but is peculiar to the use of a railroad, which is usually a permanent improvement -- a perpetual highway of travel and commerce -- and will rarely be abandoned by nonuser.  The exclusive use of the surface is acquired, the damages are assessed, on the theory that the easements will be perpetual, so that ordinarily the fee is of little or no value unless the land is underlaid by a quarry or mine."</p>\n<p>"The right acquired by the railroad company, though technically an easement, yet requires for its enjoyment a use of the land permanent in its nature and practically exclusive."</p>\n<p><em>Hazen v. Boston &amp; Maine Railroad,</em> 2 Gray 574, 580. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 172 U. S. 184</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Southern Pacific v. Burr,</em> 86 Cal. 279, the Supreme Court of California sustained an action of ejectment for land constituting a part of the right of way granted to the Central Pacific Railroad by the Act of July 1, 1862, by language similar to the grant in the case at bar.</p>\n<p>Distinguishing the case from <em>Wood v. Truckee Turnpike Co.,</em> 24 Cal. 474, in which it was held that "a road or right of way is an incorporeal hereditament, and ejectment is maintainable only for corporeal hereditaments," the court said:</p>\n<p>"We think that case plainly distinguishable from this.  Here there was a special grant of a right of way two hundred feet in width on each side of the road.  This grant is a conclusive determination of the reasonable and necessary quantity of land to be dedicated to the public use, and it necessarily involves a right of possession in the grantee, and is inconsistent with any adverse possession of any part of the land embraced within the grant.  It is true the strip of land now actually occupied by the roadbed and telegraph line may be only a small part of the four hundred feet granted, but this fact is of no consequence.  The company may at some time want to use more land for side tracks or other purposes, and it is entitled to have the land clear and unobstructed whenever it shall have occasion to do so."</p>\n<p>The court quoted and approved the views expressed in <em>Winona v. Huff,</em> 11 Minn. 119, that</p>\n<p>"for a mere easement, perhaps an action of ejectment would not lie, but wherever a right of entry exists, and the interest is tangible, so that possession can be delivered, an action of ejectment will lie."</p>\n<p>The same distinction was made in <em>New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Railroad v. Trimmer, supra,</em> and the court said that if the interest of the railroad company was a naked right of way, it would constitute no such right of possession of the land itself as would sustain the action, for such a right would be an incorporeal one, upon which there could be no entry, nor could possession of it be given under an <em>habere facias possessionem.</em>  In this case, it was held that the interest taken by the railroad was not an easement.</p>\n<p>The interest granted by the statute to the Atlantic and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 172 U. S. 185</a></p><p> Pacific Railroad Company therefore is real estate of corporeal quality, and the principles of such apply.  One of these, and an elemental one, is that whatever is erected upon it becomes part of it.  There are exceptions to the principle, but, as we are not concerned with them, we need not state them.  Applications of the principle to railroads are illustrated by the decisions of this Court and by those of other courts:  as to rails put down against him from whom purchased, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/459/case.html">Galveston Railroad v. Cowdry,</a></span></em> 11 Wall. 459; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/79/362/case.html">United States v. New Orleans Railroad,</a></span></em> 12 Wall. 362; <em>Thompson v. White Water Railroad,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/132/68/case.html">132 U. S. 68</a></span>, even though the contract of purchase provided that the property should remain that of the vendor and he have a right to remove the same, <em>Porter v. Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/122/267/case.html">122 U. S. 267</a></span>, and cases cited; in determining the relation of the rails to the right of way. <em>Joy v. St. Louis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/138/1/case.html">138 U. S. 1</a></span>.  In this case, Mr. Justice Blatchford said:</p>\n<p>"The track cannot be separated from the right of way, the right of way being the principal thing, and the track merely an incident.  A right of way is of no particular use to a railroad without a superstructure and rails; the track is a necessary incident to the enjoyment of the right of way."</p>\n<p><em>See also Palmer v. Forbes,</em> 23 Ill. 300; <em>Hunt v. Bay State Iron Co.,</em> 97 Mass. 279; <em>New Haven v. Fair Haven &amp; Westville Railroad,</em> 38 Conn. 422.</p>\n<p>The principle has also illustrations in cases of taxation.  <em>People v. Cassity,</em> 46 N.Y. 46; <em>Appeal Tax Court of Baltimore v. Baltimore Cemetery Co.,</em> 50 Md. 432; <em>Osborne v. Humphrey,</em> 7 Conn. 335; <em>Parker v. Redfield,</em> 10 Conn. 490; <em>Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Co. v. Northampton County,</em> 8 W. &amp; S. 334; <em>Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway v.

Western Railroad Corporation,</em> 4 Met. 564.</p>\n<p>It is urged, however, that the rule of construction declared in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/665/case.html">Vicksburg, Shreveport &amp; Pacific Railroad v. Dennis,</a></span></em> 116 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="186">Page 172 U. S. 186</a></p><p> U.S. 665, and the cases there cited and approved, and repeated in <em>Railroad Co. v.
