To this writ, return was made on the 23d day of March, 1882, setting forth the reasons relied on by respondents as justifying their refusal to make the levy required.

No preliminary injunction was granted, and the cause was finally heard on bill and answer at the September term, 1888, when the bill was dismissed and a decree rendered against the county for costs.

CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Appellant\'s counsel contends that the appeal taken and perfected from the decree dismissing his client\'s bill of complaint operated, or should be made to operate, to supersede the judgment in collection of which the peremptory writ of mandamus was awarded.  That judgment was recovered on the 28th day of March, 1881, and no proceedings in error have ever been taken, and no bond given to supersede its operation.  An alternative writ of mandamus was sued out, the cause shown by the county court and its judges against granting the peremptory writ was disposed of by this Court on writ of error, and the peremptory writ was directed to be issued.  The County of Knox then filed its bill in equity to restrain the collection of the judgment as commanded.  No preliminary injunction was granted, and upon final hearing, the bill was dismissed and a decree passed against the county for costs.</p>\n<p>The general rule is well settled that an appeal from a decree granting, refusing, or dissolving an injunction does not disturb its operative effect.  <em>Hovey v.
