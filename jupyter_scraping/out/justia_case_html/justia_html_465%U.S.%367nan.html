Regan, the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.  The State seeks an injunction and other relief, on the ground that \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) (1982 ed.), as added by \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Pub.L. 97-248, 96 Stat. 596, is constitutionally invalid as violative of the Tenth Amendment and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.</p>\n<p>The Secretary objects to the motion on the ground that the Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7421(a), bars this action [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and, alternatively, that the Court should exercise its discretion to deny leave to file.  We are not persuaded that either is a ground for denying the motion, and therefore grant the motion for leave to file the complaint.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 103(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) exempts from a taxpayer\'s gross income the interest earned on the obligations of any State. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In 1982, however, as part of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="371">Page 465 U. S. 371</a></p><p> TEFRA, Congress amended \xc2\xa7 103 to restrict the types of bonds that qualify for the tax exemption granted by that section.  Specifically, \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) of TEFRA added a new provision, \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1), to the Code.  Section 103(j)(1) requires that certain obligations, termed "registration-required obligation[s]," be issued in registered, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] rather than bearer, form to qualify for the \xc2\xa7 103(a) exemption. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  For purposes of \xc2\xa7 103 (j)(1), registration-required obligations are defined broadly to include most publicly issued obligations with maturities greater than one year. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  If an obligation that is registration-required is issued in bearer, rather than registered, form, then \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) provides that the interest on that obligation is taxable.</p>\n<p>Because the imposition of a tax on bearer bonds would require a State to pay its bondholders a higher rate of interest on such bonds, South Carolina argues that the practical effect of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) is to require it to issue its obligations in registered form.  For that reason, South Carolina argues that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="372">Page 465 U. S. 372</a></p><p> section destroys its freedom to issue obligations in the form that it chooses.  Viewing its borrowing power as essential to the maintenance of its separate and independent existence, South Carolina contends that the condition imposed by \xc2\xa7 103 (j)(1) on the exercise of that power violates the Tenth Amendment.  In addition, relying on <em>Pollock v. Farmers\' Loan &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/157/429/case.html">157 U. S. 429</a></span> (1895), South Carolina argues that Congress may not tax the interest earned on the obligations of a State.  Because \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) imposes a tax on the interest earned on state obligations issued in bearer form, the State argues that the section is unconstitutional.  Accordingly, South Carolina asks that its motion to file the complaint be granted and that this Court award declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Secretary does not address the merits of the State\'s constitutional claims.  Rather, he argues that we may not grant the motion to file because this action is barred by the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Act provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<p>"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]"</p>\n<p>Characterizing this action as a suit to "restrai[n] the assessment or collection of" a tax, the Secretary contends that this suit is barred by the statute.  The Secretary argues that <em>Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/1/case.html">370 U. S. 1</a></span> (1962), establishes the single judicially created exception to the Act and that this action does not fall within that exception.  We need not address </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 465 U. S. 373</a></p><p> whether this case falls within the <em>Williams Packing</em> exception, for we hold that the Act was not intended to bar an action where, as here, Congress has not provided the plaintiff with an alternative legal way to challenge the validity of a tax. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>When enacted in 1867, the forerunner of the current Anti-Injunction Act provided that "no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of tax shall be maintained in any court."  Act of Mar. 2, 1867, \xc2\xa7 10, 14 Stat. 475. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Although the Act apparently has no recorded legislative history, <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html">416 U. S. 725</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#736">416 U. S. 736</a></span> (1974), the circumstances of its enactment strongly suggest that Congress intended the Act to bar a suit only in situations in which Congress had provided the aggrieved party with an alternative legal avenue by which to contest the legality of a particular tax.</p>\n<p>The Act originated as an amendment to a statute that provided that</p>\n<p>"[n]o suit shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, until appeal shall have been duly made to the commissioner of internal revenue . . . and a decision of said commissioner shall be had thereon, unless such suit shall be brought within six months from the time of said decision. . . ."</p>\n<p>Internal Revenue Act of July 13, 1866, \xc2\xa7 19, 14 Stat. 152.  The Anti-Injunction Act amended this statute by adding the prohibition against injunctions.  Act of Mar. 2, 1867, \xc2\xa7 10, 14 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="374">Page 465 U. S. 374</a></p><p> Stat. 475.  The Act, therefore, prohibited injunctions in the context of a statutory scheme that provided an alternative remedy.  As we explained in <em>Snyder v. Marks,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/109/189/case.html">109 U. S. 189</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/109/189/case.html#193">109 U. S. 193</a></span> (1883), "[t]he remedy of a suit to recover back the tax after it is paid is provided by statute, and a suit to restrain its collection is forbidden."  This is cogent evidence that the 1867 amendment was merely intended to require taxpayers to litigate their claims in a designated proceeding.</p>\n<p>The Secretary argues that, regardless of whether other remedies are available, a plaintiff may only sue to restrain the collection of taxes if it satisfies the narrow exception to the Act enunciated in <em>Williams Packing, supra.</em> <em>Williams Packing</em> did not, however, ever address, let alone decide, the question whether the Act applies when Congress has provided no alternative remedy.  Indeed, as we shall see, a careful reading of <em>Williams Packing</em> and its progeny supports our conclusion that the Act was not intended to apply in the absence of such a remedy.</p>\n<p><em>Williams Packing</em> was a taxpayer\'s suit to enjoin the District Director of the Internal Revenue Service from collecting allegedly past-due social security and unemployment taxes.  The Court concluded that the Anti-Injunction Act would not apply if the taxpayer (1) was certain to succeed on the merits, and (2) could demonstrate that collection would cause him irreparable harm.  370 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/1/case.html#6">370 U. S. 6</a></span>-7.  Finding that the first condition had not been met, the Court concluded that the Act barred the suit.  Significantly, however, Congress had provided the plaintiff in <em>Williams Packing</em> with the alternative remedy of a suit for a refund.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/1/case.html#7">370 U. S. 7</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In each of this Court\'s subsequent cases that have applied the <em>Williams Packing</em> rule, the plaintiff had the option of paying the tax and bringing a suit for a refund.  Moreover, these cases make clear that the Court in <em>Williams Packing</em> and its progeny did not intend to decide whether the Act would apply to an aggrieved party who could not bring a suit for a refund. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 465 U. S. 375</a></p><p></p>\n<p>For example, in <em>Bob Jones, supra,</em> the taxpayer sought to prevent the Service from revoking its tax-exempt status under IRC \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3).  Because the suit would have restrained the collection of income taxes from the taxpayer and its contributors, as well as the collection of federal social security and unemployment taxes from the taxpayer, the Court concluded that the suit was an action to restrain "the assessment or collection of any tax" within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction Act.  416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#728">416 U. S. 738</a></span>-739.  Applying the <em>Williams Packing</em> test, the Court found that the Act barred the suit because the taxpayer failed to demonstrate that it was certain to succeed on the merits.  416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#749">416 U. S. 749</a></span>.  In rejecting the taxpayer\'s challenge to the Act on due process grounds, however, the Court relied on the availability of a refund suit, noting that "our conclusion might well be different" if the aggrieved party had no access to judicial review.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#746">416 U. S. 746</a></span>.  Similarly, the Court left open the question whether the Due Process Clause would be satisfied if an organization had to rely on a "friendly donor" to obtain judicial review of the Service\'s revocation of its tax exemption.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#747">416 U. S. 747</a></span>, n. 21. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, in <em>Alexander v. "Americans United" Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/752/case.html">416 U. S. 752</a></span> (1974), decided the same day as <em>Bob Jones,</em> the Court considered a taxpayer\'s action to require the Service to reinstate its tax-exempt status. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The Court applied the <em>Williams Packing</em> test and held that the action was barred </p><p><a class="page-number" name="376">Page 465 U. S. 376</a></p><p> by the Act.  Finally, in <em>United States v. American Friends Service Committee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/7/case.html">419 U. S. 7</a></span> (1974) (per curiam), the taxpayers sought to enjoin the Government from requiring that a portion of their wages be withheld.  The taxpayers argued that the withholding provisions violated their First Amendment right to bear witness to their religious beliefs.  The Court again applied the <em>Williams Packing</em> rule, and found that the suit was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act.  In both of these cases, the taxpayers argued that the <em>Williams Packing</em> test was irrelevant and the Act inapplicable because they did not have adequate alternative remedies.  In rejecting this argument, the Court expressly relied on the availability of refund suits.  416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/752/case.html#761">416 U. S. 761</a></span>; 419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/7/case.html#11">419 U. S. 11</a></span>.  This emphasis on alternative remedies would have been irrelevant had the Court meant to decide that the Act applied in the absence of such remedies.  We therefore turn to that question.</p>\n<p>The analysis in <em>Williams Packing</em> and its progeny of the purposes of the Act provides significant support for our holding today.  <em>Williams Packing</em> expressly stated that the Act was intended to protect tax revenues from judicial interference "<em>and to require that the legal right to the disputed sums be determined in a suit for refund.</em>"  370 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/1/case.html#7">370 U. S. 7</a></span> (emphasis added).  Similarly, the Court concluded that the Act was also designed as "protection of the collector from litigation <em>pending a suit for refund,</em>" <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/1/case.html#7">370 U. S. 7</a></span>-8 (emphasis added).  The Court\'s concerns with protecting the expeditious collection of revenue and protecting the collector from litigation were expressed in the context of a procedure that afforded the taxpayer the remedy of a refund suit. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor is our conclusion inconsistent with the 1966 amendment to the Anti-Injunction Act.  In 1966, in \xc2\xa7 110(c) of the Federal Tax Lien Act, Pub.L. 89-719, 80 Stat. 1144, Congress amended the Anti-Injunction Act to read, in pertinent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="377">Page 465 U. S. 377</a></p><p> part, that</p>\n<p>"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The central focus of the added phrase, "by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed," was on third parties whose property rights competed with federal tax liens.  <em>Bob Jones,</em> 416 U.S. at 732, n. 6.  Prior to the adoption of the Tax Lien Act, such parties were often unable to protect their property interests.  <em>Ibid.;</em> H.R.Rep. No. 1884, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 27-28 (1966). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Section 110(a) of the Tax Lien Act gave such third parties a right of action against the United States. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The amendment to the Anti-Injunction Act was primarily designed to insure that the right of action granted by \xc2\xa7 110(a) of the Federal Tax Lien Act was exclusive.  416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#732">416 U. S. 732</a></span>, n. 6.  The language added to the Anti-Injunction Act by the 1966 amendment is, therefore, largely irrelevant to the issue before us today. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 465 U. S. 378</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In sum, the Anti-Injunction Act\'s purpose and the circumstances of its enactment indicate that Congress did not intend the Act to apply to actions brought by aggrieved parties for whom it has not provided an alternative remedy. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  In this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 465 U. S. 379</a></p><p> case, if the plaintiff South Carolina issues bearer bonds, its bondholders will, by virtue of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1), be liable for the tax on the interest earned on those bonds. South Carolina will </p><p><a class="page-number" name="380">Page 465 U. S. 380</a></p><p> incur no tax liability.  Under these circumstances, the State will be unable to utilize any statutory procedure to contest the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1).  Accordingly, the Act cannot bar this action.</p>\n<p>The Secretary suggests that the State may obtain judicial review of its claims by issuing bearer bonds and urging a purchaser of those bonds to bring a suit contesting the legality of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1).  But the nature of this proposed remedy only buttresses our conclusion that the Act was not intended to apply to this kind of action.  First, instances in which a third party may raise the constitutional rights of another are the exception, rather than the rule.  <em>Singleton v. Wulff,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/106/case.html">428 U. S. 106</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/106/case.html#114">428 U. S. 114</a></span> (1976).  More important, to make use of this remedy, the State</p>\n<p>"must first be able to find [an individual] willing to subject himself to the rigors of litigation against the Service, and then must rely on [him] to present the relevant arguments on [its] behalf."</p>\n<p><em>Bob Jones,</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#747">416 U. S. 747</a></span>, n. 21.  Because it is by no means certain that the State would be able to convince a taxpayer to raise its claims, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] reliance on the remedy suggested by the Secretary would create </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 465 U. S. 381</a></p><p> the risk that the Anti-Injunction Act would entirely deprive the State of any opportunity to obtain review of its claims.  For these reasons, we should not lightly attribute to Congress an intent to require plaintiff to find a third party to contest its claims.  Here, the indicia of congressional intent -- the Act\'s purposes and the circumstances of its enactment -- demonstrate that Congress did not intend the Act to apply where an aggrieved party would be required to depend on the mere possibility of persuading a third party to assert his claims.  Rather, the Act was intended to apply only when Congress has provided an alternative avenue for an aggrieved party to litigate its claims on its own behalf. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Because Congress did not prescribe an alternative remedy for the plaintiff in this case, the Act does not bar this suit.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Secretary argues that, if we conclude that the Anti-Injunction Act is not a bar to this suit, we should in any event exercise our discretion to deny leave to file.  He notes that the Court\'s jurisdiction over this suit is not exclusive, and that the Court exercises its</p>\n<p>"original jurisdiction sparingly and [is] particularly reluctant to take jurisdiction of a suit where the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 465 U.

Unquestionably, the manner in which a State may exercise its borrowing power is a question that is of vital importance to all 50 States.

Like JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, I have reservations about the breadth of the approach taken by JUSTICE BRENNAN in determining that Congress did not intend the Act to apply in any case in which the aggrieved party has no alternative avenue by which to contest the legality of a particular tax.</p>\n<p>In <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html">416 U. S. 725</a></span> (1974), the Court stressed the broad sweep of the Anti-Injunction Act.  The Court noted that the language added in 1966, prohibiting any suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax "by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed," <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7 110(c) of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 465 U. S. 383</a></p><p> Pub.L. 89-719, 80 Stat. 1144, was intended as a "reaffirmation of the plain meaning" of the Act as it had stood since 1867.  <em>See</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#731">416 U.

The Court in <em>Bob Jones</em> rejected the petitioner\'s efforts to rely on exceptions to the reach of the Act suggested in the 1930\'s for situations in which there is no adequate remedy short of a suit to enjoin the challenged tax.  <em>See</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#744">416 U. S. 744</a></span>.  Because it concluded that the plaintiffs in <em>Bob Jones</em> and <em>"Americans United"</em> had access to judicial forums in which to challenge the alleged deprivations of their property, the Court did not need to decide whether and under what circumstances its broad reading of the Anti-Injunction Act might deny an aggrieved party due process of law.  416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#746">416 U. S. 746</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Unlike JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, I see no need to decide whether Congress intended the Anti-Injunction Act to apply to suits invoking this Court\'s original jurisdiction.  I would decide this case on the narrower ground set forth in my dissenting opinion in <em>"Americans United,"</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/752/case.html#763">416 U. S. 763</a></span>.  I there expressed concern that the Court was overlooking a necessary first step in applying the Anti-Injunction Act, that is, the determination whether the litigation is a "<em>suit for the purpose of restraining\'" any tax.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/752/case.html#767">416 U. S. 767</a></span>, quoting 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7421(a).  Here, as in <em>"Americans United,"</em> there can be no serious argument that the disposition of South Carolina\'s claim will have much effect, if any at all, upon federal tax revenues.  If South Carolina loses, it will register its securities. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/367/case.html">*</a></span>  If it wins, it will continue to issue unregistered </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 465 U. S. 384</a></em></p><p><em> securities.  In either event, the Federal Government will receive no more tax revenues from purchasers of such securities than it has enjoyed since <em>Pollock v. Farmers\' Loan &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/157/429/case.html">157 U. S. 429</a></span>, was decided in 1895.\n</em></p>\n<p>The acknowledged purpose of Congress in enacting \xc2\xa7 310 (b)(1) of TEFRA in 1982 so as to add a new \xc2\xa7 103(j) to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was to encourage the States to issue securities in registered form.  <em>See</em> Staff of Joint Committee on Taxation, General Explanation of the Revenue Provisions of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., 190 (Comm. Print 1982).  In a case such as this, where it is evident that the challenged governmental action is one to "accomplish a broad-based policy objective," rather than to produce revenue, <em>see "Americans United,"</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/752/case.html#771">416 U. S. 771</a></span> (dissenting opinion), and the disposition of the challenge will have no effect on federal revenues, I conclude that the suit is not one "for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax," within the words of \xc2\xa7 7421(a).</p>\n<p>Although I would not hold the Anti-Injunction Act to be a bar to South Carolina\'s ability to bring this suit in another court, I agree that we should hear this case.  Exercise of our original jurisdiction is discretionary and, though the Court has exercised it sparingly, we are not prohibited from doing so by the fact that the original party may have an alternative forum.  <em>See Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/439/case.html">324 U. S. 439</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/439/case.html#465">324 U. S. 465</a></span> (1945).  The issue presented is a substantial one, and is of concern to a number of States.  I am satisfied that prompt resolution of the issue here will benefit all concerned, and that the decision to grant leave to file is a proper exercise of our discretion.</p>\n<p>According to the affidavit of the Treasurer of South Carolina, the issuance of registered bonds will increase South Carolina\'s interest costs by 0.25%. If the State were to continue to issue unregistered bonds, in the face of a ruling that \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) is valid, it estimates that it would have to pay between 3% and 5% more interest on its bonds to render them marketable. Counsel for South Carolina acknowledged at oral argument that since the effective date of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) the State has issued fully registered bonds. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The motion of South Carolina for leave to file a complaint in our original jurisdiction raises three questions.  First, the Court must decide whether Congress intended, by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 465 U. S. 385</a></p><p> Tax Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7421(a), to bar nontaxpayers like the State of South Carolina from challenging the validity of federal tax statutes in the courts.  Second, if the Act generally does bar such nontaxpayer suits, the Court must decide whether Congress intended, and if so whether the Constitution permits it, to bar us from considering South Carolina\'s complaint in our original jurisdiction.  Third, if Congress either did not intend, or constitutionally is not permitted, to withdraw this case from our original jurisdiction, the Court must decide whether South Carolina\'s challenge to the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) (1982 ed.), as added by \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Pub.L. 97-248, 96 Stat. 596, raises issues appropriate for original adjudication.</p>\n<p>In answering the first question, the Court reaches the unwarranted conclusion that the Tax Anti-Injunction Act proscribes only those suits in which the complaining party, usually a taxpayer, can challenge the validity of a taxing measure in an alternative forum.  The Court holds that suits by nontaxpayers generally are not barred.  In my opinion, the Court\'s interpretation fundamentally misconstrues the congressional anti-injunction policy.  Accordingly, I cannot join its opinion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Tax Anti-Injunction Act provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<p>"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed."</p>\n<p>26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7421(a).  The Act\'s language "could scarcely be more explicit" in prohibiting nontaxpayer suits like this one, <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html">416 U. S. 725</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#736">416 U.

S. 386</a></p><p> attempt to enjoin the collection of his own taxes, . . ." but also "a suit to enjoin the assessment or collection of anyon[e] [else\'s] taxes. . . ."  <em>Alexander v.

Though the Internal Revenue Code (Code) contains a few exceptions to this nearly complete ban, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] for the most part, Congress has restricted the judicial role to resolution of concrete disputes over specific sums of money, either by way of a deficiency proceeding in the Tax Court, <em>see</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6212, 6213, or by way of a taxpayer\'s suit for refund, <em>see</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6532, 7422.</p>\n<p>In depriving courts of jurisdiction to resolve abstract tax controversies, Congress has determined that the United States must be able "to assess and collect taxes alleged to be due without judicial intervention. . . ."  <em>Enochs v.

The Act\'s proscription literally extends to nontaxpayer as well as taxpayer suits, if only to prevent taxpayers from sidestepping the anti-injunction policy by bringing suit through nontaxpaying associations of taxpayers. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="387">Page 465 U.

The tax collector is an attractive target for all kinds of litigation, <em>see, e.g., Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html">426 U.

First enacted in 1867, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] it apparently was designed to protect the federal tax system from being inundated with the same type of injunctive suits that were then sweeping over the state tax systems.  <em>See State Railroad Tax Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/575/case.html">92 U.

S. 613</a></span>.  The experience in the States demonstrated the grave dangers which accompany intrusion of the injunctive power of the courts into the administration of the revenue:</p>\n<p>"If there existed in the courts . . . any general power of impeding or controlling the collection of taxes, or relieving the hardship incident to taxation, the very existence of the government might be placed in the power of a hostile judiciary."</p>\n<p><em>Cheatham v.

S. 89</a></span> (1876).  To avoid these evils and to safeguard the federal tax system, the 39th Congress committed administration of the Code to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>This broad anti-injunction ban remained essentially untouched for almost a century. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In 1966, however, Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 465 U.

"Americans United" Inc.,</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/752/case.html#760">416 U. S. 760</a></span>, and n. 11.  In \xc2\xa7 110(c) of the Federal Tax Lien Act, Pub.L. 89-719, 80 Stat. 1144, Congress amended the Act to emphasize that no injunctive action "<em>by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed</em>" could be maintained in the courts.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  The Treasury Department proposed the 1966 amendment, and its principal spokesperson, Assistant Secretary Surrey, testified:</p>\n<p>"Subsection (c) of section 110 of the bill amends section 7421(a) of the code.  That section presently prohibits injunctions against the assessment or collection of tax.  The cases decided under this provision raise a question as to whether this prohibition applies against actions by persons other than the taxpayer.  New section 7426 will specifically allow actions by third parties to enjoin the enforcement of a levy or sale of property.  The amendment to section 7421 makes clear that third parties may bring injunction suits only under the circumstances provided in new section 7426(b)(1) of the code."</p>\n<p>Statement by the Hon. Stanley S. Surrey, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, reprinted in Hearings on H.R. 11256 and H.R. 11290, before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 58 (1966).  The House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance apparently shared Mr. Surrey\'s understanding of the rights of nontaxpayers under prior law, for their Reports both state:</p>\n<p>"Under present law, . . . the United States cannot be sued by third persons where its collection activities interfere with their property rights.  This includes cases where the Government wrongfully levies on one person\'s property in attempting to collect from a taxpayer.  However, some courts allow suits to be brought against </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 465 U. S. 390</a></p><p> district directors of Internal Revenue where this occurs."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 1884, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 27 (1966); S.Rep. No. 1708, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 29 (1966).  To accommodate these conflicting rights, both Committees recommended that Congress enact \xc2\xa7 7426, allowing "persons other than taxpayers" to bring suits against the United States to protect preexisting liens on property levied upon by the Treasury, and amend \xc2\xa7 7421(a) to forbid suits by all third persons, excepting those within the ambit of new \xc2\xa7 7426.  Congress followed the Committees\' recommendations, on the understanding that the new language in \xc2\xa7 7421(a) was "declaratory, not innovative."  <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon,</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/case.html#731">416 U. S. 731</a></span>-732, n. 6. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Congress has since relaxed the statutory proscription against third-party suits on several occasions.  For example, in 1974, it provided that certain designated persons could obtain declaratory judgments in the Tax Court with respect to the tax status of pension plans.  <em>See</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7476.  Similarly, in 1976, because "[u]nder [prevailing] law, no court review of [Internal Revenue Service] ruling[s] [was] available," H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 94-1515, p. 463 (1976), Congress provided declaratory judgment procedures for determining the tax status of charitable organizations and of certain property transfers.  <em>See</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7428, 7477; <em>see also</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 94-1515, <em>supra,</em> at 523-524 ("Under present </p><p><a class="page-number" name="391">Page 465 U. S. 391</a></p><p> law, the Tax Court can hear declaratory judgment suits only on the tax status of employee retirement plans.  In no other case may an individual or an organization seek a declaratory judgment as to an organization\'s tax-exempt status").  Finally, in 1978, in 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7478 (1982 ed.), Congress provided a mechanism whereby state or local governments could seek declaratory judgments as to the tax status of proposed municipal bond issuances. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  The relevant Senate Report noted:</p>\n<p>"As a practical matter, there is no effective appeal from a Service private letter ruling (or failure to issue a private letter ruling) that a proposed issue of municipal bonds is taxable.  In those cases, although there may be a real controversy between a State or local government and the Service, present law does not allow the State or local government to go to court.  The controversy can be resolved only if the bonds are issued, a bondholder excludes interest on the bonds from income, the exclusion is disallowed, and the Service asserts a deficiency in its statutory notice of deficiency.  This uncertainty, coupled with the threat of the ultimate loss of the exclusion, invariably makes it impossible to market the bonds.  In addition, it is impossible for a State or local government to question the Service rulings and regulations directly."</p>\n<p>"[S]tate and local government[s] should have a right to court adjudication in the situation described above.  The bill deals with the problem by providing . . . for a declaratory judgment as to the tax status of a proposed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="392">Page 465 U. S. 392</a></p><p> issue of municipal bonds."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 95-1263, pp. 150-151 (1978).  The Conference Report reflects a similar view of prevailing law.  <em>See</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1800, p. 240 (1978).  Thus, in 1974, 1976, and again in 1978, Congress expressed its belief that the Tax Anti-Injunction Act generally bars nontaxpayers from bringing the kind of injunctive action the State of South Carolina asks leave to file today. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>These subsequently enacted provisions and the legislative understanding of them are entitled to "great weight" in construing earlier, related legislation.  <em>See, e.g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.

Combined with the legislative purposes obviously motivating the 39th and 89th Congresses, these provisions conclusively demonstrate that, absent express exemption, the Act generally precludes judicial resolution of all abstract tax controversies, even if the complaining parties would have no other forum in which to bring their challenges.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court drew these same conclusions in <em>Bob Jones University v.

But the Court\'s reference to "a case in which an aggrieved party has no access at all to judicial review" came in the context of its discussion of the taxpayer\'s claim that postponement of its challenge to the revocation of its tax-exempt status would violate due process.  <em>Bob Jones University\'s</em> dictum, therefore, should be interpreted only as reflecting the established rule that Congress cannot, consistently with due process, deny a taxpayer with property rights at stake all opportunity for an ultimate judicial determination of the legality of a tax assessment against him.  <em>See Phillips v.

S. 394</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On this reading, <em>Bob Jones Uriversity\'s</em> recognition that the complete inaccessability of judicial review might implicate due process concerns provides absolutely no basis for crafting an exception in this case.  The State of South Carolina is not a "person" within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.  <em>See South Carolina v. Katzenbach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/case.html">383 U.

Nor does the State assert a right cognizable as a "property" interest protected by that Clause.  <em>See generally Logan v.

Therefore, it has no due process right to review of its claim in a judicial forum. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>In holding that the Act does not bar suits by nontaxpayers with no other remedies, the Court today has created a "breach in the general scheme of taxation [that] gives an opening for the disorganization of the whole plan. . . ."  <em>Allen v.

Nontaxpaying associations of taxpayers, and most other nontaxpayers, will now be allowed to sidestep Congress\' policy against judicial resolution of abstract tax controversies.

I simply cannot join such a fundamental undermining of the congressional purpose.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Act\'s language, purpose, and history should leave no doubt that Congress intended to preclude both taxpayer and nontaxpayer suits, regardless of the availability of an alternative forum.  The Solicitor General agrees and contends that, since the anti-injunction prohibition extends to "any court," it should be read to bar this Court from acting in its original jurisdiction as well.  The Solicitor General\'s contention raises a grave constitutional question:  namely, whether Congress constitutionally can impose remedial limitations so jurisdictional in nature that they effectively withdraw the original jurisdiction of this Court.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Under the language used in Art. III of the Constitution, Congress relates to the courts of the United States in three textually different ways. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  In its broadest textual delegation, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="396">Page 465 U. S. 396</a></p><p> that Article authorizes Congress to establish the "inferior Courts" and places no express limits on the congressional power to regulate the courts so created.  <em>See</em> U.S.Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa7 1, cl. 1.  By contrast, that Article itself creates the Supreme Court and textually differentiates between Congress\' relationship with the appellate and original jurisdictions of that Court.  Article III expressly empowers Congress to make "Exceptions" and "Regulations" to the appellate jurisdiction.  U.S.Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/506/case.html">Ex parte McCardle,</a></span></em> 7 Wall. 506 (1869) (dismissing for want of appellate jurisdiction).  But, in what is effectively its narrowest delegation, Art. III is silent regarding Congress\' authority to make exceptions to or regulations regarding cases in the original jurisdiction -- those that affect "Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Though the original history of Art. III is sparse, [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] what is available indicates that these textual differences were purposeful on the Framers\' part.  The Framers obviously thought that the National Government should have a judicial system of its own, and that that system should have a Supreme Court.  However, because the Framers believed the state courts would be adequate for resolving most disputes, they generally left Congress the power of determining what cases, if any, should be channelled to the federal courts.  The one textual exception to that rule concerned the original jurisdiction, where the Framers apparently mandated that Supreme Court review be available.</p>\n<p>"The evident purpose </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 465 U. S. 397</a></p><p> was to open and keep open the highest court of the nation for the determination, in the first instance, of suits involving a State or a diplomatic or commercial representative of a foreign government."</p>\n<p><em>Ames v.

Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton).  Perhaps more importantly, the Framers also thought that the original jurisdiction was a necessary substitute for the powers of war and diplomacy that these sovereigns previously had relied upon.  <em>See Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/439/case.html">324 U.

Rather, it merely prohibits "any court" from "maintain[ing]" a suit that has "the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection" of federal taxes.  <em>See</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7421(a).  The effect of this prohibition, however, is to preclude this Court ever from assuming original jurisdiction to adjudicate a State <em>qua</em> State\'s Tenth and Sixteenth Amendment tax claims, in apparent derogation of the grant\'s constitutional purpose. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  While</p>\n<p>"Congress has broad powers over the jurisdiction of the federal courts and over the sovereign immunity of the United States[,] it is extremely doubtful that they include the power to limit in this manner the original jurisdiction conferred upon this Court by the Constitution."</p>\n<p><em>California v.

S. 399</a></p><p> avoided."</p>\n<p><em>Crowell v. Benson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html">285 U.

Such a construction is possible in this case.</p>\n<p>The manifest purpose of the Tax Anti-Injunction Act is simply to permit the United States to assess and collect taxes without undue judicial interference, and to require that legal challenges be raised in certain designated forums.  The language and history of the Act evidence a congressional desire generally to bar both taxpayer and nontaxpayer suits, since both can substantially interrupt "the process of collecting the taxes on which the government depends for its continued existence" if left uncontrolled.  <em>State Railroad Tax Cases,</em> 92 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/575/case.html#613">92 U. S. 613</a></span>.  Similarly, the language and history evidence a congressional desire to prohibit courts from restraining any aspect of the tax laws\' administration, since the prohibition against injunctions should not depend upon the alleged legality or character of a particular assessment.  <em>See Snyder v. Marks,</em> 109 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/109/189/case.html#192">109 U. S. 192</a></span>-194.  Yet the statute was enacted against a settled history in which foreign and state sovereigns had a unique right to seek refuge in the original jurisdiction of this Court.  Nothing in the legislative history of the Act of 1867, of the later amendments, or of the related declaratory judgment provisions enacted in 1974, 1976, or 1978, mentions any intent to alter these sovereign parties\' unique right occasionally to seek injunctive relief by original action in this Court, even with regard to tax matters.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, the Act precludes "any court" from maintaining a suit initiated for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of federal taxes.  <em>See</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7421(a).  That language clearly instructs all courts that Congress constitutionally controls not to prematurely interfere with the assessment and collection of federal taxes.  That language does not, however, necessarily encompass this Court, which Congress did not create and which Congress is not expressly empowered to make "Exceptions" or "Regulations" as to its original jurisdiction.  Moreover, since only a small number of preenforcement suits could conceivably involve a party for whom the original jurisdiction was created, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="400">Page 465 U. S. 400</a></p><p> there is no reason to believe that Congress would want to have the constitutionality of its anti-injunction policy placed into question. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Given this <em>de minimis</em> effect and the absence of express congressional intent to the contrary, I would conclude that the Act\'s reference to "any court" means to assure that all state, as well as federal, courts are subject to the anti-injunction prohibition.  Such an interpretation gives meaning to the Act and avoids a grave constitutional question.

The State of South Carolina\'s motion for leave to file satisfies, albeit by the barest of margins, both of these tests. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>The State has demonstrated injury of "serious magnitude."  It contends, and provides uncontroverted affidavits to support, that application of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) will "materially interfere with and infringe upon the authority of South Carolina to borrow funds."  Complaint 16.  The authority the State claims has significant historical basis, <em>see Pollock v. Farmers\' Loan &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/157/429/case.html">157 U. S. 429</a></span> (1895), and the injury the State alleges could deprive it of a meaningful political choice.  <em>See Colorado v. Kansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/320/383/case.html">320 U. S. 383</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/320/383/case.html#393">320 U. S. 393</a></span>, and n. 8 (1943).  Twenty-four States have filed a joint brief <em>amici curiae</em> in support of South Carolina\'s motion, which further attests to the "serious magnitude" of the federalism concerns at issue.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the State <em>qua</em> State has demonstrated that it has no adequate alternative forum in which to raise its unique Tenth and Sixteenth Amendment claims.  <em>See Maryland v. Louisiana, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/725/case.html#743">451 U. S. 743</a></span>, and n.19.  If the State issues bearer bonds and urges its purchasers to contest the legality of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1), it will suffer irremedial injury.  The purchasers will inevitably demand higher interest rates as compensation for bearing the risk of future potential federal taxes.  Conversely, if the State forsakes bearer bonds in favor of registered ones, it will bear the increased expense that issuers of registered bonds incur, and it will be unable ever to contest the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1).  In short, the State will </p><p><a class="page-number" name="402">Page 465 U. S. 402</a></p><p> suffer irremedial injury if the Court does not assume original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Therefore, although great deference is due the longstanding congressional policy against premature judicial interference with federal taxes, I believe it is proper to exercise the Court\'s original jurisdiction under these unique circumstances.  I emphasize both the unique circumstances of this case and the congressional policy against premature judicial interference because original litigants should not be misled into believing that this Court will become a haven for suits that cannot be entertained in lower courts with concurrent jurisdiction.  The original jurisdiction is not a forum for litigating everyday tax concerns.  Rather, it must be "sparingly" invoked.  <em>United States v. Nevada,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/534/case.html">412 U. S. 534</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/534/case.html#538">412 U. S. 538</a></span> (1973).  Moreover, the legislative policy against premature judicial interference embodied in the Act must be paid the highest deference by this Court.  Thus, where the original party does not present a clear and convincing case that the tax at issue will impair its ability to structure integral operations of its government, and that irremedial injury is likely to occur absent review in the original jurisdiction, I would defer to the legislative directive against premature judicial interference. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  But since South Carolina\'s claims meet these stringent requirements, its motion for leave to file should be granted.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the record is not sufficiently developed to permit us to address the merits, and that a Special Master should be appointed.  But I do not share its view </p><p><a class="page-number" name="403">Page 465 U. S. 403</a></p><p> that the Tax Anti-Injunction Act applies only when Congress has provided an alternative avenue for a complaining party -- one with original status or not -- to litigate claims on its own behalf.  That view is not, in my opinion, based on any fair or even tenable canon of statutory construction, and cannot be reconciled with express statements of congressional intent and purpose.

Though South Carolina\'s Tenth Amendment and intergovernmental tax immunity claims are serious ones, we cannot say that there are no circumstances under which the Government could prevail.

This Court has held that the indirect impacts of a tax, no matter how detrimental, generally do not invade any interest cognizable under the Due Process Clause.  <em>See, e.g., Bob Jones University v.

I do not think the fortuity of the effect saves the statute from constitutional doubt.  As the Solicitor General himself reads the Act, it categorically prevents the State of South Carolina from maintaining a suit in this Court\'s original jurisdiction, which is precisely what Art. III arguably entitles the State to do.  The fact that a bond interest recipient can litigate the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) in due course, <em>see id.</em> at 7, does not mitigate an otherwise effective denial of the original forum to the State of South Carolina.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/15" name="F2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>In this vein, Congress itself has recently questioned its power to withdraw the Court\'s original jurisdiction.  In enacting the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978, which changed the Court\'s original jurisdiction of actions involving ambassadors or foreign states from exclusive to concurrent, the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded that "Congress may not deny to the Supreme Court jurisdiction which is expressly granted to it by the Constitution."  S.Rep. No. 95-1108, p. 6 (1978).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/16" name="F2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>Since the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2201 (1982 ed.), which prohibits "any court of the United States" from declaring rights of parties "with respect to Federal taxes," clearly has no jurisdictional effect, I have no occasion to address it at this time.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/17" name="F2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>The Solicitor General concedes that, absent a bar from the Anti-Injunction Act, this case falls within the literal terms of the constitutional and statutory grant of original jurisdiction to this Court.  <em>See</em> Supplemental Memorandum for Defendant 1-2.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/18" name="F2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, where Congress expressly leaves open an alternative forum in which an original plaintiff can raise its claims, this Court will ordinarily presume that original jurisdiction is inappropriate.  For example, where Congress allows the state, but not the federal, courts to issue injunctive relief, as Congress has done in the Norris-La Guardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 104, and \xc2\xa7 2283 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283, an original plaintiff could rarely, if ever, demand access to the obligatory original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>While I join Parts  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/367/case.html#370">465 U.

We should do so not only because the proceeding can be conducted more expeditiously in another forum, [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] but also because it is so plain that, even if we read the complaint liberally in favor of the State of South Carolina, there is simply no merit to the claim the State has advanced.  I do not believe the Court does a sovereign State a favor by giving it an opportunity to expend resources in litigation that has no chance of success.  I would therefore deny leave to file.</p>\n<p>South Carolina claims that \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) (1982 ed.), as added </p><p><a class="page-number" name="404">Page 465 U. S. 404</a></p><p> by \xc2\xa7 310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 596, is unconstitutional because it abridges the State\'s power to borrow money.  Under the federal statute, the income that private citizens receive from state bonds is taxed unless the bonds are issued in registered form.  As a practical matter, this requirement will force South Carolina to issue its bonds in registered form.  Its complaint alleges that registered bonds are more costly to issue than bearer bonds, and therefore that its future bond issues will generate smaller net revenues for the State.</p>\n<p>Although the State\'s constitutional arguments are not stated in precisely this form, in essence it claims that the statute is invalid because it violates:  (1) the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity; (2) the Tenth Amendment; and (3) the doctrine of <em>National League of Cities v. Usery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html">426 U. S. 833</a></span> (1976).  A long line of cases plainly forecloses the first claim; the other two are frivolous.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The origins of intergovernmental taxation immunity are found in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).  Of course, <em>McCulloch</em> dealt not with the immunity of the States, but rather with that of the United States.  The Court held that the State of Maryland could not constitutionally tax the Bank of the United States, because the power to tax the bank could be used to destroy it, thereby undermining the constitutionally guaranteed supremacy of the Federal Government.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#425">17 U. S. 425</a></span>-437.  The Court\'s argument was premised explicitly upon the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, and thus its holding did not require that any immunity from taxation be accorded the States. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Therefore, the case upon which South Carolina relies is not <em>McCulloch,</em> but <em>Pollock v. Farmers\' Loan &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/157/429/case.html">157 U. S. 429</a></span> (1895).  There, the Court specifically held that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="405">Page 465 U. S. 405</a></p><p> provision of the federal income tax statute taxing income derived from municipal bonds was unconstitutional.  It noted that the Court had previously held that the United States lacks the authority to tax the property or revenues of States or municipalities, since their independence from federal control is secured by the Tenth Amendment.  Of the cases cited by the Court, most dealt with whether the Federal Government could lay a tax directly upon the property of States or localities, paid by them.  In only one, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/113/case.html">Collector v. Day,</a></span></em> 11 Wall. 113 (1871), did the Court address whether the United States could tax the income of an individual derived from his dealings with a State.  There, the Court had held that the United States could not tax the salaries of judicial officers of a State.  After reciting this case law, the Court continued:</p>\n<p>"It is contended that, although the property or revenues of the States or their instrumentalities cannot be taxed, nevertheless the income derived from state, county, and municipal securities can be taxed.  But we think the same want of power to tax the property or revenues of the States or their instrumentalities exists in relation to a tax on the income from their securities, and for the same reason, and that reason is given by Chief Justice Marshall in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/27/449/case.html">Weston v. Charleston,</a></span></em> 2 Pet. 449,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/27/449/case.html#468">27 U. S. 468</a></span>, where he said:"</p>\n<p>"The right to tax the contract to any extent, when made, must operate upon the power to borrow before it is exercised, and have a sensible influence on the contract.  The extent of this influence, depends on the will of a distinct government.  To any extent, however inconsiderable, it is a burthen on the operations of government.  It may be carried to an extent which shall arrest them entirely. . . .  The tax on government stock is thought by this court to be a tax on the contract, a tax on the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and consequently to be repugnant to the Constitution."</p>\n<p>"Applying this language to these municipal securities, it is obvious that taxation on the interest therefrom would operate on the power to borrow before </p><p><a class="page-number" name="406">Page 465 U. S. 406</a></p><p> it is exercised, and would have a sensible influence on the contract, and that the tax in question is a tax on the power of the States and their instrumentalities to borrow money, and consequently repugnant to the Constitution."</p>\n<p>157 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/157/429/case.html#585">157 U. S. 585</a></span>-586 (ellipsis in original).</p>\n<p>The theory employed in <em>Pollock</em> is what I shall refer to as the "intergovernmental burden" theory:  even though a tax is not laid directly upon another government, if it has a "sensible influence" on the costs incurred by that government, it must fall.  This theory is the only rationale offered by the <em>Pollock</em> Court for its decision, and it is on this theory that <em>Pollock</em> must stand or fall.</p>\n<p>The precedential weight of <em>Pollock</em> was doubtful almost from the start.  Within a generation, <em>Pollock</em> was seemingly overruled by constitutional amendment.  The Sixteenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, states:</p>\n<p>"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, <em>from whatever source derived,</em> without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)  This clear language makes the fact that income is derived from interest on state or local obligations constitutionally irrelevant.</p>\n<p>Any doubt about the vitality of <em>Pollock</em> is dispelled by our subsequent cases.  At every opportunity, this Court has rejected the intergovernmental burden theory.</p>\n<p>In <em>Metcalf &amp; Eddy v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/269/514/case.html">269 U. S. 514</a></span> (1926), the Court first rejected the theory.  It held that the United States could tax the income derived by an independent contractor from its contracts with a State.  The Court recognized that the federal tax increased costs incurred by the State, [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>] but nevertheless upheld the tax: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="407">Page 465 U. S. 407</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"[H]ere the tax is imposed on the income of one who is neither an officer nor an employee of government and whose only relation to it is that of contract, under which there is an obligation to furnish service, for practical purposes not unlike a contract to sell and deliver a commodity.  The tax is imposed without discrimination upon income whether derived from services rendered to the state or services rendered to private individuals.  In such a situation, it cannot be said that the tax is imposed upon an agency of government in any technical sense, and the tax cannot be deemed to be an interference with government, or an impairment of the efficiency of its agencies in any substantial way."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/269/514/case.html#524">269 U.

A burden on the State imposed by taxing those who contract with it was no longer sufficient to invalidate a tax; the theory that a State\'s contracts could not be taxed which the Court had relied upon in <em>Pollock</em> was no longer good law.

The Court there held that the United States could tax the salaries of state employees.  The Court began its analysis by pointing out that the scope of <em>McCulloch</em> was limited to state taxation of federal instrumentalities. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  The Court read <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/27/449/case.html">Weston v.

[I]f every federal tax which is laid on some new form of state activity, or whose economic burden reaches in some measure the state or those who serve it, were to be set aside as an infringement of state sovereignty, it is evident that a restriction on the national power, devised only as a shield to protect the states from curtailment of the essential operations of government which they have exercised from the beginning, would become a ready means for striking down the taxing power of the nation."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/405/case.html#416">304 U.

The burden, so far as it can be said to exist or to affect the government in any indirect or incidental way, is one which the Constitution presupposes, and hence it cannot rightly be deemed to be within an implied restriction upon the taxing power of the national and state governments which the Constitution has expressly granted to one and has confirmed to the other."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 487.

There, land owned by the United States was occupied by S. R. A., which had bought the land under a conditional sales contract that left title in the United States pending full payment of the purchase price.  Nevertheless, the Court held that state property taxes could be assessed against the land, since, in reality, the private </p><p><a class="page-number" name="414">Page 465 U.

[<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]  Thus, the Court recognized that, where the property inures to the benefit of a private party, it has no immunity from taxation despite the fact that the taxation may increase the costs imposed on the governmental entity.

S. 419</a></span>-420 (1949)</p>\n<p>Our cases thus demonstrate the insubstantiality of South Carolina\'s claim.  Under \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1), South Carolina is not required to pay any federal tax at all.  The tax is imposed not upon state property or revenues, but only upon persons with whom it contracts.  Under the test adopted by a majority of the Court in <em>New York v. United States,</em> and followed since, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 465 U. S. 415</a></p><p> this alone defeats its claim.  South Carolina is trying to shield private parties with whom it does business from taxation because part of the financial burden of the tax falls upon it.  This Court has repeatedly rejected exactly that sort of claim. [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]  Moreover, the rationale on which <em>Pollock</em> is based -- the intergovernmental burden theory -- has been repudiated over and over again by this Court.  There is simply nothing left of <em>Pollock</em> on which South Carolina can base a claim.</p>\n<p>Even if there were enough left of <em>Pollock</em> to invalidate a federal tax that might cripple traditional state functions, the burden imposed on the State here is far from crushing.  South Carolina estimates that, if it must issue its bonds in registered form, it will have to pay an additional one quarter of one percent interest on its bonds. [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]  It identifies in its offer of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="416">Page 465 U. S. 416</a></p><p> proof no disruption in its operation except for this slight increase in interest costs. [<a href="#F3/17" name="T3/17">Footnote 3/17</a>]  Surely this cost is infinitesimal compared to the costs imposed on States and localities because their employees\' salaries are federally taxed -- a burden that the Federal Government unquestionably has the constitutional power to impose.  Moreover, the challenged statute still provides States and localities with the ability to offer debt instruments at substantially less than the market rates which must be paid by private enterprise -- three to five points lower according to South Carolina\'s estimate.  It is hard to see how marginal increases in the interest they must pay can destroy the integrity of governmental entities when private entities are able not only to survive but generally to make a profit while obtaining financing at significantly higher rates of interest.  As Professor Thomas Reed Powell observed:</p>\n<p>"Public bonds will not be put in an unfavorable position relatively by being subjected to taxes on the income.  They will merely be deprived of an artificial advantage heretofore enjoyed, which however is not strictly necessary, in all probability, in order to give them a practical success on the financial markets of the country when offered at the same rates of interest that have usually been offered in the past."</p>\n<p>Powell, Intergovernmental Tax Immunities, 8 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 1213, 1214-1215 (1940).</p>\n<p>In contrast to the slight burden alleged by South Carolina, the Federal Government\'s interest in encouraging bearer bonds to be issued in registered form is substantial, as the Senate Report on this provision makes clear. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 465 U. S. 417</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"The Committee believes that a fair and efficient system of information reporting and withholding cannot be achieved with respect to interest-bearing obligations as long as a significant volume of long-term bearer instruments is issued.  A system of book-entry registration will preserve the liquidity of obligations while requiring the creation of ownership records that can produce useful information reports with respect to both the payment of interest and the sale of obligations prior to maturity through brokers.  Furthermore, registration will reduce the ability of noncompliant taxpayers to conceal income and property from the reach of the income, estate, and gift taxes.  Finally, the registration requirement may reduce the volume of readily negotiable substitutes for cash available to persons engaged in illegal activities."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 97-494, pt. 1, p. 242 (1982).</p>\n<p>As this Court has previously held, the Constitution does not invalidate every burden on a State or locality created by federal taxation because such burdens are the "normal incident" of a system of dual sovereigns with dual taxing powers, which the Constitution envisions will coexist.  Surely it follows that the Constitution intended that the taxing power it gave the Federal Government not be undermined through the abuse engendered by bearer instruments.  The burden imposed upon States and localities by efforts to eliminate such abuse is one necessary in a system committed to the efficacy of dual taxing authorities.</p>\n<p>The fairness of this requirement is highlighted by the fact that \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) requires that federally issued bonds also be in registered form to be tax exempt.  Even in the heyday of <em>Pollock,</em> the Court never held that the Federal Government impermissibly infringed state sovereignty by imposing a burden on the States that it also imposed on itself.  If Congress has destroyed some protected concept of state sovereignty through \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1), then it has destroyed the sovereignty of the United States as well. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 465 U. S. 418</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>South Carolina\'s complaint alleges that \xc2\xa7 103(j)(1) violates the Tenth Amendment.  That Amendment provides:</p>\n<p>"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."</p>\n<p>In order to bring its challenge within the terms of that Amendment, South Carolina alleges:</p>\n<p>"The Congress of the United States has no power whatsoever to impose an income tax upon the interest paid by South Carolina to its lenders."</p>\n<p>Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd 9.  This allegation is inconsistent with the plain language of the Constitution itself.  Article I, \xc2\xa7 8, specifically delegates to Congress the "Power To lay and collect Taxes," and the Sixteenth Amendment removes any possible ambiguity concerning the scope of the power exercised by Congress in this case.  The cases I have discussed above confirm this point.</p>\n<p>Because the power to tax private income has been expressly delegated to Congress, the Tenth Amendment has no application to this case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Finally, South Carolina relies on <em>National League of Cities v. Usery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html">426 U. S. 833</a></span> (1976).  In that case, the Court held that a federal statute extending the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to certain public employees was "not within the authority granted Congress by Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html#852">426 U. S. 852</a></span> (footnote omitted).  The conclusion that the case merely involved an interpretation of the outer limits of the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce was then confirmed by the following footnote:</p>\n<p>"We express no view as to whether different results might obtain if Congress seeks to affect integral operations of state governments by exercising authority granted it under other sections of the Constitution such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 465 U.

I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 1, or \xc2\xa7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/case.html#852">426 U. S. 852</a></span>, n. 17.  By its express terms, therefore, the <em>National League of Cities</em> case has no application to South Carolina\'s challenge to an exercise of the federal taxing power. [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>]</p>\n<p>In sum, I can see no basis on which South Carolina could prevail in this case, even accepting its allegations and offers of proof for all they are worth.  We do South Carolina no favor by permitting it to file and litigate a claim on which it has no chance of prevailing.  At the same time, the Court\'s decision to permit South Carolina to file this claim is an unwise use of its scarce resources.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court\'s decision to grant South Carolina\'s motion for leave to file its complaint.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>As the Solicitor General points out:</p>\n<p>"[T]his case is particularly inappropriate for the exercise of this Court\'s discretionary original jurisdiction.  First, given the demands on this Court\'s original and appellate docket, it seems plain that a district court could hear the case more promptly.  This is especially true in light of the fact that to support its claim, South Carolina would undoubtedly seek to introduce evidence of the actual burden imposed upon it by the federal tax statute.  Such a proceeding could be more expeditiously conducted at the usual trial court level by a federal district court."</p>\n<p>Brief in Opposition 12.  <em>See United States v.

He was careful to point out not only that the taxing power of the national government is supreme, by reason of the constitutional grant, but that, in laying a federal tax on state instrumentalities, the people of the states, acting through their representatives, are laying a tax on their own institutions, and consequently are subject to political restraints which can be counted on to prevent abuse.  State taxation of national instrumentalities is subject to no such restraint, for the people outside the state have no representatives who participate in the legislation; and in a real sense, as to them, the taxation is without representation.

The seductive cliche that the power to tax involves the power to destroy was fused with another assumption, likewise not to be found in the Constitution itself, namely the doctrine that the immunities are correlative -- because the existence of the national government implies immunities from state taxation, the existence of state governments implies equivalent immunities from federal taxation. . . ."</p>\n<p>"All these doctrines of intergovernmental immunity have, until recently, been moving in the realm of what Lincoln called \'pernicious abstractions.\'  The web of unreality spun from Marshall\'s famous dictum was brushed away by one stroke of Mr. Justice Holmes\'s pen:  \'The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.\'  <em>Panhandle Oil Co. v.

Second, the right to issue unregistered bearer bonds has never been considered an indisputable aspect of sovereignty.
