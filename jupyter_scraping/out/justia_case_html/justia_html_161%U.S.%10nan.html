The defendants appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>A recapitulation of the principles heretofore affirmed by this Court touching the liability of the United States and of their officers and agents to suit in the judicial tribunals, will go far towards disposing of this case.</p>\n<p>It should be premised that our law differs from that of England as to the right of the government to use without compensation an invention for which it has granted letters patent.</p>\n<p>In England, the grant of a patent for an invention is considered as simply an exercise of the royal prerogative, and not to be construed as precluding the crown from using the invention at its pleasure, and therefore a petition of right cannot be maintained against the crown for using a patented invention, although a private person or corporation that has contracted to supply the government with articles embodying the invention may be sued for infringement of the patent.  <em>Feather v. The Queen,</em> 6 B. &amp; S. 257; <em>Dixon v. London Small Arms Co.,</em> L.R. 10 Q.B. 130, 1 App.Cas. 632.</p>\n<p>But in this country, letters patent for inventions are not granted in the exercise of prerogative or as a matter of favor, but under Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution of the United States, which gives Congress power</p>\n<p>"to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited terms to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries."</p>\n<p>The patent act provides that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="16">Page 161 U. S. 16</a></p><p> every patent shall contain a grant to the patentee, his heirs and assigns, for a certain term of years, of "the exclusive right to make, use and vend the invention or discovery throughout the United States."  Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 4884.  And this Court has repeatedly and uniformly declared that the United States have no more right than any private person to use a patented invention without license of the patentee or making compensation to him.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/79/246/case.html">United States v.

This doctrine has been affirmed by this Court in cases too numerous to be cited, and was clearly stated by MR. JUSTICE FIELD, delivering judgment in the case of <em>The Siren,</em> as follows:</p>\n<p>"It is a familiar doctrine of the common law that the sovereign cannot be sued in his own courts without his consent.  The doctrine rests upon reasons of public policy -- the inconvenience and danger which would follow from any different rule.  It is obvious that the public service would be hindered, and the public safety endangered, if the supreme authority could be subjected to suit at the instance of every citizen, and consequently controlled in the use and disposition of the means required for the proper administration of the government.  The exemption from direct suit is therefore without exception.  This doctrine of the common law is equally applicable to the supreme authority of the nation, the United States.  They cannot be subjected to legal proceedings at law or in equity without their consent, and whoever institutes such proceedings must bring his case within the authority of some act of Congress.  Such is the language of this Court in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/33/436/case.html#444">United States v. Clarke,</a></span></em> 8 Pet. 444.  The same exemption from judicial process extends to the property of the United States, and for the same reasons.  As justly observed by the learned judge who tried this case, there is no distinction between suits against the government directly and suits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 161 U. S. 17</a></p><p> against its property."</p>\n<p>7 Wall.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/152/case.html">74 U. S. 152</a></span>-154.

In these cases, he is not sued as, or because he is, the officer of the government, but as an individual, and the court is not ousted of jurisdiction because he asserts authority as such officer.  To make out his defense, he must show that his authority was sufficient in law to protect him."</p>\n<p>After citing several cases to this point, he added:</p>\n<p>"To this class belongs also the recent case of <em>United States v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/106/196/case.html">106 U.

And the defendants Strong and Kaufman, being sued individually as trespassers, set up their authority as officers of the United States, which this Court held to he unlawful, and therefore insufficient as a defense.

This principle is conceded in all the cases, and whenever it can be clearly seen that the state is an indispensable party to enable the court, according to the rules which govern its procedure, to grant the relief sought, it will refuse to take jurisdiction. . . .  In the case now under consideration, the State of Georgia is an indispensable party.  It is in fact the only proper defendant in the case.  No one sued has any personal interest in the matter, or any official authority to grant the relief asked.  No foreclosure suit can be sustained without the state, because she has the legal title to the property, and the purchaser under a foreclosure decree would get no title in the absence of the state.  The state is in the actual possession of the property, and the court can deliver no possession to the purchaser.  The entire interest adverse to plaintiff in this suit is the interest of the State of Georgia in the property, of which she has both the title and possession."</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/109/446/case.html#451">109 U.

Mr. Justice Matthews, again delivering its opinion, and fully reviewing the previous cases, said that from the decision in <em>Cunningham v. Brunswick &amp; Macon Railroad,</em> above cited,</p>\n<p>"the inference is that where it is manifest upon the face of the record that the defendants have no individual interest in the controversy, and that the relief sought against them is only in their official capacity as representatives of the state, which alone is to be affected by the judgment or decree, the question then arising, whether the suit is not substantially a suit against the state, is one of jurisdiction,"</p>\n<p>and added that actions had been sustained against officers acting in behalf of a state</p>\n<p>"only in those instances where the act complained of, considered apart from the official authority alleged as to its justification, and as the personal act of the individual defendant, constituted a violation of right for which the plaintiff was entitled to a remedy at law or in equity against the wrongdoer, in his individual character,"</p>\n<p>and that the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution, declaring that</p>\n<p>"the judicial power of the United </p><p><a class="page-number" name="22">Page 161 U. S. 22</a></p><p> States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state,"</p>\n<p>must be held</p>\n<p>"to cover, not only suits brought against a state by name, but those also against its officers, agents and representatives, where the state, though not named as such, is, nevertheless, the only real party against which alone in fact the relief is asked, and against which the judgment or decree effectively operates,"</p>\n<p>and therefore concluded that the suit in which the injunction was granted was, in substance and in law, a suit against the State of Virginia, and consequently the circuit court was without jurisdiction to entertain it, the order of injunction and the commitments for contempt were null and void, and the imprisonment of the officers was without authority of law.  <em>In re Ayers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/443/case.html">123 U.

The defendants filed a plea to the whole bill, and the Attorney General, in behalf of the United States, filed a suggestion, the single ground of each of which was that the only caisson gate that the defendants had any relation with was not made by them, and was not used by them for their own benefit, but was made and used by the United States in a dry dock at a navy yard, and the defendants only operated and used it as officers, servants, and employees of the United States.  The fact so pleaded and suggested could not, consistently with the previous decisions above cited, prevent the defendants from being held liable to the patentee for their own infringement of his patent.  There was no error, therefore, in overruling the plea of the defendants and the suggestion of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>But the circuit court erred in awarding an injunction against the defendants.</p>\n<p>As this Court, when deciding that things manufactured under letters patent of the United States were subject to be taxed by a state like other property, said, "the right of property </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 161 U.

S. 506</a></span>.  Title in the thing manufactured does not give the right to use the patented invention; no more does the patent right in the invention give title in the thing made in violation of the patent.</p>\n<p>In an English case, quite analogous to the case at bar, where shells, bought and owned by a foreign sovereign, were brought to England to be put on board his ships of war, the Court of Appeal held that his agents, if they used the shells in England in infringement of an English patent, might be liable in damages to the patentee, but that the court could not restrain the delivery of the shells to the sovereign to whom they belonged.  Lord Justice Brett said:  "The patent law has nothing to do with property."  And Lord Justice Cotton expressed the same idea more fully, as follows:</p>\n<p>"The property in articles which are made in violation of a patent is, notwithstanding the privilege of the patentee, in the infringer if he would otherwise have the property in them.  The court, in a suit to restrain the infringement of a patent, does not proceed on the footing that the defendant proved to have infringed has no property in the articles, but, assuming the property to be in him, it prevents the use of those articles either by removing that which constitutes the infringement or by ordering, if necessary, a destruction of the articles so as to prevent them from being used in derogation of the plaintiff\'s rights, and does this as the most effectual mode of protecting the plaintiff\'s rights, not on the footing that there is no property in the defendant.  The court cannot proceed to give that relief and interfere with the articles unless it has before it the person entitled to the articles in question, and has, as against this person, power to adjudicate that the articles are made or used in infringement of the plaintiff\'s rights."</p>\n<p><em>Vavasseur v. Krupp,</em> 9 Ch.Div. 351, 358-360.</p>\n<p>In the present case, the caisson gate was a part of the dry dock in a navy yard of the United States, was constructed and put in place by the United States, and was the property of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="25">Page 161 U. S. 25</a></p><p> United States, and held and used by the United States for the public benefit.  If the gate was made in infringement of plaintiff\'s patent, that did not prevent the title in the gate from vesting in the United States.  The United States, then, had both the title and the possession of the property.  The United States could not hold or use it except through officers and agents.  Although this suit was not brought against the United States by name, but against their officers and agents only, nevertheless, so far as the bill prayed for an injunction and for the destruction of the gate in question, the defendants had no individual interest in the controversy.  The entire interest adverse to the plaintiff was the interest of the United States in property of which the United States had both the title and the possession.  The United States were the only real party against whom alone in fact the relief was asked and against whom the decree would effectively operate.  The plaintiff sought to control the defendants in their official capacity and in the exercise of their official functions as representatives and agents of the United States, and thereby to defeat the use by the United States of property owned and used by the United States for the common defense and general welfare, and therefore the United States were an indispensable party to enable the court, according to the rules which govern its procedure, to grant the relief sought, and the suit could not be maintained without violating the principles affirmed in the long series of decisions of this Court above cited.</p>\n<p>There was also error in the final decree awarding profits to the plaintiff as against the defendants.</p>\n<p>In a suit in equity for the infringement of a patent, the ground upon which profits are recovered is that they are the benefits which have accrued to the defendants from their wrongful use of the plaintiff\'s invention, and for which they are liable, <em>ex aequo et bono,</em> to the like extent as a trustee would be who had used the trust property for his own advantage.  The defendants in any such suit are therefore liable to account for such profits only as have accrued to themselves from the use of the invention, and not for those </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 161 U.

It being shown that the city had made no profits from the use of the invention, but that the contractor had, this Court held that profits could be recovered against the contractor only, and not against the city.  Mr. Justice Bradley, in delivering judgment, said:</p>\n<p>"One thing may be affirmed with reasonable confidence -- that if an infringer of a patent has realized no profit from the use of the invention, he cannot be called upon to respond for profits.

JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I am unable to concur in the disposition which has been made of this case.</p>\n<p>As stated in the opinion of the majority, this Court has frequently held that the United States has no more right than any private person to use a patented invention without license of the patentee, or without making or securing compensation to him.  It is not claimed that the defendants used the plaintiff\'s patent under a license from him, or that compensation or provision for compensation has been made. T he government is therefore under an implied obligation to compensate the plaintiff.  That obligation arises from the Constitution, which declares that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.  Upon this point, the Court, in <em>Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Attorney General,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/112/645/case.html">112 U. S. 645</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/112/645/case.html#657">112 U. S. 657</a></span>, said:</p>\n<p>"Such an implication being consistent with the constitutional duty of the government, as well as with common justice, the claimant\'s cause of action is one that arises out of implied contract within the meaning of the statute which confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims of actions founded \'upon any contract, expressed or implied, with the government of the United States.\'"</p>\n<p>The same principle was recognized in <em>Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Attorney General,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/124/581/case.html">124 U. S. 581</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/124/581/case.html#597">124 U. S. 597</a></span>; <em>United States v.

S. 28</a></p><p> <em>Schillinger v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/155/163/case.html">155 U.

In this view (the defendants being public officers, who derive no personal advantage from the use by the government of the plaintiff\'s invention), the prayer for an injunction might well have been denied upon the ground that there was an adequate and complete remedy by a suit against the United States as upon implied contract.  But the Court does not proceed distinctly on that ground.</p>\n<p>If the plaintiff cannot sue the United States to recover compensation for the use of his invention, actually appropriated by the government for public use, then the only adequate remedy for him would be an injunction against the individual officers, who are proceeding without his license and without any provision\'s having been made for his being compensated.  This must be so unless the court is prepared to hold that there is no remedy, under the Constitution, for the protection of private rights against illegal invasion by officers of the government.  In <em>United States v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/196/case.html">106 U. S. 196</a></span>, this Court said that when the citizen,</p>\n<p>"in one of the courts of competent jurisdiction, has established his right of property, there is no reason why deference to any person, natural or artificial, not even the United States, should prevent him from using the means which the law gives him for the protection and enforcement of that right;"</p>\n<p>that</p>\n<p>"no man in this country is so high that he is above the law.  No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity.  All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it."</p>\n<p>If the United States may appropriate to public use the invention of a patentee without his consent and without liability to suit, as upon implied contract, for the value of the use of such invention; if, as the Court holds, a public officer, acting only in the interest of the public, is not individually liable for gains, profits, and advantages that may accrue to the United States from such use, and if the officer who thus violates the rights of the patentee cannot be restrained by injunction, then the government may well be regarded as organized robbery, so far as the rights of patentees are concerned. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="29">Page 161 U. S. 29</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Instead of leaving open the question whether the United States was liable to suit, as upon implied contract, the prayer for injunction, if denied, should have been denied upon the ground, and only upon the ground, that the plaintiff had a complete and adequate remedy by a suit against the government.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
