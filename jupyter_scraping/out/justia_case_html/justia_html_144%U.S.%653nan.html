The plaintiff further complains of the defendant for that plaintiff has a legal estate in and is entitled to the immediate possession of the following described property, to-wit, lots number one, two, three, four, five, and six, all in block number forty-one, in Dawson\'s addition to South Lincoln, in Lancaster County, Nebraska, and that said defendant has, ever since the 11th day of April, 1887, unlawfully kept, and still keeps, the plaintiff out of possession thereof."</p>\n<p>"Wherefore the plaintiff prays that he may have judgment for the delivery of the possession of said premises to him, and for the costs of this action."</p>\n<p>The defendant filed the following amended answer:</p>\n<p>"1. The above-named defendant, for an amended answer to the plaintiff\'s petition, says that for more than ten years prior to the commencement of this action he had been, and still is, in the open, adverse possession of the premises in controversy."</p>\n<p>"2. Defendant, further answering, denies each and every allegation in said petition contained."</p>\n<p>The parties stipulated in writing that the value of the premises in controversy exceeded $5,000, and the case was tried by a jury, who, by direction of the court, returned a special verdict, finding the following facts:</p>\n<p>Jacob Dawson died seised in fee of the premises, leaving a widow and five children, and by his last will, dated May 10, 1869, and duly admitted to probate in Lancaster County, Nebraska, made the following devise and bequest:</p>\n<p>"To my beloved wife, Editha J. Dawson, I give and bequeath all my estate, real and personal, of which I may die seised, the same to be and remain hers, with full power, rights, and authority to dispose of the same as to her shall seem meet and proper, so long as she shall remain my widow, upon the express condition, however, that, if she should marry again, then it is my will that all of the estate herein bequeathed, or whatever may remain, shall go to my surviving children, share and share </p><p><a class="page-number" name="655">Page 144 U.

The premises were conveyed on September 15, 1879, by warranty deed, by Jacob Dawson\'s children to Wheeler and Burr by them, on April 27, 1880, to Ezekiel Giles, and by him, in May, 1887, to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>The jury found that if the court should be of opinion that under the will Editha J. Dawson took only an estate determinable upon her marriage, then the plaintiff at the commencement of the action, was seised in fee of the premises, and entitled to the immediate possession thereof, and should recover of the defendant nominal damages, but if the court should be of opinion that under the will, Editha J.

JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The principal question argued in this case is upon the true construction of the devise of Jacob Dawson to his wife, in view of the conflicting decisions of this Court and of the Supreme </p><p><a class="page-number" name="656">Page 144 U. S. 656</a></p><p> Court of Nebraska.  <em>Giles v. Little,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/104/291/case.html">104 U. S. 291</a></span>; <em>Little v. Giles,</em> 25 Neb. 313.  <em>See also Little v. Giles,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/118/596/case.html">118 U. S. 596</a></span>; <em>Giles v.

S. 645</a></span>.</p>\n<p>But a preliminary question to be decided is whether the circuit court of the United States appears upon this record to have had any jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p>The petition or declaration alleges in due form that the plaintiff is a citizen of the State of Wisconsin and the defendant is a citizen of the State of Nebraska, and further alleges that the plaintiff has a legal estate in, and is entitled to the immediate possession of, certain lots in Lancaster County, in the State of Nebraska, and the defendant has kept, and still keeps, the plaintiff out of possession thereof; wherefore the plaintiff prays for judgment for delivery of possession of the premises to him.  The answer sets up two defenses:  (1) open and adverse possession of the premises by the defendant for 10 years; (2) a general denial of each and every allegation in the petition.  The special verdict finds facts bearing on the merits of the case, but nothing as to the citizenship of the parties.</p>\n<p>Whenever the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States depends upon the citizenship of the parties, it has been held from the beginning that the requisite citizenship should be alleged by the plaintiff and must appear of record, and that when it does not so appear, this Court, on writ of error, must reverse the judgment for want of jurisdiction in the circuit court.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/33/112/case.html">Brown v.

S. 237</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Doubtless so long as the rules of pleading in the courts of the United States remained as at common law, the requisite citizenship of the parties, if duly alleged or apparent in the declaration, could not be denied by the defendant except by plea in abatement, and was admitted by pleading to the merits of the action.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/55/505/case.html">Sheppard v. Graves,</a></span></em> 14 How. 505.</p>\n<p>But since 1872, when Congress assimilated the rules of pleading, practice, and forms and modes of procedure in actions at law in the courts of the United States to those prevailing in the courts of the several states, all defenses are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="657">Page 144 U. S. 657</a></p><p> open to a defendant in the circuit court of the United States, under any form of plea, answer, or demurrer, which would have been open to him under like pleading in the courts of the state within which the circuit court is held.

By \xc2\xa7 94, the defendant may demur to the petition for certain matters appearing on its face, among which are "that the court has no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, or the subject of the action" and "that the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action," and by \xc2\xa7 95, the demurrer must specify the grounds of objection, or else be regarded as limited to the latter ground only.  By \xc2\xa7 96, "when any of the defects enumerated in \xc2\xa7 94 do not appear upon the face of the petition, the objection may be taken by answer," and in every case, by \xc2\xa7 99, the answer must contain "a general or specific denial of each material allegation of the petition controverted by the defendant," and "a statement of any new matter constituting a defense."</p>\n<p>Under this code, as under the Code of New York, upon which it was modeled, the answer takes the place of all pleas at common law, whether general or special, in abatement or to the merits, and a positive denial in the answer of "each and every allegation in the petition" puts in issue every material allegation therein, as fully as if it had been specifically and separately denied.  <em>Sweet v.

The record showing no proof or finding upon this essential point, on which the jurisdiction of the circuit court depended, the judgment must be reversed, with costs, for want of jurisdiction in the circuit court, and the case remanded to that court, which may, in its discretion, either dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction or set aside the verdict and permit the plaintiff to offer evidence of the citizenship of the parties.  <em>Continental Ins.
