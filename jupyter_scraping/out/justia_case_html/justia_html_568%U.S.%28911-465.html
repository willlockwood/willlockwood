Richter, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.  There, the Court held that when a state court issues an order that summarily rejects without discussion all the claims raised by a defendant, including a federal claim that the defendant subsequently presses in federal habeas, the federal habeas court must presume that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.  Though Richter concerned a state-court order that did not address any of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claims, there is no sound reason not to apply its presumption when a state-court opinion addresses some but not all of those claims.  Federal habeas courts should not assume that any unaddressed federal claim was simply overlooked because state courts do not uniformly discuss separately every claim referenced by a defendant.  In fact, they frequently take a different course.  They may view a line of state precedent as fully incorporating a related federal constitutional right, may not regard a fleeting reference to a provision of the Federal Constitution or federal precedent as sufficient to raise a federal claim, or may simply regard a claim as too insubstantial to merit discussion.

Certainly, if a state standard subsumes the federal standard, the federal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated on the merits.  See Early v. Packer, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 3\n.  But where, e.g., the state standard is less protective or the federal precedent was mentioned in passing, the presumption may be rebutted\xe2\x80\x94either by a habeas petitioner (to show that the federal court should consider the claim de novo) or by the State (to show that the federal claim should be regarded as procedurally defaulted).  See Coleman v. Thompson, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722\n.  An irrebuttable presumption that state courts never overlook federal claims would sometimes be wrong.  It would also improperly excise \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x99s on-the-merits requirement, for a claim that is rejected as a result of sheer inadvertence has not been evaluated on the merits.  The experience of the lower federal courts shows that allowing federal habeas petitioners to rebut the presumption will not prompt an unduly burdensome flood of litigation.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x88\x9213.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t2.\xc2\xa0Applying the rebuttable presumption of merits adjudication here, the Ninth Circuit erred by finding that the State Court of Appeal overlooked Williams\xe2\x80\x99 \n \nSixth Amendment claim.  Several facts lead to that conclusion.  Most important is that the court discussed Cleveland, a State Supreme Court case that in turn examined three Federal Court of Appeals cases concerning the \n \nSixth Amendment implications of discharging holdout jurors.  Though Cleveland refused to follow those cases, the views of the federal courts of appeals do not bind a State Supreme Court when it decides a federal constitutional question.  Regardless of whether a California court would consider Williams\xe2\x80\x99 state-law and \n \nSixth Amendment claims to be coextensive, their similarity makes it unlikely that the State Court of Appeal decided one while overlooking the other.  The State Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s quotation of Wood, supra, at 145\xe2\x88\x92146, further confirms that it was well aware that the juror\xe2\x80\x99s questioning and dismissal implicated federal law.  Williams\xe2\x80\x99 litigation strategy also supports this result.  She treated her state and federal claims as interchangeable, so it is not surprising that the state courts did as well.  Notably, Williams neither petitioned the State Court of Appeal for rehearing nor argued in subsequent state and federal proceedings that the state court had failed to adjudicate her \n \nSixth Amendment claim on the merits.

This issue arises when a defendant convicted in state court attempts to raise a federal claim, either on direct appeal or in a collateral state proceeding, and a state court rules against the defendant and issues an opinion that addresses some issues but does not expressly address the federal claim in question.  If this defendant then raises the same claim in a federal habeas proceeding, should the federal court regard the claim as having been adjudicated on the merits by the state court and apply deference under \xc2\xa72254(d)?  Or may the federal court assume that the state court simply overlooked the federal claim and proceed to adjudicate the claim de\xc2\xa0novo, the course taken by the Court of Appeals in the case at hand?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe believe that the answer to this question follows logically from our decision in Harrington v.

In that case, we held that, when a state court issues an order that summarily rejects without discussion all the claims raised by a defendant, including a federal claim that the defendant subsequently presses in a federal habeas proceeding, the federal habeas court must presume (subject to rebuttal) that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.

We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn October 1993, respondent Tara Williams took two of her friends for a drive in southern California with the objective of committing a robbery.  They stopped at a liquor store in Long Beach, and while Williams waited in the getaway car, her friends stole money from the cash register and fatally shot the store\xe2\x80\x99s owner.  Williams then drove one of her friends away, and the other fled on foot.  Williams avoided capture for five years but was ultimately apprehended and charged with first-degree murder.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt trial, Williams admitted that she had served as the getaway driver but claimed that she did not know that her friends were going to rob the liquor store at the particular time in question.  Instead, she contended that the three friends had agreed only that they would \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d the store and would possibly return later that evening to rob it.  The State countered that, regardless of whether Williams knew precisely when and where the robbery was to take place, she had agreed to help commit a robbery and that this was sufficient to provide the predicate for felony murder under California law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter deliberating for about three hours, the jury foreman sent the judge two notes.

Then, over Williams\xe2\x80\x99 objection, the judge briefly questioned the foreman outside the presence of the rest of the jury about the second note.  The foreman said that he thought the judge\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the first note might resolve the problem, and the judge instructed the jury to resume its deliberations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe next morning, once again over Williams\xe2\x80\x99 objection, the judge decided to inquire further about the foreman\xe2\x80\x99s second note.  On questioning by the judge and lawyers for both parties, the foreman testified that Juror 6 had brought up past instances of jury nullification.  The foreman also expressed doubt about whether Juror 6 was willing to apply the felony-murder rule.  The trial judge then ordered questioning of Juror 6, who first denied and then admitted bringing up instances of nullification.  Juror 6 also testified that this was a serious case and that he would vote to convict only if he was \xe2\x80\x9cvery convinced .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1280.  He later clarified that in his view \xe2\x80\x9cconvinced beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvery convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d meant the same thing.  Id., at 1281.  After taking testi- mony from the remaining jurors, who corroborated the  foreman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony to varying degrees, the trial judge dis- missed Juror 6 for bias.  With an alternate juror in place, the jury convicted Williams of first-degree murder.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn appeal to the California Court of Appeal, Williams argued, among other things, that the discharge of Juror 6 violated both the \n \nSixth Amendment and the California Penal Code, which allows a California trial judge to dismiss a juror who \xe2\x80\x9cupon .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. good cause shown to the court is found to be unable to perform his or her duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71089 (West 2004).  Although Williams\xe2\x80\x99 brief challenged the questioning and dismissal of Juror 6 on both state and federal grounds, it did not clearly distinguish between these two lines of authority.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn a written opinion affirming Williams\xe2\x80\x99 conviction, the California Court of Appeal devoted several pages to  discussing the propriety of the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision to dis- miss the juror.  People v. Taylor, No. B137365 (Mar. 27, 2001). The court held that Juror 6 had been properly dismissed for bias and quoted this Court\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cimpartiality\xe2\x80\x9d in United States v. Wood, \n\n299 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123\n\xe2\x80\x93146 (1936).  But despite its extended discussion of Juror 6\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal and the questioning that preceded it, the California Court of Appeal never expressly acknowledged that it was deciding a \n \nSixth Amendment issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWilliams petitioned the California Supreme Court for review, and while her petition was pending, that court decided People v.

The California Supreme Court granted Williams\xe2\x80\x99 petition for review and remanded her case for further consideration in light of this intervening authority.  People v.

Williams argued that Juror 6\xe2\x80\x94like the holdout juror in Cleveland\xe2\x80\x94was dismissed because he was uncooperative with other jurors who did not share his view of the evidence.  But the California Court of Appeal disagreed, explaining that Williams\xe2\x80\x99 argument \xe2\x80\x9cnot only misstate[d] the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cignore[d] the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that it was discharging Juror No. 6 because he had shown himself to be biased, not because he was failing to deliberate or engaging in juror nullification.\xe2\x80\x9d  People v. Taylor, No. B137365 (Jan. 18, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 105a.  As in its earlier opinion, the California Court of Appeal quoted our definition of juror bias in Wood, but the court did not expressly acknowledge that Williams had invoked a federal basis for her argument.  Despite that omission, however, Williams did not seek rehearing or other- wise suggest that the court had overlooked her federal claim.  Instead, she filed another petition for review in the California Supreme Court, but this time that court denied relief in a one-sentence order.  People v.

Although Richter itself concerned a state-court order that did not address any of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claims, we see no reason why the Richter presumption should not also apply when a state-court opinion addresses some but not all of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  There would be a reason for drawing a distinction between these two situations if opinions issued by state appellate courts always separately addressed every single claim that is mentioned in a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s papers.  If there were such a uniform practice, then federal habeas courts could assume that any unaddressed federal claim was simply overlooked.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNo such assumption is warranted, however, because it is not the uniform practice of busy state courts to discuss separately every single claim to which a defendant makes even a passing reference.  On the contrary, there are several situations in which state courts frequently take a different course.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, there are circumstances in which a line of state precedent is viewed as fully incorporating a related federal constitutional right.  In California, for example, the state constitutional right to be present at trial \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is generally coextensive with\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the protections of the Federal Constitution.  People v. Butler, 46 Cal. 4th 847, 861, 209 P.\xc2\xa03d 596, 606 (2009); see also, e.g., Commonwealth v. Prunty, 462 Mass. 295, 305, n.\xc2\xa014, 968 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 361, 371, n. 14 (2012) (standard for racial discrimination in juror selection \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is the same under the Federal Constitution and the [Massachusetts] Declaration of Rights\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); State v. Krause, 817 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 136, 144 (Minn. 2012) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The due process protection provided under the Minnesota Constitution is identical to the due proces[s] guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); State v. Engelhardt, 280 Kan. 113, 122, 119 P.\xc2\xa03d 1148, 1158 (2005) (observing that a Kansas statute is \xe2\x80\x9canalytically and functionally identical to the requirements under the Confrontation Clause and the Due Process Clause of the federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this situation, a state appellate court may regard its discussion of the state precedent as sufficient to cover a claim based on the related federal right.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, a state court may not regard a fleeting reference to a provision of the Federal Constitution or federal precedent as sufficient to raise a separate federal claim.  Federal courts of appeals refuse to take cognizance of arguments that are made in passing without proper development.  See, e.g., United States v. Cloud, 680 F.\xc2\xa03d 396, 409, n.\xc2\xa07 (CA4 2012); United States v. Mitchell, 502 F.\xc2\xa03d 931, 953, n.\xc2\xa02 (CA9 2007); United States v. Charles, 469 F.\xc2\xa03d 402, 408 (CA5 2006); Reynolds v. Wagner, 128 F.\xc2\xa03d 166, 178 (CA3 1997); Carducci v. Regan, 714 F.\xc2\xa02d 171, 177 (CADC 1983).  State appellate courts are entitled to follow the same practice.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, there are instances in which a state court may simply regard a claim as too insubstantial to merit discussion.  Indeed, the California Court of Appeal has expressly stated that it has no obligation to address claims that lack arguable merit.  See People v. Rojas, 118 Cal. App. 3d 278, 290, 173 Cal. Rptr. 91, 93 (1981).  That court has explained: \xe2\x80\x9cIn an era in which there is concern that the quality of justice is being diminished by appellate backlog with its attendant delay, which in turn contributes to a lack of finality of judgment, it behooves us as an appellate court to \xe2\x80\x98get to the heart\xe2\x80\x99 of cases presented and dispose of them expeditiously.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  See also People v. Burke, 18 Cal. App. 72, 79, 122 P. 435, 439 (1912) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe author of an opinion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must follow his own judgment as to the degree of elaboration to be accorded to the treatment of any proposition and as to the questions which are worthy of notice at all\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  While it is preferable for an appellate court in a criminal case to list all of the arguments that the court recognizes as having been properly presented, see R. Aldisert, Opinion Writing 95\xe2\x80\x9396 (3d ed. 2012), federal courts have no authority to impose mandatory opinion-writing standards on state courts, see Coleman v. Thompson, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722, \n739 (1991)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have no power to tell state courts how they must write their opinions\xe2\x80\x9d).  The caseloads shouldered by many state appellate courts are very heavy,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and the opinions issued by these courts must be read with that factor in mind.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, because it is by no means uncommon for a state court to fail to address separately a federal claim that the court has not simply overlooked, we see no sound reason for failing to apply the Richter presumption in cases like the one now before us.  When a state court rejects a federal claim without expressly addressing that claim, a federal habeas court must presume that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits\xe2\x80\x94but that presumption can in some limited circumstances be rebutted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNot satisfied with a strong but rebuttable presumption, petitioner urges us to make the presumption irrebuttable.  Specifically, petitioner contends that a state court must be regarded as having adjudicated a federal claim on the merits if the state court addressed \xe2\x80\x9cthe substance of [an] asserted trial error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 27.  Suppose, for example, that a defendant claimed in state court that something that occurred at trial violated both a provision of the Federal Constitution and a related provision of state law, and suppose further that the state court, in denying relief, made no reference to federal law.  According to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument, a federal habeas court would be required to proceed on the assumption that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis argument goes too far.  To be sure, if the state-law rule subsumes the federal standard\xe2\x80\x94that is, if it is at least as protective as the federal standard\xe2\x80\x94then the federal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated on the merits.  See Early v. Packer, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 3, \n8 (2002)\n (per\xc2\xa0curiam).  But what if, for example, in at least some circumstances the state standard is less protective?  Or what if the state standard is quite different from the federal standard, and the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s papers made no effort to develop the basis for the federal claim?  What if a provision of the Federal Constitution or a federal precedent was simply mentioned in passing in a footnote or was buried in a string cite?  In such circumstances, the presumption that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits may be rebutted\xe2\x80\x94either by the habeas petitioner (for the purpose of showing that the claim should be considered by the federal court de\xc2\xa0novo) or by the State (for the purpose of showing that the federal claim should be regarded as procedurally defaulted).  See Coleman, supra, at 739 (rebuttable presumption of no independent and adequate state ground applies so long as \xe2\x80\x9cit fairly appears that a state court judgment rested primarily on federal law or was interwoven with federal law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, while the Richter presumption is a strong one that may be rebutted only in unusual circumstances, it is not irrebuttable.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  \xe2\x80\x9cPer se rules should not be applied .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in situations where the generalization is incorrect as an empirical matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 737, and an irrebuttable presumption that state courts never overlook federal claims would occasionally miss the mark.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe language of \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d) makes it clear that this provision applies only when a federal claim was \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits in State court.\xe2\x80\x9d  A judgment is normally said to have been rendered \xe2\x80\x9con the merits\xe2\x80\x9d only if it was \xe2\x80\x9cdelivered after the court .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. heard and evaluated the evidence and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 substantive arguments.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1199 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added).  And as used in this context, the word \xe2\x80\x9cmerits\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he intrinsic rights and wrongs of a case as determined by matters of substance, in distinction from matters of form.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1540 (2d ed. 1954) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., 9 Oxford English Dictionary 634 (2d ed. 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe intrinsic \xe2\x80\x98rights and wrongs\xe2\x80\x99 of the matter, in contradistinction to extraneous points such as the competence of the tribunal or the like\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 897 (1967) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe intrinsic right and wrong of a matter, as a law case, unobscured by procedural details, technicalities, personal feelings, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  If a federal claim is rejected as a result of sheer inadvertence, it has not been evaluated based on the intrinsic right and wrong of the matter.  Justice Scalia is surely correct that such claims have been adjudicated and present federal questions we may review, post, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, but it does not follow that they have been adjudicated \xe2\x80\x9con the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  By having us nevertheless apply AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review in such cases, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument would improperly excise \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x99s on-the-merits requirement. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s preferred approach follow inexorably from AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential architecture.  Even while leaving \xe2\x80\x9cprimary responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d for adjudicating federal claims to the States, Woodford v. Visciotti, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19, \n27 (2002)\n (per\xc2\xa0curiam), AEDPA permits de\xc2\xa0novo review in those rare cases when a state court decides a federal claim in a way that is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d clearly established Supreme Court precedent, see Panetti v. Quarterman, \n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 930, \n953 (2007)\n.  When the evidence leads very clearly to the conclusion that a federal claim was inadvertently overlooked in state court, \xc2\xa72254(d) entitles the prisoner to an unencumbered opportunity to make his case before a fed- eral judge.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe are not persuaded that applying a rebuttable presumption in this context will be unduly burdensome for federal courts.

Cleveland held that a California trial court, \xe2\x80\x9cif put on notice that a juror is not participating in delib- erations,\xe2\x80\x9d may \xe2\x80\x9cconduct \xe2\x80\x98whatever inquiry is reasonably necessary to determine\xe2\x80\x99 whether such grounds exist and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. discharge the juror if it appears as a \xe2\x80\x98demonstrable reality\xe2\x80\x99 that the juror is unable or unwilling to deliberate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 484, 21 P. 3d, at 1237 (citations omitted).

After the California Court of Appeal rendered its decision, Williams neither petitioned that court for rehearing nor argued in the subsequent state and federal proceedings that the state court had failed to adjudicate her \n \nSixth Amendment claim on the merits.  The possibility that the California Court of Appeal had simply overlooked Williams\xe2\x80\x99 \n \nSixth Amendment claim apparently did not occur to anyone until that issue was raised by two judges during the oral argument in the Ninth Circuit.  See 646 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 638, n.\xc2\xa07.

S. C. \xc2\xa72254(d).  I disagree, however, that one of the grounds on which the rebuttal may rely is that the federal claim was \xe2\x80\x9cinadvertently overlooked.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13.  In my view the rebuttal must consist of a show- ing, based on the explicit text of the court\xe2\x80\x99s order, or upon standard practice and understanding in the jurisdiction with regard to the meaning of an ambiguous text, that the judgment did not purport to decide the federal question.  \xe2\x80\x9cDecided after due consideration\xe2\x80\x9d is not, and has never been, the meaning of the legal term of art \xe2\x80\x9cdecided on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d and giving it that meaning burdens our lower courts with an unusual subjective inquiry that demeans state courts and will be a fertile source of litigation and delay.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, a habeas petitioner receives de novo review if he can prove that the state court, although addressing his state claim, overlooked his federal claim.  A nonexhaustive list of factors, we are told, may bear on the analysis:  state-court opinion-writing practices, ante, at 8, 9; state-law precedents and whether and how they incorporate federal law, ante, at 8; substantiality of the federal claim, ante, at 9; citations to federal cases in state-court opinions (or citations to state cases that contain citations to federal cases), ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314; the degree of similarity between the federal and state claim, ante, at 15; a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clitigation strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316; and other clues that may possibly illuminate the inner thought processes of a state-court judge.  Only after conducting its own detective work does the Court conclude that the federal claim was not overlooked in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis complex exercise is unnecessary.  A judgment that denies relief necessarily denies\xe2\x80\x94and thus adjudicates\xe2\x80\x94all the claims a petitioner has raised.  See 1 H. Black, Law of Judgments \xc2\xa71, p. 2 (2d ed. 1902) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he judgment necessarily affirms, or else denies, that [an alleged] duty or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. liability rests upon the person against whom the aid of the law is invoked\xe2\x80\x9d); id., \xc2\xa724, at 37.  The judgment itself gives conclusive expression that the claims have been con- sidered and rejected\xe2\x80\x94whatever the individual judge might have been pondering (or not pondering).  At common law the formal language traditionally preceding the announcement of a court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was \xe2\x80\x9cconsideratum est per curiam\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is considered by the court\xe2\x80\x9d).  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 349\xe2\x80\x93350 (9th ed. 2009); 1 Bouvier\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 619 (8th ed. 1914).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court maintains that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a federal claim is rejected as a result of sheer inadvertence, it has not been evalu- ated based on the intrinsic right and wrong of the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 12.  Perhaps not, but it nonetheless may have been rejected \xe2\x80\x9con the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  That phrase does not suggest a line between a considered rejection of a claim and an unconsidered, inadequately considered, or inadvertent rejection.  Rather, it refers to a \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination that there exist or do not exist grounds entitling a petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d to relief under his claim, as contrasted with a \xe2\x80\x9cdenial for such rea- sons as failure to exhaust, procedural default, or statute-of-limitations bar.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, \n\n545 U. S. 524\n, n.\xc2\xa04 (2005).  An \xe2\x80\x9cadjudication on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cbest understood by stating what it is not: it is not a resolution of a claim on procedural grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Muth v. Frank, 412 F.\xc2\xa03d 808, 815 (CA7 2005).  And, as we have affirmed and reaffirmed recently, where a claim has been denied, but it is unclear from the record whether the denial was on the merits or on another basis, we presume the former.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310) (citing Harris v. Reed, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 255, \n265 (1989)\n); see also Coleman v.

We have long applied it, for example, in determining whether a claim is barred by res judicata:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cOrdinarily, such a question is answered by a mere inspection of the decree\xe2\x80\x94the presumption being that a dismissal in equity, without qualifying words, is a final decision on the merits.  That presumption of finality . . . disappears whenever the record shows that the court did not pass upon the merits but dismissed the bill because of a want of jurisdiction, for want of parties, because the suit was brought prematurely, because the plaintiff had a right to file a subsequent bill on the same subject-matter, or on any other ground not going to the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Swift v. McPherson, \n\n232 U. S. 51\n\xe2\x80\x9356 (1914) (emphasis added); see also Hubbell v. United States, \n\n171 U. S. 203, \n207 (1898)\n; Durant v. Essex Co., 7 Wall. 107, 109 (1868).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe also apply a presumption of merits determination in the sense I have described for purposes of \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257, which imposes a federal-question requirement as a condition of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction.  Michigan v. Long, \n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1032\n\xe2\x80\x931041 (1983).  Indeed, the application of the presumption in direct-review cases was the genesis of the presumption in federal habeas cases.  The condition for federal habeas\xe2\x80\x94that the federal question must have been addressed on the merits by the state courts\xe2\x80\x94did not originate with the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act in 1996, but was established as early as 1977 in Wainwright v. Sykes, \n\n433 U.\xc2\xa0S. 72\n\xe2\x80\x9387.  We described the assessment of whether that requirement was met as presenting \xe2\x80\x9cthe same problem of ambiguity that this Court resolved in Michigan v. Long.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harris, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 262.  And indeed, we described the habeas requirement as an application of the \xe2\x80\x9cadequate and independent state ground doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d which inquires whether a \xe2\x80\x9cfinding of procedural default will bar federal habeas review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  It is of course unthinkable that a state-court resolution of a federal question will escape our review under \xc2\xa71257 if it is inadvertent rather than intentional.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven this background, there is no reason to believe that AEDPA established a new and peculiar regime in which the federal habeas court must make one assessment of whether the federal question has been decided \xe2\x80\x9con the merits\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of determining its authority to review the question (a Long assessment which counts, as \xc2\xa71257 cases count, inadvertent resolution of a federal question); and then must proceed to a different assessment of \xe2\x80\x9con the merits\xe2\x80\x9d (one that does not count inadvertent resolution) for purposes of determining whether deference to the state-court judgment is required.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut, it will be argued, how can a court \xe2\x80\x9cdefer\xe2\x80\x9d to a state-court determination that was in fact never made?  Must not one first be sure it exists before one can accord it respect?  The answer is no; according respect only to determinations that have for-sure been made is demonstrably not the scheme that AEDPA envisions.  Federal ha- beas courts defer to state determinations that may in fact never have been made whenever they find a summary, unexplained rejection of a federal claim to be sustainable (e.g., not contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by this Court).  The validating basis that the federal habeas court posits need not have been the one that the state court actually relied upon; the state court may well have applied a theory that was flat-out wrong, and may not have made the subsidiary determinations (including factual assessments) necessary to support the correct theory.  That does not matter.  For what is accorded deference is not the state court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning but the state court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, which is presumed to be supported by whatever valid support was available.  See Harrington, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12) (\xe2\x80\x9cUnder \xc2\xa72254(d) a habeas court must determine what arguments or theories supported or, as here, could have supported, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the deference with regard to the basis of decision is much more \xe2\x80\x9cblind\xe2\x80\x9d than the deference I assert is necessary in the present case.  I demand a state-court statement (contained in the unqualified terms of its judgment) that it has rejected the federal claim; I sim- ply refuse to question the veracity of that statement.  By contrast, no statement is ever even required that the state court relied upon the theory of federal law that the habeas court finds validating.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI doubt that the Court is prepared to abide by its novel interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9con the merits\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa72254(d).  Imagine that the state court formulated its judgment as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cAll claims raised by the defendant have been considered and denied.\xe2\x80\x9d  I cannot believe that the Court would require federal courts to test the veracity of that statement.  Yet, as we have described, that is precisely what an (unadorned) judgment denying relief already conveys.  Although the Court acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]e have no power to tell state courts how they must write their opinions,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9, its analysis would turn solely on how the order of judgment is styled.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tResolution of this case is direct: Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim was \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d because the state court rendered a judgment rejecting all her claims, and the judgment gave no indication (such as a statement that it was \xe2\x80\x9cwithout prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d) that it was based on a procedural or other nonmerits ground.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s novel resolution of the \xe2\x80\x9con the merits\xe2\x80\x9d question produces a clear enough answer in this case.  The weight of the evidence demonstrated that it was \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly unlikely\xe2\x80\x9d that the state court overlooked the federal claim.  Ante, at 16.  But such ready resolution will not be commonplace.  Consider another case, where the federal and state claims are not related, where there is no relevant state precedent referring to federal law, where state law might be interpreted as less defendant-friendly than the federal standard, or where a confluence of such factors exists.  The answer to whether the federal claim has been \xe2\x80\x9cevaluated based on the intrinsic right and wrong of the matter\xe2\x80\x9d is anybody\xe2\x80\x99s guess.  One thing, however, is certain: The Court\xe2\x80\x99s case-by-case approach will guarantee protracted litigation over whether a state-court judge was aware of a claim on the day he rejected it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court tells us not to worry about a flood of liti- gation, because the Courts of Appeals have previously al- lowed arguments from petitioners that the state courts overlooked their federal claims.  Ante, at 13, and n.\xc2\xa04 (citing cases).  But many of those cases applied a much simpler (and even less justifiable) test than the one adopted today: if the federal claim was not addressed in the opinion, then it was not adjudicated on the merits.  See, e.g., Lyell v. Renico, 470 F.\xc2\xa03d 1177, 1181\xe2\x80\x931182 (CA6 2006); Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F. 3d 39, 47 (CA1 2001).  And even those courts that attempted to \xe2\x80\x9cdivin[e] the thought processes of\xe2\x80\x9d the judge limited their inquiry to \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a state court has said.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brown v. Luebbers, 371 F. 3d 458, 461 (CA8 2004) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F.\xc2\xa03d 597, 606 (CA3 2002).  By contrast, the Court today asks whether a judge thought about the merits of an unaddressed claim, and leaves on the table any evidence relevant to that inquiry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis newly-sponsored enterprise of probing the judicial mind is inappropriately intrusive upon state-court processes.  Are federal habeas courts now to consider evidence relevant to the internal deliberations of the state judiciary?  Can a petitioner introduce testimony showing that state-court judges\xe2\x80\x94because of time constraints, heavy caseloads, or other reasons\xe2\x80\x94fail to read the briefs but leave that to their assistants, whose recommendations they rarely reject?  Or testimony showing that, typically, only one judge on the state-court appellate panel reads the briefs and considers all the claims, and the others simply join the drafted order?  Has there been an \xe2\x80\x9cadjudication on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d then?
