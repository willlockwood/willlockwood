QUON<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">CITY OF ONTARIO, CALIFORNIA, et\xc2\xa0al. <em>v</em>. QUON et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x931332.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 19, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 17, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner Ontario (hereinafter City) acquired alphanumeric pagers able to send and receive text messages.  Its contract with its service provider, Arch Wireless, provided for a monthly limit on the number of characters each pager could send or receive, and specified that usage exceeding that number would result in an additional fee.  The City issued the pagers to respondent Quon and other officers in its police department (OPD), also a petitioner here.  When Quon and others exceeded their monthly character limits for several months running, petitioner Scharf, OPD\xe2\x80\x99s chief, sought to determine whether the existing limit was too low, <em>i.e.,</em> whether the officers had to pay fees for sending work-related messages or, conversely, whether the overages were for personal messages.  After Arch Wireless provided transcripts of Quon\xe2\x80\x99s and another employee\xe2\x80\x99s August and September 2002 text messages, it was discovered that many of Quon\xe2\x80\x99s messages were not work related, and some were sexually explicit.  Scharf referred the matter to OPD\xe2\x80\x99s internal affairs division.  The investigating officer used Quon\xe2\x80\x99s work schedule to redact from his transcript any messages he sent while off duty, but the transcript showed that few of his on-duty messages related to police business.  Quon was disciplined for violating OPD rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He and the other respondents\xe2\x80\x94each of whom had exchanged text messages with Quon during August and September\xe2\x80\x94filed this suit, alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment rights and the federal Stored Communications Act (SCA) by obtaining and reviewing the transcript of Quon\xe2\x80\x99s pager messages, and that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the transcript.  The District Court denied respondents summary judgment on the constitutional claims, relying on the plurality opinion in <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> v. <em>Ortega</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/709/index.html">480 U. S. 709</a>, to determine that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his messages.  Whether the audit was nonetheless reasonable, the court concluded, turned on whether Scharf used it for the improper purpose of determining if Quon was using his pager to waste time, or for the legitimate purpose of determining the efficacy of existing character limits to ensure that officers were not paying hidden work-related costs.  After the jury concluded that Scharf\xe2\x80\x99s intent was legitimate, the court granted petitioners summary judgment on the ground they did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  Although it agreed that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the appeals court concluded that the search was not reasonable even though it was conducted on a legitimate, work-related rationale.  The opinion pointed to a host of means less intrusive than the audit that Scharf could have used.  The court further concluded that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by giving the City the transcript.     </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because the search of Quon\xe2\x80\x99s text messages was reasonable, petitioners did not violate respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Fourth Amendment rights, and the Ninth Circuit erred by concluding otherwise.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Amendment guarantees a person\xe2\x80\x99s privacy, dignity, and security against arbitrary and invasive governmental acts, without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function.  <em>Skinner</em> v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\xe2\x80\x99 Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/602/index.html">489 U. S. 602</a>, 613\xe2\x80\x93614.  It applies as well when the government acts in its capacity as an employer.  <em>Treasury Employees</em> v. <em>Von Raab</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/656/index.html">489 U. S. 656</a>, 665.  The Members of the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> Court<em> </em>disagreed on the proper analytical framework for Fourth Amendment claims against government employers.  A four-Justice plurality concluded that the correct analysis has two steps.  First, because \xe2\x80\x9csome [government] offices may be so open \xe2\x80\xa6 that no expectation of privacy is reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d a court must consider \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he operational realities of the workplace\xe2\x80\x9d to determine if an employee\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights are implicated.  480 U. S., at 718.  Second, where an employee has a legitimate privacy expectation, an employer\xe2\x80\x99s intrusion on that expectation \xe2\x80\x9cfor noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 725\xe2\x80\x93726.  Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment, would have dispensed with the \xe2\x80\x9coperational realities\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry and concluded \xe2\x80\x9cthat the offices of government employees \xe2\x80\xa6 are [generally] covered by Fourth Amendment protections,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 731, but he would also have held \xe2\x80\x9cthat government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules\xe2\x80\x94searches of the sort that are regarded as  reasonable and normal in the private-employer context\xe2\x80\x94do not violate the \xe2\x80\xa6 Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 732.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Even assuming that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the search was reasonable under both <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> approaches, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s and Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Court does not resolve the parties\xe2\x80\x99 disagreement over Quon\xe2\x80\x99s privacy expectation.  Prudence counsels caution before the facts in this case are used to establish far-reaching premises that define the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations of employees using employer-provided communication devices.  Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and information transmission are evident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as proper behavior.  At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms, and the law\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of them, will evolve.  Because it is therefore preferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds, the Court assumes, <em>arguendo,</em> that: (1) Quon had a reasonable privacy expectation; (2) petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 review of the transcript constituted a Fourth Amendment search; and (3) the principles applicable to a government employer\xe2\x80\x99s search of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s physical office apply as well in the electronic sphere.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 warrantless review of Quon\xe2\x80\x99s pager transcript was reasonable under the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach because it was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope.  See 480 U. S., at 726.  There were \xe2\x80\x9creasonable grounds for [finding it] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> in that Chief Scharf had ordered the audit to determine whether the City\xe2\x80\x99s contractual character limit was sufficient to meet the City\xe2\x80\x99s needs.  It was also \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related to the objectives of the search,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> because both the City and OPD had a legitimate interest in ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or, on the other hand, that the City was not paying for extensive personal communications.  Reviewing the transcripts was an efficient and expedient way to determine whether either of these factors caused Quon\xe2\x80\x99s overages.  And the review was also not \xe2\x80\x9cexcessively intrusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> Although Quon had exceeded his monthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested transcripts for only August and September 2002 in order to obtain a large enough sample to decide the character limits\xe2\x80\x99 efficaciousness, and all the messages that Quon sent while off duty were redacted.  And from OPD\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, the fact that Quon likely had only a limited privacy expectation lessened the risk that the review would intrude on highly private details of Quon\xe2\x80\x99s life.  Similarly, because the City had a legitimate reason for the search and it was not excessively intrusive in light of that justification, the search would be \xe2\x80\x9cregarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer context\xe2\x80\x9d and thereby satisfy the approach of Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, <em>id.,</em> at 732.  Conversely, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cleast intrusive\xe2\x80\x9d means approach was inconsistent with controlling precedents.  See<em>, e.g.,</em> <em>Vernonia School Dist. 47J</em> v. <em>Acton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/646/index.html">515 U. S. 646</a>, 663.  Pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Whether the other respondents can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their text messages to Quon need not be resolved.  They argue that because the search was unreasonable as to Quon, it was also unreasonable as to them, but they make no corollary argument that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be unreasonable as to them.  Given this litigating position and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Quon, these other respondents cannot prevail.

The employee contends that the privacy of the messages is protected by the ban on \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable searches and seizures\xe2\x80\x9d found in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Mapp</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/index.html">367 U. S. 643</a> (1961).  Though the case touches issues of far-\nreaching significance, the Court concludes it can be resolved by settled principles determining when a search is reasonable.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p>\n\nA</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The City of Ontario (City) is a political subdivision of the State of California.  The case arose out of incidents in 2001 and 2002 when respondent Jeff Quon was employed by the Ontario Police Department (OPD).  He was a police sergeant and member of OPD\xe2\x80\x99s Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team.  The City, OPD, and OPD\xe2\x80\x99s Chief, Lloyd Scharf, are petitioners here.  As will be discussed, two respondents share the last name Quon.  In this opinion \xe2\x80\x9cQuon\xe2\x80\x9d refers to Jeff Quon, for the relevant events mostly revolve around him.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In October 2001, the City acquired 20 alphanumeric pagers capable of sending and receiving text messages.  Arch Wireless Operating Company provided wireless service for the pagers.  Under the City\xe2\x80\x99s service contract with Arch Wireless, each pager was allotted a limited number of characters sent or received each month.  Usage in excess of that amount would result in an additional fee.  The City issued pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team members in order to help the SWAT Team mobilize and respond to emergency situations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before acquiring the pagers, the City announced a \xe2\x80\x9cComputer Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy\xe2\x80\x9d (Computer Policy) that applied to all employees.  Among other provisions, it specified that the City \xe2\x80\x9creserves the right to monitor and log all network activity including e-mail and Internet use, with or without notice.  Users should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a.  In March 2000, Quon signed a statement acknowledging that he had read and understood the Computer Policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Computer Policy did not apply, on its face, to text messaging.  Text messages share similarities with e-mails, but the two differ in an important way.  In this case, for instance, an e-mail sent on a City computer was transmitted through the City\xe2\x80\x99s own data servers, but a text message sent on one of the City\xe2\x80\x99s pagers was transmitted using wireless radio frequencies from an individual pager to a receiving station owned by Arch Wireless.  It was routed through Arch Wireless\xe2\x80\x99 computer network, where it remained until the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s pager or cellular telephone was ready to receive the message, at which point Arch Wireless transmitted the message from the transmitting station nearest to the recipient.  After delivery, Arch Wireless retained a copy on its computer servers.  The message did not pass through computers owned by the City.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Computer Policy did not cover text messages by its explicit terms, the City made clear to employees, including Quon, that the City would treat text messages the same way as it treated e-mails.  At an April 18, 2002, staff meeting at which Quon was present, Lieutenant Steven Duke, the OPD officer responsible for the City\xe2\x80\x99s contract with Arch Wireless, told officers that messages sent on the pagers \xe2\x80\x9care considered e-mail messages.  This means that [text] messages would fall under the City\xe2\x80\x99s policy as public information and [would be] eligible for auditing.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 30.  Duke\xe2\x80\x99s comments were put in writing in a memorandum sent on April 29, 2002, by Chief Scharf to Quon and other City personnel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Within the first or second billing cycle after the pagers were distributed, Quon exceeded his monthly text message character allotment.  Duke told Quon about the overage, and reminded him that messages sent on the pagers were \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered e-mail and could be audited.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 40.  Duke said, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cit was not his intent to audit [an] employee\xe2\x80\x99s text messages to see if the overage [was] due to work related transmissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Duke suggested that Quon could reimburse the City for the overage fee rather than have Duke audit the messages.  Quon wrote a check to the City for the overage.  Duke offered the same arrangement to other employees who incurred overage fees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the next few months, Quon exceeded his character limit three or four times.  Each time he reimbursed the City.  Quon and another officer again incurred overage fees for their pager usage in August 2002.  At a meeting in October, Duke told Scharf that he had become \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tired of being a bill collector.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 91.  Scharf decided to determine whether the existing character limit was too low\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether officers such as Quon were having to pay fees for sending work-related messages\xe2\x80\x94or if the overages were for personal messages.  Scharf told Duke to request transcripts of text messages sent in August and September by Quon and the other employee who had exceeded the character allowance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At Duke\xe2\x80\x99s request, an administrative assistant employed by OPD contacted Arch Wireless.  After verifying that the City was the subscriber on the accounts, Arch Wireless provided the desired transcripts.  Duke reviewed the transcripts and discovered that many of the messages sent and received on Quon\xe2\x80\x99s pager were not work related, and some were sexually explicit.  Duke reported his findings to Scharf, who, along with Quon\xe2\x80\x99s immediate supervisor, reviewed the transcripts himself.  After his review, Scharf referred the matter to OPD\xe2\x80\x99s internal affairs division for an investigation into whether Quon was violating OPD rules by pursuing personal matters while on duty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The officer in charge of the internal affairs review was Sergeant Patrick McMahon.  Before conducting a review, McMahon used Quon\xe2\x80\x99s work schedule to redact the transcripts in order to eliminate any messages Quon sent while off duty.  He then reviewed the content of the messages Quon sent during work hours.  McMahon\xe2\x80\x99s report noted that Quon sent or received 456 messages during work hours in the month of August 2002, of which no more than 57 were work related; he sent as many as 80 messages during a single day at work; and on an average workday, Quon sent or received 28 messages, of which only 3 were related to police business.  The report concluded that Quon had violated OPD rules.  Quon was allegedly disciplined.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Raising claims under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983; 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72701 <em>et seq.</em>, popularly known as the Stored Communications Act (SCA); and California law, Quon filed suit against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  Arch Wireless and an individual not relevant here were also named as defendants.  Quon was joined in his suit by another plaintiff who is not a party before this Court and by the other respondents, each of whom exchanged text messages with Quon during August and September 2002: Jerilyn Quon, Jeff Quon\xe2\x80\x99s then-wife, from whom he was separated; April Florio, an OPD employee with whom Jeff Quon was romantically involved; and Steve Trujillo, another member of the OPD SWAT Team.  Among the allegations in the complaint was that petitioners violated respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Fourth Amendment rights and the SCA by obtaining and reviewing the transcript of Jeff Quon\xe2\x80\x99s pager messages and that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by turning over the transcript to the City.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The District Court granted Arch Wireless\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment on the SCA claim but denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment claims.  <em>Quon</em> v. <em>Arch Wireless Operating Co., </em>445 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1116 (CD Cal. 2006).    Relying on the plurality opinion in <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> v. <em>Ortega</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/709/index.html">480 U. S. 709</a>, 711 (1987), the District Court determined that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his text messages.  Whether the audit of the text messages was nonetheless reasonable, the District Court concluded, turned on Chief Scharf\xe2\x80\x99s intent: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the purpose for the audit was to determine if Quon was using his pager to \xe2\x80\x98play games\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98waste time,\xe2\x80\x99 then the audit was not constitutionally reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d; but if the audit\xe2\x80\x99s purpose \xe2\x80\x9cwas to determine the efficacy of the existing character limits to ensure that officers were not paying hidden work-related costs, \xe2\x80\xa6 no constitutional violation occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  445 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1146.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court held a jury trial to determine the purpose of the audit.  The jury concluded that Scharf ordered the audit to determine the efficacy of the character limits.  The District Court accordingly held that petitioners did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  It entered judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part.  529 F.\xc2\xa03d 892 (2008).  The panel agreed with the District Court that Jeff Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages but disagreed with the District Court about whether the search was reasonable.  Even though the search was conducted for \xe2\x80\x9ca legitimate work-related rationale,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals concluded, it \xe2\x80\x9cwas not reasonable in scope.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 908.  The panel disagreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s observation that \xe2\x80\x9cthere were no less-intrusive means\xe2\x80\x9d that Chief Scharf could have used \xe2\x80\x9cto verify the efficacy of the 25,000 character limit \xe2\x80\xa6 without intruding on [respondents\xe2\x80\x99] Fourth Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 908\xe2\x80\x93909.  The opinion pointed to a \xe2\x80\x9chost of simple ways\xe2\x80\x9d that the chief could have used instead of the audit, such as warning Quon at the beginning of the month that his future messages would be audited, or asking Quon himself to redact the transcript of his messages.  <em>Id.,</em> at 909.  The Court of Appeals further concluded that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by turning over the transcript to the City.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing en banc.  <em>Quon</em> v. <em>Arch Wireless Operating Co.,</em> 554 F.\xc2\xa03d 769 (2009).

A majority of the Court further agreed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable for government employers.  <em>Id.,</em> at 725 (plurality opinion) (quoting <em>New Jersey</em> v. <em>T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/325/index.html">469 U.

(quoting same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> Court did disagree on the proper analytical framework for Fourth Amendment claims against government employers.  A four-Justice plurality concluded that the correct analysis has two steps.  First, because \xe2\x80\x9csome government offices may be so open to fellow employees or the public that no expectation of privacy is reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 718, a court must consider \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he operational realities of the workplace\xe2\x80\x9d in order to determine whether an employee\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights are implicated, <em>id.,</em> at 717.  On this view, \xe2\x80\x9cthe question whether an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 718.  Next, where an employee has a legitimate privacy expectation, an employer\xe2\x80\x99s intrusion on that expectation \xe2\x80\x9cfor noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 725\xe2\x80\x93726.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment, outlined a different approach.  His opinion would have dispensed with an inquiry into \xe2\x80\x9coperational realities\xe2\x80\x9d and would conclude \xe2\x80\x9cthat the offices of government employees \xe2\x80\xa6 are covered by Fourth Amendment protections as a general matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 731.  But he would also have held \xe2\x80\x9cthat government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules\xe2\x80\x94searches of the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer context\xe2\x80\x94do not violate the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 732.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Later, in the <em>Von Raab </em>decision, the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9coperational realities\xe2\x80\x9d could diminish an employee\xe2\x80\x99s privacy expectations, and that this diminution could be taken into consideration when assessing the reasonableness of a workplace search.  489 U. S., at 671.  In the two decades since <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em>, however, the threshold test for determining the scope of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights has not been clarified further.  Here, though they disagree on whether Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy, both petitioners and respondents start from the premise that the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> plurality controls.  See Brief for Petitioners 22\xe2\x80\x9328; Brief for Respondents 25\xe2\x80\x9332.  It is not necessary to resolve whether that premise is correct.  The case can be decided by determining that the search was reasonable even assuming Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The two <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> approaches\xe2\x80\x94the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s and Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94therefore lead to the same result here.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before turning to the reasonableness of the search, it is instructive to note the parties\xe2\x80\x99 disagreement over whether Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The record does establish that OPD, at the outset, made it clear that pager messages were not considered private.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s Computer Policy stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]sers should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using\xe2\x80\x9d City computers.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a.  Chief Scharf\xe2\x80\x99s memo and Duke\xe2\x80\x99s statements made clear that this official policy extended to text messaging.  The disagreement, at least as respondents see the case, is over whether Duke\xe2\x80\x99s later statements overrode the official policy.  Respondents contend that because Duke told Quon that an audit would be unnecessary if Quon paid for the overage, Quon reasonably could expect that the contents of his messages would remain private.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At this point, were we to assume that inquiry into \xe2\x80\x9coperational realities\xe2\x80\x9d were called for, compare <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em>, 480 U. S., at 717 (plurality opinion), with<em> id.,</em> at 730\xe2\x80\x93731 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see also <em>id.,</em> at 737\xe2\x80\x93738 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), it would be necessary to ask whether Duke\xe2\x80\x99s statements could be taken as announcing a change in OPD policy, and if so, whether he had, in fact or appearance, the authority to make such a change and to guarantee the privacy of text messaging.  It would also be necessary to consider whether a review of messages sent on police pagers, particularly those sent while officers are on duty, might be justified for other reasons, including performance evaluations, litigation concerning the lawfulness of police actions, and perhaps compliance with state open records laws.  See Brief for Petitioners 35\xe2\x80\x9340 (citing Cal. Public Records Act, Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa76250 <em>et seq.</em> (West 2008)).  These matters would all bear on the legitimacy of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s privacy expectation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court must proceed with care when considering the whole concept of privacy expectations in communications made on electronic equipment owned by a government employer.  The judiciary risks error by elaborating too fully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging technology before its role in society has become clear.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Olmstead</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/277/438/index.html">277 U. S. 438</a> (1928), overruled by <em>Katz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/index.html">389 U. S. 347</a>, 353 (1967).  In <em>Katz</em>, the Court relied on its own knowledge and experience to conclude that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in a telephone booth.  See <em>id.,</em> at 360\xe2\x80\x93361 (Harlan, J., concurring).  It is not so clear that courts at present are on so sure a ground.  Prudence counsels caution before the facts in the instant case are used to establish far-reaching premises that define the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations enjoyed by employees when using employer-provided communication devices. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and information transmission are evident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as proper behavior.  As one <em>amici </em>brief notes, many employers expect or at least tolerate personal use of such equipment by employees because it often increases worker efficiency.  See Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation et\xc2\xa0al. 16\xe2\x80\x9320.  Another <em>amicus </em>points out that the law is beginning to respond to these developments, as some States have recently passed statutes requiring employers to notify employees when monitoring their electronic communications.  See Brief for New York Intellectual Property Law Association 22 (citing Del. Code Ann., Tit. 19, \xc2\xa7705 (2005); Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa731\xe2\x80\x9348d (West 2003)).  At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms, and the law\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of them, will evolve.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the Court were certain that the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach were the right one, the Court would have difficulty predicting how employees\xe2\x80\x99 privacy expectations will be shaped by those changes or the degree to which society will be prepared to recognize those expectations as reasonable.  See 480 U. S., at 715.  Cell phone and text message communications are so pervasive that some persons may consider them to be essential means or necessary instruments for self-expression, even self-identification.  That might strengthen the case for an expectation of privacy.  On the other hand, the ubiquity of those devices has made them generally affordable, so one could counter that employees who need cell phones or similar devices for personal matters can purchase and pay for their own.  And employer policies concerning communications will of course shape the reasonable expectations of their employees, especially to the extent that such policies are clearly communicated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A broad holding concerning employees\xe2\x80\x99 privacy expectations vis-\xc3\x80-vis employer-provided technological equipment might have implications for future cases that cannot be predicted.  It is preferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds.  For present purposes we assume several propositions <em>arguendo:</em> First, Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the text messages sent on the pager provided to him by the City; second, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 review of the transcript constituted a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment; and third, the principles applicable to a government employer\xe2\x80\x99s search of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s physical office apply with at least the same force when the employer intrudes on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s privacy in the electronic sphere.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, petitioners did not necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment by obtaining and reviewing the transcripts.  Although as a general matter, warrantless searches \xe2\x80\x9care <em>per se</em> unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d there are \xe2\x80\x9ca few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d to that general rule.  <em>Katz,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 357.  The Court has held that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special needs\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the workplace justify one such exception.  <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em>, 480 U. S., at 725 (plurality opinion); <em>id., </em>at 732 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); <em>Von Raab,</em> 489 U. S., at 666\xe2\x80\x93667.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the approach of the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> plurality, when conducted for a \xe2\x80\x9cnoninvestigatory, work-related purpos[e]\xe2\x80\x9d or for the \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigatio[n] of work-related misconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d a government employer\xe2\x80\x99s warrantless search is reasonable if it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98justified at its inception\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and if \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the circumstances giving rise to the search.  480 U. S., at 725\xe2\x80\x93726.  The search here satisfied the standard of the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> plurality and was reasonable under that approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The search was justified at its inception because there were \xe2\x80\x9creasonable grounds for suspecting that the search [was] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 726.  As a jury found, Chief Scharf ordered the search in order to determine whether the character limit on the City\xe2\x80\x99s contract with Arch Wireless was sufficient to meet the City\xe2\x80\x99s needs.  This was, as the Ninth Circuit noted, a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate work-related rationale.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 908.  The City and OPD had a legitimate interest in ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or on the other hand that the City was not paying for extensive personal communications.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the scope of the search, reviewing the transcripts was reasonable because it was an efficient and expedient way to determine whether Quon\xe2\x80\x99s overages were the result of work-related messaging or personal use.  The review was also not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98excessively intrusive.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 726 (plurality opinion)<em>. </em> Although Quon had gone over his monthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested transcripts for only the months of August and September 2002.  While it may have been reasonable as well for OPD to review transcripts of all the months in which Quon exceeded his allowance, it was certainly reasonable for OPD to review messages for just two months in order to obtain a large enough sample to decide whether the character limits were efficacious.  And it is worth noting that during his internal affairs investigation, McMahon redacted all messages Quon sent while off duty, a measure which reduced the intrusiveness of any further review of the transcripts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, and again on the assumption that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his messages, the extent of an expectation is relevant to assessing whether the search was too intrusive.  See <em>Von Raab</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 671; cf. <em>Vernonia School Dist. 47J</em> v. <em>Acton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/646/index.html">515 U. S. 646</a>, 654\xe2\x80\x93657 (1995).  Even if he could assume some level of privacy would inhere in his messages, it would not have been reasonable for Quon to conclude that his messages were in all circumstances immune from scrutiny.  Quon was told that his messages were subject to auditing.  As a law enforcement officer, he would or should have known that his actions were likely to come under legal scrutiny, and that this might entail an analysis of his on-the-job communications.  Under the circumstances, a reasonable employee would be aware that sound management principles might require the audit of messages to determine whether the pager was being appropriately used.  Given that the City issued the pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team members in order to help them more quickly respond to crises\xe2\x80\x94and given that Quon had received no assurances of privacy\xe2\x80\x94Quon could have anticipated that it might be necessary for the City to audit pager messages to assess the SWAT Team\xe2\x80\x99s performance in particular emergency situations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From OPD\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, the fact that Quon likely had only a limited privacy expectation, with boundaries that we need not here explore, lessened the risk that the review would intrude on highly private details of Quon\xe2\x80\x99s life.  OPD\xe2\x80\x99s audit of messages on Quon\xe2\x80\x99s employer-provided pager was not nearly as intrusive as a search of his personal e-mail account or pager, or a wiretap on his home phone line, would have been.  That the search did reveal intimate details of Quon\xe2\x80\x99s life does not make it unreasonable, for under the circumstances a reasonable employer would not expect that such a review would intrude on such matters.  The search was permissible in its scope.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals erred in finding the search unreasonable.  It pointed to a \xe2\x80\x9chost of simple ways to verify the efficacy of the 25,000 character limit \xe2\x80\xa6 without intruding on [respondents\xe2\x80\x99] Fourth Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 909.  The panel suggested that Scharf \xe2\x80\x9ccould have warned Quon that for the month of September he was forbidden from using his pager for personal communications, and that the contents of all his messages would be reviewed to ensure the pager was used only for work-related purposes during that time frame.  Alternatively, if [OPD] wanted to review past usage, it could have asked Quon to count the characters himself, or asked him to redact personal messages and grant permission to [OPD] to review the redacted transcript.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach was inconsistent with controlling precedents.  This Court has \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly refused to declare that only the \xe2\x80\x98least intrusive\xe2\x80\x99 search practicable can be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vernonia</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 663; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty.</em> v. <em>Earls</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/822/index.html">536 U. S. 822</a>, 837 (2002); <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Lafayette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/640/index.html">462 U. S. 640</a>, 647 (1983).  That rationale \xe2\x80\x9ccould raise insuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/543/index.html">428 U. S. 543</a>, 557, n.\xc2\xa012 (1976), because \xe2\x80\x9cjudges engaged in <em>post hoc</em> evaluations of government conduct can almost always imagine some alternative means by which the objectives of the government might have been accomplished,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Skinner</em>, 489 U. S., at 629, n.\xc2\xa09 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  The analytic errors of the Court of Appeals in this case illustrate the necessity of this principle.  Even assuming there were ways that OPD could have performed the search that would have been less intrusive, it does not follow that the search as conducted was unreasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that the search was <em>per se</em> unreasonable in light of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the transcripts of Quon\xe2\x80\x99s text messages.  The merits of the SCA claim are not before us.  But even if the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that the SCA forbade Arch Wireless from turning over the transcripts, it does not follow that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 actions were unreasonable.  Respondents point to no authority for the proposition that the existence of statutory protection renders a search <em>per se</em> unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  And the precedents counsel otherwise.  See <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/164/index.html">553 U. S. 164</a>, 168 (2008) (search incident to an arrest that was illegal under state law was reasonable); <em>California</em> v. <em>Greenwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/35/index.html">486 U. S. 35</a>, 43 (1988) (rejecting argument that if state law forbade police search of individual\xe2\x80\x99s garbage the search would violate the Fourth Amendment).  Furthermore, respondents do not maintain that any OPD employee either violated the law him- or herself or knew or should have known that Arch Wireless, by turning over the transcript, would have violated the law.  The otherwise reasonable search by OPD is not rendered unreasonable by the assumption that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by turning over the transcripts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the search was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope, the search was reasonable under the approach of the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> plurality.  480 U. S., at 726.  For these same reasons\xe2\x80\x94that the employer had a legitimate reason for the search, and that the search was not excessively intrusive in light of that justification\xe2\x80\x94the Court also concludes that the search would be \xe2\x80\x9cregarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer context\xe2\x80\x9d and would satisfy the approach of Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence.  <em>Id.,</em> at 732.  The search was reasonable, and the Court of Appeals erred by holding to the contrary.  Petitioners did not violate Quon\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court must consider whether the search violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Jerilyn Quon, Florio, and Trujillo, the respondents who sent text messages to Jeff Quon.  Petitioners and respondents disagree whether a sender of a text message can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a message he knowingly sends to someone\xe2\x80\x99s employer-provided pager.  It is not necessary to resolve this question in order to dispose of the case, however.  Respondents argue that because \xe2\x80\x9cthe search was unreasonable as to Sergeant Quon, it was also unreasonable as to his correspondents.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 60 (some capitalization omitted; boldface deleted).  They make no corollary argument that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be unreasonable as to Quon\xe2\x80\x99s correspondents.  See <em>id.,</em> at 65\xe2\x80\x9366.  In light of this litigating position and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Jeff Quon, it necessarily follows that these other respondents cannot prevail.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the search was reasonable, petitioners did not violate respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Fourth Amendment rights, and the court below erred by concluding otherwise.

Justice Blackmun, writing for the four dissenting Justices in <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em>, agreed with Justice Scalia that an employee enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office.  480 U. S., at 737.  But he advocated a third approach to the reasonable expectation of privacy inquiry, separate from those proposed by the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor </em>plurality and by Justice Scalia, see <em>ante</em>, at 8.  Recognizing that it is particularly important to safeguard \xe2\x80\x9ca public employee\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of privacy in the workplace\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the \xe2\x80\x9creality of work in modern time,\xe2\x80\x9d 480 U. S., at 739, which lacks \xe2\x80\x9ctidy distinctions\xe2\x80\x9d between workplace and private activities, <em>ibid.</em>, Justice Blackmun argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe precise extent of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of privacy often turns on the nature of the search,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 738.  And he emphasized that courts should determine this expectation in light of the specific facts of each particular search, rather than by announcing a categorical standard.  See <em>id.</em>, at 741.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated at page 13 of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, it is clear that respondent Jeff Quon, as a law enforcement officer who served on a SWAT Team, should have understood that all of his work-related actions\xe2\x80\x94including all of his communications on his official pager\xe2\x80\x94were likely to be subject to public and legal scrutiny.  He therefore had only a limited expectation of privacy in relation to this particular audit of his pager messages.  Whether one applies the reasoning from Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, or Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s dissent*<footcall num="*"> in <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em>, the result is the same: The judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case must be reversed.</footcall></p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0I do not contend that Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is controlling under <em>Marks </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/index.html">430 U. S. 188</a>, 193 (1977), but neither is his approach to evaluating a reasonable expectation of privacy foreclosed by <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em>.  Indeed, his approach to that inquiry led to the conclusion, shared by Justice Scalia but not adopted by the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> plurality, that an employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office.  See <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> v. <em>Ortega</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/709/index.html"></a><a href="/us/480/709/index.html">480 U. S. 709</a>, 718 (1987) (plurality opinion).  But Justice Blackmun would have applied the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s warrant and probable-cause requirements to workplace investigatory searches, <em>id.</em>, at 732 (dissenting opinion), whereas a majority of the Court rejected that view, see <em>id.</em>, at 722, 725 (plurality opinion); <em>id.</em>, at 732 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  It was that analysis\xe2\x80\x94regarding the proper standard for evaluating a search when an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x94that produced the opposite result in the case.  This case does not implicate that debate because it does not involve an investigatory search.  The jury concluded that the purpose of the audit was to determine whether the character limits were sufficient for work-related messages.

I continue to believe that the \xe2\x80\x9coperational realities\xe2\x80\x9d rubric for determining the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s application to public employees invented by the plurality in <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> v. <em>Ortega</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/709/index.html">480 U. S. 709</a>, 717 (1987), is standardless and unsupported.  <em>Id.</em>, at 729\xe2\x80\x93732 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  In this case, the proper threshold inquiry should be not<em> </em>whether the Fourth Amendment applies to messages on <em>public</em> employees\xe2\x80\x99 employer-issued pagers, but whether it applies <em>in general </em>to such messages on employer-issued pagers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 731.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, however, there is no need to answer that threshold question.  Even accepting at face value Quon\xe2\x80\x99s and his co-plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims that the Fourth Amendment applies to their messages, the city\xe2\x80\x99s search was reasonable, and thus did not violate the Amendment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 726 (plurality opinion); <em>id.</em>, at 732 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Since it is unnecessary to decide whether the Fourth Amendment applies, it is unnecessary to resolve which approach in <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> controls: the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s or mine.*<footcall num="*">  That should end the matter.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court concedes as much, <em>ante</em>, at 9, 12\xe2\x80\x9317, yet it inexplicably interrupts its analysis with a recitation of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments concerning, and an excursus on the complexity and consequences of answering, that admittedly irrelevant threshold question, <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  That discussion is unnecessary.  (To whom do we owe an <em>additional</em> explanation for declining to decide an issue, once we have explained that it makes no difference?)  It also seems to me exaggerated.  Applying the Fourth Amendment to new technologies may sometimes be difficult, but when it is necessary to decide a case we have no choice.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s implication, <em>ante</em>, at 10, that where electronic privacy is concerned we should decide less than we otherwise would (that is, less than the principle of law necessary to resolve the case and guide private action)\xe2\x80\x94or that we should hedge our bets by concocting case-specific standards or issuing opaque opinions\xe2\x80\x94is in my view indefensible.  The-times-they-are-a-changin\xe2\x80\x99 is a feeble excuse for disregard of duty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Worse still, the digression is self-defeating.  Despite the Court\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that it is agnostic about the proper test, lower courts will likely read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s self-described \xe2\x80\x9cinstructive\xe2\x80\x9d expatiation on how the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor </em>plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach would apply here (if it applied), <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311, as a heavy-handed hint about how <em>they</em> should proceed.  Litigants will do likewise, using the threshold question whether the Fourth Amendment is even implicated as a basis for bombarding lower courts with arguments about employer policies, how they were communicated, and whether they were authorized, as well as the latest trends in employees\xe2\x80\x99 use of electronic media.  In short, in saying why it is not saying more, the Court says much more than it should.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s inadvertent boosting of the <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> plurality\xe2\x80\x99s standard is all the more ironic because, in fleshing out its fears that applying that test to new technologies will be too hard, the Court underscores the unworkability of that standard.  Any rule that requires evaluating whether a given gadget is a \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary instrumen[t] for self-expression, even self-identification,\xe2\x80\x9d on top of assessing the degree to which \xe2\x80\x9cthe law\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of [workplace norms has] evolve[d],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11, is (to put it mildly) unlikely to yield objective answers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Despite his disclaimer, <em>ante</em>, at 2, n.

There is room for reasonable debate as to which of the two approaches advocated by Justices whose votes supported the judgment in <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em>\xe2\x80\x94the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s and mine\xe2\x80\x94is controlling under <em>Marks</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/index.html">430 U.
