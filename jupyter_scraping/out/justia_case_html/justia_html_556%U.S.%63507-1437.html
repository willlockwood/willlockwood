After removing the case to Federal District Court under 28 U.

Agreeing that respondents had failed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be granted, the District Court dismissed the claim; declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims under \xc2\xa71367(c)(3), which allows such a course if the court \xe2\x80\x9chas dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d; and remanded the case to state court.

With respect to supplemental jurisdiction, a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over specified state-law claims, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71367(a), (c), and its decision whether to exercise that jurisdiction after dismissing every claim over which it had original jurisdiction is purely discretionary, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Osborn</em> v. <em>Haley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/225/index.html">549 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367(c).  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that appellate review of such an order is barred by \xc2\xa71447(d) because it viewed the remand order in this case as resting on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over the state-law claims.  We disagree and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2005, respondents filed a complaint against petitioner and others in California state court, alleging that petitioner had violated state and federal law in connection with a patent dispute.  Petitioner removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California pursuant to \xc2\xa71441(c), which allows removal of an \xe2\x80\x9centire case\xe2\x80\x9d when it includes at least one claim over which the federal district court has original jurisdiction.  Petitioner then filed a motion to dismiss the only federal claim in the lawsuit, which arose under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71961\xe2\x80\x931968, for failure to adequately allege a pattern of racketeering.  <em>HIF Bio, Inc.</em> v. <em>Yung Shin Pharmaceuticals Indus.

The District Court agreed that respondents had failed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be granted and dismissed the claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  The District Court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367(c)(3), which provides that a district court \xe2\x80\x9cmay decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court then remanded the case to state court as authorized by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Carnegie-Mellon Univ.</em> v. <em>Cohill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/343/index.html">484 U.

The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, finding that the remand order could \xe2\x80\x9cbe colorably characterized as a remand based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d and, therefore, could not be reviewed under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71447(c) and (d), which provide in part that remands for \xe2\x80\x9clack of subject matter jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cnot reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.,</em> at 667.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has not yet decided whether a district court\xe2\x80\x99s order remanding a case to state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is a remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for which appellate review is barred by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71447(c) and (d).

The question presented in this case is whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order, which rested on its decision declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over respondents\xe2\x80\x99 state-law claims, is a remand based on a \xe2\x80\x9clack of subject matter jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71447(c) and (d).  It is not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSubject matter jurisdiction defines the court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to hear a given type of case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/822/index.html">467 U.

This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent makes clear that whether a court has subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim is distinct from whether a court chooses to exercise that jurisdiction.  See, <em>e.g., Quackenbush</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 712 (holding that an abstention-based remand is not a remand for \xe2\x80\x9clack of subject matter jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71447(c) and (d)); <em>Ankenbrandt</em> v. <em>Richards</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/689/index.html">504 U.

See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71367(a), (c).  A district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to exercise that jurisdiction after dismissing every claim over which it had original jurisdiction is purely discretionary.  See \xc2\xa71367(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe district courts <em>may</em> decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim \xe2\x80\xa6 if \xe2\x80\xa6 the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added));  <em>Osborn</em> v. <em>Haley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/225/index.html">549 U.

As a result, \xe2\x80\x9cthe [district] court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its discretion under \xc2\xa71367(c) is not a jurisdictional matter.

Upon dismissal of the federal claim, the District Court retained its statutory supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims.  Its decision declining to exercise that statutory authority was not based on a jurisdictional defect but on its discretionary choice not to hear the claims despite its subject-matter jurisdiction over them.  See <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>International College of Surgeons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/156/index.html">522 U.

The remand order, therefore, is not based on a \xe2\x80\x9clack of subject matter jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the bar to appellate review created by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71447(c) and (d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held to the contrary based on its conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cevery \xc2\xa71367(c) remand necessarily involves a predicate finding that the claims at issue lack an independent basis of subject matter jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  508 F. 3d, at 667.  But, as explained above, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71367(a) and (c) provide a basis for subject-matter jurisdiction over any properly removed state claim.  See <em>Osborn</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 245; <em>Arbaugh</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 514.  We thus disagree with the Court of Appeals that the remand at issue here \xe2\x80\x9ccan be colorably characterized as a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  508 F. 3d, at 667.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a district court remands claims to a state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, the remand order is not based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for purposes of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71447(c) and (d).

I write separately to note an anomaly about the way 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71447 works.  In this case, we consider a District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to retain on its docket a case that <em>once </em>contained federal law issues but <em>now </em>contains only state law issues.  All agree that the law grants the District Court broad discretion to determine whether it should keep such cases on its docket, that a decision to do so (or not to do so) rarely involves major legal questions, and that (even if wrong) a district court decision of this kind will not often have major adverse consequences.  We now hold that \xc2\xa71447 <em>permits</em> appellate courts to review a district court decision of this kind, even if only for abuse of discretion. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrast today\xe2\x80\x99s decision with our decision two Terms ago in <em>Powerex Corp.</em> v. <em>Reliant Energy Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/224/index.html">551 U. S. 224</a> (2007).  In that case, we considered a District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to remand a case in which a Canadian province-owned power company had sought removal\xe2\x80\x94a matter that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 specifically authorizes federal judges (in certain instances) to decide.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71441(d); 1603(a).  The case presented a difficult legal question involving the commercial activities of a foreign sovereign; and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision (if wrong) had potentially serious adverse consequences, namely preventing a sovereign power from obtaining the <em>federal </em>trial to which the law (in its view) entitled it.  We nonetheless held that \xc2\xa71447 <em>forbids </em>appellate courts from reviewing a district court decision of this kind.  <em>Id</em>., at 238\xe2\x80\x93239.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, we have held that \xc2\xa71447 <em>permits </em>review of a district court decision in an instance where that decision is unlikely to be wrong and where a wrong decision is unlikely to work serious harm.  And we have held that \xc2\xa71447 <em>forbids </em>review of a district court decision in an instance where that decision may well be wrong and where a wrong decision could work considerable harm.  Unless the circumstances I describe are unusual, something is wrong.  And the fact that we have read other exceptions in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s absolute-sounding language suggests that such circumstances are not all that unusual. See <em>Osborn</em> v. <em>Haley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/225/index.html">549 U. S. 225</a>, 240\xe2\x80\x93244 (2007); <em>Thermtron Products, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hermansdorfer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/336/index.html">423 U. S. 336</a>, 350\xe2\x80\x93352 (1976).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently, while joining the majority, I suggest that experts in this area of the law reexamine the matter with an eye toward determining whether statutory revision is appropriate.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962894">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nCARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC.

Title 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71447(d) states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute provides a single exception\xe2\x80\x94not remotely implicated in this case\xe2\x80\x94for certain civil rights cases removed under \xc2\xa71443.  See \xc2\xa71447(d).  As then-Justice Rehnquist understatingly observed in his <em>Thermtron </em>dissent, it would not be \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonabl[e] [to] believ[e] that 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71447(d) means what it says,\xe2\x80\x9d 423 U. S., at 354; and what it says is no appellate review of remand orders.  See also <em>Osborn</em> v. <em>Haley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/225/index.html"></a><a href="/us/549/225/index.html">549 U. S. 225</a>, 263 (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Since the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order in this case \xe2\x80\x9cremand[ed] a case to the State court from which it was removed,\xe2\x80\x9d it should be\xe2\x80\x94in the words of \xc2\xa71447(d)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Q.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0D.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the years, the Court has replaced the statute\xe2\x80\x99s clear bar on appellate review with a hodgepodge of jurisdictional rules that have no evident basis even in common sense.  Under our decisions, there is no appellate jurisdiction to review remands for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, see <em>Powerex Corp.</em> v. <em>Reliant Energy Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/224/index.html">551 U. S. 224</a>, 232 (2007), though with exception, see <em>Osborn</em> v. <em>Haley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 243\xe2\x80\x93244; there is jurisdiction to review remands of supplemental state-law claims, and other remands based on abstention, see <em>Quackenbush</em> v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/706/index.html">517 U. S. 706</a>, 711\xe2\x80\x93712 (1996), though presumably no jurisdiction to review remands based on the \xe2\x80\x9cdefects\xe2\x80\x9d referenced in \xc2\xa71447(c).  See also <em>post, </em>at 2 (Breyer, J., concurring) (discussing similar anomalies).  If this muddle represents a <em>welcome</em> departure from the literal text, see <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Stevens, J., concurring), the world is mad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This mess\xe2\x80\x94entirely of our own making\xe2\x80\x94does not in my view require expert reexamination of this area of the law, see <em>post, </em>at 2 (Breyer, J., concurring).  It requires only the reconsideration of our decision in <em>Thermtron</em>\xe2\x80\x94and a welcome <em>return </em>to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s focus on congressionally enacted text.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*Contrary to Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, this case does not involve reading another \xe2\x80\x9cexceptio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d into 28 U.
