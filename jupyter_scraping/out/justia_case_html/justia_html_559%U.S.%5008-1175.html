S. 436</a>, 471, this Court held that an individual must be \xe2\x80\x9cclearly informed,\xe2\x80\x9d prior to custodial questioning, that he has, among other rights, \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After arresting respondent Powell, but before questioning him, Tampa Police read him their standard <em>Miranda</em> form, stating, <em>inter alia</em>: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of our questions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[y]ou have the right to use any of these rights at any time you want during this interview.\xe2\x80\x9d  Powell then admitted he owned a handgun found in a police search.  He was charged with possession of a weapon by a convicted felon in violation of Florida law.  The trial court denied Powell\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress his inculpatory statements, which was based on the contention that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings he received did not adequately convey his right to the presence of an attorney during questioning.  Powell was convicted of the gun-possession charge, but the intermediate appellate court held that the trial court should have suppressed the statements.  The Florida Supreme Court agreed.  It noted that both <em>Miranda</em> and the State Constitution require that a suspect be clearly informed of the right to have a lawyer present during questioning.  The advice Powell received was misleading, the court believed, because it suggested that he could consult with an attorney only before the police started to question him and did not convey his entitlement to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s presence throughout the interrogation.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>1.\xc2\xa0This Court has jurisdiction to hear this case.  Powell contends that jurisdiction is lacking because the Florida Supreme Court relied on the State\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution as well as <em>Miranda, </em>hence the decision rested on an adequate and independent state ground.  See <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 729.  Under <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Long</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U. S. 1032</a>, 1040\xe2\x80\x931041, however, when a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law, and the adequacy and independence of any possible state-law ground is not clear from the face of its opinion, this Court presumes that federal law controlled the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Although invoking Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution and precedent in addition to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, the Florida court did not expressly assert that state-law sources gave Powell rights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in <em>Miranda</em>.  See <em>Long</em>, 463 U. S., at 1044.  The state-court opinion consistently trained on what <em>Miranda</em> demands, rather than on what Florida law independently requires.  This Court therefore cannot identify, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the face of the opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d a clear statement that the decision rested on a state ground separate from <em>Miranda</em>.  See <em>Long</em>, 463 U. S., at 1041.  Because the opinion does not \xe2\x80\x9cindicat[e] clearly and expressly that it is alternatively based on bona fide separate, adequate, and independent [state] grounds,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Long, </em>463 U.

S., at 479.  This <em>Miranda</em> warning addresses the Court\xe2\x80\x99s particular concern that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege [to remain silent] by his interrogators.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 469.  Responsive to that concern, the Court stated, as \xe2\x80\x9can absolute prerequisite to interrogation,\xe2\x80\x9d that an individual held for questioning \xe2\x80\x9cmust be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 471.  While the warnings prescribed by <em>Miranda</em> are invariable, this Court has not dictated the words in which the essential information must be conveyed.  See, <em>e.g., California</em> v. <em>Prysock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/355/index.html">453 U. S. 355</a>, 359.  In determining whether police warnings were satisfactory, reviewing courts are not required to \xe2\x80\x9cexamine [them]<em> </em>as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.  The inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably \xe2\x80\x98conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as required by <em>Miranda</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duckworth</em> v. <em>Eagan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/195/index.html">492 U. S. 195</a>, 203.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939. </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The warnings Powell received satisfy this standard.  By informing Powell that he had \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [their] questions,\xe2\x80\x9d the Tampa officers communicated that he could consult with a lawyer before answering any particular question.  And the statement that Powell had \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to use any of [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e] interview\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed that he could exercise his right to an attorney while the interrogation was underway.  In combination, the two warnings reasonably conveyed the right to have an attorney present, not only at the outset of interrogation, but at all times.  To reach the opposite conclusion, <em>i.e.,</em> that the attorney would not be present throughout the interrogation, the suspect would have to imagine the counterintuitive and unlikely scenario that, in order to consult counsel, he would be obliged to exit and reenter the interrogation room between each query.  Likewise unavailing is the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the warning was misleading because the temporal language that Powell could \xe2\x80\x9ctalk to a lawyer before answering any of [the officers\xe2\x80\x99] questions\xe2\x80\x9d suggested he could consult with an attorney only before the interrogation started.  In context, the term \xe2\x80\x9cbefore\xe2\x80\x9d merely conveyed that Powell\xe2\x80\x99s right to an attorney became effective before he answered any questions at all.  Nothing in the words used indicated that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s presence would be restricted after the questioning commenced.  Powell suggests that today\xe2\x80\x99s holding will tempt law enforcement agencies to end-run <em>Miranda </em>by amending their warnings to introduce ambiguity.  But, as the Federal Government explains, it is in law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s own interest to state warnings with maximum clarity in order to reduce the risk that a court will later find the advice inadequate and therefore suppress a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s statement.  The standard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are admirably informative, but the Court declines to declare their precise formulation necessary to meet <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  Different words were used in the advice Powell received, but they communicated the same message.

After spotting Powell coming from a bedroom, the officers searched the room and discovered a loaded nine-millimeter handgun under the bed.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The officers arrested Powell and transported him to the Tampa Police headquarters.

App. 3.  He then admitted that he owned the handgun found in the apartment.  Powell knew he was prohibited from possessing a gun because he had previously been convicted of a felony, but said he had nevertheless purchased and carried the firearm for his protection.  See 969 So. 2d, at 1064; App. 29.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Powell was charged in state court with possession of a weapon by a prohibited possessor, in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7790.23(1) (West 2007).  Contending that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were deficient because they did not adequately convey his right to the presence of an attorney during questioning, he moved to suppress his inculpatory statements.  The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the officers had properly notified Powell of his right to counsel.  969 So. 2d, at 1064; App. 28.  A jury convicted Powell of the gun-possession charge.  969 So. 2d, at 1064.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal held that the trial court should have suppressed Powell\xe2\x80\x99s statements.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1067.  The <em>Miranda</em> warnings, the appellate court concluded, did not \xe2\x80\x9cadequately inform [Powell] of his . . . right to have an attorney present throughout [the] interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  969 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 1063.  Considering the issue to be \xe2\x80\x9cone of great public importance,\xe2\x80\x9d the court certified the following question to the Florida Supreme Court:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the failure to provide express advice of the right to the presence of counsel during questioning vitiate <em>Miranda</em> warnings which advise of both (A) the right to talk to a lawyer \xe2\x80\x98before questioning\xe2\x80\x99 and (B) the \xe2\x80\x98right to use\xe2\x80\x99 the right to consult a lawyer \xe2\x80\x98at any time\xe2\x80\x99 during questioning?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1067\xe2\x80\x931068 (some capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Surveying decisions of this Court as well as Florida precedent, the Florida Supreme Court answered the certified question in the affirmative.  998 So. 2d 531, 532 (2008).  \xe2\x80\x9cBoth <em>Miranda</em> and article I, section 9 of the Florida Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] the Florida High Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9crequire that a suspect be clearly informed of the right to have a lawyer present during questioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 542.  The court found that the advice Powell received was misleading because it suggested that Powell could \xe2\x80\x9conly consult with an attorney before questioning\xe2\x80\x9d and did not convey Powell\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s presence throughout the interrogation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 541.  Nor, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, did the final catchall warning\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[y]ou have the right to use any of these rights at any time you want during this interview\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94cure the defect the court perceived in the right-to-counsel advice: \xe2\x80\x9cThe catch-all phrase did not supply the missing warning of the right to have counsel present during police questioning,\xe2\x80\x9d the court stated, for \xe2\x80\x9ca right that has never been expressed cannot be reiterated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Wells dissented.  He considered it \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable to conclude that the broad, unqualified language read to Powell would lead a person of ordinary intelligence to believe that he or she had a limited right to consult with an attorney that could only be exercised before answering the <em>first</em> question posed by law enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 544.  The final sentence of the warning, he stressed, \xe2\x80\x9cavoid[ed] the implication\xe2\x80\x94unreasonable as it may [have] be[en]\xe2\x80\x94that advice concerning the right of access to counsel <em>before</em> questioning conveys the message that access to counsel is foreclosed <em>during</em> questioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Criticizing the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical adherence to language \xe2\x80\xa6 that has no connection with whether the person who confessed understood his or her rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 545, he concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he totality of the warning reasonably conveyed to Powell his continuing right of access to counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 544.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 557 U.

Responsive to that concern, we stated, as \xe2\x80\x9can absolute prerequisite to interrogation,\xe2\x80\x9d that an individual held for questioning \xe2\x80\x9cmust be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 471.  The question before us is whether the warnings Powell received satisfied this requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The four warnings <em>Miranda</em> requires are invariable, but this Court has not dictated the words in which the essential information must be conveyed.  See <em>California</em> v. <em>Prysock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/355/index.html">453 U. S. 355</a>, 359 (1981) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court has never indicated that the rigidity of <em>Miranda</em> extends to the precise formulation of the warnings given a criminal defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Rhode Island</em> v. <em>Innis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/index.html">446 U.

In determining whether police officers adequately conveyed the four warnings, we have said, reviewing courts are not required to examine the words employed \xe2\x80\x9cas if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.  The inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably \xe2\x80\x98conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as required by <em>Miranda</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duckworth</em>, 492 U.

Both concerned a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to adequate notification of the right to appointed counsel.  In <em>Prysock</em>, an officer informed the suspect of, <em>inter alia</em>,<em> </em>his right to a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s presence during questioning and his right to counsel appointed at no cost.  453 U. S., at 356\xe2\x80\x93357.  The Court of Appeals held the advice inadequate to comply with <em>Miranda </em>because it lacked an express statement that the appointment of an attorney would occur prior to the impending interrogation.  See<em> </em>453 U. S., at 358\xe2\x80\x93359.  We reversed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 362.  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]othing in the warnings,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed, \xe2\x80\x9csuggested any limitation on the right to the presence of appointed counsel different from the clearly conveyed rights to a lawyer in general, including the right to a lawyer before [the suspect is] questioned, \xe2\x80\xa6 while [he is] being questioned, and all during the questioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 360\xe2\x80\x93361 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, in <em>Duckworth</em>, we upheld advice that, in relevant part, communicated the right to have an attorney present during the interrogation and the right to an appointed attorney, but also informed the suspect that the lawyer would be appointed \xe2\x80\x9cif and when [the suspect goes] to court.\xe2\x80\x9d  492 U.

We thought otherwise.  Under the relevant state law, we noted, \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel is appointed at [a] defendant\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance in court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 204.  The \xe2\x80\x9cif and when you go to court\xe2\x80\x9d advice, we said, \xe2\x80\x9csimply anticipate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d a question the suspect might be expected to ask after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>when</em> [will he] obtain counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  492 U. S., at 204.  Reading the \xe2\x80\x9cif and when\xe2\x80\x9d language together with the other information conveyed, we held that the warnings, \xe2\x80\x9cin their totality, satisfied <em>Miranda</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 205.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reach the same conclusion in this case.  The Tampa officers did not \xe2\x80\x9centirely omi[t],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 9, any information <em>Miranda</em> required them to impart.  They informed Powell that he had \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [their] questions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to use any of [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e] interview.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 3.  The first statement communicated that Powell could consult with a lawyer before answering any particular question, and the second statement confirmed that he could exercise that right while the interrogation was underway.  In combination, the two warnings reasonably conveyed Powell\xe2\x80\x99s right to have an attorney present, not only at the outset of interrogation, but at all times.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To reach the opposite conclusion, <em>i.e.</em>, that the attorney would not be present throughout the interrogation, the suspect would have to imagine an unlikely scenario: To consult counsel, he would be obliged to exit and reenter the interrogation room between each query.  A reasonable suspect in a custodial setting who has just been read his rights, we believe, would not come to the counterintuitive conclusion that he is obligated, or allowed, to hop in and out of the holding area to seek his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s advice.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Instead, the suspect would likely assume that he must stay put in the interrogation room and that his lawyer would be there with him the entire time.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Florida Supreme Court found the warning misleading because it believed the temporal language\xe2\x80\x94that Powell could \xe2\x80\x9ctalk to a lawyer before answering any of [the officers\xe2\x80\x99] questions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94suggested Powell could consult with an attorney only before the interrogation started.  998 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 541.  See also Brief for Respondent 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  In context, however, the term \xe2\x80\x9cbefore\xe2\x80\x9d merely conveyed when Powell\xe2\x80\x99s right to an attorney became effective\xe2\x80\x94namely, before he answered any questions at all.  Nothing in the words used indicated that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s presence would be restricted after the questioning commenced.  Instead, the warning communicated that the right to counsel carried forward to and through the interrogation: Powell could seek his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s advice before responding to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> of [the officers\xe2\x80\x99] questions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c<em>at any time</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>during</em> th[e] interview.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 3 (emphasis added).  Although the warnings were not the<em> clearest possible</em> formulation of <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s right-to-counsel advisement, they were sufficiently comprehensive and comprehensible when given a commonsense reading.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pursuing a different line of argument, Powell points out that most jurisdictions in Florida and across the Nation expressly advise suspects of the right to have counsel present both before and during interrogation.  Brief for Respondent 41\xe2\x80\x9344.  If we find the advice he received adequate, Powell suggests, law enforcement agencies, hoping to obtain uninformed waivers, will be tempted to end-run <em>Miranda </em>by amending their warnings to introduce ambiguity.  Brief for Respondent 50\xe2\x80\x9353.  But as the United States explained as <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of the State of Florida, \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement agencies have little reason to assume the litigation risk of experimenting with novel <em>Miranda</em> formulations,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6; instead, it is \xe2\x80\x9cdesirable police practice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s own interest\xe2\x80\x9d to state warnings with maximum clarity, <em>id.</em>, at 12.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 11 (\xe2\x80\x9cBy using a conventional and precise formulation of the warnings, police can significantly reduce the risk that a court will later suppress the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s statement on the ground that the advice was inadequate.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, \xe2\x80\x9call \xe2\x80\xa6 federal law enforcement agencies explicitly advise \xe2\x80\xa6 suspect[s] of the full contours of each <em>[Miranda]</em> right, including the right to the presence of counsel during questioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 12.  The standard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are exemplary.

You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa03 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This advice is admirably informative, but we decline to declare its precise formulation necessary to meet <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.

In my view, the Florida Supreme Court held on an adequate and independent state-law ground that the warnings provided to Powell did not sufficiently inform him of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98right to a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s help\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under the Florida Constitution, <em>id.</em>, at 535.  This Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to review the judgment below, notwithstanding the failure of that court to include some express sentence that would satisfy this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplain-statement rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The adequate-and-independent-state-ground doctrine rests on two \xe2\x80\x9ccornerstones\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9c[r]espect for the independence of state courts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cavoidance of rendering advisory opinions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U. S. 1032</a>, 1040 (1983).  In <em>Long</em>, the Court adopted a novel presumption in favor of jurisdiction when the independence of a state court\xe2\x80\x99s state-law judgment is not clear.  But we only respect the independence of state courts and avoid rendering advisory opinions if we limit the application of that presumption to truly ambiguous cases.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  This is not such a case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the same judgment would be rendered by the state court after we corrected its views of federal laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Herb</em> v. <em>Pitcairn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/324/117/index.html">324 U. S. 117</a>, 126 (1945).  In <em>Long </em>we advised every state court of a formula by which it could assure us that our review would indeed amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion.  The state court \xe2\x80\x9cneed only make clear by a plain statement in its judgment or opinion that the federal cases are being used only for the purpose of guidance, and do not themselves compel the result that the court has reached.\xe2\x80\x9d  463 U.

That advice has sometimes been misunderstood as a command that unless such a plain statement is included in a state-court opinion, the court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling cannot have rested on an adequate and independent state ground.  But the real question is whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is \xe2\x80\xa6 clear from the face of the opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1040\xe2\x80\x931041.  Even if a state court opinion does not include the magic words set forth in <em>Long</em>, or some similarly explicit sentence,<em> </em>we lack jurisdiction if it is nonetheless apparent that the decision is indeed supported by an adequate and independent state ground.  Contrary to the assumption made by the Court, we have no power to assume jurisdiction that does not otherwise exist simply because the Florida Supreme Court did not include in its decision some express statement that its interpretation of state law is independent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, we can tell from the face of the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe decision rested on a state ground separate from <em>Miranda</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6<em>.</em>  This case is easily distinguished from <em>Long </em>in that regard.  In <em>Long</em>, although the Michigan Supreme Court had twice cited the Michigan Constitution in its opinion, it \xe2\x80\x9crelied <em>exclusively </em>on its understanding of <em>Terry</em> [v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/index.html">392 U.

There was, in short, nothing to \xe2\x80\x9cindicate that the decision below rested on grounds in any way <em>independent </em>from the state court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1044.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other cases in which we have applied the <em>Long</em> presumption have been similarly devoid of independent state-law analysis.  We typically apply the <em>Long </em>presumption when the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision cited a state constitutional provision only a few times or not at all, and rested exclusively upon federal cases or upon state cases that themselves cited only federal law.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We have also applied <em>Long</em> when the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision indicated that under state law, the relevant state constitutional provision is considered coextensive with the federal one.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  This case shares none of those features.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Florida Supreme Court did not merely cite the Florida Constitution a time or two without state-law analysis.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Rather, the court discussed and relied on the separate rights provided under Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79 of the Florida Constitution.  For example, after a paragraph describing the general scope of <em>Miranda</em> warnings under federal law, the Court explained the general scope of warnings under state law.  998 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 534\xe2\x80\x93535 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o ensure the voluntariness of confessions as required by article I, section 9 of the Florida Constitution, this Court in <em>Traylor</em> v. <em>State</em>, 596 So.\xc2\xa02d 957 (Fla. 1992), outlined the \xe2\x80\xa6 rights Florida suspects must be told of prior to custodial interrogation,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that they have a right to a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s help\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  The court consistently referred to these state-law rights as separate and distinct from <em>Miranda</em>, noting that in its earlier cases, it had explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe requirements of both the Fifth Amendment, as explained in <em>Miranda</em>, and the Florida Constitution, as explained in <em>Traylor</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d include \xe2\x80\x9cthe requirement that a suspect be informed of the right to have counsel present during questioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  998 So. 2d, at 537\xe2\x80\x93538.  And when applying the law to the specific facts of this case, the Florida Supreme Court again invoked the specific and distinct \xe2\x80\x9cright to a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s help\xe2\x80\x9d under the Florida Constitution.  <em>Id.</em>, at 540.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the state cases relied upon by the Florida Supreme Court did not themselves rely exclusively on federal law.  The primary case relied upon for the state-law holding, <em>Traylor</em>, rested exclusively upon state law.  See 596 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 961.  In that decision, the Florida Supreme Court embraced the principle that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen called upon to decide matters of fundamental rights, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s state courts are bound under federalist principles to give primacy to our state Constitution and to give independent legal import to every phrase and clause contained therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 962.  Elaborating upon the meaning of Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79 of the Florida Constitution, the Florida Supreme Court explained the roots of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to protecting its citizens from self-incrimination.  Florida has long \xe2\x80\x9crequired as a matter of state law that one charged with a crime be informed of his rights prior to rendering a confession.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 964.  It has required warnings before some interrogations since at least 1889, and has for that long excluded confessions obtained in violation of those rules.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In sum, this case looks quite different from those cases in which we have applied the <em>Long</em> presumption in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court concludes otherwise by relying primarily upon the formulation of the certified question and restatements of that question within the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  Yet while the certified question asks whether particular phrases \xe2\x80\x9cvitiate[d] <em>Miranda </em>warnings,\xe2\x80\x9d 998 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 532 (capitalization and footnote omitted), <em>Miranda</em> has become a generic term to refer to the warnings suspects must be given before interrogation, see Merriam-Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Collegiate Dictionary 792 (11th ed. 2003) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cMiranda\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cof, relating to, or being the legal rights of an arrested person to have an attorney and to remain silent so as to avoid self-incrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, its invocation of <em>Miranda</em> in the certified question and in its statement of the issue\npresented is entirely consistent with the fact that the state-law basis for its decision is fully adequate and\nindependent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That said, I agree with the Court that the decision below is interwoven with federal law.  In reaching its state-law holding, the Florida Supreme Court found <em>Miranda</em> and our other precedents instructive.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  But that alone is insufficient to assure our jurisdiction, even under <em>Long</em>.  In my view, the judgment\xe2\x80\x94reversal of Powell\xe2\x80\x99s conviction\xe2\x80\x94is supported by the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s independent and carefully considered holding that these warnings were inadequate under the Florida Constitution.  See 998 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 534\xe2\x80\x93535, 537\xe2\x80\x93538, 540, 542.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court acknowledges that nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9ctrenches on the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to impose, based on the State\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution, any additional protections against coerced confessions it deems appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  As the Florida Supreme Court has noted on more than one occasion, its interpretation of the Florida Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s privilege against self-incrimination need not track our construction of the parallel provision in the Federal Constitution.  See <em>Rigterink </em>v.<em> State</em>, 2 So. 3d 221, 241 (2009) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he federal Constitution sets the floor, not the ceiling, and this Court retains the ability to interpret the right against self-incrimination afforded by the Florida Constitution more broadly than that afforded by its federal counterpart\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Traylor</em>, 596 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 961\xe2\x80\x93963.  In this very case, the Florida Supreme Court may reinstate its judgment upon remand.  If the Florida Supreme Court does so, as I expect it will, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on the merits will qualify as the sort of advisory opinion that we should studiously seek to avoid.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the merits is also unpersuasive.  As we recognized in <em>Miranda</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to have counsel present at [an] interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>, 469 (1966).  Furthermore, \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 470.  Because the \xe2\x80\x9caccused who does not know his rights and therefore does not make a request may be the person who most needs counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 470\xe2\x80\x93471, a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cmust be clearly informed\xe2\x80\x9d regarding two aspects of his right to consult an attorney: \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 471.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the form regularly used by the Tampa police warned Powell that he had \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of our questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 3.  This informed him only of the right to consult with a lawyer before questioning, the very right the <em>Miranda </em>Court identified as insufficient to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege.  The warning did not say anything about the right to have counsel present during interrogation.  Although we have never required \xe2\x80\x9crigidity in the <em>form</em> of the required warnings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>California</em> v. <em>Prysock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/355/index.html"></a><a href="/us/453/355/index.html">453 U. S. 355</a>, 359 (1981) <em>(per curiam)</em>, this is, I believe, the first time the Court has approved a warning which, if given its natural reading, entirely omitted an essential element of a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the failure of the warning to mention it, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view the warning \xe2\x80\x9creasonably conveyed\xe2\x80\x9d to Powell that he had the right to a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s presence during the interrogation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  The Court cobbles together this conclusion from two elements of the warning.  First, the Court assumes the warning regarding Powell\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x9cto talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the officers\xe2\x80\x99] questions,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 3, conveyed that \xe2\x80\x9cPowell could consult with a lawyer before answering any <em>particular</em> question,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Second, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the addition of a catchall clause at the end of the recitation of rights \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed\xe2\x80\x9d that Powell could use his right to consult an attorney \xe2\x80\x9cwhile the interrogation was underway.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The more natural reading of the warning Powell was given, which (1) contained a temporal limit and (2) failed to mention his right to the presence of counsel in the interrogation room, is that Powell only had the right to consult with an attorney before the interrogation began, not that he had the right to have an attorney with him during questioning.  Even those few Courts of Appeals that have approved warnings that did not expressly mention the right to an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s presence during interrogation[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] have found language of the sort used in Powell\xe2\x80\x99s warning to be misleading.  For instance, petitioner cites the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lamia</em>, 429 F.\xc2\xa02d 373 (1970), as an example of a court applying the properly flexible approach to <em>Miranda</em>.  But in that case, the Second Circuit expressly distinguished a warning that a suspect \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98could consult an attorney prior to any question,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which was \xe2\x80\x9caffirmatively misleading since it was thought to imply that the attorney could not be present during questioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  429 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 377.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  That even the Courts of Appeals taking the most flexible approach to <em>Miranda</em> have found warnings like Powell\xe2\x80\x99s misleading should caution the Court against concluding that such a warning reasonably conveyed Powell\xe2\x80\x99s right to have an attorney with him during the interrogation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the relevant clause of the warning in this case is given its most natural reading, the catchall clause does not meaningfully clarify Powell\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  It communicated that Powell could exercise the previously listed rights at any time.  Yet the only previously listed right was the \xe2\x80\x9cright to talk to a lawyer <em>before </em>answering any of [the officers\xe2\x80\x99] questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 3 (emphasis added).  Informing Powell that he could exercise, at any time during the interview, the right to talk to a lawyer <em>before</em> answering any questions did not reasonably convey the right to talk to a lawyer <em>after</em> answering some questions, much less implicitly inform Powell of his right to have a lawyer with him at all times during interrogation.  An intelligent suspect could reasonably conclude that all he was provided was a one-time right to consult with an attorney, not a right to have an attorney present with him in the interrogation room at all times.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court relies on <em>Duckworth </em>v. <em>Eagan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/195/index.html">492 U. S. 195</a> (1989), and <em>Prysock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/355/index.html"></a><a href="/us/453/355/index.html">453 U. S. 355</a>, but in neither case did the warning at issue completely omit one of a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  In <em>Prysock</em>, the warning regarding the right to an appointed attorney contained no temporal limitation, see<em> id.</em>, at 360\xe2\x80\x93361, which clearly distinguishes that case from Powell\xe2\x80\x99s.  In <em>Duckworth</em>, the suspect was explicitly informed that he had the right \xe2\x80\x9cto talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions, and to have him with you during questioning,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he had \xe2\x80\x9cthis right to the advice and presence of a lawyer even if you cannot afford to hire one.\xe2\x80\x9d  492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  The warning thus conveyed in full the right to appointed counsel before and during the interrogation.  Although the warning was arguably undercut by the addition of a statement that an attorney would be appointed \xe2\x80\x9cif and when you go to court,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court found the suspect was informed of his full rights and the warning simply added additional, truthful information regarding when counsel would be appointed.  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Unlike the <em>Duckworth</em> warning, Powell\xe2\x80\x99s warning did not convey his <em>Miranda </em>rights in full with the addition of some arguably misleading statement.  Rather, the warning entirely failed to inform him of the separate and distinct right \xe2\x80\x9cto have counsel present during any questioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miranda</em>,<em> </em>384 U. S., at 470.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the warning at issue in this case did not reasonably convey to Powell his right to have a lawyer with him during the interrogation.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe requirement of warnings \xe2\x80\xa6 [is] fundamental with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 476.  In determining that the warning implied what it did not say, it is the Court \xe2\x80\x9cthat is guilty of attaching greater importance to the form of the <em>Miranda </em>ritual than to the substance of the message it is intended to convey.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Prysock,</em> 453 U. S., at 366 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether we focus on Powell\xe2\x80\x99s particular case, or the use of the warning form as the standard used in one jurisdiction, it is clear that the form is imperfect.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12.  As the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision today demonstrates, reasonable judges may well differ over the question whether the deficiency is serious enough to violate the Federal Constitution.  That difference of opinion, in my judgment, falls short of providing a justification for reviewing this case when the judges of the highest court of the State have decided the warning is insufficiently protective of the rights of the State\xe2\x80\x99s citizens.  In my view, respect for the independence of state courts, and their authority to set the rules by which their citizens are protected, should result in a dismissal of this petition.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In my view, this Court would better respect the independence of state courts by applying the opposite presumption, as it did in the years prior to 1983.

But accepting <em>Long </em>as the law, we can limit its negative effects\xe2\x80\x94unnecessary intrusion into the business of the state courts and unnecessary advisory opinions\xe2\x80\x94only if we limit its application to cases in which the independence of the state-law ground is in serious doubt.

I, \xc2\xa79 is clearly not dependent upon federal law.  <em>Rigterink </em>v. <em>State</em>, 2 So. 3d 221, 241 (Fla. 2009); <em>Traylor</em> v. <em>State</em>, 596 So.\xc2\xa02d 957, 962 (Fla. 1992).</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This assumption makes it easier for the Court to conclude the warning conveyed a right to have a lawyer present.  If a suspect is told he has the right to consult with an attorney before answering any particular question, the Court may be correct that he would reasonably conclude he has the right to a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s presence because otherwise he would have to imagine he could consult his attorney in some unlikely fashion (<em>e.g.</em>, by leaving the interrogation room between every question). </p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Several Courts of Appeals have held that warnings that did not expressly inform a suspect of his right to have counsel present during interrogation did not adequately inform a suspect of his <em>Miranda</em> rights.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tillman</em>, 963 F.\xc2\xa02d 137, 141 (CA6 1992); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bland</em>, 908 F.\xc2\xa02d 471, 474 (CA9 1990); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Anthon</em>, 648 F.\xc2\xa02d 669, 672\xe2\x80\x93673 (CA10 1981); <em>Windsor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 389 F.\xc2\xa02d 530, 533 (CA5 1968).  And most of the Circuits that have not required express mention of the right to an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s presence have approved only general warnings regarding the right to an attorney; that is, warnings which did not specifically mention the right to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s presence during interrogation but which also contained no limiting words that might mislead a suspect as to the broad nature of his right to counsel.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frankson</em>, 83 F.\xc2\xa03d 79, 82 (CA4 1996); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Caldwell</em>, 954 F.\xc2\xa02d 496, 502 (CA8 1992); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adams</em>, 484 F.\xc2\xa02d 357, 361\xe2\x80\x93362 (CA7 1973).  I am doubtful that warning a suspect of his \xe2\x80\x9cright to counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d without more, reasonably conveys a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s full rights under <em>Miranda</em>, but at least such a general warning does not include the same sort of misleading temporal limitation as in Powell\xe2\x80\x99s warning.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Petitioner also cites <em>Bridgers</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, 431 F.\xc2\xa03d 853 (CA5 2005), in which the Fifth Circuit held the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in finding adequate a warning in which a suspect was informed that \xe2\x80\x9che had the right to the <em>presence</em> of an attorney before any questioning commenced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 857 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But even assuming that warning would sufficiently apprise an individual of his right to an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s presence <em>during</em> interrogation, the fact that the warning mentioned an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s presence materially distinguishes it from the warning Powell received.  The Fifth Circuit quoted with approval the state court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that warning a suspect solely that \xe2\x80\x9che had the right to consult or speak to an attorney before questioning \xe2\x80\xa6 might have created the [impermissible] impression that the attorney could not be present during interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court supports its analysis by taking note of Powell\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at trial, given after the trial judge had overruled his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s objection that the warning he received was inadequate.  In my view, the testimony in context is not probative of what Powell thought the warnings meant.  It did not explore what Powell understood the warnings to mean, but simply established, as a prelude to Powell\xe2\x80\x99s testimony explaining his prior statement, that he had waived his rights.  Regardless, the testimony is irrelevant, as the Court acknowledges.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo amount of circumstantial evidence that a person may have been aware of [the right to have a lawyer with him during interrogation] will suffice to stand\xe2\x80\x9d in the stead of an adequate warning.  <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U.
