Respondents also argue that the vehicles covered here are analogous to the nontypical structures and vehicles that <i>Taylor</i>, <i>Mathis</i>, and other cases described as falling outside the scope of generic burglary, but none of those prior cases presented the question whether generic burglary includes structures or vehicles that are adapted or customarily used for overnight use.

It might refer to a kind of crime, a generic crime, as set forth in a statute (\xe2\x80\x9ca burglary consists of behavior that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x9d), or it might refer to the way in which an individual offender acted on a particular occasion (\xe2\x80\x9con January 25, Jones committed a burglary on Oak Street in South San Francisco\xe2\x80\x9d).  We have held that the words in the Armed Career Criminal Act do the first.  Accordingly, we have held that the Act requires us to evaluate a prior state conviction \xe2\x80\x9cin terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Begay </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137, 141 (2008).

That case, which specifically considered the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cburglary,\xe2\x80\x9d governs here and determines the outcome.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Taylor</i>, we did more than hold that the word \xe2\x80\x9cbur- glary\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a kind of generic crime rather than to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s behavior on a particular occasion.  We also explained, after examining the Act\xe2\x80\x99s history and purpose, that Congress intended a \xe2\x80\x9cuniform definition of burglary [to] be applied to all cases in which the Government seeks\xe2\x80\x9d an enhanced sentence under the Act.  <i>Id.</i>, at 580\xe2\x80\x93592.  We held that this uniform definition includes \xe2\x80\x9cat least the \xe2\x80\x98classic\xe2\x80\x99 common-law definition,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, breaking and entering a dwelling at night with intent to commit a fel- ony.  <i>Id.,</i> at 593.  But we added that it must include more.  The classic definition, by excluding all places other than dwellings, we said, has \xe2\x80\x9clittle relevance to modern law enforcement concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Perhaps for that reason, by the time the Act was passed in 1986, most States had expanded the meaning of burglary to include \xe2\x80\x9cstructures other than dwellings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (citing W.

If that had been Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent, adding the word \xe2\x80\x9cbur- glary\xe2\x80\x9d would have been unnecessary, since the (now-invalid) residual clause \xe2\x80\x9calready include[d] <i>any</i> crime that \xe2\x80\x98involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 597 (quoting\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)); see <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x9310) (holding residual clause unconstitutionally vague).  We concluded that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s term \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d must include \xe2\x80\x9cordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crun-of-the-mill\xe2\x80\x9d burglaries as well as aggravated ones.  <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 597.  And we defined the elements of generic \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 598.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The relevant language of the Tennessee and Arkansas statutes falls within the scope of generic burglary\xe2\x80\x99s definition as set forth in <i>Taylor</i>.  For one thing, we made clear in <i>Taylor </i>that Congress intended the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cbur- glary\xe2\x80\x9d to reflect \xe2\x80\x9cthe generic sense in which the term [was] used in the criminal codes of most States\xe2\x80\x9d at the time the Act was passed.  <i>Ibid.</i>  In 1986, a majority of state bur- glary statutes covered vehicles adapted or customarily used for lodging\xe2\x80\x94either explicitly or by defining \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d to include those vehicles.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, N.\xc2\xa0H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7635:1 (1974) (prohibiting burglary of an \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ccupied structure,\xe2\x80\x9d defined to include \xe2\x80\x9cany structure, vehicle, boat or place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons\xe2\x80\x9d); Ore.

An offender who breaks into a mobile home, an RV, a camping tent, a vehicle, or another structure that is adapted for or customarily used for lodging runs a similar or greater risk of violent confrontation.  See <i>Spring</i>, 80 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1462 (noting the greater risk of confrontation in a mobile home or camper, where \xe2\x80\x9cit is more difficult for the burglar to enter or escape unnoticed\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although, as respondents point out, the risk of violence is diminished if, for example, a vehicle is only used for lodging part of the time, we have no reason to believe that Congress intended to make a part-time/full-time distinction.  After all, a burglary is no less a burglary because it took place at a summer home during the winter, or a commercial building during a holiday.  Cf. Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7221.1, Comment 3(b), p. 72 (burglary should cover places with the \xe2\x80\x9capparent potential for regular occupancy\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents make several additional arguments.  Respondent Stitt argues that the Tennessee statute is too broad even under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s definition of generic burglary.  That is so, Stitt contends, because the statute covers the burglary of a \xe2\x80\x9cstructure appurtenant to or connected with\xe2\x80\x9d a covered structure or vehicle, a provision that Stitt reads to include the burglary of even ordinary vehicles that are plugged in or otherwise appurtenant to covered structures.

Stitt\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, however, ignores that the \xe2\x80\x9cappurtenant to\xe2\x80\x9d provision extends only to \xe2\x80\x9cstructure[s],\xe2\x80\x9d not to the separate statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cvehicle[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  We therefore disagree with Stitt\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the \xe2\x80\x9cappurtenant to\xe2\x80\x9d provision sweeps more broadly than generic burglary, as defined in <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 598.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents also point out that in <i>Taylor</i>, <i>Mathis</i>, and other cases, we said that burglary of certain nontypical structures and vehicles fell outside the scope of the federal Act\xe2\x80\x99s statutory word \xe2\x80\x9cburglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 599 (noting that some States \xe2\x80\x9cdefine burglary more broadly\xe2\x80\x9d than generic burglary by, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding places, such as automobiles and vending machines, other than buildings\xe2\x80\x9d).  And they argue that the vehicles covered here are analogous to the nontypical structures and vehicles to which the Court referred in those cases.  Our examination of those cases, however, convinces us that we did not decide in either case the question now before us.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Taylor</i>, for example, we referred to a Missouri breaking and entering statute that among other things criminalized breaking and entering \xe2\x80\x9c<i>any</i> boat or vessel, or railroad car.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (citing Mo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7560.070 (1969); emphasis added).  We did say that that particular provision was beyond the scope of the federal Act.  But the statute used the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d; it referred to ordinary boats and vessels often at sea (and railroad cars often filled with cargo, not people), nowhere restricting its coverage, as here, to vehicles or structures customarily used or adapted for overnight accommodation.  The statutes before us, by using these latter words, more clearly focus upon circumstances where burglary is likely to present a serious risk of violence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Mathis</i>, we considered an Iowa statute that covered \xe2\x80\x9cany building, structure, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. land, water or air vehicle, or similar place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons [or used] for the storage or safekeeping of anything of value.\xe2\x80\x9d  Iowa Code \xc2\xa7702.12 (2013).  Courts have construed that statute to cover ordinary vehicles because they can be used for storage or safekeeping.  See <i>State</i> v. <i>Buss</i>, 325 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 384 (Iowa 1982); <i>Weaver</i> v. <i>Iowa</i>, 949 F.\xc2\xa02d 1049 (CA8 1991).  That is presumably why, as we wrote in our opinion, \xe2\x80\x9call parties agree[d]\xe2\x80\x9d that Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s burglary statute \xe2\x80\x9ccovers more conduct than generic burglary does.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mathis</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  The question before us was whether federal generic \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d includes within its scope a burglary statute that lists multiple, alternative means of satisfying one element, some of which fall within <i>Taylor</i>\xe2\x80\x99s generic definition and some of which fall outside it.  We held, in light of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement that the Iowa statute covered some \xe2\x80\x9coutside\xe2\x80\x9d behavior (<i>i.e.</i>, ordinary vehicles), that the statute did not count as a generic burglary statute.  But for present purposes, what matters is that the Court in <i>Mathis</i> did not decide the question now before us\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether coverage of vehicles designed or adapted for overnight  use takes the statute outside the generic burglary definition.  We now decide that latter question, and, for the reasons we have stated, we hold that it does not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondent Sims argues that Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 residential burglary statute is too broad to count as generic burglary for a different reason, namely, because it also covers burglary of \xe2\x80\x9ca vehicle .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [i]n which any person lives.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.  Sims adds that these words might cover a car in which a homeless person occasionally sleeps.  Sims\xe2\x80\x99 argument rests in part upon state law, and the lower courts have not considered it.  As \xe2\x80\x9cwe are a court of review, not of first view,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cutter </i>v. <i>Wilkinson</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 709, 718, n.\xc2\xa07 (2005), we remand the Arkansas case to the lower courts for further proceedings.  Those courts remain free to determine whether Sims properly presented the argument and to decide the merits, if appropriate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.  We vacate the judgment of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"> </p>\n<p style="p-H1">APPENDIX</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711.46.300, 11.46.310, 11.81.900(b)(3) (1989) (effective 1978); Ariz.
