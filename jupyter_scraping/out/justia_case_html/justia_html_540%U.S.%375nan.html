Argued October 15, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided December 15, 2003</p>\n<p align="left">In 1994, petitioner Castro attacked his federal drug conviction in a <em>pro se</em> motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33.  The Government responded that the claims were more cognizable as federal habeas claims under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255.  The District Court denied Castro\xe2\x80\x99s motion on the merits, referring to it as both a Rule 33 and a \xc2\xa72255 motion.  Castro did not challenge this recharacterization of his motion on his <em>pro se</em> appeal, and the Eleventh Circuit summarily affirmed.  In 1997, Castro, again <em>pro se, </em>filed a \xc2\xa72255 motion raising, <em>inter alia,</em> a new claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.  The District Court denied the motion, but the Eleventh Circuit remanded for the District Court to consider, among other things, whether this was Castro\xe2\x80\x99s second \xc2\xa72255 motion.  The District Court appointed counsel, determined that the 1997 motion was indeed Castro\xe2\x80\x99s second \xc2\xa72255 motion (the 1994 motion being his first), and dismissed the motion for failure to comply with \xc2\xa72255\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that Castro obtain the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 permission to file a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d motion.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of Castro\xe2\x80\x99s claim is not barred by the requirement that the \xe2\x80\x9cgrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application \xe2\x80\xa6 shall not be the subject of a [certiorari] petition,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(b)(3)(E).  Castro nowhere asked the Eleventh Circuit to grant, and it nowhere denied, such authorization.  Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position, the court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that Castro\xe2\x80\x99s petition could not meet the requirements for second or successive petitions cannot be taken as a statutorily relevant \xe2\x80\x9cdenial\xe2\x80\x9d of an authorization request not made.  Even accepting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, the argument would founder because the certiorari petition\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubject\xe2\x80\x9d is not the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s authorization \xe2\x80\x9cdenial,\xe2\x80\x9d but the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to recognize that this \xc2\xa72255 motion is Castro\xe2\x80\x99s first.  Moreover, reading the statute as the Government suggests would create procedural anomalies, allowing review where the lower court decision disfavors, but denying review where it favors, the Government; would close this Court\xe2\x80\x99s doors to a class of habeas petitioners without any clear indication that such was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent; and would be difficult to reconcile with the principle that this Court reads limitations on its jurisdiction narrowly.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0A federal court cannot recharacterize a pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s motion as a first \xc2\xa72255 motion <em>unless</em> it first informs the litigant of its intent to recharacterize, warns the litigant that this recharacterization means that any subsequent \xc2\xa72255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d motions, and provides the litigant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the \xc2\xa72255 claims he believes he has.  If these warnings are not given, the motion cannot be considered to have become a \xc2\xa72255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the law\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d restrictions.  Nine Circuits have placed such limits on recharacterization, and no one here contests the lawfulness of this judicially created requirement.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Because the District Court failed to give the prescribed warnings, Castro\xe2\x80\x99s 1994 motion cannot be considered a first \xc2\xa72255 motion and his 1997 motion cannot be considered a second or successive one.  The Government argues that Castro\xe2\x80\x99s failure to appeal the 1994 recharacterization makes the recharacterization valid as a matter of \xe2\x80\x9claw of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, according to the Government, since the 1994 recharacterization is valid, the 1997 \xc2\xa72255 motion is Castro\xe2\x80\x99s second, not his first.  This Court disagrees.  The point of a warning is to help the <em>pro se</em> litigant understand not only (1) whether he should withdraw or amend his motion, but also (2) whether he should <em>contest</em> the recharacterization, say, on appeal.  The lack of warning prevents his making an informed judgment as to both.  The failure to appeal simply underscores the practical importance of providing the warning.  Hence, an unwarned recharacterization cannot count as a \xc2\xa72255 motion for purposes of the \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d provision whether or not the unwarned<em> pro se</em> litigant takes an appeal.  Even assuming that the law of the case doctrine applies here, the doctrine simply expresses common judicial practice; it does not limit the courts\xe2\x80\x99 power.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255 a motion that a <em>pro se</em> federal prisoner has labeled differently.  Such recharacterization can have serious consequences for the prisoner, for it subjects any subsequent motion under \xc2\xa72255 to the restrictive conditions that federal law imposes upon a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d (but not upon a first) federal habeas motion.  \xc2\xa72255, \xc2\xb6  ;8.  In light of these consequences, we hold that the court cannot so recharacterize a <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s motion as the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s first \xc2\xa72255 motion <em>unless</em> the court informs the litigant of its intent to recharacterize, warns the litigant that the recharacterization will subject subsequent \xc2\xa72255 motions to the law\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d restrictions, and provides the litigant with an opportunity to withdraw, or to amend, the filing.  Where these things are not done, a recharacterized motion will not count as a \xc2\xa72255 motion for purposes of applying \xc2\xa72255\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d provision.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case focuses upon two motions that Hernan O\xe2\x80\x99Ryan Castro, a federal prisoner acting <em>pro se</em>, filed in federal court.  He filed the first motion in 1994, the second in 1997.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant facts surrounding the 1994 motion are the following:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1) On July 5, 1994, Castro filed a <em>pro se</em> motion attacking his federal drug conviction, a motion that he called a Rule 33 motion for a new trial.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 33.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2) The Government, in its response, said that Castro\xe2\x80\x99s claims were \xe2\x80\x9cmore properly cognizable\xe2\x80\x9d as federal habeas corpus claims, <em>i.e.</em>, claims made under the authority of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255.  But, the Government added, it did not object to the court\xe2\x80\x99s considering Castro\xe2\x80\x99s motion as having invoked both Rule 33 and \xc2\xa72255.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3) The District Court denied Castro\xe2\x80\x99s motion on the merits.  In its accompanying opinion, the court generally referred to Castro\xe2\x80\x99s motion as a Rule 33 motion; but the court twice referred to it as a \xc2\xa72255 motion as well.  App. 137\xe2\x80\x93144.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4) Castro, still acting <em>pro se</em>, appealed, but he did not challenge the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s recharacterization of his motion.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(5) The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed.  It said in its one-paragraph order that it was ruling on a motion based upon both Rule 33 and \xc2\xa72255.  Judgt. order reported at 82 F.\xc2\xa03d 429 (CA11 1996); App. 147.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant facts surrounding the 1997 motion are the following:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1) On April 18, 1997, Castro, acting <em>pro se</em>, filed what he called a \xc2\xa72255 motion.  The motion included claims not raised in the 1994 motion, including a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2) The District Court denied the motion; Castro appealed; and the Court of Appeals remanded for further consideration of the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  It also asked the District Court to consider whether, in light of the 1994 motion, Castro\xe2\x80\x99s motion was his second \xc2\xa72255 motion, rather than his first. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3) On remand, the District Court appointed counsel for Castro.  It then decided that the 1997 motion was indeed Castro\xe2\x80\x99s second \xc2\xa72255 motion (the 1994 motion being his first).  And it dismissed the motion for failure to comply with one of \xc2\xa72255\xe2\x80\x99s restrictive \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d conditions (namely, Castro\xe2\x80\x99s failure to obtain the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 permission to file a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d motion).  \xc2\xa72255, \xc2\xb6  ;8.  The District Court granted Castro a certificate to appeal its \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d determination.<font b="1">  \xc2\xa72253(c)(1).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4) The Eleventh Circuit affirmed by a split (2-to-1) vote.  290 F.\xc2\xa03d 1270 (2002).  The majority \xe2\x80\x9csuggested\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9curged\xe2\x80\x9d district courts in the future to \xe2\x80\x9cwarn prisoners of the consequences of recharacterization and provide them with the opportunity to amend or dismiss their filings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1273, 1274.  But it held that the 1994 court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to do so did not legally undermine its recharacterization.  Hence, Castro\xe2\x80\x99s current \xc2\xa72255 motion was indeed his second habeas motion.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1274.<font b="1"> </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other Circuits have taken a different approach.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palmer</em>, 296 F. 3d 1135, 1145\xe2\x80\x931147 (CADC 2002) (announcing a rule <em>requiring</em> courts to notify <em>pro se </em>litigants prior to recharacterization and refusing to find the \xc2\xa72255 motion before it \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d since such notice was lacking).  We consequently granted Castro\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with a jurisdictional matter.  We asked the parties to consider the relevance of a provision in the federal habeas corpus statutes that says that the </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cgrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application \xe2\x80\xa6 shall not be the subject of a petition for \xe2\x80\xa6 a writ of certiorari.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72244(b)(3)(E).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAfter receiving the parties\xe2\x80\x99 responses, we conclude that this provision does not bar our review here.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Castro\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the Eleventh Circuit did not concern an \xe2\x80\x9cauthorization . . . to file a second or successive application.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court certified for appeal the question whether Castro\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa72255 motion was his first such motion or his second.  Castro then argued to the Eleventh Circuit that his \xc2\xa72255 motion was his first; and he asked the court to reverse the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of that motion.  He nowhere asked the Court of Appeals to grant, and it nowhere denied, any \xe2\x80\x9cauthorization \xe2\x80\xa6 to file a second or successive application.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion had the <em>effect</em> of denying \xe2\x80\x9cauthorization . . . to file a second . . . application\xe2\x80\x9d because the court said in its opinion that Castro\xe2\x80\x99s motion could not meet the requirements for second or successive motions.  290 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1273.  For that reason, the Government concludes, the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision falls within the scope of the jurisdictional provision.  Brief for United States 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, however, this argument stretches the words of the statute too far.  Given the context, we cannot take these words in the opinion as a statutorily relevant \xe2\x80\x9cdenial\xe2\x80\x9d of a request that was not made.  Even if, for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, we were to accept the Government\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, the argument nonetheless would founder on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the \xe2\x80\x9cdenial\xe2\x80\x9d must be the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>subject</em>\xe2\x80\x9d of the certiorari petition.  The \xe2\x80\x9csubject\xe2\x80\x9d of Castro\xe2\x80\x99s petition is not the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdenial of an authorization.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to recognize that this \xc2\xa72255 motion is his first, not his second.  That is a very different question.  Cf.<em> Adamo Wrecking Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/275/index.html">434 U. S. 275</a>, 282\xe2\x80\x93283 (1978) (statute barring court review of lawfulness of agency \xe2\x80\x9cemission standard\xe2\x80\x9d in criminal case does not bar court review of whether regulation <em>is </em>an \xe2\x80\x9cemission standard\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, reading the statute as the Government suggests would produce troublesome results.  It would create procedural anomalies, allowing review where the lower court decision disfavors, but denying review where it favors, the Government.  Cf. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Martinez-Villareal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/637/index.html">523 U.

It would close our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review without any clear indication that such was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.

They may do so in order to avoid an unnecessary dismissal, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 692\xe2\x80\x93693, to avoid inappropriately stringent application of formal labeling requirements, see <em>Haines</em> v. <em>Kerner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/519/index.html">404 U. S. 519</a>, 520 (1972) <em>(per curiam)</em>, or to create a better correspondence between the substance of a <em>pro se</em> motion\xe2\x80\x99s claim and its underlying legal basis.

Those Circuits recognize that, by recharacterizing as a first \xc2\xa72255 motion a <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>filing that did not previously bear that label, the court may make it significantly more difficult for that litigant to file another such motion.  They have consequently concluded that a district court may not recharacterize a <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s motion as a request for relief under \xc2\xa72255\xe2\x80\x94unless the court first warns the <em>pro se</em> litigant about the consequences of the recharacterization, thereby giving the litigant an opportunity to contest the recharacterization, or to withdraw or amend the motion.

The Government suggests that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47 provides adequate underlying legal authority for the procedural practice.  Brief for United States 42.  It suggests that this Court has the authority to regulate the practice through \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise\xe2\x80\x9d of our \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory powers\xe2\x80\x9d over the federal judiciary.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>McNabb</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/332/index.html">318 U.

And it notes that limiting the courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to recharacterize, approximately as the Courts of Appeals have done, \xe2\x80\x9cis likely to reduce and simplify litigation over questions of characterization, which are often quite difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 42.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with these suggestions.  We consequently hold, as almost every Court of Appeals has already held, that the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 recharacterization powers are limited in the following way:  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The limitation applies when a court recharacterizes a <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s motion as a first \xc2\xa72255 motion.  In such circumstances the district court must notify the <em>pro se</em> litigant that it intends to recharacterize the pleading, warn the litigant that this recharacterization means that any subsequent \xc2\xa72255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d motions, and provide the litigant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the \xc2\xa72255 claims he believes he has.  If the court fails to do so, the motion cannot be considered to have become a \xc2\xa72255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the law\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d restrictions.  \xc2\xa72255, \xc2\xb6  ;8.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court that considered Castro\xe2\x80\x99s 1994 motion failed to give Castro warnings of the kind we have described.  Moreover, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory power\xe2\x80\x9d determinations normally apply, like other judicial decisions, retroactively, at least to the case in which the determination was made.  <em>McNabb, supra</em>, at 347 (applying new supervisory rule to case before the Court).  Hence, given our holding in Part III, <em>supra</em>, Castro\xe2\x80\x99s 1994 motion cannot be considered a first \xc2\xa72255 motion, and his 1997 motion cannot be considered a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d motion\xe2\x80\x94unless there is something special about Castro\xe2\x80\x99s case. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that there is something special: Castro failed to appeal the 1994 recharacterization.  According to the Government, that fact makes the 1994 recharacterization valid as a matter of \xe2\x80\x9claw of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, since the 1994 recharacterization is valid, the 1997 \xc2\xa72255 motion is Castro\xe2\x80\x99s second, not his first.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not agree.  No Circuit that has considered whether to treat a \xc2\xa72255 motion as successive (based on a prior unwarned recharacterization) has found that the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to challenge that recharacterization makes a difference.  See <em>Palmer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1147; see also <em>Henderson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 711\xe2\x80\x93712; <em>Raineri</em>, 233 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 100; <em>In\xc2\xa0re Shelton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 622. <em> </em>That is not surprising, for the very point of the warning is to help the <em>pro se</em> litigant understand not only (1) whether he should withdraw or amend his motion, but also (2) whether he should <em>contest</em> the recharacterization, say, on appeal.  The \xe2\x80\x9clack of warning\xe2\x80\x9d prevents his making an informed judgment in respect to the latter just as it does in respect to the former.  Indeed, an unwarned <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to appeal a recharacterization simply underscores the practical importance of providing the warning.  Hence, an unwarned recharacterization cannot count as a \xc2\xa72255 motion for purposes of the \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d provision, whether the unwarned <em>pro se</em> litigant does, or does not, take an appeal.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law of the case doctrine cannot pose an insurmountable obstacle to our reaching this conclusion.  Assuming for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake that the doctrine applies here, it simply \xe2\x80\x9cexpresses\xe2\x80\x9d common judicial \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d; it does not \xe2\x80\x9climit\xe2\x80\x9d the courts\xe2\x80\x99 power.

I also agree that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of Castro\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the status of his recharacterized motion is neither barred by nor necessarily resolved by the doctrine of law of the case. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I write separately because I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s laissez-faire attitude toward recharacterization.  The Court promulgates a new procedure to be followed if the district court desires the recharacterized motion to count against the <em>pro se</em> litigant as a first 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255 motion in later litigation.  (This procedure, by the way, can be ignored with impunity by a court bent upon aiding <em>pro se</em> litigants at all costs; the only consequence will be that the litigants\xe2\x80\x99 later \xc2\xa72255 submissions cannot be deemed \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d)  The Court does not, however, place any limits on when recharacterization may occur, but to the contrary treats it as a routine practice which may be employed \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid an unnecessary dismissal,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid inappropriately stringent application of formal labeling requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto create a better correspondence between the substance of a <em>pro se</em> motion\xe2\x80\x99s claim and its underlying legal basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  The Court does not address whether Castro\xe2\x80\x99s motion filed under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 should have been recharacterized, and its discussion scrupulously avoids placing any limits on the circumstances in which district courts are permitted to recharacterize.  That is particularly regrettable since the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new recharacterization procedure does not include an option for the <em>pro se</em> litigant to insist that the district court rule on his motion as filed; and gives scant indication of what might be a meritorious ground for contesting the recharacterization on appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, this approach gives too little regard to the exceptional nature of recharacterization within an adversarial system, and neglects the harm that may be caused <em>pro se</em> litigants even when courts do comply with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s newly minted procedure.  The practice of judicial recharacterization of <em>pro se</em> litigants\xe2\x80\x99 motions is a mutation of the principle that the allegations of a <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s complaint are to be held \xe2\x80\x9cto less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Haines</em> v. <em>Kerner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/519/index.html">404 U. S. 519</a>, 520 (1972) (per curiam).  \xe2\x80\x9cLiberal construction\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>pro se</em> pleadings is merely an embellishment of the notice-pleading standard set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and thus is consistent with the general principle of American jurisprudence that \xe2\x80\x9cthe party who brings a suit is master to decide what law he will rely upon.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>The Fair</em> v. <em>Kohler Die &amp; Specialty Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/228/22/index.html">228 U. S. 22</a>, 25 (1913).  Our adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recharacterization is unlike \xe2\x80\x9cliberal construction,\xe2\x80\x9d in that it requires a court deliberately to override the <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s choice of procedural vehicle for his claim.  It is thus a paternalistic judicial exception to the principle of party self-determination, born of the belief that the \xe2\x80\x9cparties know better\xe2\x80\x9d assumption does not hold true for <em>pro se</em> prisoner litigants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I am frankly not enamored of any departure from our traditional adversarial principles.  It is not the job of a federal court to create a \xe2\x80\x9cbetter correspondence\xe2\x80\x9d between the substance of a claim and its underlying procedural basis.  But if departure from traditional adversarial principles is to be allowed, it should certainly not occur in any situation where there is a risk that the patronized litigant will be harmed rather than assisted by the court\xe2\x80\x99s intervention.  It is not just a matter of whether the litigant is <em>more likely</em>, or even <em>much more likely</em>, to be helped rather than harmed.  For the overriding rule of judicial intervention must be \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, do <em>no harm</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  The injustice caused by letting the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s own mistake lie is regrettable, but incomparably less than the injustice of <em>producing </em>prejudice through the court\xe2\x80\x99s intervention.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The risk of harming the litigant always exists when the court recharacterizes into a first \xc2\xa72255 motion a claim that is procedurally or substantively deficient in the manner filed.  The court essentially substitutes the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to bring his merits claim now, for the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>later</em> ability to bring the same claim (or any other claim), perhaps with stronger evidence.  For the later \xc2\xa72255 motion will then be burdened by the limitations on second or successive petitions imposed by AEDPA (the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214).  A <em>pro se</em> litigant whose non-\xc2\xa72255 motion is dismissed on procedural grounds and one whose recharacterized \xc2\xa72255 claim is denied on the merits both end up as losers in their particular actions, but the loser on procedure is better off because he is not stuck with the consequences of a \xc2\xa72255 motion that he never filed.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be an inadequate response to this concern to state that district courts should recharacterize into first \xc2\xa72255 motions <em>only </em>when doing so is (1) procedurally necessary (2) to grant relief on the merits of the underlying claim.  Ensuring that these conditions are met would often enmesh district courts in fact- and labor-intensive inquiries.  It is an inefficient use of judicial resources to analyze the merits of every claim brought by means of a questionable procedural vehicle simply in order to determine whether to recharacterize\xe2\x80\x94particularly in the common situation in which entitlement to relief turns on resolution of disputed facts.  Moreover, even after that expenditure of effort the district court cannot be certain it is not prejudicing the litigant: the court of appeals may not agree with it on the merits of the claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other words, even fully informed district courts that try their best not to harm <em>pro se</em> litigants by recharacterizing may nonetheless end up doing so because they cannot predict and protect against every possible adverse effect that may flow from recharacterization.  But if district courts are unable to provide this sort of protection, they should not recharacterize into first \xc2\xa72255 motions at all.  This option is available under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, even though the opinion does not prescribe it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today relieves Castro of the consequences of the recharacterization (to-wit, causing his current \xc2\xa72255 motion to be dismissed as \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d) because he was not given the warning that its opinion prescribes.  I reach the same result for a different reason.  Even if one does not agree with me that, because of the risk involved, pleadings should <em>never</em> be recharacterized into first \xc2\xa72255 motions, surely one must agree that running the risk is unjustified <em>when there is nothing whatever to be gained by the recharacterization</em>.  That is the situation here.  Castro\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 33 motion was valid as a procedural matter, and the claim it raised was no weaker on the merits when presented under Rule 33 than when presented under \xc2\xa72255.  The recharacterization was therefore unquestionably improper, and Castro should be relieved of its consequences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></div>'
