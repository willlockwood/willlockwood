She testified that Cellmark was an accredited laboratory and that business records showed that vaginal swabs taken from the victim, L.\xc2\xa0J., were sent to Cellmark and returned.  She offered no other statement for the purpose of identifying the sample used for Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s profile or establishing how Cellmark handled or tested the sample.  Nor did she vouch for the accuracy of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s profile.  The defense moved to exclude, on Confrontation Clause grounds, Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony insofar as it implicated events at Cellmark, but the prosecution said that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation rights were satisfied because he had the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who had testified as to the match.  The prosecutor argued that Illinois Rule of Evidence 703 permitted an expert to disclose facts on which the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is based even if the expert is not competent to testify to those underlying facts, and that any deficiency went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.  The trial court admitted the evidence and found petitioner guilty.  Both the Illinois Court of Appeals and the State Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony did not violate petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation rights because Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report was not offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">\n\t\t\t\t238 Ill. 2d 125, 939 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 268, affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Breyer, concluded that the form of expert testimony given in this case does not violate the Confrontation Clause.

Washington, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36\n, this Court took the view that the Confrontation Clause did not bar the admission of out-of-court statements that fell within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule.  In Crawford, the Court held that such statements could be \xe2\x80\x9cadmitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 59.  In both Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305\n, and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, two of the many cases that have arisen from Crawford, this Court ruled that scientific reports could not be used as substantive evidence against a defendant unless the analyst who prepared and certified the report was subject to confrontation.  In each case, the report at issue \xe2\x80\x9ccontain[ed] a testimonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  Here, in contrast, the question is the constitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others\xe2\x80\x99 testimonial statements if those statements are not themselves admitted as evidence.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0An expert witness may voice an opinion based on facts concerning the events at issue even if the expert lacks first-hand knowledge of those facts.  A long tradition in American courts permits an expert to testify in the form of a \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical question,\xe2\x80\x9d where the expert assumes the truth of factual predicates and then offers testimony based on those assumptions.  See Forsyth v. Doolittle, \n\n120 U.\xc2\xa0S. 73\n.  Modern evidence rules dispense with the need for hypothetical questions and permit an expert to base an opinion on facts \xe2\x80\x9cmade known to the expert at or before the hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d though such reliance does not constitute admissible evidence of the underlying information.  Ill. Rule Evid. 703; Fed. Rule Evid. 703.  Both Illinois and Federal Rules bar an expert from disclosing the inadmissible evidence in jury trials but not in bench trials.  This is important because Crawford, while departing from prior Confrontation Clause precedent in other respects, reaffirmed the proposition that the Clause \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59, n.\xc2\xa09.

Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9327.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(1)\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation right was not violated when Lambatos answered \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to a question about whether there was a match between the DNA profile \xe2\x80\x9cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.\xc2\xa0J.]\xe2\x80\x9d and the one identified as petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s.  Under Illinois law, this putatively offending phrase was not admissible for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted\xe2\x80\x94i.e., that the matching DNA profile was \xe2\x80\x9cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, that fact was a mere premise of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s question, and Lambatos simply assumed it to be true in giving her answer.  Because this was a bench trial, the Court assumes that the trial judge understood that the testimony was not admissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  It is also unlikely that the judge took the testimony as providing chain-of-custody evidence.  The record does not support such an understanding; no trial judge is likely to be so confused; and the admissible evidence left little room for argument that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s sample came from any source but L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s swabs, since the profile matched the very man she identified in a lineup and at trial as her attacker.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9321.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0Nor did the substance of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report need to be introduced in order to show that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s profile was based on the semen in L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s swabs or that its procedures were reliable.  The issue here is whether petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation right was violated, not whether the State offered sufficient foundational evidence to support the admission of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 opinion.  If there were no proof that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s profile was accurate, Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony would be irrelevant, but the Confrontation Clause bars not the admission of irrelevant evidence, but the admission of testimonial statements by declarants who are not subject to cross-examination.  Here, the trial record does not lack admissible evidence with respect to the source of the sample tested by Cellmark or the reliability of its profile.  The State offered conventional chain-of-custody evidence, and the match between Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s profile and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s was telling confirmation that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s profile was deduced from the semen on L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s swabs.  The match also provided strong circumstantial evidence about the reliability of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s work.

In contrast, Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report was considered for the limited purpose of seeing whether it matched something else, and the relevance of that match was established by independent circumstantial evidence showing that the report was based on a sample from the crime scene.  There are at least four safeguards to prevent abuses in such situations.  First, trial courts can screen out experts who would act as conduits for hearsay by strictly enforcing the requirement that experts display genuine \xe2\x80\x9cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d to help the trier of fact understand the evidence or determine a fact at issue.  Fed. Rule Evid. 702(a).  Second, experts are generally precluded from disclosing inadmissible evidence to a jury.  Third, if such evidence is disclosed, a trial judge may instruct the jury that the statements cannot be accepted for their truth, and that an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is only as good as the independent evidence establishing its underlying premises.  Fourth, if the prosecution cannot muster independent admissible evidence to prove foundational facts, the expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony cannot be given weight by the trier of fact.  Pp. \xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9327.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(e)\xc2\xa0Even if Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report had been introduced for its truth, there would have been no Confrontation Clause violation.  The Clause refers to testimony by \xe2\x80\x9cwitnesses against\xe2\x80\x9d an accused, prohibiting modern-day practices that are tantamount to the abuses that gave rise to the confrontation right, namely, (a) out-of-court statements having the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct, and (b) formalized statements such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.  These characteristics were present in every post-Crawford case in which a Confrontation Clause violation has been found, except for Hammon v. Indiana, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813\n.  But, even in Hammon, the particular statement, elicited during police interrogation, had the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.  A person who makes a statement to resolve an ongoing emergency is not like a trial witness because the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to bring an end to an ongoing threat.  Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Such a statement\xe2\x80\x99s admissibility \xe2\x80\x9cis the concern of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause. \xe2\x80\x9d  Id., ___\xe2\x80\x93___ .  The forensic reports in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming ran afoul of the Confrontation Clause because they were the equivalent of affidavits made for the purpose of proving a particular criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  But the Cellmark report\xe2\x80\x99s primary purpose was to catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain evidence for use against petitioner, who was neither in custody nor under suspicion at that time.  Nor could anyone at Cellmark possibly know that the profile would inculpate petitioner.  There was thus no \xe2\x80\x9cprospect of fabrication\xe2\x80\x9d and no incentive to produce anything other than a scientifically sound and reliable profile.  Bryant, supra, at ___, ___.  Lab technicians producing a DNA profile generally have no way of knowing whether it will turn out to be incriminating, exonerating, or both.  And with numerous technicians working on a profile, it is likely that each technician\xe2\x80\x99s sole purpose is to perform a task in accordance with accepted procedures.  The knowledge that defects in a DNA profile may be detected from the profile itself provides a further safeguard.

Under Illinois law, such facts are not admitted for their truth, but only to explain the basis of the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  See People v. Pasch, 152 Ill. 2d 133.  But state evidence rules do not trump a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to confrontation.  This Court ensures that an out-of-court statement was introduced for a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate, nonhearsay purpose\xe2\x80\x9d before relying on the not-for-its-truth rationale to dismiss the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x99s application.  See Tennessee v. Street, \n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409\n.  Statements introduced to explain the basis of an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion are not introduced for a plausible nonhearsay purpose because, to use the basis testimony in evaluating the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, the factfinder must consider the truth of the basis testimony.  This commonsense conclusion is not undermined by any historical practice exempting expert basis testimony from the rigors of the Confrontation Clause.  Before the Federal Rules of Evidence were adopted in 1975, an expert could render an opinion based only on facts that the expert had personally perceived or learned at trial.  In 1975, that universe of facts was expanded to include facts that the expert learned out of court by means other than his own perception.  The disclosure of such facts raises Confrontation Clause concerns.

In concluding that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DNA profile matched the profile derived from L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s swabs, Lambatos relied on Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court statements that its profile was in fact derived from those swabs, rather than from some other source.  Thus, the validity of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 opinion ultimately turned on the truth of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s statements.

Washington, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813\n\xe2\x80\x93837, 840 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  This test comports with history because solemnity marked the practices that the Confrontation Clause was designed to eliminate, namely, the ex\xc2\xa0parte examination of witnesses under English bail and committal statutes.  See id., at 835.  Accordingly, the Clause reaches \xe2\x80\x9cformalized testimonial materials,\xe2\x80\x9d such as depositions, affidavits, and prior testimony, or statements resulting from \xe2\x80\x9cformalized dialogue,\xe2\x80\x9d such as custodial interrogation.  Bryant, supra, at ___.  Applying these principles, Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report is not a statement by a \xe2\x80\x9cwitnes[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under the Confrontation Clause.  It lacks the solemnity of an affidavit or deposition, for it is neither a sworn nor a certified declaration of fact.  And, although it was produced at the request of law enforcement, it was not the product of formalized dialogue resembling custodial interrogation.

We also decide whether Crawford substantially impedes the ability of prosecutors to introduce DNA evidence and thus may effectively relegate the prosecution in some cases to reliance on older, less reliable forms of proof.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s bench trial for rape, the prosecution called an expert who testified that a DNA profile produced by an outside laboratory, Cellmark, matched a profile produced by the state police lab using a sample of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s blood.  On direct examination, the expert testified that Cellmark was an accredited laboratory and that Cellmark provided the police with a DNA profile.  The expert also explained the notations on documents admitted as business records, stating that, according to the records, vaginal swabs taken from the victim were sent to and received back from Cellmark.  The expert made no other statement that was offered for the purpose of identifying the sample of biological material used in deriving the profile or for the purpose of establishing how Cellmark handled or tested the sample.  Nor did the expert vouch for the accuracy of the profile that Cellmark produced.  Nevertheless, petitioner contends that the expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony violated the Confrontation Clause as interpreted in Crawford.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s main argument is that the expert went astray when she referred to the DNA profile provided by Cellmark as having been produced from semen found on the victim\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs.  But both the Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme Court found that this statement was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, and it is settled that the Confrontation Clause does not bar the admission of such statements.  See id., at 59\xe2\x80\x9360, n. 9 (citing Tennessee v. Street, \n\n471 U. S. 409 (1985)\n).  For more than 200 years, the law of evidence has permitted the sort of testimony that was given by the ex- pert in this case.  Under settled evidence law, an expert may express an opinion that is based on facts that the expert assumes, but does not know, to be true.  It is then up to the party who calls the expert to introduce other evidence establishing the facts assumed by the expert.  While it was once the practice for an expert who based an opinion on assumed facts to testify in the form of an an- swer to a hypothetical question, modern practice does not demand this formality and, in appropriate cases, permits an expert to explain the facts on which his or her opinion is based without testifying to the truth of those facts.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 703.  That is precisely what occurred in this case, and we should not lightly \xe2\x80\x9cswee[p] away an accepted rule governing the admission of scientific evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305, \n330 (2009)\n (Kennedy, J., dissenting).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe now conclude that this form of expert testimony does not violate the Confrontation Clause because that provision has no application to out-of-court statements that are not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  When an expert testifies for the prosecution in a criminal case, the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine the expert about any statements that are offered for their truth.  Out-of-court statements that are related by the expert solely for the purpose of explaining the assumptions on which that opinion rests are not offered for their truth and thus fall outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause.  Applying this rule to the present case, we conclude that the expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony did not violate the \n \nSixth Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs a second, independent basis for our decision, we also conclude that even if the report produced by Cellmark had been admitted into evidence, there would have been no Confrontation Clause violation.  The Cellmark report is very different from the sort of extrajudicial statements, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, and confessions, that the Confrontation Clause was originally understood to reach.  The report was produced before any suspect was identified.  The report was sought not for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used against petitioner, who was not even under suspicion at the time, but for the purpose of finding a rapist who was on the loose.  And the profile that Cellmark provided was not inherently inculpatory.  On the contrary, a DNA profile is evidence that tends to exculpate all but one of the more than 7 billion people in the world today.  The use of DNA evidence to exonerate persons who have been wrongfully accused or convicted is well known.  If DNA profiles could not be introduced without calling the technicians who participated in the preparation of the profile, economic pressures would encourage prosecutors to forgo DNA testing and rely instead on older forms of evidence, such as eyewitness identification, that are less reliable.  See Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012).  The Confrontation Clause does not mandate such an undesirable development.  This conclusion will not prejudice any defendant who really wishes to probe the reliability of the DNA testing done in a particular case because those who participated in the testing may always be subpoenaed by the defense and questioned at trial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn February 10, 2000, in Chicago, Illinois, a young woman, L.\xc2\xa0J., was abducted while she was walking home from work.  The perpetrator forced her into his car and raped her, then robbed her of her money and other personal items and pushed her out into the street.  L.\xc2\xa0J. ran home and reported the attack to her mother, who called the police.  An ambulance took L.\xc2\xa0J. to the hospital, where doctors treated her wounds and took a blood sample and vaginal swabs for a sexual-assault kit.  A Chicago Police detective collected the kit, labeled it with an inventory number, and sent it under seal to the Illinois State Police (ISP) lab.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the ISP lab, a forensic scientist received the sealed kit.  He conducted a chemical test that confirmed the presence of semen on the vaginal swabs, and he then resealed the kit and placed it in a secure evidence freezer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDuring the period in question, the ISP lab often sent biological samples to Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratory in Germantown, Maryland, for DNA testing.  There was evidence that the ISP lab sent L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs to Cellmark for testing and that Cellmark sent back a report containing a male DNA profile produced from semen taken from those swabs.  At this time, petitioner was not under suspicion for L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s rape.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSandra Lambatos, a forensic specialist at the ISP lab, conducted a computer search to see if the Cellmark profile matched any of the entries in the state DNA database.  The computer showed a match to a profile produced by the lab from a sample of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s blood that had been taken after he was arrested on unrelated charges on August 3, 2000.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn April 17, 2001, the police conducted a lineup at which L.\xc2\xa0J. identified petitioner as her assailant.  Petitioner was then indicted for aggravated criminal sexual assault, aggravated kidnaping, and aggravated robbery.  In lieu of a jury trial, petitioner chose to be tried before a state judge.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s bench trial began in April 2006.  In open court, L.\xc2\xa0J. again identified petitioner as her attacker.  The State also offered three expert forensic witnesses to link petitioner to the crime through his DNA.  First, Brian Hapack, an ISP forensic scientist, testified that he had confirmed the presence of semen on the vaginal swabs taken from L.\xc2\xa0J. by performing an acid phosphatase test.  After performing this test, he testified, he resealed the evidence and left it in a secure freezer at the ISP lab.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, Karen Abbinanti, a state forensic analyst, testified that she had used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Short Tandem Repeat (STR) techniques to develop a DNA profile from a blood sample that had been drawn from petitioner after he was arrested in August 2000.  She also stated that she had entered petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DNA profile into the state forensic database.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the State offered Sandra Lambatos as an expert witness in forensic biology and forensic DNA analysis.  On direct examination, Lambatos testified about the general process of using the PCR and STR techniques to generate DNA profiles from forensic samples such as blood and semen.  She then described how these DNA profiles could be matched to an individual based on the individual\xe2\x80\x99s unique genetic code.  In making a comparison between two DNA profiles, Lambatos stated, it is a \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly accepted\xe2\x80\x9d practice within the scientific community for \xe2\x80\x9cone DNA expert to rely on the records of another DNA expert.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 51.  Lambatos also testified that Cellmark was an \xe2\x80\x9caccredited crime lab\xe2\x80\x9d and that, in her experience, the ISP lab routinely sent evidence samples via Federal Express to Cellmark for DNA testing in order to expedite the testing process and to \xe2\x80\x9creduce [the lab\xe2\x80\x99s] backlog.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  To keep track of evidence samples and preserve the chain of custody, Lambatos stated, she and other analysts relied on sealed shipping containers and labeled shipping manifests, and she added that experts in her field regularly relied on such protocols.  Id., at 50\xe2\x80\x9351.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLambatos was shown shipping manifests that were admitted into evidence as business records, and she explained what they indicated, namely, that the ISP lab had sent L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs to Cellmark, and that Cellmark had sent them back, along with a deduced male DNA profile.  Id., at 52\xe2\x80\x9355.  The prosecutor asked Lambatos whether there was \xe2\x80\x9ca computer match\xe2\x80\x9d between \xe2\x80\x9cthe male DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.\xc2\xa0J.]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[the] male DNA profile that had been identified\xe2\x80\x9d from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s blood sample.

Rather, she said, she was simply asking Lambatos about \xe2\x80\x9cher own testing based on [DNA] information\xe2\x80\x9d that she had received from Cellmark.  Ibid.  The trial judge agreed, noting, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she says she didn\xe2\x80\x99t do her own testing and she relied on a test of another lab and she\xe2\x80\x99s testifying to that, we will see what she\xe2\x80\x99s going to say.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe prosecutor then proceeded, asking Lambatos, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you compare the semen that had been identified by Brian Hapack from the vaginal swabs of [L.\xc2\xa0J.] to the male DNA profile that had been identified by Karen [Abbinanti] from the blood of [petitioner]?\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLambatos answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Defense counsel lodged an objection \xe2\x80\x9cto the form of the question,\xe2\x80\x9d but the trial judge overruled it.  Ibid.  Lambatos then testified that, based on her own comparison of the two DNA profiles, she \xe2\x80\x9cconcluded that [petitioner] cannot be excluded as a possible source of the semen identified in the vaginal swabs,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the probability of the profile\xe2\x80\x99s appearing in the general population was \xe2\x80\x9c1 in 8.7 quadrillion black, 1 in 390 quadrillion white, or 1 in 109 quadrillion Hispanic unrelated individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 57.  Asked whether she would \xe2\x80\x9ccall this a match to [petitioner],\xe2\x80\x9d Lambatos answered yes, again over defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  Id., at 58.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Cellmark report itself was neither admitted into evidence nor shown to the factfinder.  Lambatos did not quote or read from the report; nor did she identify it as the source of any of the opinions she expressed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn cross-examination, Lambatos confirmed that she did not conduct or observe any of the testing on the vaginal swabs, and that her testimony relied on the DNA profile produced by Cellmark.  Id., at 59.  She stated that she trusted Cellmark to do reliable work because it was an accredited lab, but she admitted she had not seen any of the calibrations or work that Cellmark had done in deducing a male DNA profile from the vaginal swabs.  Id., at 59\xe2\x80\x9362.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAsked whether the DNA sample might have been degraded before Cellmark analyzed it, Lambatos answered that, while degradation was technically possible, she strongly doubted it had occurred in this case.  She gave two reasons.  First, the ISP lab likely would have noticed the degradation before sending the evidence off to Cell- mark.  Second, and more important, Lambatos also noted that the data making up the DNA profile would ex- hibit certain telltale signs if it had been deduced from a degraded sample: The visual representation of the DNA sequence would exhibit \xe2\x80\x9cspecific patterns\xe2\x80\x9d of degradation, and she \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t see any evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of that from looking at the profile that Cellmark produced.  Id., at 81\xe2\x80\x9382.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen Lambatos finished testifying, the defense moved to exclude her testimony \xe2\x80\x9cwith regards to testing done by [Cellmark]\xe2\x80\x9d based on the Confrontation Clause.  Id., at 90.  Defense counsel argued that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno evidence with regards to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any work done by [Cellmark] to justify testimony coming into this case with regard to their analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Thus, while defense counsel objected to and sought the exclusion of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony insofar as it implicated events at the Cellmark lab, defense counsel did not object to or move for the exclusion of any other portion of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, including statements regarding the contents of the shipment sent to or received back from Cellmark.

The Court emphasized that the introduction of the report to prove the nature of the substance found in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s possession was tantamount to \xe2\x80\x9clive, in-court testimony\xe2\x80\x9d on that critical fact and that the certificates did \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely what a witness does on direct examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 311 (internal quotation marks omitted).  There was no doubt that the certificates were used to prove the truth of the matter they asserted.  Under state law, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole purpose of the affidavits was to provide prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight of the analyzed substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis deleted).  On these facts, the Court said, it was clear that the certif- icates were \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial statements\xe2\x80\x9d that could not be introduced unless their authors were subjected to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cru- cible of cross-examination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 311, 317 (quoting Crawford, supra, at 61).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Bullcoming, we held that another scientific report could not be used as substantive evidence against the de- fendant unless the analyst who prepared and certified the report was subject to confrontation.  The defendant in that case had been convicted of driving while intoxicated.  At trial, the court admitted into evidence a forensic report certifying that a sample of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s blood had an alcohol concentration of 0.21 grams per hundred milli- liters, well above the legal limit.  Instead of calling the analyst who signed and certified the forensic report, the prosecution called another analyst who had not performed or observed the actual analysis, but was only familiar with the general testing procedures of the laboratory.  The Court declined to accept this surrogate testimony, despite the fact that the testifying analyst was a \xe2\x80\x9cknowledgeable representative of the laboratory\xe2\x80\x9d who could \xe2\x80\x9cexplain the lab\xe2\x80\x99s processes and the details of the report.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).

The report was signed by the nontestifying analyst who had authored it, stating, \xe2\x80\x9cI certify that I followed the procedures set out on the reverse of this report, and the statements in this block are correct.

Critically, the report was introduced at trial for the substantive purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted by its out-of-court author\xe2\x80\x94namely, that the defendant had a blood-alcohol level of 0.21.  This was the central fact in question at the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s trial, and it was dispositive of his guilt.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn concurrence, Justice Sotomayor highlighted the im- portance of the fact that the forensic report had been admitted into evidence for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter it asserted.

An expert could rely on facts that had already been established in the record.  But because it was not always possible to proceed in this manner, and because record evidence was often disputed, courts developed the alternative practice of allowing an expert to testify in the form of a \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under this approach, the expert would be asked to assume the truth of certain factual predicates, and was then asked to offer an opinion based on those assumptions.  See 1 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence \xc2\xa714, p. 87 (6th ed. 2006); 1 J.\xc2\xa0Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa7677, p. 1084 (2d ed. 1923) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the witness is skilled enough, his opinion may be adequately obtained upon hypothetical data alone; and it is immate- rial whether he has ever seen the person, place or thing in question\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  The truth of the premises could then be established through independent evidence, and the factfinder would regard the expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony to be only as credible as the premises on which it was based.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn early example of this approach comes from the English case of Beckwith v. Sydebotham, 1 Camp. 116, 170 Eng. Rep. 897 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1807), where a party sought to prove the seaworthiness of a ship, the Earl of Wycombe, by calling as witnesses \xe2\x80\x9cseveral eminent surveyors of ships who had never seen the \xe2\x80\x98Earl of Wycombe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The opposing party objected to the testimony because it relied on facts that were not known to be true, but the judge disagreed.  Because the experts were \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiarly ac- quainted\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of skill or science,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge said, the \xe2\x80\x9cjury might be assisted\xe2\x80\x9d by their hypothetical opinion based on certain assumed facts.  Id., at 117, 170 Eng. Rep., at 897.  The judge acknowledged the danger of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s being unduly prejudiced by wrongly assuming the truth of the hypothetical facts, but the judge noted that the experts could be asked on cross-examination what their opinion of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s seaworthiness would be if different hypothetical facts were assumed.  If the party that had called the experts could not independently prove the truth of the premises they posited, then the experts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9copinion might not go for much; but still it was admissible evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is a long tradition of the use of hypothetical questions in American courts.  In 1887, for example, this Court indicated its approval of the following jury instruction:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the questions, you must understand that they are not evidence; they are mere statements to these witnesses .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and, upon the hypothesis or assumption of these questions the witnesses are asked to give their [opinion].  You must readily see that the value of the answers to these questions depends largely, if not wholly, upon the fact whether the statements made in these questions are sustained by the proof.  If the statements in these questions are not supported by the proof, then the answers to the questions are entitled to no weight, because based upon false assumptions or statements of facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Forsyth v. Doolittle, \n\n120 U.\xc2\xa0S. 73\n (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tModern rules of evidence continue to permit experts to express opinions based on facts about which they lack personal knowledge, but these rules dispense with the need for hypothetical questions.  Under both the Illinois and the Federal Rules of Evidence, an expert may base an opinion on facts that are \xe2\x80\x9cmade known to the expert at or before the hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d but such reliance does not constitute admissible evidence of this underlying information.  Ill. Rule Evid. 703; Fed. Rule Evid. 703.  Accordingly, in jury trials, both Illinois and federal law generally bar an expert from disclosing such inadmissible evidence.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In bench trials, however, both the Illinois and the Federal Rules place no restriction on the revelation of such information to the factfinder.  When the judge sits as the trier of fact, it is presumed that the judge will understand the limited reason for the disclosure of the underlying inadmissible information and will not rely on that information for any improper purpose. As we have noted, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n bench trials, judges routinely hear inadmissible evidence that they are presumed to ignore when making decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harris v. Rivera, \n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 339, \n346 (1981)\n (per\xc2\xa0curiam).

Street, \n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409\n).  In Street, the defendant claimed that the police had coerced him into adopting the confession of his alleged accomplice.  The prosecution sought to rebut this claim by showing that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s confession differed significantly from the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s.  Although the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s confession was clearly a testimonial statement, the Court held that the jurors could hear it as long as they were instructed to consider that confession not for its truth, but only for the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctive and limited purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of comparing it to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s confession, to see whether the two were identical.

She testified to the truth of the following matters: Cellmark was an accredited lab, App. 49; the ISP occasionally sent forensic samples to Cellmark for DNA testing, ibid.; according to shipping manifests admitted into evidence, the ISP lab sent vaginal swabs taken from the victim to Cellmark and later received those swabs back from Cellmark, id., at 52\xe2\x80\x9355; and, finally, the Cellmark DNA profile matched a profile produced by the ISP lab from a sample of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s blood, id., at 55\xe2\x80\x9356.  Lambatos had personal knowledge of all of these matters, and therefore none of this testimony in- fringed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation right.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLambatos did not testify to the truth of any other matter concerning Cellmark.  She made no other reference to the Cellmark report, which was not admitted into evidence and was not seen by the trier of fact.  Nor did she testify to anything that was done at the Cellmark lab, and she did not vouch for the quality of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s work.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe principal argument advanced to show a Confrontation Clause violation concerns the phrase that Lambatos used when she referred to the DNA profile that the ISP lab received from Cellmark.  This argument is developed most fully in the dissenting opinion, and therefore we refer to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of this issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the view of the dissent, the following is the critical portion of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, with the particular words that the dissent finds objectionable italicized:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">\n\t\t\t\t\n\xe2\x80\x9cQ\xe2\x80\x82Was there a computer match generated of the male DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.J.] to a male DNA profile that had been identified as having originated from Sandy Williams?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">\n\t\t\t\t\n\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x82Yes, there was.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 7 (opinion of Kagan, J.)

As the dissent acknowledges, there would have been \xe2\x80\x9cnothing wrong with Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s testifying that two DNA profiles\xe2\x80\x94the one shown in the Cellmark report and the one derived from Williams\xe2\x80\x99s blood\xe2\x80\x94matched each other; that was a straightforward application of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 12.  Thus, if Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony had been slightly modified as follows, the dissent would see no problem:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">\n\t\t\t\t\n\xe2\x80\x9cQ\xe2\x80\x82Was there a computer match generated of the male DNA profile produced by Cellmark found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.J.] to a male DNA profile that had been identified as having originated from Sandy Williams?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">\n\t\t\t\t\n\xe2\x80\x9cA  Yes, there was.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe defect in this argument is that under Illinois law (like federal law) it is clear that the putatively offending phrase in Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony was not admissible for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted\xe2\x80\x94i.e., that the matching DNA profile was \xe2\x80\x9cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, that fact was a mere premise of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s question, and Lambatos simply assumed that premise to be true when she gave her answer indicating that there was a match between the two DNA profiles.  There is no reason to think that the trier of fact took Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 answer as substantive evidence to establish where the DNA profiles came from.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument would have force if petitioner had elected to have a jury trial.  In that event, there would have been a danger of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s taking Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony as proof that the Cellmark profile was derived from the sample obtained from the victim\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs.  Absent an evaluation of the risk of juror confusion and careful jury instructions, the testimony could not have gone to the jury.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case, however, involves a bench trial and we must assume that the trial judge understood that the portion of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony to which the dissent objects was not admissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The dissent, on the other hand, reaches the truly remarkable conclusion that the wording of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony confused the trial judge.  Were it not for that wording, the argument goes, the judge might have found that the prosecution failed to introduce sufficient admissible evidence to show that the Cellmark profile was derived from the sample taken from the victim, and the judge might have disregarded the DNA evidence.  This argument reflects a profound lack of respect for the acumen of the trial judge.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo begin, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument finds no support in the trial record.  After defense counsel objected to Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, the prosecutor made clear that she was asking Lambatos only about \xe2\x80\x9cher own testing based on [DNA] information\xe2\x80\x9d that she had received from Cellmark.  App. 56.  Recognizing that Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony would carry weight only if the underlying premises could be established, the judge noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe issue is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0what weight do you give the test [performed by Lambatos], not do you exclude it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 94.  This echoes the old statement in Beckwith that an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion based on disputed premises \xe2\x80\x9cmight not go for much; but still it [is] admissible evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Camp., at 117, 170 Eng. Rep., at 897.  Both the Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme Court viewed the record in this way, and we see no ground for disagreement.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, it is extraordinarily unlikely that any trial judge would be confused in the way that the dissent posits.  That Lambatos was not competent to testify to the chain of custody of the sample taken from the victim was a point that any trial judge or attorney would immediately understand.  Lambatos, after all, had absolutely nothing to do with the collection of the sample from the victim, its subsequent handling or preservation by the police in Illinois, or its shipment to and receipt by Cellmark.  No trial judge would take Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony as furnishing \xe2\x80\x9cthe missing link\xe2\x80\x9d in the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence regarding the identity of the sample that Cellmark tested.  See post, at 6 (opinion of Kagan, J.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the admissible evidence left little room for argument that the sample tested by Cellmark came from any source other than the victim\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  This is so because there is simply no plausible explanation for how Cellmark could have produced a DNA profile that matched Williams\xe2\x80\x99 if Cellmark had tested any sample other than the one taken from the victim.  If any other items that might have contained Williams\xe2\x80\x99 DNA had been sent to Cellmark or were otherwise in Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s possession, there would have been a chance of a mix-up or of cross-contamination.  See District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52, \n80 (2009)\n (Alito, J., concurring).  But there is absolutely nothing to suggest that Cellmark had any such items.  Thus, the fact that the Cellmark profile matched Williams\xe2\x80\x94the very man whom the victim identified in a lineup and at trial as her at- tacker\xe2\x80\x94was itself striking confirmation that the sample that Cellmark tested was the sample taken from the victim\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs. For these reasons, it is fanciful to suggest that the trial judge took Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony as providing critical chain-of-custody evidence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther than the phrase that Lambatos used in referring to the Cellmark profile, no specific passage in the trial record has been identified as violating the Confrontation Clause, but it is nevertheless suggested that the State somehow introduced \xe2\x80\x9cthe substance of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report into evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 8 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  The main impetus for this argument appears to be the (erroneous) view that unless the substance of the report was sneaked in, there would be insufficient evidence in the record on two critical points: first, that the Cellmark profile was based on the semen in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs and, second, that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s procedures were reli- able.  This argument is both legally irrelevant for present purposes and factually incorrect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs to legal relevance, the question before us is whether petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment confrontation right was violated, not whether the State offered sufficient foundational evidence to support the admission of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 opinion about the DNA match.  In order to prove these underlying facts, the prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence, and the Illinois courts found that this evidence was sufficient to satisfy state-law requirements regarding proof of foundational facts.  See 385 Ill. App. 3d, at 366\xe2\x80\x93368, 895 N. E. 2d, at 967\xe2\x80\x93968; 238 Ill. 2d, at 138, 939 N. E. 2d, at 275.  We cannot review that interpretation and application of Illinois law.  Thus, even if the record did not contain any evidence that could rationally support a finding that Cellmark produced a scientifically reliable DNA profile based on L. J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swab, that would not establish a Confrontation Clause violation.  If there were no proof that Cellmark produced an accurate profile based on that sample, Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony regarding the match would be irrelevant, but the Confrontation Clause, as interpreted in Crawford, does not bar the admission of irrelevant evidence, only testimonial statements by declarants who are not subject to cross-examination.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is not correct, however, that the trial record lacks admissible evidence with respect to the source of the sam- ple that Cellmark tested or the reliability of the Cell- mark profile.  As to the source of the sample, the State offered conventional chain-of-custody evidence, namely, the testimony of the physician who obtained the vaginal swabs, the testimony of the police employees who handled and kept custody of that evidence until it was sent to Cellmark, and the shipping manifests, which provided evidence that the swabs were sent to Cellmark and then returned to the ISP lab.  In addition, as already discussed, the match between the Cellmark profile and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s profile was itself telling confirmation that the Cellmark profile was deduced from the semen on the vaginal swabs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis match also provided strong circumstantial evidence regarding the reliability of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s work.  Assuming (for the reasons discussed above) that the Cellmark profile was based on the semen on the vaginal swabs, how could shoddy or dishonest work in the Cellmark lab\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t have resulted in the production of a DNA profile that just so happened to match petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s?  If the semen found on the vaginal swabs was not petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s and thus had an en- tirely different DNA profile, how could sloppy work in the Cellmark lab have transformed that entirely different profile into one that matched petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s?  And without access to any other sample of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DNA (and recall that petitioner was not even under suspicion at this time), how could a dishonest lab technician have substituted pe- titioner\xe2\x80\x99s DNA profile?  Under the circumstances of this case, it was surely permissible for the trier of fact to infer that the odds of any of this were exceedingly low.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis analysis reveals that much of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument rests on a very clear error.  The dissent argues that Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony could be \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d only if the predicate facts asserted in the Cellmark report were true, and therefore Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 reference to the report must have been used for the purpose of proving the truth of those facts.  See post, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But the truth of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, properly understood, was not dependent on the truth of any predicate facts.  Lambatos testified that two DNA profiles matched.  The correctness of this expert opinion, which the defense was able to test on cross-examination, was not in any way dependent on the origin of the samples from which the profiles were derived.  Of course, Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 opinion would have lacked probative value if the prosecution had not introduced other evidence to establish the provenance of the profiles, but that has nothing to do with the truth of her testimony.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent is similarly mistaken in its contention that the Cellmark report \xe2\x80\x9cwas offered for its truth because that is all such \xe2\x80\x98basis evidence\xe2\x80\x99 can be offered for.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 13; see also post, at 3 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]tatements introduced to explain the basis of an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion are not introduced for a plausible nonhearsay purpose\xe2\x80\x9d).  This view is directly contrary to the current version of Rule 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which this Court approved and sent to Congress in 2000.  Under that Rule, \xe2\x80\x9cbasis evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that is not admissible for its truth may be disclosed even in a jury trial under appropriate circumstances.  The purpose for allowing this disclosure is that it may \xe2\x80\x9cassis[t] the jury to evaluate the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 703, 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 361.  The Rule 703 approach, which was controversial when adopted,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t is based on the idea that the disclosure of basis evidence can help the factfinder understand the expert\xe2\x80\x99s thought process and determine what weight to give to the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  For example, if the factfinder were to suspect that the expert relied on factual premises with no support in the record, or that the expert drew an unwarranted inference from the premises on which the expert relied, then the probativeness or credibility of the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion would be seriously undermined.  The purpose of disclosing the facts on which the expert relied is to allay these fears\xe2\x80\x94to show that the expert\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning was not illogical, and that the weight of the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not depend on factual premises unsupported by other evidence in the record\xe2\x80\x94not to prove the truth of the underlying facts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerhaps because it cannot seriously dispute the legit- imate nonhearsay purpose of illuminating the expert\xe2\x80\x99s thought process, the dissent resorts to the last-ditch argument that, after all, it really does not matter whether Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 statement regarding the source of the Cellmark report was admitted for its truth.  The dissent concedes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial judge might have ignored Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s statement about the Cellmark report,\xe2\x80\x9d but nonetheless maintains that \xe2\x80\x9cthe admission of that statement violated the Confrontation Clause even if the judge ultimately put it aside.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 15, n.\xc2\xa02.  But in a bench trial, it is not necessary for the judge to stop and make a formal statement on the record regarding the limited reason for which the testimony is admitted.  If the judge does not consider the testimony for its truth, the effect is precisely the same.  Thus, if the trial judge in this case did not rely on the statement in question for its truth, there is simply no way around the proviso in Crawford that the Confrontation Clause applies only to out-of-court statements that are \xe2\x80\x9cuse[d]\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cestablis[h] the truth of the matter asserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59\xe2\x80\x9360, n.\xc2\xa09 (citing Street, \n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409\n). \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor all these reasons, we conclude that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment confrontation right was not violated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis conclusion is entirely consistent with Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz.  In those cases, the forensic reports were introduced into evidence, and there is no question that this was done for the purpose of proving the truth of what they asserted: in Bullcoming that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit and in Melendez- Diaz that the substance in question contained cocaine.  Nothing comparable happened here.  In this case, the Cellmark report was not introduced into evidence.  An expert witness referred to the report not to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the report, i.e., that the report contained an accurate profile of the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s DNA, but only to establish that the report contained a DNA profile that matched the DNA profile deduced from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s blood. Thus, just as in Street, the report was not to be considered for its truth but only for the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctive and limited purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of seeing whether it matched something else.  471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 417.  The relevance of the match was then established by independent circumstantial evidence showing that the Cellmark report was based on a forensic sample taken from the scene of the crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur conclusion will not open the door for the kind of abuses suggested by some of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s amici and the dissent. See post, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311; Brief for Richard D. Friedman as Amicus Curiae 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  In the hypothetical situations posited, an expert expresses an opinion based on factual premises not supported by any admissible evidence, and may also reveal the out-of-court statements on which the expert relied.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  There are at least four safeguards to prevent such abuses.  First, trial courts can screen out experts who would act as mere conduits for hearsay by strictly enforcing the requirement that experts display some genuine \xe2\x80\x9cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge [that] will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Evid. 702(a).  Second, experts are generally precluded from disclosing inadmissible evidence to a jury.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 703; People v. Pasch, 152 Ill. 2d 133, 175\xe2\x80\x93176, 604 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 294, 310\xe2\x80\x93311 (1992).  Third, if such evidence is disclosed, the trial judges may and, under most circumstances, must, instruct the jury that out-of-court statements cannot be accepted for their truth, and that an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is only as good as the independent evidence that establishes its underlying premises.  See Fed. Rules Evid. 105, 703; People v. Scott, 148 Ill. 2d 479, 527\xe2\x80\x93528, 594 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 217, 236\xe2\x80\x93237 (1992).  And fourth, if the prosecution cannot muster any independent admissible evidence to prove the foundational facts that are essential to the relevance of the expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, then the expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony cannot be given any weight by the trier of fact.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if the Cellmark report had been introduced for its truth, we would nevertheless conclude that there was no Confrontation Clause violation.  The Confrontation Clause refers to testimony by \xe2\x80\x9cwitnesses against\xe2\x80\x9d an accused.  Both the noted evidence scholar James Henry Wigmore and Justice Harlan interpreted the Clause in a strictly literal sense as referring solely to persons who testify in court, but we have not adopted this narrow view.  It has been said that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he difficulty with the Wigmore-Harlan view in its purest form is its tension with much of the apparent history surrounding the evolution of the right of confrontation at common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  White v. Illinois, \n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 346, \n360 (1992)\n (Thomas, J., concurring).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded in Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n England, pretrial examinations of suspects and witnesses by government officials \xe2\x80\x98were sometimes read in court in lieu of live testimony.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Crawford, supra, at 43).  The Court has thus interpreted the Confrontation Clause as prohibiting modern-day practices that are tantamount to the abuses that gave rise to the recognition of the confrontation right.  But any further expansion would strain the constitutional text.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe abuses that the Court has identified as prompting the adoption of the Confrontation Clause shared the following two characteristics: (a) they involved out-of-court statements having the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct and (b) they involved formalized statements such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.  In all but one of the post-Crawford cases\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F13" name="T13">\n\t\t\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t in which a Confrontation Clause violation has been found, both of these characteristics were present.  See Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308 (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934) (certified lab report having purpose of showing that defendant\xe2\x80\x99s blood-alcohol level exceeded legal limit); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308 (certified lab report having purpose of showing that substance connected to defendant contained cocaine); Crawford, supra, at 38 (custodial statement made after Miranda warnings that shifted blame from declarant to accused).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F14" name="T14">\n\t\t\t\t\t14\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The one exception occurred in Hammon v. Indiana, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813\n\xe2\x80\x93832 (2006), which was decided together with Davis v. Washington, but in Hammon and every other post-Crawford case in which the Court has found a violation of the confrontation right, the statement at issue had the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Hammon, the one case in which an informal statement was held to violate the Confrontation Clause, we considered statements elicited in the course of police in- terrogation.  We held that a statement does not fall within the ambit of the Clause when it is made \xe2\x80\x9cunder circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 822.  In Bryant, another police-interrogation case, we explained that a person who makes a statement to resolve an ongoing emergency is not acting like a trial witness because the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is not to provide a solemn declaration for use at trial, but to bring an end to an ongoing threat.  See 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11, 14).

We emphasized that if a statement is not made for \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d its admissibility \xe2\x80\x9cis the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, the Court held that the particular forensic reports at issue qualified as testimonial statements, but the Court did not hold that all forensic reports fall into the same category.  Introduction of the reports in those cases ran afoul of the Confrontation Clause because they were the equivalent of affidavits made for the purpose of proving the guilt of a particular criminal defendant at trial.  There was nothing resembling an ongoing emergency, as the suspects in both cases had already been captured, and the tests in question were relatively simple and can generally be performed by a single analyst.  In addition, the technicians who prepared the reports must have realized that their contents (which reported an elevated blood-alcohol level and the presence of an illegal drug) would be incriminating.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Cellmark report is very different.  It plainly was not prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.  In identifying the primary purpose of an out-of-court statement, we apply an objective test.  Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  We look for the primary purpose that a reasonable person would have ascribed to the statement, taking into account all of the surrounding circumstances.

When the ISP lab sent the sample to Cellmark, its primary purpose was to catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain evidence for use against petitioner, who was neither in custody nor under suspicion at that time.  Similarly, no one at Cellmark could have possibly known that the profile that it produced would turn out to inculpate petitioner\xe2\x80\x94or for that matter, anyone else whose DNA profile was in a law enforcement database.  Under these circumstances, there was no \xe2\x80\x9cprospect of fabrication\xe2\x80\x9d and no incentive to produce anything other than a scientifi- cally sound and reliable profile.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe situation in which the Cellmark technicians found themselves was by no means unique.  When lab technicians are asked to work on the production of a DNA profile, they often have no idea what the consequences of their work will be.  In some cases, a DNA profile may provide powerful incriminating evidence against a person who is identified either before or after the profile is completed.  But in others, the primary effect of the profile is to exonerate a suspect who has been charged or is under investigation.  The technicians who prepare a DNA profile generally have no way of knowing whether it will turn out to be incriminating or exonerating\xe2\x80\x94or both.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is also significant that in many labs, numerous technicians work on each DNA profile.  See Brief for New York County District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 6 (New York lab uses at least 12 technicians for each case); People v. Johnson, 389 Ill. App. 3d 618, 627, 906 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 70, 79 (2009) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]pproximately 10 Cellmark analysts were involved in the laboratory work in this case\xe2\x80\x9d).  When the work of a lab is divided up in such a way, it is likely that the sole purpose of each technician is simply to perform his or her task in accordance with accepted procedures.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the knowledge that defects in a DNA profile may often be detected from the profile itself provides a further safeguard.  In this case, for example, Lambatos testified that she would have been able to tell from the profile if the sample used by Cellmark had been degraded prior to testing.  As noted above, moreover, there is no real chance that \xe2\x80\x9csample contamination, sample switching, mislabeling, [or] fraud\xe2\x80\x9d could have led Cellmark to produce a DNA profile that falsely matched petitioner.  Post, at 21 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  At the time of the testing, petitioner had not yet been identified as a suspect, and there is no suggestion that anyone at Cellmark had a sample of his DNA to swap in by malice or mistake.

Mnookin, The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence \xc2\xa74.10.1, pp. 196\xe2\x80\x93197 (2d ed. 2011) (hereinafter New Wigmore), that are critical of the theory that an expert, without violating the Confrontation Clause, may express an opinion that is based on testimonial hearsay and may, in some circumstances, disclose that testimonial hearsay to the trier of fact.  The principal basis for this criticism seems to be the fear that juries, even if given limiting instructions, will view the disclosed hearsay as evidence of the truth of the matter asserted.  See id., at 196, n. 36 (referring reader to the more detailed discussion in Mnookin, Expert Evidence and the Confrontation Clause After Crawford v.

This argument plainly has no application in a case like this one, in which a judge sits as the trier of fact.  In the 2012 Supplement of The New Wigmore, the authors discuss the present case and criticize the reasoning of the Illinois courts as follows:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem with [the not-for-the-truth-of-the-matter argument accepted by the Illinois courts] is that Lambatos had to rely on the truth of the statements in the Cellmark report to reach her own conclusion.  The claim that evidence that the jury must credit in order to credit the conclusion of the expert is introduced for something other than its truth is sheer fiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  New Wigmore \xc2\xa74.11.6, at 24 (2012 Supp.) (emphasis added).\nThis discussion is flawed.  It overlooks the fact that there was no jury in this case, and as we have explained, the trier of fact did not have to rely on any testimonial hearsay in order to find that Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony about the DNA match was supported by adequate foundational evidence and was thus probative.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">12</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Our discussion of the first ground for our decision cannot conclude without commenting on the Kocak case, which dramatically appears at the beginning of the dissent.  In that case, a Cellmark lab analyst realized while testifying at a pretrial hearing that there was an error in the lab\xe2\x80\x99s report and that the DNA profile attributed to the accused was actually that of the victim.  The lesson of this cautionary tale is nothing more than the truism that it is possible for an apparently incriminating DNA profile to be mistakenly attributed to an accused.  But requiring that the lab analyst or analysts who produced the DNA profile be called as prosecution witnesses is neither sufficient nor necessary to prevent such errors.  Since samples may be mixed up or contaminated at many points along the way from a crime scene to the lab, calling one or more lab analysts will not necessarily catch all such mistakes.  For example, a mistake might be made by a clerical employee responsible for receiving shipments of samples and then providing them to the lab\xe2\x80\x99s technicians.  What is needed is for the trier of fact to make sure that the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, rules out the possibility of such mistakes at every step along the way.  And in the usual course of authentication, defense counsel will have access to sufficient information to inquire into, question, or challenge the procedures used by a laboratory if this seems to be a prudent and productive strategy.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">13</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Experience might yet show that the holdings in those cases should be reconsidered for the reasons, among others, expressed in the dissents the decisions produced.

Relying on these Rules, the State contends that the facts on which an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion relies are not to be considered for their truth, but only to explain the basis of his opinion.

To be sure, we should not \xe2\x80\x9clightly swee[p] away an accepted rule\xe2\x80\x9d of federal or state evidence law, ante, at 2 (internal quotation marks omitted), when applying the Confrontation Clause.  \xe2\x80\x9cRules of limited admissibility are commonplace in evidence law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mnookin, Expert Evidence and the Confrontation Clause after Crawford v. Washington, 15 J.\xc2\xa0L. &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y 791, 812 (2007).  And, we often presume that courts and juries follow limiting instructions.  See, e.g., Street, supra, at 415, n.\xc2\xa06.  But we have recognized that concepts central to the application of the Confrontation Clause are ultimately matters of federal constitutional law that are not dictated by state or federal evidentiary rules.  See Barber v. Page, \n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 719\n\xe2\x80\x93725 (1968) (defining a constitutional standard for whether a witness is \xe2\x80\x9cunavailable\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Confrontation Clause); see also Ohio v.

Likewise, we have held that limiting in- structions may be insufficient in some circumstances to protect against violations of the Confrontation Clause.  See Bruton v.

See Street, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 417 (emphasis added).  In Street, the defendant testified that he gave a false confession because police coerced him into parroting his accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s confession.  Id., at 411.  On rebuttal, the prosecution introduced the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s confession to demonstrate to the jury the ways in which the two confessions differed.  Id., at 411\xe2\x80\x93412.  Finding no Confrontation Clause problem, this Court held that the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court confession was not introduced for its truth, but only to impeach the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s version of events.  Id., at 413\xe2\x80\x93414.  Although the Court noted that the confession was not hearsay \xe2\x80\x9cunder traditional rules of evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 413, the Court did not accept that nonhearsay label at face value.  Instead, the Court thoroughly examined the use of the out-of-court confession and the efficacy of a limiting instruction before concluding that the Confrontation Clause was satisfied \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n this context.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 417.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnlike the confession in Street, statements introduced to explain the basis of an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion are not introduced for a plausible nonhearsay purpose.  There is no meaningful distinction between disclosing an out-of-court statement so that the factfinder may evaluate the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and disclosing that statement for its truth.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo use the inadmissible information in evaluating the expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, the jury must make a preliminary judgment about whether this information is true.\xe2\x80\x9d  D. Kaye, D. Bernstein, &amp; J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: A Treatise on Evidence: Expert Evidence \xc2\xa74.10.1, p.\xc2\xa0196 (2d ed. 2011) (hereinafter Kaye).  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the jury believes that the basis evidence is true, it will likely also believe that the expert\xe2\x80\x99s reliance is justified; inversely, if the jury doubts the accuracy or validity of the basis evidence, it will be skeptical of the expert\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, this common- sense conclusion is not undermined by any longstand- ing historical practice exempting expert basis testimony from the rigors of the Confrontation Clause.  Prior to the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1975, an expert could render an opinion based only on facts that the expert had personally perceived or facts that the expert learned at trial, either by listening to the testimony of other witnesses or through a hypothetical question based on facts in evidence.  See Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 703, 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 361; 29 C. Wright &amp; V.

In those situations, there was little danger that the expert would rely on testimonial hearsay that was not subject to confrontation because the expert and the witnesses on whom he relied were present at trial.  It was not until 1975 that the universe of facts upon which an expert could rely was expanded to include facts of the case that the expert learned out of court by means other than his own perception.  1 Broun \xc2\xa714, at 87; Kaye \xc2\xa74.6, at 157.  It is the expert\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure of those facts that raises Confrontation Clause concerns.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThose concerns are fully applicable in this case.  Lambatos opined that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DNA profile matched the male profile derived from L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs.  In reaching that conclusion, Lambatos relied on Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court statements that the profile it reported was in fact derived from L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s swabs, rather than from some other source.  Thus, the validity of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 opinion ultimately turned on the truth of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s statements.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s statements were merely relayed to explain \xe2\x80\x9cthe assumptions on which [Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99] opinion rest[ed],\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 3, overlooks that the value of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony depended on the truth of those very assumptions.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is no answer to say that other nonhearsay evidence established the basis of the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  Here, Lambatos disclosed Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s statements that it generated a male DNA profile from L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s swabs, but other evidence showed that L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s swabs contained semen and that the swabs were shipped to and received from Cellmark.  Ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  That evidence did not render Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s statements superfluous.  Of course, evidence that Cellmark received L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s swabs and later produced a DNA profile is some indication that Cellmark in fact generated the profile from those swabs, rather than from some other source (or from no source at all).  Cf. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305, \n319 (2009)\n (citing brief that describes \xe2\x80\x9ccases of documented \xe2\x80\x98drylabbing\xe2\x80\x99 where forensic analysts report results of tests that were never performed,\xe2\x80\x9d including DNA tests).  But the only direct evidence to that effect was Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s statement, which Lambatos relayed to the factfinder.  In any event, the factfinder\xe2\x80\x99s ability to rely on other evidence to evaluate an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not alter the conclusion that basis testimony is admitted for its truth.  The existence of other evidence corroborating the basis testimony may render any Confrontation Clause violation harmless, but it does not change the purpose of such testimony and thereby place it outside of the reach of the Confrontation Clause.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  I would thus conclude that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s statements were introduced for their truth.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion may seem of little consequence to those who view DNA testing and other forms of \xe2\x80\x9chard science\xe2\x80\x9d as intrinsically reliable.  But see Melendez-Diaz, supra, at 318 (\xe2\x80\x9cForensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, however, will reach beyond scientific evidence to ordinary out-of-court statements.  For example, it is not uncommon for experts to rely on interviews with third parties in forming their opinions.  See, e.g., People v. Goldstein, 6 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d 119, 123\xe2\x80\x93124, 843 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 727, 729\xe2\x80\x93730 (2005) (psychiatrist disclosed statements made by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintances as part of the basis of her opinion that the defendant was motivated to kill by his feelings of sexual frustration).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is no answer to say that \xe2\x80\x9csafeguards\xe2\x80\x9d in the rules of evidence will prevent the abuse of basis testimony.  Ante, at 26.  To begin with, courts may be willing to conclude that an expert is not acting as a \xe2\x80\x9cmere condui[t]\xe2\x80\x9d for hearsay, ante, at 27, as long as he simply provides some opinion based on that hearsay.  See Brief for Respondent 18, n.\xc2\xa04 (collecting cases).  In addition, the hearsay may be the kind of fact on which experts in a field reasonably rely.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 703; Goldstein, supra, at 125, 843 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 731 (evidence showed that reputable psychiatrists relied upon third-party interviews in forming their opinions).  Of course, some courts may determine that hearsay of this sort is not substantially more probative than prejudicial and therefore should not be disclosed un- der Rule 703.  But that balancing test is no substitute for a constitutional provision that has already struck the balance in favor of the accused.  See Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 61 (\xe2\x80\x9c[The Confrontation Clause] commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHaving concluded that the statements at issue here were introduced for their truth, I turn to whether they were \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.  In Crawford, the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he text of the Confrontation Clause .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. applies to \xe2\x80\x98witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 against the accused\xe2\x80\x94in other words, those who \xe2\x80\x98bear testimony.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 51 (quoting 2 N.

In light of its text, I continue to think that the Confrontation Clause regulates only the use of statements bearing \xe2\x80\x9cindicia of solemnity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Davis v. Washington, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813\n\xe2\x80\x93837, 840 (2006) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  This test comports with history because solemnity marked the practices that the Confrontation Clause was designed to eliminate, namely, the ex\xc2\xa0parte examination of wit- nesses under the English bail and committal statutes passed during the reign of Queen Mary.  See id., at 835; Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1); Crawford, supra, at 43\xe2\x80\x9345.  Accordingly, I have concluded that the Confrontation Clause reaches \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98formalized testimonial materials,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d such as depositions, affidavits, and prior testimony, or statements resulting from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98formalized dialogue,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d such as custodial interrogation.

The Cellmark report lacks the solemnity of an affidavit or deposition, for it is neither a sworn nor a certified declaration of fact.  Nowhere does the report attest that its statements accurately reflect the DNA testing processes used or the results ob- tained.  See Report of Laboratory Examination, Lodging of Petitioner.  The report is signed by two \xe2\x80\x9creviewers,\xe2\x80\x9d but they neither purport to have performed the DNA testing nor certify the accuracy of those who did.  See ibid.  And, although the report was produced at the request of law enforcement, it was not the product of any sort of formalized dialogue resembling custodial interrogation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Cellmark report is distinguishable from the laboratory reports that we determined were testimonial in Melendez-Diaz, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305\n, and in Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).  In Melendez-Diaz, the reports in question were \xe2\x80\x9csworn to before a notary public by [the] analysts\xe2\x80\x9d who tested a substance for cocaine.  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308.  In Bullcoming, the report, though unsworn, included a \xe2\x80\x9cCertificate of Analyst\xe2\x80\x9d signed by the forensic analyst who tested the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s blood sample.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  The analyst \xe2\x80\x9caffirmed that \xe2\x80\x98[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken in the laboratory,\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98the statements in [the analyst\xe2\x80\x99s block of the report] are correct,\xe2\x80\x99 and that he had \xe2\x80\x98followed the procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent insists that the Bullcoming report and Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report are equally formal, separated only by such \xe2\x80\x9cminutia\xe2\x80\x9d as the fact that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report \xe2\x80\x9cis not labeled a \xe2\x80\x98certificate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (opinion of Kagan, J.).  To the contrary, what distinguishes the two is that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report, in substance, certifies nothing.  See su- pra, at 9.  That distinction is constitutionally significant because the scope of the confrontation right is properly limited to extrajudicial statements similar in solemnity to the Marian examination practices that the Confrontation Clause was designed to prevent.  See Davis, supra, at 835\xe2\x80\x93836 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  By certifying the truth of the analyst\xe2\x80\x99s representations, the unsworn Bullcoming report bore \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98striking resemblance,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9d 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 837 (quot- ing Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 52), to the Marian practice in which magistrates examined witnesses, typically on oath, and \xe2\x80\x9ccertif[ied] the results to the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 44.  And, in Melendez-Diaz, we observed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98certificates\xe2\x80\x99 are functionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310\xe2\x80\x93311.  Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report is marked by no such indicia of solemnity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, acknowledging that the Confrontation Clause is implicated only by formalized statements that are characterized by solemnity will not result in a prosecutorial conspiracy to elude confrontation by using only informal extrajudicial statements against an accused.  As I have previously noted, the Confrontation Clause reaches bad-faith attempts to evade the formalized process.  See supra, at 9, n.\xc2\xa05 (quoting Davis, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 838).  Moreover, the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s use of informal statements comes at a price.  As the dissent recognizes, such statements are \xe2\x80\x9cless reliable\xe2\x80\x9d than formalized statements, post, at 24, and therefore less persuasive to the factfinder.  Cf. post, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322, n.\xc2\xa06 (arguing that prosecutors are unlikely to \xe2\x80\x9cforgo DNA evidence in favor of less reliable eyewitness testimony\xe2\x80\x9d simply because the defendant is entitled to confront the DNA analyst).  But, even assuming that the dissent accurately predicts an upswing in the use of \xe2\x80\x9cless reliable\xe2\x80\x9d informal statements, that result does not \xe2\x80\x9cturn the Confrontation Clause upside down.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 24.  The Confrontation Clause does not require that evidence be reliable, Crawford, supra, at 61, but that the reliability of a specific \xe2\x80\x9cclass of testimonial statements\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94formalized statements bearing indicia of solemnity\xe2\x80\x94be assessed through cross-examination.

The original formulation of that test asked whether the primary purpose of an extrajudicial statement was \xe2\x80\x9cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Davis, supra, at 822.  I agree that, for a statement to be testimonial within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, the declarant must primarily intend to establish some fact with the understanding that his statement may be used in a criminal prosecution.  See Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933).  But this necessary criterion is not sufficient, for it sweeps into the ambit of the Confrontation Clause statements that lack formality and solemnity and is thus \xe2\x80\x9cdisconnected from history.\xe2\x80\x9d  Davis, supra, at 838\xe2\x80\x93842 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Bryant, supra, at ___ (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  In addition, a primary purpose inquiry divorced from solemnity is unworkable in practice.  Davis, supra, at 839; Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1).  Statements to police are often made both to resolve an ongoing emergency and to establish facts about a crime for potential prosecution.  The primary purpose test gives courts no principled way to assign primacy to one of those purposes.  Davis, supra, at 839.  The solemnity requirement is not only true to the text and history of the Confrontation Clause, but goes a long way toward resolving that practical difficulty.  If a statement bears the formality and solemnity necessary to come within the scope of the Clause, it is highly unlikely that the statement was primarily made to end an ongoing emergency.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe shortcomings of the original primary purpose test pale in comparison, however, to those plaguing the reformulated version that the plurality suggests today.  The new primary purpose test asks whether an out-of-court statement has \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 29.  That test lacks any grounding in constitutional text, in history, or in logic.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe new test first requires that an out-of-court statement be made \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of proving the guilt of a particular criminal defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 30 (emphasis added).  Under this formulation, statements made \xe2\x80\x9cbefore any suspect was identified\xe2\x80\x9d are beyond the scope of the Confrontation Clause.  See ante, at 3.  There is no textual justification, however, for limiting the confrontation right to statements made after the accused\xe2\x80\x99s identity became known.  To be sure, the \n \nSixth Amendment right to confrontation attaches \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. criminal prosecutions,\xe2\x80\x9d at which time the accused has been identified and apprehended.  But the text of the Confrontation Clause does not constrain the time at which one becomes a \xe2\x80\x9cwitnes[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, we have previously held that a declarant may become a \xe2\x80\x9cwitnes[s]\xe2\x80\x9d before the accused\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution.  See Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (rejecting the view that the Confrontation Clause applies only to in-court testimony).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHistorical practice confirms that a declarant could become a \xe2\x80\x9cwitnes[s]\xe2\x80\x9d before the accused\xe2\x80\x99s identity was known.  As previously noted, the confrontation right was a response to ex parte examinations of witnesses in 16th-century England.  Such examinations often occurred after an accused was arrested or bound over for trial, but some examinations occurred while the accused remained \xe2\x80\x9cunknown or fugitive.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Langbein, Prosecuting Crime in the Renaissance 90 (1974) (describing examples, including the deposition of a victim who was swindled out of 20 shillings by a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cunning man\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 1 J.

The plurality characterizes Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report as a statement elicited by police and made by Cellmark not \xe2\x80\x9cto accuse petitioner or to create evidence for use at trial,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather to resolve the ongoing emergency posed by \xe2\x80\x9ca dangerous rapist who was still at large.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 31.  But, as I have explained, that distinction is unworkable in light of the mixed purposes that often underlie statements to the police.  See supra, at 12.  The difficulty is only compounded by the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to merge the purposes of both the police and the declarant.  See ante, at 29; Bryant, supra, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 20\xe2\x80\x9323).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut if one purpose must prevail, here it should surely be the evidentiary one, whether viewed from the perspective of the police, Cellmark, or both.  The police confirmed the presence of semen on L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs on February 15, 2000, placed the swabs in a freezer, and waited until November 28, 2000, to ship them to Cellmark.  App. 30\xe2\x80\x9334, 51\xe2\x80\x9352.  Cellmark, in turn, did not send its report to the police until April 3, 2001, id., at 54, over a year after L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s rape.  Given this timeline, it strains credulity to assert that the police and Cellmark were primarily concerned with the exigencies of an ongoing emergency, rather than with producing evidence in the ordinary course.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition to requiring that an out-of-court statement \xe2\x80\x9ctarge[t]\xe2\x80\x9d a particular accused, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s new primary purpose test also considers whether the statement is so \xe2\x80\x9cinherently inculpatory,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 3, that the declarant should have known that his statement would incriminate the accused.  In this case, the plurality asserts that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he technicians who prepare a DNA profile generally have no way of knowing whether it will turn out to be incriminating or exonerating\xe2\x80\x94or both,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 32, and thus \xe2\x80\x9cno one at Cellmark could have possibly known that the profile that it produced would turn out to inculpate petitioner,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 31.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAgain, there is no textual justification for this limitation on the scope of the Confrontation Clause.  In Melendez-Diaz, we held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he text of the [Sixth] Amendment contemplates two classes of witnesses\xe2\x80\x94those against the defendant and those in his favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 313\xe2\x80\x93314.  We emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is not a third category of witnesses, helpful to the prosecution, but somehow immune from confrontation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 314.  Thus, the distinction between those who make \xe2\x80\x9cinherently inculpatory\xe2\x80\x9d statements and those who make other statements that are merely \xe2\x80\x9chelpful to the prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d has no foundation in the text of the Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is also contrary to history.  The 16th-century Marian statutes instructed magistrates to transcribe any information by witnesses that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall be material to prove the felony.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., 1 Stephen, supra, at 219 (quoting 1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mary, ch. 13 (1554)).  Magistrates in the 17th and 18th centuries were also advised by practice manuals to take the ex\xc2\xa0parte examination of a witness even if his evi- dence was \xe2\x80\x9cweak\xe2\x80\x9d or the witness was \xe2\x80\x9cunable to inform any material thing against\xe2\x80\x9d an accused.

Thus, neither law nor practice limited ex\xc2\xa0parte examinations to those witnesses who made \xe2\x80\x9cinherently inculpatory\xe2\x80\x9d statements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis requirement also makes little sense.  A statement that is not facially inculpatory may turn out to be highly probative of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt when considered with other evidence.  Recognizing this point, we previously rejected the view that a witness is not subject to confrontation if his testimony is \xe2\x80\x9cinculpatory only when taken together with other evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Melendez-Diaz, supra, at 313.

See, e.g., ante, at 32 (citing brief stating that some crime labs use up to 12 technicians when testing a DNA sample).  These burdens are largely the product of a primary purpose test that reaches out-of-court statements well beyond the historical scope of the Confrontation Clause and thus sweeps in a broad range of sources on which modern experts regularly rely.  The proper solution to this problem is not to carve out a Confrontation Clause exception for expert testimony that is rooted only in legal fiction.  See ante, at 3.  Nor is it to create a new primary purpose test that ensures that DNA evidence is treated differently.  See ibid.  Rather, the solution is to adopt a reading of the Confrontation Clause that respects its historically limited application to a narrow class of statements bearing indicia of solemnity.  In forgoing that approach, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision diminishes the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protection in cases where experts convey the contents of solemn, formalized statements to explain the bases for their opinions.

Before trial, the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s expert, Sandra Lambatos, received a copy of a report prepared by Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratory.  That report reflected the fact that Cellmark technicians had received material from a vaginal swab taken from the crime victim, had identified semen in that material, and had derived a profile of the male DNA that the semen contained.  Lambatos then entered that profile into an Illinois State Police Crime Laboratory computerized database, which contained, among many other DNA profiles, a profile derived by the crime laboratory from Williams\xe2\x80\x99 blood (taken at an earlier time).  The computer she was using showed that the two profiles matched.  Lambatos then confirmed the match.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLater, Lambatos testified at trial, where the prosecutor asked her three relevant questions.  First, the prosecutor asked whether there was \xe2\x80\x9ca computer match generated of the male DNA profile [derived by Cellmark] found in [the] semen from the vaginal swabs .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to [the] male DNA profile [found in the database] that had been identified as having originated from Sandy Williams\xe2\x80\x9d?  App. 56.  Since the computer had shown such a match, Lambatos answered affirmatively.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the prosecutor asked whether Lambatos had in-dependently \xe2\x80\x9ccompare[d the DNA profile that Cellmark had derived from] the semen that had been identified .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the vaginal swabs of [the victim] to the male DNA profile [found in the database] that had been [derived] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the blood of Sandy Williams.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Lambatos again answered affirmatively.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the prosecutor asked whether, in Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 ex-pert opinion, the DNA profile derived from the semen identified in the vaginal swabs of the victim was \xe2\x80\x9ca match to Sandy Williams.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 58.  Lambatos again answered affirmatively.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Confrontation Clause problem lies in the fact that Lambatos did not have personal knowledge that the male DNA profile that Cellmark said was derived from the crime victim\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swab sample was in fact correctly derived from that sample.  And no Cellmark expert testified that it was true.  Rather, she simply relied for her knowledge of the fact upon Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report.  And the defendant Williams had no opportunity to cross-examine the individual or individuals who produced that report.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn its first conclusion, the plurality explains why it finds that admission of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony nonetheless did not violate the Confrontation Clause.  That Clause concerns out-of-court statements admitted for their truth.  Ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony did not introduce the Cellmark report (which other circumstantial evidence supported) for its truth.  Ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9321.  Rather, Lam-batos used the Cellmark report only to indicate the underlying factual information upon which she based her independent expert opinion.  Ibid.  Under well-established principles of evidence, experts may rely on otherwise inadmissible out-of-court statements as a basis for forming an expert opinion if they are of a kind that experts in the field normally rely upon.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 703; Ill. Rule Evid. 703.  Nor need the prosecution enter those out-of-court statements into evidence for their truth.  That, the Illinois courts held, is just what took place here.  Ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent would abandon this well-established rule.  It would not permit Lambatos to offer an expert opinion in reliance on the Cellmark report unless the prosecution also produces one or more experts who wrote or otherwise produced the report.  I am willing to accept the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the present rule as artificial, see post, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317 (opinion of Kagan, J.), but I am not certain that the dissent has produced a workable alternative, see Bullcoming, supra, at ___ (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (expressing similar view).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOnce one abandons the traditional rule, there would seem often to be no logical stopping place between requiring the prosecution to call as a witness one of the labora-tory experts who worked on the matter and requiring the prosecution to call all of the laboratory experts who did so.  Experts\xe2\x80\x94especially laboratory experts\xe2\x80\x94regularly rely on the technical statements and results of other experts to form their own opinions.  The reality of the matter is that the introduction of a laboratory report involves layer upon layer of technical statements (express or implied) made by one expert and relied upon by another.  Hence my general question: How does the Confrontation Clause apply to crime laboratory reports and underlying technical statements made by laboratory technicians?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe general question is not easy to answer.  The California case described at the outset of the dissenting opinion helps to illustrate the difficulty.  In that example, Cellmark, the very laboratory involved in this case, tested a DNA sample taken from the crime scene.  A laboratory analyst, relying upon a report the laboratory had prepared, initially stated (at a pretrial hearing about admissibil- ity) that the laboratory had found that the crime-scene DNA sample matched a sample of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s DNA.  But during the hearing and after reviewing the labor-atory\xe2\x80\x99s notes, the laboratory analyst realized that the written report was mistaken.  In fact, the testing showed only that the crime-scene DNA matched a sample of the victim\xe2\x80\x99s DNA, not the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s DNA.  At some point during the writing of the report, someone, perhaps the testifying analyst herself, must have misread the proper original sample labeling.  Upon discovering the error, the analyst corrected her testimony.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe example is useful, not simply because as adapted it might show the importance of cross-examination (an importance no one doubts), but also because it can reveal the nature of the more general question before us.  When the laboratory in the example received the DNA samples, it labeled them properly.  The laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s final report mixed up the labels.  Any one of many different technicians could be responsible for an error like that.  And the testifying analyst might not have reviewed the underlying notes and caught the error during direct examination (or for that matter, during cross-examination).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAdapting the example slightly, assume that the admissibility of the initial laboratory report into trial had been directly at issue.  Who should the prosecution have had to call to testify?  Only the analyst who signed the report noting the match?  What if the analyst who made the match knew nothing about either the laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s underlying procedures or the specific tests run in the particular case?  Should the prosecution then have had to call all potentially involved laboratory technicians to testify?  Six to twelve or more technicians could have been involved.  (See Appendix, infra, which lists typically relevant laboratory procedures.)  Some or all of the words spoken or written by each technician out of court might well have constituted relevant statements offered for their truth and reasonably relied on by a supervisor or analyst writing the laboratory report.  Indeed, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s amici argue that the technicians at each stage of the process should be subject to cross-examination.  See Brief for Innocence Network as Amicus Curiae 13\xe2\x80\x9323 (hereinafter Innocence Network Brief).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd as is true of many hearsay statements that fall within any of the 20 or more hearsay exceptions, cross-examination could sometimes significantly help to elicit the truth.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 803 (listing 24 hearsay exceptions).  The Confrontation Clause as interpreted in Crawford recognizes, as a limitation upon a pure \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial statement\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, circumstances where the defendant had an adequate \xe2\x80\x9cprior opportunity to cross-examine.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59.  To what extent might the \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial statements\xe2\x80\x9d requirement embody one or more (or modified versions) of these traditional hearsay exceptions as well?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLower courts and treatise writers have recognized the problem.  And they have come up with a variety of solutions.  The New Wigmore, for example, lists several nonexclusive approaches to when testifying experts may rely on testing results or reports by nontestifying experts (i.e., DNA technicians or analysts), including: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cthe dominant approach,\xe2\x80\x9d which is simply to determine the need to testify by looking \xe2\x80\x9cthe quality of the nontestifying expert\xe2\x80\x99s report, the testifying expert\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the process, and the consequent ability of the testifying expert to use independent judgment and interpretive skill\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) permitting \xe2\x80\x9ca substitute expert to testify about forensic science results only when the first expert is unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d (irrespective of the lack of opportunity to cross-examine the first expert, cf. Crawford, supra, at 59); (3) permitting \xe2\x80\x9ca substitute expert\xe2\x80\x9d to testify if \xe2\x80\x9cthe original test was documented in a thorough way that permits the substitute expert to evaluate, assess, and interpret it\xe2\x80\x9d; (4) permitting a DNA analyst to introduce DNA test results at trial without having \xe2\x80\x9cpersonally perform[ed] every specific aspect of each DNA test in question, provided the analyst was present during the critical stages of the test, is familiar with the process and the laboratory protocol involved, reviews the results in proximity to the test, and either initials or signs the final report outlining the results\xe2\x80\x9d; (5) permitting the introduction of a crime laboratory DNA report without the testimony of a technician where the \xe2\x80\x9ctesting in its pre-liminary stages\xe2\x80\x9d only \xe2\x80\x9crequires the technician simply to perform largely mechanical or ministerial tasks .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. absent some reason to believe there was error or falsification\xe2\x80\x9d; and (6) permitting introduction of the report without requiring the technicians to testify where there is a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine unavailability.\xe2\x80\x9d  See D. Kaye, D. Bernstein, &amp; J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74.10.2, 4.10.3, pp. 202, 204, 206 (2d ed. 2010) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted); id., \xc2\xa74.11.6, at 24 (Supp. 2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSome of these approaches seem more readily compatible with Crawford than others.  Some seem more easily considered by a rules committee (or by state courts) than by this Court.  Nonetheless, all assume some kind of Crawford boundary\xe2\x80\x94some kind of limitation upon the scope of its application\xe2\x80\x94though they reflect different views as to just how and when that might be done.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnswering the underlying general question just discussed, and doing so soon, is important.  Trial judges in both federal and state courts apply and interpret hearsay rules as part of their daily trial work.  The trial of criminal cases makes up a large portion of that work.  And laboratory reports frequently constitute a portion of the evidence in ordinary criminal trials.  Obviously, judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers have to know, in as definitive a form as possible, what the Constitution requires so that they can try their cases accordingly.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe several different opinions filed today embody sev-eral serious, but different, approaches to the difficult gen-eral question.  Yet none fully deals with the underlying question as to how, after Crawford, Confrontation Clause \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial statement\xe2\x80\x9d requirements apply to crime lab-oratory reports.  Nor can I find a general answer in Melendez-Diaz or Bullcoming.  While, as a matter of pure logic, one might use those cases to answer a narrowed version of the question presented here, see post, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (Kagan, J., dissenting), those cases do not fully con- sider the broader evidentiary problem presented.  I consequently find the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s response, \xe2\x80\x9cBeen there, done that,\xe2\x80\x9d unsatisfactory.  See post, at 21.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder these circumstances, I would have this case reargued.  I would request the parties and amici to focus specifically upon the broader \xe2\x80\x9climits\xe2\x80\x9d question.  And I would permit them to discuss, not only the possible implications of our earlier post-Crawford opinions, but also any necessary modifications of statements made in the opinions of those earlier cases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the absence of reargument, I adhere to the dissenting view set forth in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, under which the Cellmark report would not be considered \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d and barred by the Confrontation Clause.  See also ante, at 28\xe2\x80\x9333 (setting forth similar conclusion).  That view understands the Confrontation Clause as interpreted in Crawford to bar the admission of \xe2\x80\x9c[t]estimonial\xe2\x80\x9d statements made out of court unless the declarant is unavail-able and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59 (emphasis added).  It also understands the word \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d as having outer limits and Crawford as describing a constitutional heartland.  And that view would leave the States with constitutional leeway to maintain traditional expert testimony rules as well as hearsay exceptions where there are strong reasons for doing so and Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s basic rationale does not apply.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn particular, the States could create an exception that presumptively would allow introduction of DNA reports from accredited crime laboratories.  The defendant would remain free to call laboratory technicians as witnesses.  Were there significant reason to question a laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s technical competence or its neutrality, the presumptive exception would disappear, thereby requiring the prosecution to produce any relevant technical witnesses.  Such an exception would lie outside Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional limits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider the report before us.  Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s DNA report embodies technical or professional data, observations, and judgments; the employees who contributed to the report\xe2\x80\x99s findings were professional analysts working on technical matters at a certified laboratory; and the employees operated behind a veil of ignorance that likely prevented them from knowing the identity of the defendant in this case.  Statements of this kind fall within a hearsay exception that has constituted an important part of the law of evidence for decades.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6) (\xe2\x80\x9cRecords of Regularly Conducted Activity\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71517\xe2\x80\x931533, pp. 1878\xe2\x80\x931899 (1904) (\xe2\x80\x9cRegular Entries\xe2\x80\x9d).  And for somewhat similar reasons, I believe that such statements also presumptively fall outside the category of \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d statements that the Confrontation Clause makes inadmissible.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the plurality points out, ante, at 28\xe2\x80\x9333, the introduction of statements of this kind does not risk creating the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50.  That evil consists of the pre-Constitution practice of using \xe2\x80\x9cex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Sir Walter Raleigh\xe2\x80\x99s case illustrates the point.  State authorities questioned Lord Cobham, the key witness against Raleigh, outside his presence.  They then used those testimonial statements in court against Raleigh.  And when Raleigh asked to face and to challenge his accuser, he was denied that opportunity.  See id., at 44.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Confrontation Clause prohibits the use of this kind of evidence because allowing it would deprive a defendant of the ability to cross-examine the witness.  Id., at 61\xe2\x80\x9362; Mattox v. United States, \n\n156 U.\xc2\xa0S. 237\n\xe2\x80\x93243 (1895).  That deprivation would prevent a defendant from confronting the witness.  And it would thereby prevent a defendant from probing the witness\xe2\x80\x99 perception, memory, narration, and sincerity.  See, e.g., 2 K. Broun et\xc2\xa0al., McCormick on Evidence \xc2\xa7245, p. 125 (6th ed. 2006); E. Morgan, Some Problems of Proof Under the Anglo-American System of Litigation 119\xe2\x80\x93127 (1956); 30 C.

Hale, History of the Common Law of England 258 (1713) (explaining virtues of confronting witness); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 373 (1768) (same).  \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut the need for cross-examination is considerably diminished when the out-of-court statement was made by an accredited laboratory employee operating at a remove from the investigation in the ordinary course of professional work.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor one thing, as the hearsay exception itself reflects, alternative features of such situations help to guarantee its accuracy.  An accredited laboratory must satisfy well-established professional guidelines that seek to ensure the scientific reliability of the laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s results.  App. 59\xe2\x80\x9360, 74, 86\xe2\x80\x9387; see Brief for National District Attorneys Assn. et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 25, n.\xc2\xa05 (hereinafter NDAA Brief) (noting that the standards date back 30 years); Giannelli, Regulating Crime Laboratories: The Impact of DNA Evidence, 15 J.\xc2\xa0L. &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y 59, 72\xe2\x80\x9376 (2007).  For example, forensic DNA testing laboratories permitted to access the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s Combined DNA Index System must adhere to standards governing, among other things, the organization and management of the laboratory; education, training, and experience requirements for laboratory personnel; the laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s physical facilities and security measures; control of physical evidence; validation of testing methodologies; procedures for analyzing samples, including the reagents and controls that are used in the testing process; equipment calibration and maintenance; documentation of the process used to test each sample handled by the laboratory; technical and administrative review of every case file; proficiency testing of laboratory; personnel; corrective action that addresses any discrepancies in proficiency tests and casework analysis; internal and external audits of the laboratory; environmental health and safety; and outsourcing of testing to vendor laboratories.  See Brief for New York County District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 4, n.\xc2\xa04 (hereinafter NY County DAO Brief); see also App. to NY County DAO Brief A22\xe2\x80\x93A49.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese standards are not foolproof.  Nor are they always properly applied.  It is not difficult to find instances in which laboratory procedures have been abused.  See, e.g., Innocence Network Brief 6\xe2\x80\x9311; App. to Brief for Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 1a\xe2\x80\x9312a; cf. Giannelli, The Abuse of Scientific Evidence in Criminal Cases: The Need for Independent Crime Laboratories, 4 Va. J. Soc. Pol\xe2\x80\x99y &amp; L. 439 (1997).  Moreover, DNA testing itself has exonerated some defendants who previously had been convicted in part upon the basis of testimony by laboratory experts.  See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 319 (citing Garrett &amp; Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrongful Convictions, 95 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1 (2009)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut if accreditation did not prevent admission of faulty evidence in some of those cases, neither did cross-examination.  In the wrongful-conviction cases to which this Court has previously referred, the forensic experts all testified in court and were available for cross-examination.  Sklansky, Hearsay\xe2\x80\x99s Last Hurrah, 2009 S.\xc2\xa0Ct. Rev. 1, 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (cited study \xe2\x80\x9cdid not identify any cases in which hearsay from forensic analysts contributed to the conviction of innocent defendants\xe2\x80\x9d); see Garrett &amp; Neufeld, supra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312, 84, 89 (noting that cross-examination was rarely effective); see also Murphy, The New Forensics: Criminal Justice, False Certainty, and the Second Generation of Scientific Evidence, 95 Cal. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 721, 785\xe2\x80\x93786 (2007) (suggesting need for greater reliance upon accreditation and oversight of accredited laboratories); Sklansky, supra, at 74 (same).  Similarly, the role of cross-examination is ambiguous in the laboratory example that the dissent describes.  See post, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  (Apparently, the report\xe2\x80\x99s error came to light and was corrected after cross-examination had concluded, see Thompson, Taroni, &amp; Aitken, Author\xe2\x80\x99s Response, 49 J. Forensic Sci. 1202 (2003), and in any event all parties had received the correctly labeled underlying laboratory data, see Clarke, Commentary, id., at 1201).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor another thing, the fact that the laboratory testing takes place behind a veil of ignorance makes it unlikely that a particular researcher has a defendant-related motive to behave dishonestly, say, to misrepresent a step in an analysis or otherwise to misreport testing results.  Cf. Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 14) (discussing the \xe2\x80\x9cprospect of fabrication\xe2\x80\x9d as a factor in whether the Confrontation Clause requires statements \xe2\x80\x9cto be subject to the crucible of cross-examination\xe2\x80\x9d).  The laboratory here, for example, did not know whether its test results might help to incriminate a particular defendant.  Ante, at 32\xe2\x80\x9333; cf. Melendez-Diaz, supra, at 310\xe2\x80\x93311; Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurther, the statements at issue, like those of many laboratory analysts, do not easily fit within the linguistic scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial statement\xe2\x80\x9d as we have used that term in our earlier cases.  As the plurality notes, in every post-Crawford case in which the Court has found a Confrontation Clause violation, the statement at issue had the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.  Ante, at 29\xe2\x80\x9331; see, e.g., Davis v. Washington, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813, \n822 (2006)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d); Bryant, supra, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312) (\xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony\xe2\x80\x9d).  The declarant was essentially an adverse witness making an accusatory, testimonial statement\xe2\x80\x94implicating the core concerns of the Lord Cobham-type affidavits.  But here the DNA report sought, not to accuse petitioner, but instead to generate objectively a profile of a then-unknown suspect\xe2\x80\x99s DNA from the semen he left in committing the crime.  See ante, at 31\xe2\x80\x9333.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, to bar admission of the out-of-court records at issue here could undermine, not fortify, the accuracy of factfinding at a criminal trial.  Such a precedent could bar the admission of other reliable case-specific technical information such as, say, autopsy reports.  Autopsies, like the DNA report in this case, are often conducted when it is not yet clear whether there is a particular suspect or whether the facts found in the autopsy will ultimately prove relevant in a criminal trial.  Autopsies are typically conducted soon after death.  And when, say, a victim\xe2\x80\x99s body has decomposed, repetition of the autopsy may not be possible.  What is to happen if the medical examiner dies before trial?  E.g., State v. Lackey, 280 Kan. 190, 195\xe2\x80\x93196, 120 P.\xc2\xa03d 332, 341 (2005); see also People v.

Is the Confrontation Clause \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98effectively\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to function \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as a statute of limitations for murder\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d?  Melendez-Diaz, supra, at 335 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (quoting Comment, Toward a Definition of \xe2\x80\x9cTestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d: How Autopsy Reports Do Not Embody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement, 96 Cal. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1093, 1115 (2008)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn general, such a holding could also increase the risk of convicting the innocent.  The New York County District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office and the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner tell us that the additional cost and complexity involved in requiring live testimony from perhaps dozens of ordinary laboratory technicians who participate in the preparation of a DNA profile may well force a laboratory \xe2\x80\x9cto reduce the amount of DNA testing it conducts, and force prosecutors to forgo forensic DNA analysis in cases where it might be highly probative.  In the absence of DNA testing, defendants might well be prosecuted solely on the basis of eyewitness testimony, the reliability of which is often questioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  NY County DAO Brief 10 (citing United States v. Wade, \n\n388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, \n229 (1967)\n); see also NDAA Brief 26 (such a holding \xe2\x80\x9cwill also impact the innocent who may wait to be cleared from suspicion or exonerated from mistaken conviction\xe2\x80\x9d).  I find this plausible.  But cf. Innocence Network Brief 3.  An interpretation of the Clause that risks greater prosecution reliance upon less reliable evidence cannot be sound.  Cf. Maryland v. Craig, \n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 836, \n845 (1990)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe central concern of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reli-ability of the evidence against a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsequently, I would consider reports such as the DNA report before us presumptively to lie outside the perimeter of the Clause as established by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  Such a holding leaves the defendant free to call the laboratory employee as a witness if the employee is available.  Moreover, should the defendant provide good reason to doubt the laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s competence or the validity of its accreditation, then the alternative safeguard of reliability would no longer exist and the Constitution would entitle defendant to Confrontation Clause protection.  Similarly, should the defendant demonstrate the existence of a motive to falsify, then the alternative safeguard of honesty would no longer exist and the Constitution would entitle the defendant to Confrontation Clause protection.  Cf. 2 Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa71527, at 1892 (in respect to the business records exception, \xe2\x80\x9cthere must have been no motive to misrepresent\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the defendant would remain free to show the absence or inadequacy of the alternative reliability/honesty safeguards, thereby rebutting the pre-sumption and making the Confrontation Clause applicable.  No one has suggested any such problem in respect to the Cellmark Report at issue here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is basically consistent with the views set forth here, I join that opinion in full.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">\n</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tAPPENDIX\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis appendix outlines the way that a typical modern fo-rensic laboratory conducts DNA analysis.

The DNA analysis takes place in three parts, through three different sets of laboratory experts: (1) a DNA pro-file is derived from the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s DNA sample, (2) a DNA profile is derived from the crime-scene DNA sample, and (3) an analyst compares the two profiles and makes a conclusion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs many as six technicians may be involved in deriving the profile from the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s sample; as many as six more technicians may be involved in deriving the profile from the crime-scene sample; and an additional expert may then be required for the comparative analysis, for a total of about a dozen different laboratory experts.  Each expert may make technical statements (express or implied) during the DNA analysis process that are in turn relied upon by other experts.  The amici dispute how many of these experts the Confrontation Clause requires to be subject to cross-examination.  Compare Innocence Network Brief 13\xe2\x80\x9323 with NY County DAO Brief 7\xe2\x80\x938 and NDAA Brief 22\xe2\x80\x9323.

At a preliminary hearing, the State presented testimony from an analyst at the Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratory\xe2\x80\x94the same facility used to generate DNA evidence in this case.  The analyst had extracted DNA from a bloody sweatshirt found at the crime scene and then compared it to two control samples\xe2\x80\x94one from Kocak and one from the victim.  The analyst\xe2\x80\x99s report identified a single match: As she explained on direct examination, the DNA found on the sweatshirt belonged to Kocak.  But after undergoing cross-examination, the analyst realized she had made a mortifying error.  She took the stand again, but this time to admit that the report listed the victim\xe2\x80\x99s control sample as coming from Kocak, and Kocak\xe2\x80\x99s as coming from the victim.  So the DNA on the sweatshirt matched not Kocak, but the victim herself.  See Tr. in No. SCD110465 (Super. Ct. San Diego Cty., Cal., Nov. 17, 1995), pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934 (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a little hysterical right now, but I think .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the two names should be switched\xe2\x80\x9d), online at http://www.nlada.org/forensics/for_ lib/Documents/1037341561.0/JohnIvanKocak.pdf (as vis- ited June 15, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  In trying Kocak, the State would have to look elsewhere for its evidence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur Constitution contains a mechanism for catching such errors\xe2\x80\x94the \n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause.  That Clause, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent cases interpreting it, require that testimony against a criminal defendant be subject to cross-examination.  And that command applies with full force to forensic evidence of the kind involved in both the Kocak case and this one.  In two decisions issued in the last three years, this Court held that if a prosecutor wants to introduce the results of forensic testing into evidence, he must afford the defendant an opportunity to cross-examine an analyst responsible for the test.  Forensic evidence is reliable only when properly produced, and the Confrontation Clause prescribes a particular method for determining whether that has happened.  The Kocak incident illustrates how the Clause is designed to work: Once confronted, the analyst discovered and disclosed the error she had made.  That error would probably not have come to light if the prosecutor had merely admitted the report into evidence or asked a third party to present its findings.  Hence the genius of an 18th-century device as applied to 21st-century evidence: Cross-examination of the analyst is especially likely to reveal whether vials have been switched, samples contaminated, tests incompetently run, or results inaccurately recorded.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder our Confrontation Clause precedents, this is an open-and-shut case.  The State of Illinois prosecuted Sandy Williams for rape based in part on a DNA profile created in Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.  Yet the State did not give Williams a chance to question the analyst who produced that evidence.  Instead, the prosecution introduced the results of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s testing through an expert witness who had no idea how they were generated.  That approach\xe2\x80\x94no less (perhaps more) than the confrontation-free methods of presenting forensic evidence we have formerly banned\xe2\x80\x94deprived Williams of his \n \nSixth Amendment right to \xe2\x80\x9cconfron[t] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the witnesses against him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court today disagrees, though it cannot settle on a reason why.  Justice Alito, joined by three other Jus- tices, advances two theories\xe2\x80\x94that the expert\xe2\x80\x99s summary of the Cellmark report was not offered for its truth, and that the report is not the kind of statement triggering the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protection.  In the pages that follow, I call Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s opinion \xe2\x80\x9cthe plurality,\xe2\x80\x9d because that is the conventional term for it.  But in all except its disposition, his opinion is a dissent: Five Justices specifically reject every aspect of its reasoning and every paragraph of its explication.  See ante, at 1 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cI share the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s flawed analysis\xe2\x80\x9d).  Justice Thomas, for his part, contends that the Cellmark report is nontestimonial on a different rationale.  But no other Justice joins his opinion or subscribes to the test he offers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat creates five votes to approve the admission of the Cellmark report, but not a single good explanation.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s first rationale endorses a prosecutorial dodge; its second relies on distinguishing indistinguishable forensic reports.  Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, though positing an altogether different approach, suffers in the end from similar flaws.  I would choose another path\xe2\x80\x94to adhere to the simple rule established in our decisions, for the good reasons we have previously given.  Because defendants like Williams have a constitutional right to confront the witnesses against them, I respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s fractured decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur modern Confrontation Clause doctrine began with Crawford v. Washington, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36 (2004)\n.  About a quarter century earlier, we had interpreted the Clause to allow the admission of any out-of-court statement falling within a \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\xe2\x80\x9d or carrying \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ohio v. Roberts, \n\n448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56, \n66 (1980)\n.  But in Crawford, we concluded that our old approach was misguided.  Drawing on historical research about the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, we held that the prosecution may not admit \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial statements of a witness who [does] not appear at trial unless he [is] unavailable to testify, and the defendant .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  That holding has two aspects.  First, the Confrontation Clause applies only to out-of-court statements that are \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, where the Clause applies, it guarantees to a defendant just what its name suggests\xe2\x80\x94the opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the statement.  See id., at 59.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA few years later, we made clear that Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s rule reaches forensic reports.  In Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305 (2009)\n, the Commonwealth introduced a laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98certificates of analysis\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d stating that a substance seized from the defendant was cocaine.  Id., at 308.  We held that the certificates fell within the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98core class of testimonial statements\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because they had a clear \xe2\x80\x9cevidentiary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d: They were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that [they] would be available for use at a later trial.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 310\xe2\x80\x93311 (quoting Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51\xe2\x80\x9352).  Accordingly, we ruled, the defendant had a right to cross-examine the analysts who had authored them.  In reaching that conclusion, we rejected the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Confrontation Clause should not apply because the statements resulted from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98neutral scientific testing,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and so were presumptively reliable.  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318.  The Clause, we noted, commands that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reliability be assessed in a particular manner\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94through \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 317 (quoting Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 61).  Further, we doubted that the testing summarized in the certificates was \xe2\x80\x9cas neutral or as reliable\xe2\x80\x9d as the Commonwealth suggested.  Citing chapter and verse from various studies, we concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]orensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation\xe2\x80\x9d and mistake.  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318; see id., at 319.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd just two years later (and just one year ago), we reiterated Melendez-Diaz\xe2\x80\x99s analysis when faced with a State\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to evade it.  In Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011), a forensic report showed the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s blood-alcohol concentration to exceed the legal limit for drivers.  The State tried to introduce that finding through the testimony of a person who worked at the laboratory but had not performed or observed the blood test or certified its results.  We held that Melendez-Diaz foreclosed that tactic.  The report, we stated, resembled the certificates in Melendez-Diaz in \xe2\x80\x9call material respects,\xe2\x80\x9d 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15): Both were signed documents providing the results of forensic testing designed to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prov[e] some fact\xe2\x80\x99 in a criminal proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310).  And the State\xe2\x80\x99s resort to a \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate\xe2\x80\x9d witness, in place of the analyst who produced the report, did not satisfy the Confrontation Clause.  Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  Only the presence of \xe2\x80\x9cthat particular scientist,\xe2\x80\x9d we reasoned, would enable Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s counsel to ask \xe2\x80\x9cquestions designed to reveal whether incompetence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or dishonesty\xe2\x80\x9d had tainted the results.  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 12).  Repeating the refrain of Melendez-Diaz, we held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he accused\xe2\x80\x99s right is to be confronted with\xe2\x80\x9d the actual analyst, unless he is unavailable and the accused \xe2\x80\x9chad an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine\xe2\x80\x9d him.  Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case is of a piece.  The report at issue here shows a DNA profile produced by an analyst at Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory, allegedly from a vaginal swab taken from a young woman, L.\xc2\xa0J., after she was raped.  That report is identical to the one in Bullcoming (and Melendez-Diaz) in \xe2\x80\x9call material respects.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Once again, the report was made to establish \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98some fact\xe2\x80\x99 in a criminal proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here, the identity of L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s attacker.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310); see infra, at 20.  And once again, it details the results of forensic testing on evidence gathered by the police.  Viewed side-by-side with the Bullcoming report, the Cellmark analysis has a comparable title; similarly describes the relevant samples, test methodology, and results; and likewise includes the signatures of laboratory officials.  Compare Cellmark Diagnostics Report of Laboratory Examination (Feb. 15, 2001), Lodging of Petitioner with App. in Bullcoming v. New Mexico, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2010, No. 09\xe2\x80\x9310876, pp. 62\xe2\x80\x9365.  So under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior analysis, the substance of the report could come into evidence only if Williams had a chance to cross-examine the responsible analyst.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut that is not what happened.  Instead, the prosecutor used Sandra Lambatos\xe2\x80\x94a state-employed scientist who had not participated in the testing\xe2\x80\x94as the conduit for this piece of evidence.  Lambatos came to the stand after two other state analysts testified about forensic tests they had performed.  One recounted how she had developed a DNA profile of Sandy Williams from a blood sample drawn after his arrest.  And another told how he had confirmed the presence of (unidentified) semen on the vaginal swabs taken from L.\xc2\xa0J.  All this was by the book: Williams had an opportunity to cross-examine both witnesses about the tests they had run.  But of course, the State still needed to supply the missing link\xe2\x80\x94it had to show that DNA found in the semen on L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs matched Williams\xe2\x80\x99s DNA.  To fill that gap, the prosecutor could have called the analyst from Cellmark to testify about the DNA profile she had produced from the swabs.  But instead, the State called Lambatos as an expert witness and had her testify that the semen on those swabs contained Sandy Williams\xe2\x80\x99s DNA:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cQ  Was there a computer match generated of the male DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.\xc2\xa0J.] to a male DNA profile that had been identified as having originated from Sandy Williams?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\xe2\x80\x9cA  Yes, there was.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n\t\t\t\t\n\xe2\x80\x9cQ  Did you compare the semen .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the vaginal swabs of [L.\xc2\xa0J.] to the male DNA profile .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the blood of Sandy Williams?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n\t\t\t\t\n\xe2\x80\x9cA  Yes, I did.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n\t\t\t\t\n.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n\t\t\t\t\n\xe2\x80\x9cQ  [I]s the semen identified in the vaginal swabs of [L.\xc2\xa0J.] consistent with having originated from Sandy Williams?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\xe2\x80\x9cA  Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 56\xe2\x80\x9357.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tAnd so it was Lambatos, rather than any Cellmark employee, who informed the trier of fact that the testing of L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs had produced a male DNA profile implicating Williams.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHave we not already decided this case?  Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s testimony is functionally identical to the \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate testimony\xe2\x80\x9d that New Mexico proffered in Bullcoming, which did nothing to cure the problem identified in Melendez-Diaz (which, for its part, straightforwardly applied our decision in Crawford).  Like the surrogate witness in Bullcoming, Lambatos \xe2\x80\x9ccould not convey what [the actual analyst] knew or observed about the events .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , i.e., the particular test and testing process he employed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  \xe2\x80\x9cNor could such surrogate testimony expose any lapses or lies\xe2\x80\x9d on the testing analyst\xe2\x80\x99s part.  Ibid.  Like the lawyers in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, Williams\xe2\x80\x99s attorney could not ask questions about that analyst\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproficiency, the care he took in performing his work, and his veracity.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa07 (slip op., at 12, n.\xc2\xa07).  He could not probe whether the analyst had tested the wrong vial, inverted the labels on the samples, committed some more technical error, or simply made up the results.  See App. to Brief for Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 5a, 11a (describing mistakes and fraud at Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory).  Indeed, Williams\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer was even more hamstrung than Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s.  At least the surrogate witness in Bullcoming worked at the relevant laboratory and was familiar with its procedures.  That is not true of Lambatos: She had no knowledge at all of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s operations.  Indeed, for all the record discloses, she may never have set foot in Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder our case law, that is sufficient to resolve this case.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the State elected to introduce\xe2\x80\x9d the substance of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report into evidence, the analyst who generated that report \xe2\x80\x9cbecame a witness\xe2\x80\x9d whom Williams \xe2\x80\x9chad the right to confront.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  As we stated just last year, \xe2\x80\x9cOur precedent[s] cannot sensibly be read any other way.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality\xe2\x80\x99s primary argument to the contrary tries to exploit a limit to the Confrontation Clause recognized in Crawford.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d we cautioned there, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59\xe2\x80\x9360, n.\xc2\xa09 (citing Tennessee v. Street, \n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409, \n414 (1985)\n).  The Illinois Supreme Court relied on that statement in concluding that Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was permissible.  On that court\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cLambatos disclosed the underlying facts from Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report\xe2\x80\x9d not for their truth, but \xe2\x80\x9cfor the limited purpose of explaining the basis for her [expert] opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d so that the factfinder could assess that opinion\xe2\x80\x99s value.  238 Ill. 2d 125, 150, 939 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 268, 282 (2010).  The plurality wraps itself in that holding, similarly asserting that Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s findings, when viewed through the prism of state evidence law, was not introduced to establish \xe2\x80\x9cthe truth of any .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. matter concerning [the] Cellmark\xe2\x80\x9d report.  Ante, at 16; see ante, at 2, 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  But five Justices agree, in two opinions reciting the same reasons, that this argument has no merit: Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s statements about Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report went to its truth, and the State could not rely on her status as an expert to circumvent the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  See ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x938 (opinion of Thomas, J.). \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo see why, start with the kind of case Crawford had in mind.  In acknowledging the not-for-the-truth carveout from the Clause, the Court cited Tennessee v. Street as exemplary.  See Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59\xe2\x80\x9360, n.\xc2\xa09.  There, Street claimed that his stationhouse confession of murder was a sham: A police officer, he charged, had read aloud his alleged accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s confession and forced him to repeat it.  To help rebut that defense, the State introduced the other confession into the record, so the jury could see how it differed from Street\xe2\x80\x99s.  This Court rejected Street\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause claim because the State had offered the out-of-court statement not to prove \xe2\x80\x9cthe truth of [the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s] assertions\xe2\x80\x9d about the murder, but only to disprove Street\xe2\x80\x99s claim of how the police elicited his confession.  Street, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 413.  Otherwise said, the truth of the admitted statement was utterly immaterial; the only thing that mattered was that the statement (whether true or false) varied from Street\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe situation could not be more different when a witness, expert or otherwise, repeats an out-of-court statement as the basis for a conclusion, because the statement\xe2\x80\x99s utility is then dependent on its truth.  If the statement is true, then the conclusion based on it is probably true; if not, not.  So to determine the validity of the witness\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, the factfinder must assess the truth of the out-of-court statement on which it relies.  That is why the principal modern treatise on evidence variously calls the idea that such \xe2\x80\x9cbasis evidence\xe2\x80\x9d comes in not for its truth, but only to help the factfinder evaluate an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opin- ion \xe2\x80\x9cvery weak,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfactually implausible,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csheer fiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  D.

Unlike in Street, admission of the out-of-court statement in this context has no purpose separate from its truth; the factfinder can do nothing with it except assess its truth and so the credibility of the conclusion it serves to buttress.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider a prosaic example not involving scientific experts.  An eyewitness tells a police officer investigating an assault that the perpetrator had an unusual, star-shaped birthmark over his left eye.  The officer arrests a person bearing that birthmark (let\xe2\x80\x99s call him Starr) for committing the offense.  And at trial, the officer takes the stand and recounts just what the eyewitness told him.  Presumably the plurality would agree that such testimony violates the Confrontation Clause unless the eyewitness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.  Now ask whether anything changes if the officer couches his testimony in the following way: \xe2\x80\x9cI concluded that Starr was the assailant because a reliable eyewitness told me that the assailant had a star-shaped birthmark and, look, Starr has one just like that.\xe2\x80\x9d  Surely that framing would make no constitutional difference, even though the eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99s statement now explains the basis for the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  It remains the case that the prosecution is attempting to introduce a testimonial statement that has no relevance to the proceedings apart from its truth\xe2\x80\x94and that the defendant cannot cross-examine the person who made it.  Allowing the admission of this evidence would end-run the Confrontation Clause, and make a parody of its strictures.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd that example, when dressed in scientific clothing, is no different from this case.  The Cellmark report identified the rapist as having a particular DNA profile (think of it as the quintessential birthmark).  The Confrontation Clause prevented the State from introducing that report into evidence except by calling to the stand the person who prepared it.  See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310\xe2\x80\x93311; Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  So the State tried another route\xe2\x80\x94introducing the substance of the report as part and parcel of an expert witness\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  In effect, Lambatos testified (like the police officer above): \xe2\x80\x9cI concluded that Williams was the rapist because Cellmark, an accredited and trustworthy laboratory, says that the rapist has a particular DNA profile and, look, Williams has an identical one.\xe2\x80\x9d  And here too, that form of testimony should change nothing.  The use of the Cellmark statement remained bound up with its truth, and the statement came into evidence without any opportunity for Williams to cross-examine the person who made it.  So if the plurality were right, the State would have a ready method to bypass the Constitution (as much as in my hypothetical case); a wink and a nod, and the Confrontation Clause would not pose a bar to forensic evidence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality tries to make plausible its not-for-the-truth rationale by rewriting Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s testimony about the Cellmark report.  According to the plurality, Lambatos merely \xe2\x80\x9cassumed\xe2\x80\x9d that Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s DNA profile came from L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swabs, accepting for the sake of argument the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s premise.  Ante, at 18.  But that is incorrect.  Nothing in Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s testimony indicates that she was making an assumption or considering a hypothesis.  To the contrary, Lambatos affirmed, without qualification, that the Cellmark report showed a \xe2\x80\x9cmale DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L.\xc2\xa0J.].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 56.  Had she done otherwise, this case would be different.  There was nothing wrong with Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s testifying that two DNA profiles\xe2\x80\x94the one shown in the Cellmark report and the one derived from Williams\xe2\x80\x99s blood\xe2\x80\x94matched each other; that was a straightforward application of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s expertise.  Similarly, Lambatos could have added that if the Cellmark report resulted from scientifically sound testing of L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swab, then it would link Williams to the assault.  What Lambatos could not do was what she did: indicate that the Cellmark report was produced in this way by saying that L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s vaginal swab contained DNA matching Williams\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  By testifying in that manner, Lambatos became just like the surrogate witness in Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x94a person knowing nothing about \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular test and testing process,\xe2\x80\x9d but vouching for them regardless.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  We have held that the Confrontation Clause requires something more.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality also argues that Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the Cellmark report did not violate the Confrontation Clause because the case \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve[d] a bench trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 19 (emphasis deleted).  I welcome the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s concession that the Clause might forbid presenting Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s statement to a jury, see ante, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319; it indicates that the plurality realizes that her testimony went beyond an \xe2\x80\x9cassumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the presence of a judge does not transform the constitutional question.  In applying the Confrontation Clause, we have never before considered relevant the decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  See, e.g., Davis v. Washington, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813 (2006)\n.  And this case would be a poor place to begin.  Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s description of the Cellmark report was offered for its truth because that is all such \xe2\x80\x9cbasis evidence\xe2\x80\x9d can be offered for; as described earlier, the only way the factfinder could consider whether that statement supported her opinion (that the DNA on L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s swabs came from Williams) was by assessing the statement\xe2\x80\x99s truth.  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  That is so, as a simple matter of logic, whether the factfinder is a judge or a jury.  And thus, in either case, admission of the statement, without the opportunity to cross-examine, violates the Confrontation Clause.  See ante, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, n.\xc2\xa01 (opinion of Thomas, J.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn saying that much, I do not doubt that a judge typi- cally will do better than a jury in excluding such inadmissible evidence from his decisionmaking process.  Perhaps the judge did so here; perhaps, as the plurality thinks, he un- derstood that he could not consider Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s repre- sentation about the Cellmark report, and found that other, \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d established \xe2\x80\x9cthe source of the sample that Cellmark tested\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe reliability of the Cellmark profile.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  Some indications are to the contrary: In delivering his verdict, the judge never referred to the circumstantial evidence the plurality marshals, but instead focused only on Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  See 4 Record JJJ151 (calling Lambatos \xe2\x80\x9cthe best DNA witness I have ever heard\xe2\x80\x9d and referring to Williams as \xe2\x80\x9cthe guy whose DNA, according to the evidence from the experts, is in the semen recovered from the victim\xe2\x80\x99s vagina\xe2\x80\x9d).  But I take the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s point that when read \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n context\xe2\x80\x9d the judge\xe2\x80\x99s statements might be \xe2\x80\x9cbest understood\xe2\x80\x9d as meaning something other than what they appear to say.  See ante, at 20, n.\xc2\xa06.  Still, that point suggests only that the admission of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s statement was harmless\xe2\x80\x94that the judge managed to put it out of mind.  After all, whether a factfinder is confused by an error is a separate question from whether an error has occurred.  So the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s argument does not answer the only question this case presents: whether a constitutional violation happened when Lambatos recited the Cellmark report\xe2\x80\x99s findings.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt bottom, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s not-for-the-truth rationale is a simple abdication to state-law labels.  Although the utility of the Cellmark statement that Lambatos repeated logi- cally depended on its truth, the plurality thinks this case decided by an Illinois rule holding that the facts underlying an expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion are not admitted for that purpose.  See ante, at 14\xe2\x80\x9318; People v. Pasch, 152 Ill. 2d 133, 175\xe2\x80\x93177, 604 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 294, 311 (1992).  But we do not typically allow state law to define federal constitutional requirements.  And needless to say (or perhaps not), the Confrontation Clause is a constitutional rule like any other.  As Justice Thomas observes, even before Crawford, we did not allow the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope to be \xe2\x80\x9cdictated by state or federal evidentiary rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 2.  Indeed, in Street, we independently reviewed whether an out-of-court statement was introduced for its truth\xe2\x80\x94the very question at issue in this case.  See 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 413\xe2\x80\x93416.  And in Crawford, we still more firmly disconnected the Confrontation Clause inquiry from state evidence law, by overruling an approach that looked in part to whether an out- of-court statement fell within a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98firmly rooted hearsay exception.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 60 (quoting Roberts, 448 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 66).  That decision made clear that the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protections are not coterminous with rules of evidence.  So the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s state-law-first approach would be an about-face.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill worse, that approach would allow prosecutors to do through subterfuge and indirection what we previously have held the Confrontation Clause prohibits.  Imagine for a moment a poorly trained, incompetent, or dishonest laboratory analyst.  (The analyst in Bullcoming, placed on unpaid leave for unknown reasons, might qualify.)  Under our precedents, the prosecutor cannot avoid exposing that analyst to cross-examination simply by introducing his report.  See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 311.  Nor can the prosecutor escape that fate by offering the results through the testimony of another analyst from the laboratory.  See Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  But under the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach, the prosecutor could choose the analyst-witness of his dreams (as the judge here said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best DNA witness I have ever heard\xe2\x80\x9d), offer her as an expert (she knows nothing about the test, but boasts impressive degrees), and have her provide testimony identical to the best the actual tester might have given (\xe2\x80\x9cthe DNA extracted from the vaginal swabs matched Sandy Williams\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x94all so long as a state evidence rule says that the purpose of the testimony is to enable the factfinder to assess the expert opinion\xe2\x80\x99s basis.  (And this tactic would not be confined to cases involving scientific evidence.  As Justice Thomas points out, the prosecutor could similarly substitute experts for all kinds of people making out-of-court statements.  See ante, at 7.)  The plurality thus would countenance the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s circumvention.  If the Confrontation Clause prevents the State from getting its evidence in through the front door, then the State could sneak it in through the back.  What a neat trick\xe2\x80\x94but really, what a way to run a criminal justice system.  No wonder five Justices reject it. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality also argues, as a \xe2\x80\x9csecond, independent basis\xe2\x80\x9d for its decision, that the Cellmark report falls outside the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x99s ambit because it is nontestimonial.  Ante, at 3.  The plurality tries out a number of supporting theories, but all in vain: Each one either conflicts with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents or misconstrues this case\xe2\x80\x99s facts.  Justice Thomas rejects the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s views for similar reasons as I do, thus bringing to five the number of Justices who repudiate the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of what statements count as testimonial.  See ante, at 1, 12\xe2\x80\x9315.  Justice Thomas, however, offers a rationale of his own for deciding that the Cellmark report is nontestimonial.  I think his essay works no better.  When all is said and done, the Cellmark report is a testimonial statement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAccording to the plurality, we should declare the Cellmark report nontestimonial because \xe2\x80\x9cthe use at trial of a DNA report prepared by a modern, accredited laboratory \xe2\x80\x98bears little if any resemblance to the historical practices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 33 (quoting Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2)).  But we just last year treated as testimonial a forensic report prepared by a \xe2\x80\x9cmodern, accredited laboratory\xe2\x80\x9d; indeed, we declared that the report at issue \xe2\x80\x9cfell within the core class of testimonial statements\xe2\x80\x9d implicating the Confrontation Clause.  Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Brief for New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division as Amicus Curiae in Bullcoming, O. T. 2010, No. 09\xe2\x80\x9310786, p.\xc2\xa01 (discussing accreditation).  And although the plurality is close, it is not quite ready (or able) to dispense with that decision.  See ante, at 29, n.\xc2\xa013 (\xe2\x80\x9cExperience might yet show that the holdings in [Bullcoming and other post-Crawford] cases should be reconsidered\xe2\x80\x9d).  So the plurality must explain: What could support a distinction between the laboratory analysis there and the DNA test in this case?\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs its first stab, the plurality states that the Cellmark report was \xe2\x80\x9cnot prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 31.  Where that test comes from is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess.  Justice Thomas rightly shows that it derives neither from the text nor from the history of the Confrontation Clause.  See ante, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (opinion concurring in judgment).  And it has no basis in our precedents.  We have previously asked whether a statement was made for the primary purpose of establishing \xe2\x80\x9cpast events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in other words, for the purpose of providing evidence.  Davis, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 822; see also Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14); Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 14, 29); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310\xe2\x80\x93311; Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51\xe2\x80\x9352.  None of our cases has ever suggested that, in addition, the statement must be meant to accuse a previously identified individual; indeed, in Melendez-Diaz, we rejected a related argument that laboratory \xe2\x80\x9canalysts are not subject to confrontation because they are not \xe2\x80\x98accusatory\xe2\x80\x99 witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does the plurality give any good reason for adopting an \xe2\x80\x9caccusation\xe2\x80\x9d test.  The plurality apparently agrees with Justice Breyer that prior to a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s identification, it will be \xe2\x80\x9cunlikely that a particular researcher has a defendant-related motive to behave dishonestly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12 (Breyer, J., concurring); see ante, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332 (plurality opinion).  But surely the typical problem with laboratory analyses\xe2\x80\x94and the typical focus of cross-examination\xe2\x80\x94has to do with careless or incompetent work, rather than with personal vendettas.  And as to that predominant concern, it makes not a whit of difference whether, at the time of the laboratory test, the police already have a suspect.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality next attempts to invoke our precedents holding statements nontestimonial when made \xe2\x80\x9cto respond to an \xe2\x80\x98ongoing emergency,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rather than to create evidence for trial, Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); here, the plurality insists, the Cellmark report\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was \xe2\x80\x9cto catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 31.  But that is to stretch both our \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency\xe2\x80\x9d test and the facts of this case beyond all recognition.  We have previously invoked that test to allow statements by a woman who was being assaulted and a man who had just been shot.  In doing so, we stressed the \xe2\x80\x9cinformal [and] harried\xe2\x80\x9d nature of the statements, Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 31)\xe2\x80\x94that they were made as, or \xe2\x80\x9cminutes\xe2\x80\x9d after, id., at ___ (slip op., at 28), the events they described \xe2\x80\x9cactually happen[ed],\xe2\x80\x9d Davis, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 827 (emphasis deleted), by \xe2\x80\x9cfrantic\xe2\x80\x9d victims of criminal attacks, ibid., to officers trying to figure out \xe2\x80\x9cwhat had .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. occurred\xe2\x80\x9d and what threats remained, Bryant, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 30) (internal quotation marks omitted).  On their face, the decisions have nothing to say about laboratory analysts conducting routine tests far away from a crime scene.  And this case presents a peculiarly inapt set of facts for extending those precedents.  Lambatos testified at trial that \xe2\x80\x9call reports in this case were prepared for this criminal investigation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [a]nd for the purpose of the eventual litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 82\xe2\x80\x94in other words, for the purpose of producing evidence, not enabling emergency responders.  And that testimony fits the relevant timeline.  The police did not send the swabs to Cellmark until November 2008\xe2\x80\x94nine months after L.\xc2\xa0J.\xe2\x80\x99s rape\xe2\x80\x94and did not receive the results for another four months.  See id., at 30\xe2\x80\x9334, 51\xe2\x80\x9352, 54.  That is hardly the typical emergency response.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the plurality offers a host of reasons for why reports like this one are reliable: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here [i]s no prospect of fabrication,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 31 (internal quotation marks omitted); multiple technicians may \xe2\x80\x9cwork on each DNA profile,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 32; and \xe2\x80\x9cdefects in a DNA profile may often be detected from the profile itself,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  See also ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x9314 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  But once again: Been there, done that.  In Melendez-Diaz, this Court rejected identical arguments, noting extensive documentation of \xe2\x80\x9c[s]erious deficiencies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the forensic evidence used in criminal trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 319; see supra, at 4\xe2\x80\x935; see also Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa01 (slip op., at 4, n. 1) (citing similar errors in laboratory analysis); Brief for Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 13 (discussing \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ystemic problems,\xe2\x80\x9d such as sample contamination, sample switching, mislabeling, and fraud, at \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98flagship\xe2\x80\x99 DNA labs\xe2\x80\x9d).  Scientific testing is \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical,\xe2\x80\x9d to be sure, ante, at 1 (opinion of Breyer, J.); but it is only as reliable as the people who perform it.  That is why a defendant may wish to ask the analyst a variety of questions: How much experience do you have?  Have you ever made mistakes in the past?  Did you test the right sample?  Use the right procedures?  Contaminate the sample in any way?  Indeed, as scientific evidence plays a larger and larger role in criminal prosecutions, those inquiries will often be the most important in the case.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd Melendez-Diaz made yet a more fundamental point in response to claims of the \xc3\xbcber alles reliability of scientific evidence: It is not up to us to decide, ex ante, what evidence is trustworthy and what is not.  See 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 317\xe2\x80\x93318; see also Bullcoming, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  That is because the Confrontation Clause prescribes its own \xe2\x80\x9cprocedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 67.  That procedure is cross-examination.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ispensing with [it] because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 62.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s second basis for denying Williams\xe2\x80\x99s right of confrontation also fails.  The plurality can find no reason consistent with our precedents for treating the Cellmark report as nontestimonial.  That is because the report is, in every conceivable respect, a statement meant to serve as evidence in a potential criminal trial.  And that simple fact should be sufficient to resolve the question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s unique method of defining testimonial statements fares no better.  On his view, the Confrontation Clause \xe2\x80\x9cregulates only the use of statements bearing \xe2\x80\x98indicia of solemnity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8 (quoting Davis, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 836\xe2\x80\x93837).  And Cellmark\xe2\x80\x99s report, he concludes, does not qualify because it is \xe2\x80\x9cneither a sworn nor a certified declaration of fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9.  But Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s approach grants constitutional significance to minutia, in a way that can only undermine the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protections.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo see the point, start with precedent, because the Court rejected this same kind of argument, as applied to this same kind of document, at around this same time just last year.  In Bullcoming, the State asserted that the forensic report at issue was nontestimonial because\xe2\x80\x94unlike the report in Melendez-Diaz\xe2\x80\x94it was not sworn before a notary public.  We responded that applying the Confrontation Clause only to a sworn forensic report \xe2\x80\x9cwould make the right to confrontation easily erasable\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94next time, the laboratory could file the selfsame report without the oath.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  We then held, as noted earlier, that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all material respects,\xe2\x80\x9d the forensic report in Bullcoming matched the one in Melendez-Diaz.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15); see supra, at 5.  First, a law enforcement officer provided evidence to a state laboratory assisting in police investigations.  See 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Second, the analyst tested the evidence and \xe2\x80\x9cprepared a certificate concerning the result[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Third, the certificate was \xe2\x80\x9cformalized in a signed document .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. headed a \xe2\x80\x98report.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

That was enough.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNow compare that checklist of \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d features to the report in this case.  The only differences are that Cellmark is a private laboratory under contract with the State (which no one thinks relevant), and that the report is not labeled a \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate.\xe2\x80\x9d  That amounts to (maybe) a nickel\xe2\x80\x99s worth of difference: The similarities in form, function, and purpose dwarf the distinctions.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Each report is an official and signed record of laboratory test results, meant to establish a certain set of facts in legal proceedings.  Neither looks any more \xe2\x80\x9cformal\xe2\x80\x9d than the other; neither is any more formal than the other.  See ibid.  The variances are no more (probably less) than would be found if you compared different law schools\xe2\x80\x99 transcripts or different companies\xe2\x80\x99 cash flow statements or different States\xe2\x80\x99 birth certificates.  The difference in labeling\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate\xe2\x80\x9d in one case, a \xe2\x80\x9creport of laboratory examination\xe2\x80\x9d in the other\xe2\x80\x94is not of constitutional dimension.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s approach, if accepted, would turn the Confrontation Clause into a constitutional geegaw\xe2\x80\x94nice for show, but of little value.  The prosecution could avoid its demands by using the right kind of forms with the right kind of language.  (It would not take long to devise the magic words and rules\xe2\x80\x94principally, never call anything a \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And still worse: The new conventions, precisely by making out-of-court statements less \xe2\x80\x9csolem[n],\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 1, would also make them less reliable\xe2\x80\x94and so turn the Confrontation Clause upside down.  See Crawford, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 52\xe2\x80\x9353, n.\xc2\xa03 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe find it implausible that a provision which concededly condemned trial by sworn ex\xc2\xa0parte affidavit thought trial by unsworn ex\xc2\xa0parte affidavit perfectly OK\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is not surprising that no other Member of the Court has adopted this position.  To do so, as Justice Thomas rightly says of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s decision, would be to \xe2\x80\x9cdiminis[h] the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protection\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cthe very cases in which the accused should \xe2\x80\x98enjoy the right .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 16.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, a prosecutor wishing to admit the results of forensic testing had to produce the technician responsible for the analysis.  That was the result of not one, but two decisions this Court issued in the last three years.  But that clear rule is clear no longer.  The five Justices who control the outcome of today\xe2\x80\x99s case agree on very little.  Among them, though, they can boast of two accomplishments.  First, they have approved the introduction of testimony at Williams\xe2\x80\x99s trial that the Confrontation Clause, rightly understood, clearly prohibits.  Second, they have left significant confusion in their wake.  What comes out of four Justices\xe2\x80\x99 desire to limit Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming in whatever way possible, combined with one Justice\xe2\x80\x99s one-justice view of those holdings, is\xe2\x80\x94to be frank\xe2\x80\x94who knows what.  Those decisions apparently no longer mean all that they say.  Yet no one can tell in what way or to what extent they are altered because no proposed limitation commands the support of a majority.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe better course in this case would have been simply to follow Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming.  Precedent-based decisionmaking provides guidance to lower court judges and predictability to litigating parties.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s plurality and concurring opinions, and the uncertainty they sow, bring into relief that judicial method\xe2\x80\x99s virtues.  I would decide this case consistently with, and for the reasons stated by, Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming.  And until a majority of this Court reverses or confines those decisions, I would understand them as continuing to govern, in every particular, the admission of forensic evidence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0In responding to this reasoning, the plurality confirms it.  According to the plurality, basis evidence supports the \xe2\x80\x9ccredibility of the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x9d by showing that he has relied on, and drawn logical inferences from, sound \xe2\x80\x9cfactual premises.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 24.  Quite right.  And that process involves assessing such premises\xe2\x80\x99 truth: If they are, as the majority puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cunsupported by other evidence in the record\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise baseless, they will not \xe2\x80\x9callay [a factfinder\xe2\x80\x99s] fears\xe2\x80\x9d about an \xe2\x80\x9cexpert\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.

But the statement \xe2\x80\x9cif X is true, then Y follows\xe2\x80\x9d differs materially\xe2\x80\x94and constitutionally\xe2\x80\x94from the statement \xe2\x80\x9cY is true because X is true (according to Z).\xe2\x80\x9d  The former statement is merely a logical proposition, whose validity the defendant can contest by questioning the speaker.  And then, assum-ing the prosecutor tries to prove the statement\xe2\x80\x99s premise through some other witness, the defendant can rebut that effort through cross-examination.  By contrast, the latter statement as well contains a factual allegation (that X is true), which the defendant can only effectively challenge by confronting the person who made it (Z).  That is why recognizing the difference between these two forms of testimony is not to insist on an archaism or a formality, but to ensure, in line with the Constitution, that defendants have the ability to confront their accusers.  And if prosecutors can easily conform their conduct to that constitutional directive, as the plurality suggests, so much the better: I would not have thought it a ground of complaint that the Confrontation Clause, properly understood, manages to protect defendants without overly burdening the State.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">3</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The plurality asserts (without citation) that I am \xe2\x80\x9creach[ing] the truly remarkable conclusion that the wording of Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony confused the trial judge,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 19, and then spends three pages explaining why that conclusion is wrong, see ante, at 19\xe2\x80\x9321.  But the plurality is responding to an argument of its own imagining, because I reach no such conclusion.  As I just stated, the trial judge might well have ignored Lambatos\xe2\x80\x99s statement about the Cellmark report and relied on other evidence to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Cellmark profile was derived from the sample taken from the victim,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 19.  All I am saying is that the admission of that statement violated the Confrontation Clause even if the judge ultimately put it aside, because it came into evidence for nothing other than its truth.  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312.\nSimilarly, the plurality claims (still without citation) that I think the other evidence about the Cellmark report insufficient, see ante, at 21.  But once again, the plurality must be reading someone else\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  I express no view on sufficiency of the evidence because it is irrelevant to the Confrontation Clause issue we took this case to decide.  It is the plurality that wrongly links the two, spending another five pages trumpeting the strength of the Cellmark report, see ante, at 22\xe2\x80\x9324, 32\xe2\x80\x9333.  But the plurality cannot properly decide whether a Confrontation Clause violation occurred at Williams\xe2\x80\x99s trial by determining that Williams was guilty.  The American criminal justice system works the opposite way: determining guilt by holding trials in accord with constitutional requirements.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">4</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer does not attempt to distinguish our precedents, opting simply to adhere to \xe2\x80\x9cthe dissenting view set forth in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 8 (concurring opinion).  He principally worries that under those cases, a State will have to call to the witness stand \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ix to twelve or more technicians\xe2\x80\x9d who have worked on a report.
