Ferrer thereupon petitioned the California Labor Commissioner (Labor Commissioner) for a determination that the contract was invalid and unenforceable under California\xe2\x80\x99s Talent Agencies Act (TAA) because Preston had acted as a talent agent without the required license.  After the Labor Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s hearing officer denied Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s motion to stay the arbitration, Ferrer filed suit in state court seeking to enjoin arbitration, and Preston moved to compel arbitration.  The court denied Preston\xe2\x80\x99s motion and enjoined him from proceeding before the arbitrator unless and until the Labor Commissioner determined she lacked jurisdiction over the dispute.  While Preston\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was pending, this Court held, in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cardegna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/440/index.html">546 U. S. 440</a>, 446, that challenges to the validity of a contract requiring arbitration of disputes ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cshould \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Affirming the judgment below, the California Court of Appeal held that the TAA vested the Labor Commissioner with exclusive original jurisdiction over the dispute, and that <em>Buckeye</em> was inapposite because it did not involve an administrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction over a disputed issue.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0When parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The issue is not whether the FAA preempts the TAA wholesale.  Instead, the question is simply who decides\xe2\x80\x94the arbitrator or the Labor Commissioner\xe2\x80\x94whether Preston acted as an unlicensed talent agent in violation of the TAA, as Ferrer claims, or as a personal manager not governed by the TAA, as Preston contends.

That national policy \xe2\x80\x9cappli[es] in state as well as federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cforeclose[s] state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 16.  The FAA\xe2\x80\x99s displacement of conflicting state law has been repeatedly reaffirmed.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Buckeye</em>, 546 U. S., at\xc2\xa0445\xe2\x80\x93446; <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.</em> v. <em>Dobson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/265/index.html">513 U. S. 265</a>, 272.   A recurring question under \xc2\xa72 is who should decide whether \xe2\x80\x9cgrounds \xe2\x80\xa6 exist at law or in equity\xe2\x80\x9d to invalidate an arbitration agreement.  In <em>Prima Paint Corp.</em> v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/395/index.html">388 U. S. 395</a>, 403\xe2\x80\x93404, which originated in federal court, this Court held that attacks on an entire contract\xe2\x80\x99s validity, as distinct from attacks on the arbitration clause alone, are within the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s ken.  <em>Buckeye </em>held that the same rule applies in state court<em>.  </em>See 546 U. S., at 446.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Buckeye </em>largely, if not entirely, resolves the present dispute.  The contract at issue clearly \xe2\x80\x9cevidenc[ed] a transaction involving commerce\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72, and Ferrer has never disputed that the contract\xe2\x80\x99s written arbitration provision falls within \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s purview.  Ferrer sought invalidation of the contract as a whole.  He made no discrete challenge to the validity of the arbitration clause, and thus sought to override that clause on a ground <em>Buckeye </em>requires the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.  Pp. 5\xe2\x80\x936. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Ferrer attempts to distinguish <em>Buckeye, </em>urging that the TAA merely requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before the parties proceed to arbitration.  This argument is unconvincing.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Procedural prescriptions of the TAA conflict with the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s dispute resolution regime in two basic respects: (1) One TAA provision grants the Labor Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide an issue that the parties agreed to arbitrate, see <em>Buckeye</em>, 546 U. S., at\xc2\xa0446; (2) another imposes prerequisites to enforcement of an arbitration agreement that are not applicable to contracts generally, see <em>Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Associates, Inc.</em> v. <em>Casarotto</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/681/index.html">517 U. S. 681</a>, 687.   Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Ferrer contends that the TAA is compatible with the FAA because the TAA provision vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Labor Commissioner merely postpones arbitration.  That position is contrary to the one Ferrer took in the California courts and does not withstand examination.  Arbitration, if it ever occurred following the Labor Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s decision, would likely be long delayed, in contravention of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent \xe2\x80\x9cto move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital</em> v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/index.html">460 U. S. 1</a>, 22.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Ferrer contends that the conflict between the arbitration clause and the TAA should be overlooked because Labor Commissioner proceedings are administrative rather than judicial.  The Court rejected a similar argument in <em>Gilmer</em> v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/20/index.html">500 U. S. 20</a>, 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/index.html">489 U. S. 468</a>, is misplaced for two reasons.  First, arbitration was stayed in <em>Volt</em> to accommodate litigation involving third parties who were strangers to the arbitration agreement.  Because the contract at issue in <em>Volt </em>did not address the order of proceedings and included a choice-of-law clause adopting California law, the <em>Volt </em>Court recognized as the gap filler a California statute authorizing the state court to stay either third-party court proceedings or arbitration proceedings to avoid the possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue.  Here, in contrast, the arbitration clause speaks to the matter in controversy; both parties are bound by the arbitration agreement; the question of Preston\xe2\x80\x99s status as a talent agent relates to the validity or legality of the contract; there is no risk that related litigation will yield conflicting rulings on common issues; and there is no other procedural void for the choice-of-law clause to fill.  Second, the Court is guided by its decision in <em>Mastrobuono</em> v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/52/index.html">514 U. S. 52</a>.  Although the <em>Volt</em> contract provided for arbitration in accordance with AAA rules, 489 U. S., at\xc2\xa0470, n.\xc2\xa01, Volt never argued that incorporation of those rules by reference trumped the contract\xe2\x80\x99s choice-of-law clause, so this Court never addressed the import of such incorporation.  In <em>Mastrobuono</em>, the Court reached that open question, declaring that the \xe2\x80\x9cbest way to harmonize\xe2\x80\x9d a New York choice-of-law clause and a clause providing for arbitration in accordance with privately promulgated arbitration rules was to read the choice-of-law clause \xe2\x80\x9cto encompass substantive principles that New York courts would apply, but not to include [New York\xe2\x80\x99s] special rules limiting [arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99] authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U. S., at\xc2\xa063\xe2\x80\x9364.  Similarly here, the \xe2\x80\x9cbest way to harmonize\xe2\x80\x9d the Ferrer-Preston contract\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of the AAA rules and its selection of California law is to read the latter to encompass prescriptions governing the parties\xe2\x80\x99 substantive rights and obligations, but not the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspecial rules limiting [arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99] authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p align="left">145 Cal.

S. 1</a> (1984), the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 <em>et seq</em>. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), establishes a national policy favoring arbitration when the parties contract for that mode of dispute resolution.  The Act, which rests on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Commerce Clause, supplies not simply a procedural framework applicable in federal courts; it also calls for the application, in state as well as federal courts, of federal substantive law regarding arbitration.  465 U. S., at 16.  More recently, in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cardegna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/440/index.html">546 U. S. 440</a> (2006), the Court clarified that, when parties agree to arbitrate all disputes arising under their contract, questions concerning the validity of the entire contract are to be resolved by the arbitrator in the first instance, not by a federal or state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The instant petition presents the following question: Does the FAA override not only state statutes that refer certain state-law controversies initially to a judicial forum, but also state statutes that refer certain disputes initially to an administrative agency?  We hold today that, when parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative, are superseded by the FAA.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns a contract between respondent Alex E. Ferrer, a former Florida trial court judge who currently appears as \xe2\x80\x9cJudge Alex\xe2\x80\x9d on a Fox television network program, and petitioner Arnold M. Preston, a California attorney who renders services to persons in the entertainment industry.  Seeking fees allegedly due under the contract, Preston invoked the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to arbitrate \xe2\x80\x9cany dispute \xe2\x80\xa6 relating to the terms of [the contract] or the breach, validity, or legality thereof \xe2\x80\xa6 in accordance with the rules [of the American Arbitration Association].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 18.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Preston\xe2\x80\x99s demand for arbitration, made in June 2005, was countered a month later by Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s petition to the California Labor Commissioner charging that the contract was invalid and unenforceable under the California Talent Agencies Act (TAA), Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71700 <em>et seq</em>. (West 2003 and Supp. 2008).  Ferrer asserted that Preston acted as a talent agent without the license required by the TAA, and that Preston\xe2\x80\x99s unlicensed status rendered the entire contract void.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Labor Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s hearing officer, in November 2005, determined that Ferrer had stated a \xe2\x80\x9ccolorable basis for exercise of the Labor Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 33.  The officer denied Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s motion to stay the arbitration, however, on the ground that the Labor Commissioner lacked authority to order such relief.  Ferrer then filed suit in the Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking a declaration that the controversy between the parties \xe2\x80\x9carising from the [c]ontract, including in particular the issue of the validity of the [c]ontract, is not subject to arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 29.  As interim relief, Ferrer sought an injunction restraining Preston from proceeding before the arbitrator.  Preston responded by moving to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 2005, the Superior Court denied Preston\xe2\x80\x99s motion to compel arbitration and enjoined Preston from proceeding before the arbitrator \xe2\x80\x9cunless and until the Labor Commissioner determines that \xe2\x80\xa6 she is without jurisdiction over the disputes between Preston and Ferrer.\xe2\x80\x9d  No. BC342454 (Dec. 7, 2005), App. C to Pet. for Cert. 18a, 26a\xe2\x80\x9327a.  During the pendency of Preston\xe2\x80\x99s appeal from the Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, this Court reaffirmed, in <em>Buckeye</em>, that challenges to the validity of a contract providing for arbitration ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cshould \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.\xe2\x80\x9d  546 U. S., at 446.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a 2-to-1 decision issued in November 2006, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  The appeals court held that the relevant provision of the TAA, Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71700.44(a) (West 2003), vests \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive original jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over the dispute in the Labor Commissioner.  145 Cal. App. 4th 440, 447, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 628, 634.  <em>Buckeye</em> is \xe2\x80\x9cinapposite,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said, because that case \xe2\x80\x9cdid not involve an administrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction over a disputed issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  145 Cal. App. 4th, at 447, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 634.  The dissenting judge, in contrast, viewed <em>Buckeye</em> as controlling; she reasoned that the FAA called for immediate recognition and enforcement of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to arbitrate and afforded no basis for distinguishing prior resort to a state administrative agency from prior resort to a state court.  145 Cal. App. 4th, at 450\xe2\x80\x93451, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 636\xe2\x80\x93637 (Vogel, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California Supreme Court denied Preston\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review.  No. S149190 (Feb. 14, 2007), 2007 Cal. LEXIS 1539, App. A to Pet. for Cert. 1a.  We granted certiorari to determine whether the FAA overrides a state law vesting initial adjudicatory authority in an administrative agency.  551 U. S. ___ (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An easily stated question underlies this controversy.  Ferrer claims that Preston was a talent agent who operated without a license in violation of the TAA.  Accordingly, he urges, the contract between the parties, purportedly for \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal management,\xe2\x80\x9d is void and Preston is entitled to no compensation for any services he rendered.  Preston, on the other hand, maintains that he acted as a personal manager, not as a talent agent, hence his contract with Ferrer is not governed by the TAA and is both lawful and fully binding on the parties.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the contract between Ferrer and Preston provides that \xe2\x80\x9cany dispute \xe2\x80\xa6 relating to the \xe2\x80\xa6 validity, or legality\xe2\x80\x9d of the agreement \xe2\x80\x9cshall be submitted to arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 18, Preston urges that Ferrer must litigate \xe2\x80\x9chis TAA defense in the arbitral forum,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief 31.  Ferrer insists, however, that the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal manager\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctalent agent\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry falls, under California law, within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner, and that the FAA does not displace the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s primary jurisdiction.  Brief for Respondent 14, 30, 40\xe2\x80\x9344.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dispositive issue, then, contrary to Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, is not whether the FAA preempts the TAA wholesale.  See <em>id.,</em> at 44\xe2\x80\x9348.  The FAA plainly has no such destructive aim or effect.  Instead, the question is simply who decides whether Preston acted as personal manager or as talent agent.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 2 of the FAA states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA written provision in any \xe2\x80\xa6 contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U.

This prescription demonstrates that there is no inherent conflict between the TAA and arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism.  But \xc2\xa71700.45 was of no utility to Preston.  He has consistently maintained that he is <em>not</em> a talent agent as that term is defined in \xc2\xa71700.4(a), but is, instead, a personal manager not subject to the TAA\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory regime.  145 Cal.

S., at\xc2\xa0446; second, the TAA, in \xc2\xa71700.45, imposes prerequisites to enforcement of an arbitration agreement that are not applicable to contracts generally, see <em>Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Associates, Inc.</em>, 517 U. S., at\xc2\xa0687.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ferrer contends that the TAA is nevertheless compatible with the FAA because \xc2\xa71700.44(a) merely postpones arbitration until after the Labor Commissioner has exercised her primary jurisdiction.  Brief for Respondent 14, 40.  The party that loses before the Labor Commissioner may file for <em>de novo</em> review in Superior Court.  See \xc2\xa71700.44(a).  At that point, Ferrer asserts, either party could move to compel arbitration under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71281.2 (West 2007), and thereby obtain an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s determination prior to judicial review.  See Brief for Respondent 13.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is not the position Ferrer took in the California courts.  In his complaint, he urged the Superior Court to declare that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [c]ontract, including in particular the issue of the validity of the [c]ontract, <em>is not subject to arbitration</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and he sought an injunction stopping arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cunless and until, <em>if ever</em>, the Labor Commissioner determines that he/she has no jurisdiction over the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 29 (emphasis added).  Ferrer also told the Superior Court: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f \xe2\x80\xa6 the Commissioner rules that the [c]ontract is void, Preston may appeal that ruling and have a hearing de novo <em>before this Court</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s App. in No. B188997 (Cal. App.), p.\xc2\xa0157, n.\xc2\xa01 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s current argument\xe2\x80\x94that \xc2\xa71700.44(a) merely postpones arbitration\xe2\x80\x94withstand examination.  Section 1700.44(a) provides for <em>de novo</em> review in Superior Court, not elsewhere.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Arbitration, if it ever occurred following the Labor Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s decision, would likely be long delayed, in contravention of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent \xe2\x80\x9cto move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital</em> v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/index.html">460 U. S. 1</a>, 22 (1983).  If Ferrer prevailed in the California courts, moreover, he would no doubt argue that judicial findings of fact and conclusions of law, made after a full and fair <em>de novo</em> hearing in court, are binding on the parties and preclude the arbitrator from making any contrary rulings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve \xe2\x80\x9cstreamlined proceedings and expeditious results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/index.html">473 U.

That objective would be frustrated even if Preston could compel arbitration in lieu of <em>de novo</em> Superior Court review.  Requiring initial reference of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute to the Labor Commissioner would, at the least, hinder speedy resolution of the controversy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ferrer asks us to overlook the apparent conflict between the arbitration clause and \xc2\xa71700.44(a) because proceedings before the Labor Commissioner are administrative rather than judicial.  Brief for Respondent 40\xe2\x80\x9348.  Allowing parties to proceed directly to arbitration, Ferrer contends, would undermine the Labor Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s ability to stay informed of potentially illegal activity, <em>id.,</em> at 43, and would deprive artists protected by the TAA of the Labor Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s expertise, <em>id.,</em> at 41\xe2\x80\x9343.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Gilmer</em> v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/20/index.html">500 U. S. 20</a> (1991), we considered and rejected a similar argument, namely, that arbitration of age discrimination claims would undermine the role of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in enforcing federal law.  The \xe2\x80\x9cmere involvement of an administrative agency in the enforcement of a statute,\xe2\x80\x9d we held, does not limit private parties\xe2\x80\x99 obligation to comply with their arbitration agreements.  <em>Id.,</em> at\xc2\xa028\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ferrer points to our holding in <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Waffle House, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/279/index.html">534 U. S. 279</a>, 293\xe2\x80\x93294 (2002), that an arbitration agreement signed by an employee who becomes a discrimination complainant does not bar the EEOC from filing an enforcement suit in its own name.  He further emphasizes our observation in <em>Gilmer</em> that individuals who agreed to arbitrate their discrimination claims would \xe2\x80\x9cstill be free to file a charge with the EEOC.\xe2\x80\x9d  500 U. S., at\xc2\xa028.  Consistent with these decisions, Ferrer argues, the arbitration clause in his contract with Preston leaves undisturbed the Labor Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s independent authority to enforce the TAA.  See Brief for Respondent 44\xe2\x80\x9348.  And so it may.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  But in proceedings under \xc2\xa71700.44(a), the Labor Commissioner functions not as an advocate advancing a cause before a tribunal authorized to find the facts and apply the law; instead, the Commissioner serves as impartial arbiter.  That role is just what the FAA-governed agreement between Ferrer and Preston reserves for the arbitrator.  In contrast, in <em>Waffle House</em> and in the <em>Gilmer</em> aside Ferrer quotes, the Court addressed the role of an agency, not as adjudicator but as prosecutor, pursuing an enforcement action in its own name or reviewing a discrimination charge to determine whether to initiate judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it bears repeating that Preston\xe2\x80\x99s petition presents precisely and only a question concerning the forum in which the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute will be heard.  See <em>supra</em>, at\xc2\xa04.  \xe2\x80\x9cBy agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral \xe2\x80\xa6 forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em>, 473 U. S., at\xc2\xa0628.  So here, Ferrer relinquishes no substantive rights the TAA or other California law may accord him.  But under the contract he signed, he cannot escape resolution of those rights in an arbitral forum.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we disapprove the distinction between judicial and administrative proceedings drawn by Ferrer and adopted by the appeals court.  When parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, the FAA supersedes state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s final attempt to distinguish <em>Buckeye </em>relies on <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/index.html">489 U. S. 468</a> (1989).  <em>Volt</em> involved a California statute dealing with cases in which \xe2\x80\x9c[a] party to [an] arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action \xe2\x80\xa6 [involving] a third party [not bound by the arbitration agreement], arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71281.2(c) (West 2007).  To avoid the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute gives the Superior Court authority, <em>inter alia</em>, to stay the court proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cpending the outcome of the arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d or to stay the arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cpending the outcome of the court action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Volt Information Sciences and Stanford University were parties to a construction contract containing an arbitration clause.  When a dispute arose and Volt demanded arbitration, Stanford sued Volt and two other companies involved in the construction project.  Those other companies were not parties to the arbitration agreement; Stanford sought indemnification from them in the event that Volt prevailed against Stanford.  At Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s request, the Superior Court stayed the arbitration.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed the stay order.  Volt and Stanford incorporated \xc2\xa71281.2(c) into their agreement, the appeals court held.  They did so by stipulating that the contract\xe2\x80\x94otherwise silent on the priority of suits drawing in parties not subject to arbitration\xe2\x80\x94would be governed by California law.  <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ. </em>v. <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em>, 240 Cal. Rptr. 558, 561 (1987) (officially depublished).  Relying on the Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the contract, we held that the FAA did not bar a stay of arbitration pending the resolution of Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s Superior Court suit against Volt and the two companies not bound by the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Preston and Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s contract also contains a choice-of-law clause, which states that the \xe2\x80\x9cagreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 17.  A separate saving clause provides: \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is any conflict between this agreement and any present or future law,\xe2\x80\x9d the law prevails over the contract \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent necessary to bring [the contract] within the requirements of said law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 18.  Those contractual terms, according to Ferrer, call for the application of California procedural law, including \xc2\xa71700.44(a)\xe2\x80\x99s grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Labor Commissioner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ferrer\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Volt</em> is misplaced for two discrete reasons.  First, arbitration was stayed in <em>Volt</em> to accommodate litigation involving third parties who were strangers to the arbitration agreement.  Nothing in the arbitration agreement addressed the order of proceedings when pending litigation with third parties presented the prospect of inconsistent rulings.  We thought it proper, in those circumstances, to recognize state law as the gap filler.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, in contrast, the arbitration clause speaks to the matter in controversy; it states that \xe2\x80\x9cany dispute \xe2\x80\xa6 relating to \xe2\x80\xa6 the breach, validity, or legality\xe2\x80\x9d of the contract should be arbitrated in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules.  App. 18.  Both parties are bound by the arbitration agreement; the question of Preston\xe2\x80\x99s status as a talent agent relates to the validity or legality of the contract; there is no risk that related litigation will yield conflicting rulings on common issues; and there is no other procedural void for the choice-of-law clause to fill.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, we are guided by our more recent decision in <em>Mastrobuono</em> v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/52/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/52/index.html">514 U. S. 52</a> (1995).  Although the contract in <em>Volt</em> provided for \xe2\x80\x9carbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,\xe2\x80\x9d 489 U. S., at\xc2\xa0470, n.\xc2\xa01 (internal quotation marks omitted), Volt never argued that incorporation of those rules trumped the choice-of-law clause contained in the contract, see Brief for Appellant, and Reply Brief, in <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1987, No. 87\xe2\x80\x931318.  Therefore, neither our decision in <em>Volt</em> nor the decision of the California appeals court in that case addressed the import of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s incorporation by reference of privately promulgated arbitration rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Mastrobuono</em>, we reached that open question while interpreting a contract with both a New York choice-of-law clause and a clause providing for arbitration in accordance with the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD).  514 U.

The incorporation of the AAA rules, and in particular Rule 7(b), weighs against inferring from the choice-of-law clause an understanding shared by Ferrer and Preston that their disputes would be heard, in the first instance, by the Labor Commissioner.  Following the guide <em>Mastrobuono</em> provides, the \xe2\x80\x9cbest way to harmonize\xe2\x80\x9d the parties\xe2\x80\x99 adoption of the AAA rules and their selection of California law is to read the latter to encompass prescriptions governing the substantive rights and obligations of the parties, but not the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspecial rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), does not apply to proceedings in state courts.  See <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.</em> v. <em>Dobson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/265/index.html">513 U. S. 265</a>, 285\xe2\x80\x93297 (1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cardegna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/440/index.html">546 U. S. 440</a>, 449 (2006) (same); <em>Green Tree Financial Corp.</em> v. <em>Bazzle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/444/index.html">539 U. S. 444</a>, 460 (2003) (same); <em>Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Associates, Inc.</em> v. <em>Casarotto</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/681/index.html">517 U. S. 681</a>, 689 (1996) (same).  Thus, in state -court proceedings, the FAA cannot displace a state law that delays arbitration until administrative proceedings are completed.  Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
