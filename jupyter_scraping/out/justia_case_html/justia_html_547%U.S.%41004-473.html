Concluding after the review that the affidavit made serious misrepresentations, Ceballos relayed his findings to his supervisors, petitioners here, and followed up with a disposition memorandum recommending dismissal.  Petitioners nevertheless proceeded with the prosecution.  At a hearing on a defense motion to challenge the warrant, Ceballos recounted his observations about the affidavit, but the trial court rejected the challenge.  Claiming that petitioners then retaliated against him for his memo in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Ceballos filed a 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 suit.  The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, ruling, <em>inter alia,</em> that the memo was not protected speech because Ceballos wrote it pursuant to his employment duties.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that the memo\xe2\x80\x99s allegations were protected under the First Amendment analysis in <em>Pickering</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/index.html">391 U. S. 563</a>, and <em>Connick</em> v. <em>Myers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/index.html">461 U. S. 138</a>.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0When public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, they are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Two inquiries guide interpretation of the constitutional protections accorded public employee speech.  The first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  See <em>Pickering, supra,</em> at 568.  If the answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment cause of action based on the employer\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the speech.  See <em>Connick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 147.  If the answer is yes, the possibility of a First Amendment claim arises.  The question becomes whether the government employer had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.  See <em>Pickering, supra</em>, at 568.  This consideration reflects the importance of the relationship between the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s expressions and employment.  Without a significant degree of control over its employees\xe2\x80\x99 words and actions, a government employer would have little chance to provide public services efficiently.  Cf. <em>Connick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 143.  Thus, a government entity has broader discretion to restrict speech when it acts in its employer role, but the restrictions it imposes must be directed at speech that has some potential to affect its operations.  On the other hand, a citizen who works for the government is nonetheless still a citizen.  The First Amendment limits a public employer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to leverage the employment relationship to restrict, incidentally or intentionally, the liberties employees enjoy in their capacities as private citizens.  See <em>Perry</em> v. <em>Sindermann,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/593/index.html">408 U. S. 593</a>, 597.  So long as employees are speaking as citizens about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Connick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 147.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Proper application of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents leads to the conclusion that the First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee\xe2\x80\x99s expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.  Because Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 memo falls into this category, his allegation of unconstitutional retaliation must fail.  The dispositive factor here is not that Ceballos expressed his views inside his office, rather than publicly, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Givhan</em> v. <em>Western Line Consol. School Dist.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/index.html">439 U. S. 410</a>, 414, nor that the memo concerned the subject matter of his employment, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pickering, </em>391 U. S. at 573.  Rather, the controlling factor is that Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 expressions were made pursuant to his official duties.  That consideration distinguishes this case from those in which the First Amendment provides protection against discipline.  Ceballos wrote his disposition memo because that is part of what he was employed to do.  He did not act as a citizen by writing it.  The fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean his supervisors were prohibited from evaluating his performance.  Restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.  It simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created.  Cf. <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a>, 833.  This result is consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior emphasis on the potential societal value of employee speech and on affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations.  Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 proposed contrary rule, adopted by the Ninth Circuit, would commit state and federal courts to a new, permanent, and intrusive role, mandating judicial oversight of communications between and among government employees and their superiors in the course of official business.  This displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision finds no support in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents. The doctrinal anomaly the Court of Appeals perceived in compelling public employers to tolerate certain employee speech made publicly but not speech made pursuant to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s assigned duties misconceives the theoretical underpinnings of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions and is unfounded as a practical matter.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Exposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable significance, and various measures have been adopted to protect employees and provide checks on supervisors who would order unlawful or otherwise inappropriate actions.  These include federal and state whistle-blower protection laws and labor codes and, for government attorneys, rules of conduct and constitutional obligations apart from the First Amendment.  However, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents do not support the existence of a constitutional cause of action behind every statement a public employee makes in the course of doing his or her job.

S. 138</a>, 142 (1983).  The question presented by the instant case is whether the First Amendment protects a government employee from discipline based on speech made pursuant to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s official duties.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Richard Ceballos has been employed since 1989 as a deputy district attorney for the Los Angeles County District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office.  During the period relevant to this case, Ceballos was a calendar deputy in the office\xe2\x80\x99s Pomona branch, and in this capacity he exercised certain supervisory responsibilities over other lawyers.  In February 2000, a defense attorney contacted Ceballos about a pending criminal case.  The defense attorney said there were inaccuracies in an affidavit used to obtain a critical search warrant.  The attorney informed Ceballos that he had filed a motion to traverse, or challenge, the warrant, but he also wanted Ceballos to review the case.  According to Ceballos, it was not unusual for defense attorneys to ask calendar deputies to investigate aspects of pending cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After examining the affidavit and visiting the location it described, Ceballos determined the affidavit contained serious misrepresentations.  The affidavit called a long driveway what Ceballos thought should have been referred to as a separate roadway.  Ceballos also questioned the affidavit\xe2\x80\x99s statement that tire tracks led from a stripped-down truck to the premises covered by the warrant.  His doubts arose from his conclusion that the roadway\xe2\x80\x99s composition in some places made it difficult or impossible to leave visible tire tracks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ceballos spoke on the telephone to the warrant affiant, a deputy sheriff from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department, but he did not receive a satisfactory explanation for the perceived inaccuracies.  He relayed his findings to his supervisors, petitioners Carol Najera and Frank Sundstedt, and followed up by preparing a disposition memorandum.  The memo explained Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 concerns and recommended dismissal of the case.  On March 2, 2000, Ceballos submitted the memo to Sundstedt for his review.  A few days later, Ceballos presented Sundstedt with another memo, this one describing a second telephone conversation between Ceballos and the warrant affiant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 statements, a meeting was held to discuss the affidavit.  Attendees included Ceballos, Sundstedt, and Najera, as well as the warrant affiant and other employees from the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s department.  The meeting allegedly became heated, with one lieutenant sharply criticizing Ceballos for his handling of the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 concerns, Sundstedt decided to proceed with the prosecution, pending disposition of the defense motion to traverse.  The trial court held a hearing on the motion.  Ceballos was called by the defense and recounted his observations about the affidavit, but the trial court rejected the challenge to the warrant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ceballos claims that in the aftermath of these events he was subjected to a series of retaliatory employment actions.  The actions included reassignment from his calendar deputy position to a trial deputy position, transfer to another courthouse, and denial of a promotion.  Ceballos initiated an employment grievance, but the grievance was denied based on a finding that he had not suffered any retaliation.  Unsatisfied, Ceballos sued in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting, as relevant here, a claim under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  He alleged petitioners violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments by retaliating against him based on his memo of March 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners responded that no retaliatory actions were taken against Ceballos and that all the actions of which he complained were explained by legitimate reasons such as staffing needs.  They further contended that, in any event, Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 memo was not protected speech under the First Amendment.  Petitioners moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted their motion.  Noting that Ceballos wrote his memo pursuant to his employment duties, the court concluded he was not entitled to First Amendment protection for the memo\xe2\x80\x99s contents.  It held in the alternative that even if Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 speech was constitutionally protected, petitioners had qualified immunity because the rights Ceballos asserted were not clearly established.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cCeballos\xe2\x80\x99s allegations of wrongdoing in the memorandum constitute protected speech under the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  361 F.\xc2\xa03d 1168, 1173 (2004).  In reaching its conclusion the court looked to the First Amendment analysis set forth in <em>Pickering</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/563/index.html">391 U. S. 563</a> (1968), and <em>Connick</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/index.html"></a><a href="/us/461/138/index.html">461 U. S. 138</a><em>.</em> <em>Connick</em> instructs courts to begin by considering whether the expressions in question were made by the speaker \xe2\x80\x9cas a citizen upon matters of public concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 146\xe2\x80\x93147.  The Court of Appeals determined that Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 memo, which recited what he thought to be governmental misconduct, was \xe2\x80\x9cinherently a matter of public concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  361 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1174.  The court did not, however, consider whether the speech was made in Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 capacity as a citizen.  Rather, it relied on Circuit precedent rejecting the idea that \xe2\x80\x9ca public employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech is deprived of First Amendment protection whenever those views are expressed, to government workers or others, pursuant to an employment responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1174\xe2\x80\x931175 (citing cases including <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Veteran\xe2\x80\x99s Admin. of Govt. of United States</em>, 856 F.\xc2\xa02d 1401 (CA9 1988)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded that Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 memo satisfied the public-concern requirement, the Court of Appeals proceeded to balance Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 interest in his speech against his supervisors\xe2\x80\x99 interest in responding to it.  See <em>Pickering</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 568.  The court struck the balance in Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 favor, noting that petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cfailed even to suggest disruption or inefficiency in the workings of the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office\xe2\x80\x9d as a result of the memo.  See 361 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1180.  The court further concluded that Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment rights were clearly established and that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 actions were not objectively reasonable.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1181\xe2\x80\x931182.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge O\xe2\x80\x99Scannlain specially concurred.  Agreeing that the panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision was compelled by Circuit precedent, he nevertheless concluded Circuit law should be revisited and overruled.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1185.  Judge O\xe2\x80\x99Scannlain emphasized the distinction \xe2\x80\x9cbetween speech offered by a public employee acting <em>as an employee</em> carrying out his or her ordinary job duties and that spoken by an employee acting <em>as a citizen</em> expressing his or her personal views on disputed matters of public import.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1187.  In his view, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen public employees speak in the course of carrying out their routine, required employment obligations, they have no <em>personal </em>interest in the content of that speech that gives rise to a First Amendment right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1189.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1186/index.html">543 U. S. 1186</a> (2005), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions have noted, for many years \xe2\x80\x9cthe unchallenged dogma was that a public employee had no right to object to conditions placed upon the terms of employment\xe2\x80\x94including those which restricted the exercise of constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Connick,</em> 461 U. S., at 143.  That dogma has been qualified in important respects.  See <em>id.</em>, at 144\xe2\x80\x93145.  The Court has made clear that public employees do not surrender all their First Amendment rights by reason of their employment.  Rather, the First Amendment protects a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s right, in certain circumstances, to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pickering,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 568; <em>Connick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 147; <em>Rankin</em> v. <em>McPherson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/378/index.html"></a><a href="/us/483/378/index.html">483 U. S. 378</a>, 384 (1987); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Treasury Employees,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/454/index.html">513 U. S. 454</a>, 466 (1995).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Pickering</em> provides a useful starting point in explaining the Court\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine.  There the relevant speech was a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s letter to a local newspaper addressing issues including the funding policies of his school board.  391 U. S., at 566.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem in any case,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cis to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 568.  The Court found the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s speech \xe2\x80\x9cneither [was] shown nor can be presumed to have in any way either impeded the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom or to have interfered with the regular operation of the schools generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 572\xe2\x80\x93573 (footnote omitted).  Thus, the Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe interest of the school administration in limiting teachers\xe2\x80\x99 opportunities to contribute to public debate is not significantly greater than its interest in limiting a similar contribution by any member of the general public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 573.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Pickering </em>and the cases decided in its wake identify two inquiries to guide interpretation of the constitutional protections accorded to public employee speech.  The first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  See <em>id.</em>, at 568.  If the answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the speech.  See <em>Connick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 147.  If the answer is yes, then the possibility of a First Amendment claim arises.  The question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.  See <em>Pickering</em>, 391 U. S., at 568.  This consideration reflects the importance of the relationship between the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s expressions and employment.  A government entity has broader discretion to restrict speech when it acts in its role as employer, but the restrictions it imposes must be directed at speech that has some potential to affect the entity\xe2\x80\x99s operations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, conducting these inquiries sometimes has proved difficult.  This is the necessary product of \xe2\x80\x9cthe enormous variety of fact situations in which critical statements by teachers and other public employees may be thought by their superiors \xe2\x80\xa6 to furnish grounds for dismissal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 569.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s overarching objectives, though, are evident.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a citizen enters government service, the citizen by necessity must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Waters</em> v. <em>Churchill,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/661/index.html">511 U. S. 661</a>, 671 (1994) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he government as employer indeed has far broader powers than does the government as sovereign\xe2\x80\x9d).  Government employers, like private employers, need a significant degree of control over their employees\xe2\x80\x99 words and actions; without it, there would be little chance for the efficient provision of public services.  Cf. <em>Connick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 143 (\xe2\x80\x9c[G]overnment offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter\xe2\x80\x9d).  Public employees, moreover, often occupy trusted positions in society.  When they speak out, they can express views that contravene governmental policies or impair the proper performance of governmental functions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the Court has recognized that a citizen who works for the government is nonetheless a citizen.  The First Amendment limits the ability of a public employer to leverage the employment relationship to restrict, incidentally or intentionally, the liberties employees enjoy in their capacities as private citizens.  See <em>Perry</em> v. <em>Sindermann,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/593/index.html">408 U. S. 593</a>, 597 (1972).  So long as employees are speaking as citizens about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Connick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 147 (\xe2\x80\x9cOur responsibility is to ensure that citizens are not deprived of fundamental rights by virtue of working for the government\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s employee-speech jurisprudence protects, of course, the constitutional rights of public employees.  Yet the First Amendment interests at stake extend beyond the individual speaker.  The Court has acknowledged the importance of promoting the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest in receiving the well-informed views of government employees engaging in civic discussion.  <em>Pickering </em>again provides an instructive example.  The Court characterized its holding as rejecting the attempt of school administrators to \xe2\x80\x9climi[t] teachers\xe2\x80\x99 opportunities to contribute to public debate.\xe2\x80\x9d  391 U. S., at 573.  It also noted that teachers are \xe2\x80\x9cthe members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions\xe2\x80\x9d about school expenditures.  <em>Id.</em>, at 572.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach acknowledged the necessity for informed, vibrant dialogue in a democratic society.  It suggested, in addition, that widespread costs may arise when dialogue is repressed.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s more recent cases have expressed similar concerns.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>San Diego</em> v. <em>Roe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/77/index.html">543 U. S. 77</a>, 82 (2004) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cWere [public employees] not able to speak on [the operation of their employers], the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public issues.  The interest at stake is as much the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee\xe2\x80\x99s own right to disseminate it\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)); cf. <em>Treasury Employees,</em> 513 U. S., at 470 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe large-scale disincentive to Government employees\xe2\x80\x99 expression also imposes a significant burden on the public\xe2\x80\x99s right to read and hear what the employees would otherwise have written and said\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, then, have sought both to promote the individual and societal interests that are served when employees speak as citizens on matters of public concern and to respect the needs of government employers attempting to perform their important public functions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rankin</em>, 483 U. S., at 384 (recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cthe dual role of the public employer as a provider of public services and as a government entity operating under the constraints of the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Underlying our cases has been the premise that while the First Amendment invests public employees with certain rights, it does not empower them to \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionalize the employee grievance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Connick</em>, 461 U. S., at 154.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these principles in mind we turn to the instant case.  Respondent Ceballos believed the affidavit used to obtain a search warrant contained serious misrepresentations.  He conveyed his opinion and recommendation in a memo to his supervisor.  That Ceballos expressed his views inside his office, rather than publicly, is not dispositive.  Employees in some cases may receive First Amendment protection for expressions made at work.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Givhan</em> v. <em>Western Line Consol. School Dist.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/index.html">439 U. S. 410</a>, 414 (1979).  Many citizens do much of their talking inside their respective workplaces, and it would not serve the goal of treating public employees like \xe2\x80\x9cany member of the general public,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pickering</em>, 391 U. S., at 573, to hold that all speech within the office is automatically exposed to restriction.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The memo concerned the subject matter of Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 employment, but this, too, is nondispositive.  The First Amendment protects some expressions related to the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s job.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Givhan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 414.  As the Court noted in <em>Pickering:</em> \xe2\x80\x9cTeachers are, as a class, the members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent.  Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal.\xe2\x80\x9d  391 U. S., at 572.  The same is true of many other categories of public employees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The controlling factor in Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 case is that his expressions were made pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy.  See Brief for Respondent 4 (\xe2\x80\x9cCeballos does not dispute that he prepared the memorandum \xe2\x80\x98pursuant to his duties as a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  That consideration\xe2\x80\x94the fact that Ceballos spoke as a prosecutor fulfilling a responsibility to advise his supervisor about how best to proceed with a pending case\xe2\x80\x94distinguishes Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 case from those in which the First Amendment provides protection against discipline.  We hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ceballos wrote his disposition memo because that is part of what he, as a calendar deputy, was employed to do.  It is immaterial whether he experienced some personal gratification from writing the memo; his First Amendment rights do not depend on his job satisfaction.  The significant point is that the memo was written pursuant to Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 official duties.  Restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.  It simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created.  Cf. <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a>, 833 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes\xe2\x80\x9d).  Contrast, for example, the expressions made by the speaker in <em>Pickering</em>, whose letter to the newspaper had no official significance and bore similarities to letters submitted by numerous citizens every day.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ceballos did not act as a citizen when he went about conducting his daily professional activities, such as supervising attorneys, investigating charges, and preparing filings.  In the same way he did not speak as a citizen by writing a memo that addressed the proper disposition of a pending criminal case.  When he went to work and performed the tasks he was paid to perform, Ceballos acted as a government employee.  The fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean\nhis supervisors were prohibited from evaluating his\nperformance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This result is consistent with our precedents\xe2\x80\x99 attention to the potential societal value of employee speech.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Refusing to recognize First Amendment claims based on government employees\xe2\x80\x99 work product does not prevent them from participating in public debate.  The employees retain the prospect of constitutional protection for their contributions to the civic discourse.  This prospect of protection, however, does not invest them with a right to perform their jobs however they see fit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holding likewise is supported by the emphasis of our precedents on affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations.  Employers have heightened interests in controlling speech made by an employee in his or her professional capacity.  Official communications have official consequences, creating a need for substantive consistency and clarity.  Supervisors must ensure that their employees\xe2\x80\x99 official communications are accurate, demonstrate sound judgment, and promote the employer\xe2\x80\x99s mission.  Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 memo is illustrative.  It demanded the attention of his supervisors and led to a heated meeting with employees from the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s department.  If Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 superiors thought his memo was inflammatory or misguided, they had the authority to take proper corrective action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 proposed contrary rule, adopted by the Court of Appeals, would commit state and federal courts to a new, permanent, and intrusive role, mandating judicial oversight of communications between and among government employees and their superiors in the course of official business.  This displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision finds no support in our precedents.  When an employee speaks as a citizen addressing a matter of public concern, the First Amendment requires a delicate balancing of the competing interests surrounding the speech and its consequences.  When, however, the employee is simply performing his or her job duties, there is no warrant for a similar degree of scrutiny.  To hold otherwise would be to demand permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations to a degree inconsistent with sound principles of federalism and the separation of powers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals based its holding in part on what it perceived as a doctrinal anomaly.  The court suggested it would be inconsistent to compel public employers to tolerate certain employee speech made publicly but not speech made pursuant to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s assigned duties.  See 361 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1176.  This objection misconceives the theoretical underpinnings of our decisions.  Employees who make public statements outside the course of performing their official duties retain some possibility of First Amendment protection because that is the kind of activity engaged in by citizens who do not work for the government.  The same goes for writing a letter to a local newspaper, see <em>Pickering</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/563/index.html">391 U. S. 563</a>, or discussing politics with a co-worker, see <em>Rankin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/378/index.html"></a><a href="/us/483/378/index.html">483 U. S. 378</a>.  When a public employee speaks pursuant to employment responsibilities, however, there is no relevant analogue to speech by citizens who are not government employees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 concern also is unfounded as a practical matter.  The perceived anomaly, it should be noted, is limited in scope: It relates only to the expressions an employee makes pursuant to his or her official responsibilities, not to statements or complaints (such as those at issue in cases like <em>Pickering </em>and <em>Connick</em>) that are made outside the duties of employment.  If, moreover, a government employer is troubled by the perceived anomaly, it has the means at hand to avoid it.  A public employer that wishes to encourage its employees to voice concerns privately retains the option of instituting internal policies and procedures that are receptive to employee criticism.  Giving employees an internal forum for their speech will discourage them from concluding that the safest avenue of expression is to state their views in public.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proper application of our precedents thus leads to the conclusion that the First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee\xe2\x80\x99s expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.  Because Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99 memo falls into this category, his allegation of unconstitutional retaliation must fail.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two final points warrant mentioning.  First, as indicated above, the parties in this case do not dispute that Ceballos wrote his disposition memo pursuant to his employment duties.  We thus have no occasion to articulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s duties in cases where there is room for serious debate.  We reject, however, the suggestion that employers can restrict employees\xe2\x80\x99 rights by creating excessively broad job descriptions.  See <em>post</em>, at 4, n.\xc2\xa02 (Souter, J., dissenting).  The proper inquiry is a practical one.  Formal job descriptions often bear little resemblance to the duties an employee actually is expected to perform, and the listing of a given task in an employee\xe2\x80\x99s written job description is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the task is within the scope of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s professional duties for First Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Justice Souter suggests today\xe2\x80\x99s decision may have important ramifications for academic freedom, at least as a constitutional value.  See <em>post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  There is some argument that expression related to academic scholarship or classroom instruction implicates additional constitutional interests that are not fully accounted for by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s customary employee-speech jurisprudence.  We need not, and for that reason do not, decide whether the analysis we conduct today would apply in the same manner to a case involving speech related to scholarship or teaching.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable significance.  As the Court noted in <em>Connick</em>, public employers should, \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of good judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d be \xe2\x80\x9creceptive to constructive criticism offered by their employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U. S., at 149.  The dictates of sound judgment are reinforced by the powerful network of legislative enactments\xe2\x80\x94such as whistle-blower protection laws and labor codes\xe2\x80\x94available to those who seek to expose wrongdoing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72302(b)(8); Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa78547.8 (West 2005); Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71102.5 (West Supp. 2006).  Cases involving government attorneys implicate additional safeguards in the form of, for example, rules of conduct and constitutional obligations apart from the First Amendment.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Cal. Rule Prof. Conduct 5\xe2\x80\x93110 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cA member in government service shall not institute or cause to be instituted criminal charges when the member knows or should know that the charges are not supported by probable cause\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963).  These imperatives, as well as obligations arising from any other applicable constitutional provisions and mandates of the criminal and civil laws, protect employees and provide checks on supervisors who would order unlawful or otherwise inappropriate actions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject, however, the notion that the First Amendment shields from discipline the expressions employees make pursuant to their professional duties.  Our precedents do not support the existence of a constitutional cause of action behind every statement a public employee makes in the course of doing his or her job.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962084">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n547 U.

The notion that there is a categorical difference between speaking as a citizen and speaking in the course of one\xe2\x80\x99s employment is quite wrong.  Over a quarter of a century has passed since then-Justice Rehnquist, writing for a unanimous Court, rejected \xe2\x80\x9cthe conclusion that a public employee forfeits his protection against governmental abridgment of freedom of speech if he decides to express his views privately rather than publicly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Givhan</em> v. <em>Western Line Consol. School Dist.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/index.html">439 U. S. 410</a>, 414 (1979).

See<em> id.,</em> at 413\xe2\x80\x93416.  Our silence as to whether or not her speech was made pursuant to her job duties demonstrates that the point was immaterial.  That is equally true today, for it is senseless to let constitutional protection for exactly the same words hinge on whether they fall within a job description.  Moreover, it seems perverse to fashion a new rule that provides employees with an incentive to voice their concerns publicly before talking frankly to their superiors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While today\xe2\x80\x99s novel conclusion to the contrary may not be \xe2\x80\x9cinflammatory,\xe2\x80\x9d for the reasons stated in Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion it is surely \xe2\x80\x9cmisguided.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Branton </em>v. <em>Dallas</em>, 272 F.\xc2\xa03d 730 (CA5 2001) (police internal investigator demoted by police chief after bringing the false testimony of a fellow officer to the attention of a city official); <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, 444 F.\xc2\xa03d 929, 936 (CA7 2006) (police officer demoted after opposing the police chief\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cus[e] his official position to coerce a financially independent organization into a potentially ruinous merger\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Delgado </em>v.<em> Jones, </em>282 F.\xc2\xa03d 511 (CA7 2002) (police officer sanctioned for reporting criminal activity that implicated a local political figure who was a good friend of the police chief); <em>Herts</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, 345 F.\xc2\xa03d 581 (CA8 2003) (school district official\xe2\x80\x99s contract was not renewed after she gave frank testimony about the district\xe2\x80\x99s desegregation efforts); <em>Kincade</em> v. <em>Blue Springs</em>, 64 F.\xc2\xa03d 389 (CA8 1995) (engineer fired after reporting to his supervisors that contractors were failing to complete dam-related projects and that the resulting dam might be structurally unstable); <em>Fox </em>v.<em> District of Columbia</em>, 83 F.\xc2\xa03d 1491, 1494 (CADC 1996) (D.\xc2\xa0C.

I write separately to explain why I cannot fully accept either the Court\xe2\x80\x99s or Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the question presented.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I begin with what I believe is common ground:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xe2\x80\x82Because virtually all human interaction takes place through speech, the First Amendment cannot offer all speech the same degree of protection.  Rather, judges must apply different protective presumptions in different contexts, scrutinizing government\xe2\x80\x99s speech-related restrictions differently depending upon the general category of activity.  Compare, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Burson</em> v. <em>Freeman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/191/index.html">504 U. S. 191</a> (1992) (plurality opinion), (political speech), with <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N. Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/index.html">447 U. S. 557</a> (1980) (commercial speech), and <em>Rust</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/173/index.html">500 U. S. 173</a> (1991) (government speech).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xe2\x80\x82Where the speech of government employees is at issue, the First Amendment offers protection only where the offer of protection itself will not unduly interfere with legitimate governmental interests, such as the interest in efficient administration.  That is because the government, like any employer, must have adequate authority to direct the activities of its employees.  That is also because efficient administration of legislatively authorized programs reflects the constitutional need effectively to implement the public\xe2\x80\x99s democratically determined will.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xe2\x80\x82Consequently, where a government employee speaks \xe2\x80\x9cas an employee upon matters only of personal interest,\xe2\x80\x9d the First Amendment does not offer protection.  <em>Connick</em> v. <em>Myers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/index.html">461 U. S. 138</a>, 147 (1983).  Where the employee speaks \xe2\x80\x9cas a citizen \xe2\x80\xa6 upon matters of public concern,\xe2\x80\x9d the First Amendment offers protection but only where the speech survives a screening test.  <em>Pickering</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/index.html">391 U. S. 563</a>, 568 (1968).  That test, called, in legal shorthand, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Pickering</em> balancing,\xe2\x80\x9d requires a judge to \xe2\x80\x9cbalance \xe2\x80\xa6 the interests\xe2\x80\x9d of the employee \xe2\x80\x9cin commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  See also <em>Connick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 142.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xe2\x80\x82Our prior cases do not decide what screening test a judge should apply in the circumstances before us, namely when the government employee both speaks upon a matter of public concern and does so in the course of his ordinary duties as a government employee.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority answers the question by holding that  \xe2\x80\x9cwhen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  In a word, the majority says, \xe2\x80\x9cnever.\xe2\x80\x9d  That word, in my view, is too absolute.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the majority, I understand the need to \xe2\x80\x9caffor[d] government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  And I agree that the Constitution does not seek to \xe2\x80\x9cdisplac[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 managerial discretion by judicial supervision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Nonetheless, there may well be circumstances with special demand for constitutional protection of the speech at issue, where governmental justifications may be limited, and where administrable standards seem readily available\xe2\x80\x94to the point where the majority\xe2\x80\x99s fears of department management by lawsuit are misplaced.  In such an instance, I believe that courts should apply the <em>Pickering</em> standard, even though the government employee speaks upon matters of public concern in the course of his ordinary duties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is such a case.  The respondent, a government lawyer, complained of retaliation, in part, on the basis of speech contained in his disposition memorandum that he says fell within the scope of his obligations under <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963).  The facts present two special circumstances that together justify First Amendment review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the speech at issue is professional speech\xe2\x80\x94the speech of a lawyer.  Such speech is subject to independent regulation by canons of the profession.  Those canons provide an obligation to speak in certain instances.  And where that is so, the government\xe2\x80\x99s own interest in forbidding that speech is diminished.  Cf. <em>Legal Services Corporation</em> v. <em>Velazquez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/533/index.html">531 U. S. 533</a>, 544 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cRestricting LSC [Legal Services Corporation] attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys\xe2\x80\x9d).

The objective specificity and public availability of the profession\xe2\x80\x99s canons also help to diminish the risk that the courts will improperly interfere with the government\xe2\x80\x99s necessary authority to manage its work.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Constitution itself here imposes speech obligations upon the government\xe2\x80\x99s professional employee.  A prosecutor has a constitutional obligation to learn of, to preserve, and to communicate with the defense about exculpatory and impeachment evidence in the government\xe2\x80\x99s possession.  <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/419/index.html">514 U. S. 419</a>, 437 (1995); <em>Brady</em>, <em>supra. </em> So, for example, might a prison doctor have a similar constitutionally related professional obligation to communicate with superiors about seriously unsafe or unsanitary conditions in the cellblock.  Cf. <em>Farmer</em> v. <em>Brennan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/825/index.html">511 U. S. 825</a>, 832 (1994).  There may well be other examples.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where professional and special constitutional obligations  are both present, the need to protect the employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech is augmented, the need for broad government authority to control that speech is likely diminished, and administrable standards are quite likely available.  Hence, I would find that the Constitution mandates special protection of employee speech in such circumstances.  Thus I would apply the <em>Pickering</em> balancing test here.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I agree with much of Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, I believe that the constitutional standard he enunciates fails to give sufficient weight to the serious managerial and administrative concerns that the majority describes.  The standard would instruct courts to apply <em>Pickering</em> balancing in all cases, but says that the government should prevail unless the employee (1) \xe2\x80\x9cspeaks on a matter of unusual importance,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) \xe2\x80\x9csatisfies high standards of responsibility in the way he does it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 8 (dissenting opinion).  Justice Souter adds that \xe2\x80\x9conly comment on official dishonesty, deliberately unconstitutional action, other serious wrongdoing, or threats to health and safety can weigh out in an employee\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 9.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are, however, far too many issues of public concern, even if defined as \xe2\x80\x9cmatters of unusual importance,\xe2\x80\x9d for the screen to screen out very much.  Government administration typically involves matters of public concern.  Why else would government be involved?  And \xe2\x80\x9cpublic issues,\xe2\x80\x9d indeed, matters of \xe2\x80\x9cunusual importance,\xe2\x80\x9d are often daily bread-and-butter concerns for the police, the intelligence agencies, the military, and many whose jobs involve protecting the public\xe2\x80\x99s health, safety, and the environment.  This aspect of Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cadjustment\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic <em>Pickering</em> balancing scheme\xe2\x80\x9d is similar to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s present insistence that speech be of \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate news interest\xe2\x80\x9d, <em>ibid.,</em> when the employee speaks only as a private citizen.  See <em>San Diego</em> v. <em>Roe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/77/index.html">543 U. S. 77</a>, 83\xe2\x80\x9384 (2004) <em>(per curiam).</em>  It gives no extra weight to the government\xe2\x80\x99s augmented need to direct speech that is an ordinary part of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s job-related duties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the speech of vast numbers of public employees deals with wrongdoing, health, safety, and honesty: for example, police officers, firefighters, environmental protection agents, building inspectors, hospital workers, bank regulators, and so on.  Indeed, this categorization could encompass speech by an employee performing almost any public function, except perhaps setting electricity rates.  Nor do these categories bear any obvious relation to the constitutional importance of protecting the job-related speech at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The underlying problem with this breadth of coverage is that the standard (despite predictions that the government is likely to <em>prevail</em> in the balance unless the speech concerns \xe2\x80\x9cofficial dishonesty, deliberately unconstitutional action, other serious wrongdoing, or threats to health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9), does not avoid the judicial need to <em>undertake the balance</em> in the first place.  And this form of judicial activity\xe2\x80\x94the ability of a dissatisfied employee to file a complaint, engage in discovery, and insist that the court undertake a balancing of interests\xe2\x80\x94itself may interfere unreasonably with both the managerial function (the ability of the employer to control the way in which an employee performs his basic job) and with the use of other grievance-resolution mechanisms, such as arbitration, civil service review boards, and whistle-blower remedies, for which employees and employers may have bargained or which legislatures may have enacted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the list of categories substantially overlaps areas where the law already provides nonconstitutional protection through whistle-blower statutes and the like.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13 (majority opinion); <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315 (Souter, J., dissenting).  That overlap diminishes the need for a constitutional forum and also  means that adoption of the test would authorize federal Constitution-based legal actions that threaten to upset the legislatively struck (or administratively struck) balance that those statutes (or administrative procedures) embody.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I conclude that the First Amendment sometimes does authorize judicial actions based upon a government employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech that both (1) involves a matter of public concern and also (2) takes place in the course of ordinary job-related duties.  But it does so only in the presence of  augmented need for constitutional protection and diminished risk of undue judicial interference with governmental management of the public\xe2\x80\x99s affairs.  In my view, these conditions are met in this case and <em>Pickering</em> balancing is consequently appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962082">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOUTER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nGARCETTI V.

I respectfully dissent.  I agree with the majority that a government employer has substantial interests in effectuating its chosen policy and objectives, and in demanding competence, honesty, and judgment from employees who speak for it in doing their work.  But I would hold that private and public interests in addressing official wrongdoing and threats to health and safety can outweigh the government\xe2\x80\x99s stake in the efficient implementation of policy, and when they do public employees who speak on these matters in the course of their duties should be eligible to claim First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Open speech by a private citizen on a matter of public importance lies at the heart of expression subject to protection by the First Amendment.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Schenck</em> v. <em>Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/357/index.html">519 U. S. 357</a>, 377 (1997).  At the other extreme, a statement by a government employee complaining about nothing beyond treatment under personnel rules raises no greater claim to constitutional protection against retaliatory response than the remarks of a private employee.  See <em>Connick</em> v. <em>Myers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/index.html">461 U. S. 138</a>, 147 (1983).  In between these points lies a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech unwelcome to the government but on a significant public issue.  Such an employee speaking as a citizen, that is, with a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s interest, is protected from reprisal unless the statements are too damaging to the government\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to conduct public business to be justified by any individual or public benefit thought to flow from the statements.  <em>Pickering</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/563/index.html">391 U. S. 563</a>, 568 (1968).  Entitlement to protection is thus not absolute.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This significant, albeit qualified, protection of public employees who irritate the government is understood to flow from the First Amendment, in part, because a government paycheck does nothing to eliminate the value to an individual of speaking on public matters, and there is no good reason for categorically discounting a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s interest in commenting on a matter of public concern just because the government employs him.  Still, the First Amendment safeguard rests on something more, being the value to the public of receiving the opinions and information that a public employee may disclose.  \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Waters</em> v. <em>Churchill,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/661/index.html">511 U. S. 661</a>, 674 (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reason that protection of employee speech is qualified is that it can distract co-workers and supervisors from their tasks at hand and thwart the implementation of legitimate policy, the risks of which grow greater the closer the employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech gets to commenting on his own workplace and responsibilities.  It is one thing for an office clerk to say there is waste in government and quite another to charge that his own department pays full-time salaries to part-time workers.  Even so, we have regarded eligibility for protection by <em>Pickering</em> balancing as the proper approach when an employee speaks critically about the administration of his own government employer.  In<em> Givhan</em> v. <em>Western Line Consol. School Dist.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/index.html">439 U. S. 410</a> (1979), we followed <em>Pickering</em> when a teacher was fired for complaining to a superior about the racial composition of the school\xe2\x80\x99s administrative, cafeteria, and library staffs, 439 U. S., at 413\xe2\x80\x93414, and the same point was clear in <em>Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8</em> v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/167/index.html">429 U. S. 167</a> (1976).  That case was decided, in part, with reference to the <em>Pickering </em>framework, and the Court there held that a schoolteacher speaking out on behalf of himself and others at a public school board meeting could not be penalized for criticizing pending collective-bargaining negotiations affecting professional employment.  <em>Madison </em>noted that the teacher \xe2\x80\x9caddressed the school board not merely as one of its employees but also as a concerned citizen, seeking to express his views on an important decision of his government.\xe2\x80\x9d  429 U. S.,<em> </em>at 174\xe2\x80\x93175.  In each case, the Court realized that a public employee can wear a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s hat when speaking on subjects closely tied to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s own job, and <em>Givhan</em> stands for the same conclusion even when the speech is not addressed to the public at large.  Cf. <em>Pegram</em> v. <em>Herdrich, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/211/index.html">530 U. S. 211</a>, 225 (2000) (recognizing that, factually, a trustee under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 can both act as ERISA fiduciary and act on behalf of the employer).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difference between a case like <em>Givhan</em> and this one is that the subject of Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99s speech fell within the scope of his job responsibilities, whereas choosing personnel was not what the teacher was hired to do.  The effect of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional line between these two cases, then, is that a <em>Givhan</em> schoolteacher is protected when complaining to the principal about hiring policy, but a school personnel officer would not be if he protested that the principal disapproved of hiring minority job applicants.  This is an odd place to draw a distinction,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and while necessary judicial line-drawing sometimes looks arbitrary, any distinction obliges a court to justify its choice.  Here, there is no adequate justification for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s line categorically denying <em>Pickering </em>protection to any speech uttered \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to \xe2\x80\xa6 official duties,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As all agree, the qualified speech protection embodied in <em>Pickering</em> balancing resolves the tension between individual and public interests in the speech, on the one hand, and the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in operating efficiently without distraction or embarrassment by talkative or headline-grabbing employees.  The need for a balance hardly disappears when an employee speaks on matters his job requires him to address; rather, it seems obvious that the individual and public value of such speech is no less, and may well be greater, when the employee speaks pursuant to his duties in addressing a subject he knows intimately for the very reason that it falls within his duties.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the importance of such speech to the individual, it stands to reason that a citizen may well place a very high value on a right to speak on the public issues he decides to make the subject of his work day after day.  Would anyone doubt that a school principal evaluating the performance of teachers for promotion or pay adjustment retains a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s interest in addressing the quality of teaching in the schools?  (Still, the majority indicates he could be fired without First Amendment recourse for fair but unfavorable comment when the teacher under review is the superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.)  Would anyone deny that a prosecutor like Richard Ceballos may claim the interest of any citizen in speaking out against a rogue law enforcement officer, simply because his job requires him to express a judgment about the officer\xe2\x80\x99s performance?  (But the majority says the First Amendment gives Ceballos no protection, even if his judgment in this case was sound and appropriately expressed.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the very idea of categorically separating the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s interest from the employee\xe2\x80\x99s interest ignores the fact that the ranks of public service include those who share the poet\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cobject \xe2\x80\xa6 to unite [m]y avocation and my vocation;\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] these citizen servants are the ones whose civic interest rises highest when they speak pursuant to their duties, and these are exactly the ones government employers most want to attract.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  There is no question that public employees speaking on matters they are obliged to address would generally place a high value on a right to speak, as any responsible citizen would.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there any reason to raise the counterintuitive question whether the public interest in hearing informed employees evaporates when they speak as required on some subject at the core of their jobs.  Two Terms ago, we recalled the public value that the <em>Pickering</em> Court perceived in the speech of public employees as a class: \xe2\x80\x9cUnderlying the decision in <em>Pickering </em>is the recognition that public employees are often the members of the community who are likely to have informed opinions as to the operations of their public employers, operations which are of substantial concern to the public.  Were they not able to speak on these matters, the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public issues.  The interest at stake is as much the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee\xe2\x80\x99s own right to disseminate it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>San Diego</em> v. <em>Roe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/77/index.html">543 U. S. 77</a>, 82 (2004) <em>(per curiam)</em> (citation omitted).  This is not a whit less true when an employee\xe2\x80\x99s job duties require him to speak about such things: when, for example, a public auditor speaks on his discovery of embezzlement of public funds, when a building inspector makes an obligatory report of an attempt to bribe him, or when a law enforcement officer expressly balks at a superior\xe2\x80\x99s order to violate constitutional rights he is sworn to protect.  (The majority, however, places all these speakers beyond the reach of First Amendment protection against retaliation.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing, then, accountable on the individual and public side of the <em>Pickering</em> balance changes when an employee speaks \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant\xe2\x80\x9d to public duties.  On the side of the government employer, however, something is different, and to this extent, I agree with the majority of the Court.  The majority is rightly concerned that the employee who speaks out on matters subject to comment in doing his own work has the greater leverage to create office uproars and fracture the government\xe2\x80\x99s authority to set policy to be carried out coherently through the ranks.  \xe2\x80\x9cOfficial communications have official consequences, creating a need for substantive consistency and clarity.  Supervisors must ensure that their employees\xe2\x80\x99 official communications are accurate, demonstrate sound judgment, and promote the employer\xe2\x80\x99s mission,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11.  Up to a point, then, the majority makes good points: government needs civility in the workplace, consistency in policy, and honesty and competence in public service.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But why do the majority\xe2\x80\x99s concerns, which we all share, require categorical exclusion of First Amendment protection against any official retaliation for things said on the job?  Is it not possible to respect the unchallenged individual and public interests in the speech through a <em>Pickering</em> balance without drawing the strange line I mentioned before, <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934?  This is, to be sure, a matter of judgment, but the judgment has to account for the undoubted value of speech to those, and by those, whose specific public job responsibilities bring them face to face with wrongdoing and incompetence in government, who refuse to avert their eyes and shut their mouths.  And it has to account for the need actually to disrupt government if its officials are corrupt or dangerously incompetent.  See n.\xc2\xa04, <em>supra</em>.  It is thus no adequate justification for the suppression of potentially valuable information simply to recognize that the government has a huge interest in managing its employees and preventing the occasionally irresponsible one from turning his job into a bully pulpit.  Even there, the lesson of <em>Pickering </em>(and the object of most constitutional adjudication) is still to the point: when constitutionally significant interests clash, resist the demand for winner-take-all; try to make adjustments that serve all of the values at stake.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two reasons in particular make me think an adjustment using the basic <em>Pickering</em> balancing scheme is perfectly feasible here.  First, the extent of the government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate authority over subjects of speech required by a public job can be recognized in advance by setting in effect a minimum heft for comments with any claim to outweigh it.  Thus, the risks to the government are great enough for us to hold from the outset that an employee commenting on subjects in the course of duties should not prevail on balance unless he speaks on a matter of unusual importance and satisfies high standards of responsibility in the way he does it.  The examples I have already given indicate the eligible subject matter, and it is fair to say that only comment on official dishonesty, deliberately unconstitutional action, other serious wrongdoing, or threats to health and safety can weigh out in an employee\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  If promulgation of this standard should fail to discourage meritless actions premised on 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 (or <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971)) before they get filed, the standard itself would sift them out at the summary-judgment stage.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My second reason for adapting <em>Pickering</em> to the circumstances at hand is the experience in Circuits that have recognized claims like Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99s here.  First Amendment protection less circumscribed than what I would recognize has been available in the Ninth Circuit for over 17 years, and neither there nor in other Circuits that accept claims like this one has there been a debilitating flood of litigation.  There has indeed been some: as represented by Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer at oral argument, each year over the last five years, approximately 70 cases in the different Courts of Appeals and approximately 100 in the various District Courts.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 58\xe2\x80\x9359.  But even these figures reflect a readiness to litigate that might well have been cooled by my view about the importance required before <em>Pickering</em> treatment is in order.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For that matter, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position comes with no guarantee against factbound litigation over whether a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s statements were made \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to \xe2\x80\xa6 official duties,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9.  In fact, the majority invites such litigation by describing the enquiry as a \xe2\x80\x9cpractical one,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, apparently based on the totality of employment circumstances.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.  Are prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 discretionary statements about cases addressed to the press on the courthouse steps made \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to their official duties\xe2\x80\x9d?  Are government nuclear scientists\xe2\x80\x99 complaints to their supervisors about a colleague\xe2\x80\x99s improper handling of radioactive materials made \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant\xe2\x80\x9d to duties?</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority seeks support in two lines of argument extraneous to <em>Pickering</em> doctrine.  The one turns on a fallacious reading of cases on government speech, the other on a mistaken assessment of protection available under whistle-blower statutes.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority accepts the fallacy propounded by the county petitioners and the Federal Government as <em>amicus</em> that any statement made within the scope of public employment is (or should be treated as) the government\xe2\x80\x99s own speech, see <em>ante</em>, at 10, and should thus be differentiated as a matter of law from the personal statements the First Amendment protects, see <em>Broadrick</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/index.html">413 U. S. 601</a>, 610 (1973).  The majority invokes the interpretation set out in <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a> (1995), of <em>Rust</em> v. <em>Sullivan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/173/index.html">500 U. S. 173</a> (1991), which held there was no infringement of the speech rights of Title X funds recipients and their staffs when the Government forbade any on-the-job counseling in favor of abortion as a method of family planning, <em>id.</em>, at 192\xe2\x80\x93200.  We have read <em>Rust </em>to mean that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 833.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The key to understanding the difference between this case and <em>Rust</em> lies in the terms of the respective employees\xe2\x80\x99 jobs and, in particular, the extent to which those terms require espousal of a substantive position prescribed by the government in advance.  Some public employees are hired to \xe2\x80\x9cpromote a particular policy\xe2\x80\x9d by broadcasting a particular message set by the government, but not everyone working for the government, after all, is hired to speak from a government manifesto.  See <em>Legal Services Corporation</em> v. <em>Velazquez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/533/index.html">531 U. S. 533</a>, 542 (2001).  There is no claim or indication that Ceballos was hired to perform such a speaking assignment.  He was paid to enforce the law by constitutional action: to exercise the county government\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutorial power by acting honestly, competently, and constitutionally.  The only sense in which his position apparently required him to hew to a substantive message was at the relatively abstract point of favoring respect for law and its evenhanded enforcement, subjects that are not at the level of controversy in this case and were not in <em>Rust.</em>  Unlike the doctors in <em>Rust</em>, Ceballos was not paid to advance one specific policy among those legitimately available, defined by a specific message or limited by a particular message forbidden.  The county government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in his speech cannot therefore be equated with the terms of a specific, prescribed, or forbidden substantive position comparable to the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in <em>Rust</em>, and <em>Rust</em> is no authority for the notion that government may exercise plenary control over every comment made by a public employee in doing his job.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not, of course, that the district attorney lacked interest of a high order in what Ceballos might say.  If his speech undercut effective, lawful prosecution, there would have been every reason to rein him in or fire him; a statement that created needless tension among law enforcement agencies would be a fair subject of concern, and the same would be true of inaccurate statements or false ones made in the course of doing his work.  But these interests on the government\xe2\x80\x99s part are entirely distinct from any claim that Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99s speech was government speech with a preset or proscribed content as exemplified in <em>Rust</em>.

In any event, the combined variants of statutory whistle-blower definitions and protections add up to a patchwork, not a showing that worries may be remitted to legislatures for relief.  See D.

After showing his superior, petitioner Frank Sunstedt, the disposition memorandum at issue in this case, Ceballos complied with Sunstedt\xe2\x80\x99s direction to tone down some accusatory rhetoric out of concern that the memorandum would be unnecessarily incendiary when shown to the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department.  After meeting with members of that department, Ceballos told his immediate supervisor, petitioner Carol Najera, that he thought <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963), obliged him to give the defense his internal memorandum as exculpatory evidence.  He says that Najera responded by ordering him to write a new memorandum containing nothing but the deputy sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s statements, but that he balked at that.  Instead, he proposed to turn over the existing memorandum with his own conclusions redacted as work product, and this is what he did.  The issue over revealing his conclusions arose again in preparing for the suppression hearing.  Ceballos maintains that Sunstedt ordered Najera, representing the prosecution, to give the trial judge a full picture of the circumstances, but that Najera told Ceballos he would suffer retaliation if he testified that the affidavit contained intentional fabrications.  In any event, Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99s testimony generally stopped short of his own conclusions.  After the hearing, the trial judge denied the motion to suppress, explaining that he found grounds independent of the challenged material sufficient to show probable cause for the warrant.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ceballos says that over the next six months his supervisors retaliated against him[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] not only for his written reports, see <em>ante</em>, at 3, but also for his spoken statements to them and his hearing testimony in the pending criminal case.  While an internal grievance filed by Ceballos challenging these actions was pending, Ceballos spoke at a meeting of the Mexican-American Bar Association about misconduct of the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department in the criminal case, the lack of any policy at the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office for handling allegations of police misconduct, and the retaliatory acts he ascribed to his supervisors.  Two days later, the office dismissed Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99s grievance, a result he attributes in part to his Bar Association speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99s action against petitioners under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 claims that the individuals retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment rights in submitting the memorandum, discussing the matter with Najera and Sunstedt, testifying truthfully at the hearing, and speaking at the bar meeting.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  As I mentioned, the Court of Appeals saw no need to address the protection afforded to Ceballos\xe2\x80\x99s statements other than the disposition memorandum, which it thought was protected under the <em>Pickering</em> test.  Upon remand, it will be open to the Court of Appeals to consider the application of <em>Pickering </em>to any retaliation shown for other statements; not all of those statements would have been made pursuant to official duties in any obvious sense, and the claim relating to truthful testimony in court must surely be analyzed independently to protect the integrity of the judicial process. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It seems stranger still in light of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s concession of some First Amendment protection when a public employee repeats statements made pursuant to his duties but in a separate, public forum or in a letter to a newspaper.  <em>Ante,</em> at 12.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I do not say the value of speech \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to \xe2\x80\xa6 duties\xe2\x80\x9d will always be greater, because I am pessimistic enough to expect that one response to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding will be moves by government employers to expand stated job descriptions to include more official duties and so exclude even some currently protectable speech from First Amendment purview.  Now that the government can freely penalize the school personnel officer for criticizing the principal because speech on the subject falls within the personnel officer\xe2\x80\x99s job responsibilities, the government may well try to limit the English teacher\xe2\x80\x99s options by the simple expedient of defining teachers\xe2\x80\x99 job responsibilities expansively, investing them with a general obligation to ensure sound administration of the school.
