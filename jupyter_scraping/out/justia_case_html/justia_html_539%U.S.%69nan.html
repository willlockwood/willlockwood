Second, for essentially the same reasons, it is inappropriate to accept the Government\'s invitation to assess the merits of petitioners\' convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel. Third, the Government\'s argument that the presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the panel is sufficient to support the decision below is rejected for two reasons. The federal quorum statute, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 46(d), has been on the books (in relevant part essentially unchanged) for over a century, yet this Court has never doubted its power to vacate a judgment entered by an improperly constituted court of appeals, even when there was a quorum of judges competent to consider the appeal.

Moreover, the statute authorizing courts of appeals to sit in panels, \xc2\xa7 46(b), requires the inclusion of at least three judges in the first instance. Although the two Article III judges who took part below would have constituted a quorum had the original panel been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel. Thus, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration by a properly constituted panel.

When the Court of Appeals heard arguments in Guam, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit invited the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to participate. A judge of the District Court of Guam was similarly invited to participate in appeals heard while the Ninth Circuit sat in the Northern Mariana Islands.</p><p>The panel affirmed petitioners\' convictions without dissent. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/284/1086/">284 F.3d 1086</a> (2002). Neither Nguyen nor Phan objected to the composition of the panel before the cases were submitted for decision; neither petitioner sought rehearing after the Court of Appeals rendered judgment to challenge the panel\'s authority to decide their appeals. Each did, however, file a petition for certiorari raising the question whether the judgment of the Court of Appeals is invalid because of the participation of a non-Article III judge on the panel. In accordance with this Court\'s Rule 10(a), we granted the writ, 537 U.

Pet. for Cert. in No. 01-10873, p. 6; Pet. for Cert. in No. 02-5034, p. 5. For the following reasons, we find these to be appropriate cases for the exercise of that power.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>We begin with the congressional grant of authority permitting, in certain circumstances, the designation of district judges to serve on the courts of appeals. In relevant part, the designation statute authorizes the chief judge of a circuit to assign "one or more district judges within the circuit" to sit on the court of appeals "whenever the business of that court so requires." 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 292(a). Section 292(a) itself does not explicitly define the "district judges" who may be assigned to the court of appeals. However, as other provisions of law make perfectly clear, judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are not "district judges" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 292(a).</p><p>Outside of \xc2\xa7 292(a), Title 28 contains several particularly instructive provisions. The term "district court" as used throughout Title 28 is defined to mean a " \'court of the United States\'" that is "constituted by chapter 5 of this title." \xc2\xa7 451. Chapter 5 of Title 28 in turn creates a "United States District Court" for each judicial district. \xc2\xa7 132(a) ("There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district"). And "district judge[s]" are established as the members of those courts. \xc2\xa7 132(b) ("Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges for the district in regular active service"). The judicial districts constituted by Chapter 5 are then exhaustively enumerated. \xc2\xa7 133(a) ("The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, district judges for the several ju-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="75">75</a></p><p>dicial districts, as follows [listing districts]"). Lastly, Chapter 5 describes "district judges" as holding office "during good behavior." \xc2\xa7 134(a).</p><p>Taking these provisions together, \xc2\xa7 292(a) cannot be read to permit the designation to the court of appeals of a judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the courts constituted by Chapter 5 of Title 28, nor is that court even mentioned within Chapter 5.7 See \xc2\xa7 133(a). Because the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the President for cause, they also do not satisfy the command for district judges within the meaning of Title 28 to hold office during good behavior. \xc2\xa7 134(a).</p><p>The Government agrees these statutory provisions are best read together as not permitting the Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands to sit by designation on the Ninth Circuit. The Government maintains, however, that the erroneous designation in these cases was not plainly impermissible because Title 28 does not expressly forbid it or explicitly define the term "district judge" separately from the term "district court." This contention requires an excessively strained interpretation of the statute. To be sure, a literal reading of the words "district judges" in isolation from the rest of the statute might arguably justify assigning the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands for service on the Court of Appeals, for he is called a "district judge" of a court "within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit." But a literal reading of that sort is so capacious that it would also justify the designation of "district judges" of any number of</p><p>7The District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is instead established in Chapter 17 of Title 48 ("Territories and Insular Possessions"). See \xc2\xa7 1821.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="76">76</a></p><p><i>state </i>courts "within" the Ninth Circuit.8 The statute cannot plausibly be interpreted to authorize the improper panel assignment in these cases.</p><p>Moreover, we do not read the designation statute without regard for the "historic significance" of the term "United States District Court" used in Title 28. <i>Mookini </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/201/case.html">303 U. S. 201</a>, 205 (1938). "[W]ithout an addition expressing a wider connotation," that term ordinarily excludes Article IV territorial courts, even when their jurisdiction is similar to that of a United States District Court created under Article III. <i>Ibid. </i>See also <i>Summers </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/231/92/case.html">231 U. S. 92</a>, 101-102 (1913) ("[T]he courts of the Territories may have such jurisdiction of cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States as is vested in the circuit and district courts, but this does not make them circuit and district courts of the United States"); <i>Stephens </i>v. <i>Cherokee Nation, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/174/445/case.html">174 U. S. 445</a>, 476-477 (1899) ("It must be admitted that the words \'United States District Court\' were not accurately used ... [to refer to] the United States Court in the Indian Territory"). Construing the relevant statutory provisions together with further aid from historical usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be "district judges" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 292(a). It necessarily follows that the appointment of one member of the panel deciding petitioners\' appeals was unauthorized.9</p><p>8 Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Washington are all States within the Ninth Circuit whose judiciaries include "district judges."

Two of the grounds on which we are urged to affirm concern petitioners\' failure to object to the panel\'s composition in the Court of Appeals. Relying on the so-called <i>"de </i>facto officer" doctrine, the Government contends petitioners\' failure to challenge the panel\'s composition at the earliest practicable moment completely forecloses relief in this Court. The Government also contends that petitioners do not meet the requirements for relief under plain-error review. The presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the Court of Appeals panel is invoked as the third ground sufficient to support the decision below.

The difference between the irregular judicial designations in <i>McDowell </i>and <i>Ball </i>and the impermissible panel designation in the instant cases is therefore the difference between an action which could have been taken, if properly pursued, and one which could never have been taken at all.

In light of our conclusion that there is no plausible interpretation of \xc2\xa7 292(a) permitting the designation in the instant cases, see <i>supra, </i>at 74-76, we think this is a distinction without a difference. In any event, there was no "express" prohibition at play in <i>United States </i>v. <i>American-Foreign </i>S. S. <i>Corp., 363 </i>U.

Congress\' decision to preserve the Article III character of the courts of appeals is more than a trivial concern, cf. <i>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. </i>v. <i>Marathon Pipe Line Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/case.html">458 U. S. 50</a>, 57-60 (1982) (plurality opinion), and is entitled to respect. The Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands did not purport to have "all the powers attached to" the position of an Article III judge, <i>McDowell, </i>159 U. S., at 601, nor was the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit otherwise permitted by \xc2\xa7 292(a) to designate him for service on an Article III court. Accordingly, his participation contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals.</p><p>For essentially the same reasons, we think it inappropriate to accept the Government\'s invitation to assess the merits of petitioners\' convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel. It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limits an appellate court to review for plain error. See 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2111; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b). But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners\' part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld. Even if the parties had <i>expressly </i>stipulated to the participation of a non-Article III judge in the consider-</p><p>Court of Appeals, sitting en bane, because a Senior Circuit Judge who had participated in the decision was not authorized by statute to do so. See also id., at 691 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("The statute need hardly be read, as the Court now holds it should be, as saying that a case in an <i>en bane </i>court shall be \'heard and determined\' by the active circuit judges").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="81">81</a></p><p>ation of their appeals, no matter how distinguished and well qualified the judge might be, such a stipulation would not have cured the plain defect in the composition of the panel.12 See <i>William Cramp </i>&amp; <i>Sons, </i>228 U. S., at 650.</p><p>More fundamentally, our enforcement of \xc2\xa7 292(a)\'s outer bounds is not driven so much by concern for the validity of petitioners\' convictions at trial but for the validity of the composition of the Court of Appeals. As a general rule, federal courts may not use their supervisory powers to circumvent the obligation to assess trial errors for their prejudicial effect. See <i>Bank of Nova Scotia </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/250/case.html">487 U. S. 250</a>, 254-255 (1988). Because the error in these cases involves a violation of a statutory provision that "embodies a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business," however, our exercise of supervisory power is not inconsistent with that general rule.13 <i>Glidden, 370 </i>U. S., at 536 (plurality opinion). Thus, we invalidated the judgment of a Court of Appeals without assessing prejudice, even though urged to do so, when the error alleged was the improper composition of that court. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>American-Foreign </i>S. S. <i>Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/685/case.html">363 U.

Hand, J.). For two reasons, however, the presence of a quorum on the Ninth Circuit panel does not save the judgments below. First, the quorum statute has been on the books (in relevant part essentially unchanged) for over a century,15 yet this Court has never doubted its power to vacate the judgment entered by an improperly constituted court of appeals, even when there was a quorum of judges competent to consider the appeal. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>American-Foreign </i>S. S. <i>Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/685/case.html">363 U.

As used in \xc2\xa7 46(d), <i>"quorum ... </i>means such a number of the members of the court as may legally transact judicial business." <i>Tobin </i>v.

It is "clear that the statute was not intended to preclude disposition by a panel of two judges in the event that one member of a three-judge panel to which the appeal is assigned becomes unable to participate," <i>ibid., </i>but it is less clear whether the quorum statute offers post judgment absolution for the participation of a judge who was not otherwise competent to be part of the panel under \xc2\xa7 292(a). Thus, although the two Article III judges who took part in the decision of petitioners\' appeals would have constituted a quorum if the original panel had been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel. In light of that doubt, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration of petitioners\' appeals by a properly constituted panel organized "comformably to the requirements of the statute." 17 <i>William Cramp </i>&amp; <i>Sons, </i>228 U.

Exercise of our certiorari jurisdiction was warranted to review the case and to state the law correctly. To that extent, I agree with the Court\'s opinion. But I do not agree that that error is a valid basis for vacating petitioners\' convictions, because even assuming that the error affected petitioners\' substantial rights, it simply did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p><p>Petitioners knew of the composition of the panel of the Court of Appeals more than a week before the case was orally argued.

The Court first concedes, as it must, that a failure to object to error limits an appellate court to review for plain error. <i>Ante, </i>at 80. But the Court then completely ignores the fact that "the authority created by Rule 52(b) is circumscribed." <i>Olano, supra, </i>at 732. Indeed, the opinion fails to cite, much less apply, <i>Olano </i>or our other recent cases reaffirming that "we exercise our power under Rule 52(b) sparingly," <i>Jones </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/373/case.html">527 U.

As we explained in <i>Olano, </i>we articulated the standard that should guide the exercise of remedial discretion under Rule 52(b) almost 70 years ago in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Atkinson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/157/case.html">297 U.

Since then, "we repeatedly have quoted the <i>Atkinson </i>language in describing plain-error review." <i>Olano, supra, </i>at 736 (citing cases). According to this long line of cases, when an error is plain and affects substantial rights, "an appellate court <i>must </i>then determine whether the forfeited error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings <i>before </i>it may exercise its discretion to correct the error." <i>Johnson, supra, </i>at 469-470 (quoting <i>Olano, supra, </i>at 736) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).</p><p>This mandatory inquiry confirms that no "miscarriage of justice" would result if petitioners\' convictions were affirmed. Petitioners make no claim that Chief Judge Munson was biased or incompetent. His character and abilities as a jurist, peculiarly experienced in adjudicating matters arising within the United States Territories, stand unimpeached. It is therefore difficult to understand how fairness or the public reputation of the judicial process is advanced by allowing criminal defendants, whose convictions are supported by "\'overwhelming\'" evidence, <i>Cotton, supra, </i>at 633, 634, and whose arguments on appeal were meritless, to consume the public resources necessary for a second appellate review. *</p><p>*Drug enforcement agents seized 443.8 grams of methamphetamine in a package that was mailed to Phan and opened in Nguyen\'s apartment. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/284/1086/">284 F.3d 1086</a>, 1087-1088 (CA9 2002).

Rather, it objected at the earliest possible moment: immediately after the Court of Appeals issued an en banc decision that Judge Medina joined. It did not know that Judge Medina would retire or then participate in the en banc decision until after the case was briefed and submitted; it availed itself of the earliest opportunity to object to this error by filing a</p><p>discovered drug paraphernalia, "nearly a hundred little plastic zip lock bags," and $6,000 in cash. <i>Id., </i>at 1088, 1091.</p><p>All three members of the Ninth Circuit panel agreed that petitioners\' challenges-that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting certain evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions-lacked merit.

In both cases, this Court considered an Act of Congress providing that" \'no judge before whom a cause or question may have been tried or heard in a district court ... shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the Circuit Court of Appeals.\'" 228 U. S., at 649; 148 U. S., at 387. This Court held that, when a district judge sat in contravention of that "comprehensive and inflexible" prohibition, 228 U.

See also <i>American Construction, supra, </i>at 387.</p><p>But these cases do not control here because, as the Court fails to note, both cases predate our adoption of the standard for plain-error review in <i>Atkinson </i>in 1936, and Congress\' codification of that standard in Rule 52(b) in 1944. This, and not some broader principle, explains the Court\'s failure in those cases to apply our modern plain-error analysis. The Court has no such excuse. The cases can also easily be distinguished from this litigation on the facts: They held only that courts constituted "in violation of the <i>express prohibitions </i>of [a] statute" lack the authority to act. <i>Cramp, 228 </i>U.

But proper affirmance of petitioners\' convictions on the ground that the error did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings would not so suggest. The Government has conceded the error, and the Court\'s opinion properly makes clear to the Courts of Appeals that Chief Judge Munson\'s participation constituted plain error. Indeed, the Court unwittingly explains why its own holding is mistaken: By ignoring the limits that Congress has imposed on appellate courts\' discretion via Rule 52(b), the Court "create[s]" for itself and exercises "authority [that] Congress has quite carefully withheld." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. No miscarriage of justice will result from deciding not to notice the plain error here. Accordingly, I would proceed to address petitioners\' constitutional claims.

I would decline to address the first question because it was "neither raised nor decided below, and [was] not presented in the petition for certiorari." <i>Blessing </i>v. <i>Freestone, 520 </i>U.

"No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="89">89</a></p><p>a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it." <i>Yakus </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/414/case.html">321 U. S. 414</a>, 444 (1944); <i>Johnson, </i>520 U. S., at 465. See also <i>Cotton, </i>535 U. S., at 631-633 (applying plain-error review to a claimed violation of <i>Apprendi </i>v. <i>New Jersey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/case.html">530 U. S. 466</a> (2000)); <i>Plaut </i>v. <i>Spendthrift Farm, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/514/211/case.html">514 U. S. 211</a>, 231 (1995) ("[T]he proposition that legal defenses based upon doctrines central to the courts\' structural independence can never be waived simply does not accord with our cases"); <i>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\'n </i>v. <i>Schor, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/833/case.html">478 U. S. 833</a>, 848-849 (1986) ("[A]s a personal right, Article Ill\'s guarantee of an impartial and independent federal adjudication is subject to waiver, just as are other personal constitutional rights that dictate the procedures by which civil and criminal matters must be tried").</p><p>Assuming, <i>arguendo, </i>that petitioners could satisfy the first three elements of the plain-error inquiry, see <i>Olano, 507 </i>U. S., at 732; <i>supra, </i>at 84-85, their constitutional claim fails for the same reason as does their statutory claim: Petitioners have not shown that the claimed error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. See <i>supra, </i>at 85. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
