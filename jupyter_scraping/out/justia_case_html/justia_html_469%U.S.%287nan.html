S. 289</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In 1980, Tennessee proposed reducing the number of annual days of inpatient hospital care covered by its state Medicaid program.  The question presented is whether the effect upon the handicapped that this reduction will have is cognizable under \xc2\xa7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or its implementing regulations.  We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Faced in 1980-1981 with projected state Medicaid [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] costs of $42 million more than the State\'s Medicaid budget of $388 million, the directors of the Tennessee Medicaid program decided to institute a variety of cost-saving measures.  Among these changes was a reduction from 20 to 14 in the number of inpatient hospital days per fiscal year that Tennessee Medicaid would pay hospitals on behalf of a Medicaid recipient.  Before the new measures took effect, respondents, Tennessee Medicaid recipients, brought a class action for declaratory and injunctive relief in which they alleged, <em>inter alia,</em> that the proposed 14-day limitation on inpatient coverage would have a discriminatory effect on the handicapped. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Statistical evidence, which petitioners do not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="290">Page 469 U. S. 290</a></p><p> dispute, indicated that in the 1979-1980 fiscal year, 27.4% of all handicapped users of hospital services who received Medicaid required more than 14 days of care, while only 7.8% of nonhandicapped users required more than 14 days of inpatient care.</p>\n<p>Based on this evidence, respondents asserted that the reduction would violate \xc2\xa7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 394, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 794, and its implementing regulations.  Section 504 provides:</p>\n<p>"No otherwise qualified handicapped individual . . . shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . ."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 794.</p>\n<p>Respondents\' position was twofold.  First, they argued that the change from 20 to 14 days of coverage would have a disproportionate effect on the handicapped and hence was discriminatory. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The second, and major, thrust of respondents\' attack was directed at the use of any annual limitation on the number of inpatient days covered, for respondents acknowledged that, given the special needs of the handicapped for medical care, any such limitation was likely to disadvantage the handicapped disproportionately.  Respondents noted, however, that federal law does not require States to impose any annual durational limitation on inpatient coverage, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="291">Page 469 U. S. 291</a></p><p> and that the Medicaid programs of only 10 States impose such restrictions. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Respondents therefore suggested that Tennessee follow these other States and do away with any limitation on the number of annual inpatient days covered.  Instead, argued respondents, the State could limit the number of days of hospital coverage on a per-stay basis, with the number of covered days to vary depending on the recipient\'s illness (for example, fixing the number of days covered for an appendectomy); the period to be covered for each illness could then be set at a level that would keep Tennessee\'s Medicaid program as a whole within its budget. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The State\'s refusal to adopt the plan was said to result in the imposition of gratuitous costs on the handicapped and thus to constitute discrimination under \xc2\xa7 504.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that respondents had indeed established a <em>prima facie</em> case of a \xc2\xa7 504 violation.  <em>Jennings v. Alexander,</em> 715 F.2d 1036 (1983).  The majority apparently concluded that any action by a federal grantee that disparately affects the handicapped states a cause of action under \xc2\xa7 504 and its implementing regulations.  Because both the 14-day rule and any annual limitation on inpatient coverage disparately </p><p><a class="page-number" name="292">Page 469 U. S. 292</a></p><p> affected the handicapped, the panel found that a <em>prima facie</em> case had been made out, and the case was remanded [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] to give Tennessee an opportunity for rebuttal.  According to the panel majority, the State on remand could either demonstrate the unavailability of alternative plans that would achieve the State\'s legitimate cost-saving goals with a less disproportionate impact on the handicapped, or the State could offer "a substantial justification for the adoption of the plan with the greater discriminatory impact."  <em>Id.</em> at 1045.  We granted certiorari to consider whether the type of impact at issue in this case is cognizable under \xc2\xa7 504 or its implementing regulations, 465 U.S. 1021 (1984), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The first question the parties urge on the Court is whether proof of discriminatory animus is always required to establish a violation of \xc2\xa7 504 and its implementing regulations, or whether federal law also reaches action by a recipient of federal funding that discriminates against the handicapped by effect rather than by design.  The State of Tennessee argues that \xc2\xa7 504 reaches only purposeful discrimination against the handicapped.  As support for this position, the State relies heavily on our recent decision in <em>Guardians Assn. v. Civil Service Comm\'n of New York City,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/582/case.html">463 U. S. 582</a></span> (1983).</p>\n<p>In <em>Guardians,</em> we confronted the question whether Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000d <em>et seq.,</em> which prohibits discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities in programs receiving federal aid, reaches both </p><p><a class="page-number" name="293">Page 469 U. S. 293</a></p><p> intentional and disparate impact discrimination. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  No opinion commanded a majority in <em>Guardians,</em> and Members of the Court offered widely varying interpretations of Title VI.  Nonetheless, a two-pronged holding on the nature of the discrimination proscribed by Title VI emerged in that case.  First, the Court held that Title VI itself directly reached only instances of intentional discrimination. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Second, the Court held that actions having an unjustifiable disparate impact on minorities could be redressed through agency regulations designed to implement the purposes of Title VI. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In essence, then, we held that Title VI had delegated to the agencies in the first instance the complex determination of what sorts of disparate impacts upon minorities constituted sufficiently significant social problems, and were readily </p><p><a class="page-number" name="294">Page 469 U. S. 294</a></p><p> enough remediable, to warrant altering the practices of the federal grantees that had produced those impacts.</p>\n<p><em>Guardians,</em> therefore, does not support petitioners\' blanket proposition that federal law proscribes only intentional discrimination against the handicapped.  Indeed, to the extent our holding in <em>Guardians</em> is relevant to the interpretation of \xc2\xa7 504, <em>Guardians</em> suggests that the regulations implementing \xc2\xa7 504, upon which respondents in part rely, could make actionable the disparate impact challenged in this case. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Moreover, there are reasons to pause before too quickly extending even the first prong of <em>Guardians</em> to \xc2\xa7 504.  <em>Cf. Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Darrone,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/624/case.html">465 U. S. 624</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/624/case.html#632">465 U. S. 632</a></span>-633, n. 13 (1984) (recognizing distinctions between Title VI and \xc2\xa7 504). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="295">Page 469 U. S. 295</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Discrimination against the handicapped was perceived by Congress to be most often the product, not of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference -- of benign neglect. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Thus, Representative Vanik, introducing the predecessor to \xc2\xa7 504 in the House, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] described the treatment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="296">Page 469 U. S. 296</a></p><p> of the handicapped as one of the country\'s "shameful oversights," which caused the handicapped to live among society "shunted aside, hidden, and ignored."  117 Cong.Rec. 45974 (1971).  Similarly, Senator Humphrey, who introduced a companion measure in the Senate, asserted that "we can no longer tolerate the invisibility of the handicapped in America. . . ."  118 Cong.Rec. 525-526 (1972).  And Senator Cranston, the Acting Chairman of the Subcommittee that drafted \xc2\xa7 504, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] described the Act as a response to "previous societal neglect."  119 Cong.Rec. 5880, 5883 (1973).  <em>See also</em> 118 Cong.Rec. 526 (1972) (statement of cosponsor Sen. Percy) (describing the legislation leading to the 1973 Act as a national commitment to eliminate the "glaring neglect" of the handicapped). [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Federal agencies and commentators on the plight of the handicapped similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped is primarily the result of apathetic attitudes rather than affirmative animus. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, much of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in passing the Rehabilitation Act would be difficult if </p><p><a class="page-number" name="297">Page 469 U. S. 297</a></p><p> not impossible to reach were the Act construed to proscribe only conduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.  For example, elimination of architectural barriers was one of the central aims of the Act, <em>see, e.g.,</em> S.Rep. No. 93-318, p. 4 (1973), yet such barriers were clearly not erected with the aim or intent of excluding the handicapped.  Similarly, Senator Williams, the chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee that reported out \xc2\xa7 504, asserted that the handicapped were the victims of "[d]iscrimination in access to public transportation" and "[d]iscrimination because they do not have the simplest forms of special educational and rehabilitation services they need. . . ."  118 Cong.Rec. 3320 (1972).  And Senator Humphrey, again in introducing the proposal that later became \xc2\xa7 504, listed, among the instances of discrimination that the section would prohibit, the use of "transportation and architectural barriers," the "discriminatory effect of job qualification . . . procedures," and the denial of "special educational assistance" for handicapped children.  <em>Id.</em> at 525-526.  These statements would ring hollow if the resulting legislation could not rectify the harms resulting from action that discriminated by effect as well as by design. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="298">Page 469 U. S. 298</a></p><p></p>\n<p>At the same time, the position urged by respondents -- that we interpret \xc2\xa7 504 to reach all action disparately affecting the handicapped -- is also troubling.  Because the handicapped typically are not similarly situated to the nonhandicapped, respondents\' position would in essence require each recipient of federal funds first to evaluate the effect on the handicapped of every proposed action that might touch the interests of the handicapped, and then to consider alternatives for achieving the same objectives with less severe disadvantage to the handicapped.  The formalization and policing of this process could lead to a wholly unwieldy administrative and adjudicative burden.  <em>See</em> Note, Employment Discrimination Against the Handicapped and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act:  An Essay on Legal Evasiveness, 97 Harv.L.Rev. 997, 1008 (1984) (describing problems with pure disparate-impact model in context of employment discrimination against the handicapped).  Had Congress intended \xc2\xa7 504 to be a National Environmental Policy Act [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] for the handicapped, requiring the preparation of "Handicapped Impact </p><p><a class="page-number" name="299">Page 469 U. S. 299</a></p><p> Statements" before any action was taken by a grantee that affected the handicapped, we would expect some indication of that purpose in the statute or its legislative history.  Yet there is nothing to suggest that such was Congress\' purpose.  Thus, just as there is reason to question whether Congress intended \xc2\xa7 504 to reach only intentional discrimination, there is similarly reason to question whether Congress intended \xc2\xa7 504 to embrace all claims of disparate impact discrimination.</p>\n<p>Any interpretation of \xc2\xa7 504 must therefore be responsive to two powerful but countervailing considerations -- the need to give effect to the statutory objectives and the desire to keep \xc2\xa7 504 within manageable bounds.  Given the legitimacy of both of these goals and the tension between them, we decline the parties\' invitation to decide today that one of these goals so overshadows the other as to eclipse it.  While we reject the boundless notion that all disparate impact showings constitute <em>prima facie</em> cases under \xc2\xa7 504, we assume without deciding that \xc2\xa7 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an unjustifiable disparate impact upon the handicapped.  On that assumption, we must then determine whether the disparate effect of which respondents complain is the sort of disparate impact that federal law might recognize.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>To determine which disparate impacts \xc2\xa7 504 might make actionable, the proper starting point is <em>Southeastern Community College v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html">442 U. S. 397</a></span> (1979), our major previous attempt to define the scope of \xc2\xa7 504. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  <em>Davis</em> involved a plaintiff with a major hearing disability who sought admission </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 469 U. S. 300</a></p><p> to a college to be trained as a registered nurse, but who would not be capable of safely performing as a registered nurse even with full-time personal supervision.  We stated that, under some circumstances, a</p>\n<p>"refusal to modify an existing program might become unreasonable and discriminatory.  Identification of those instances where a refusal to accommodate the needs of a disabled person amounts to discrimination against the handicapped [is] an important responsibility of HEW."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html#413">442 U. S. 413</a></span>.  We held that the college was not required to admit Davis because it appeared unlikely that she could benefit from any modifications that the relevant HEW regulations required, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html#409">442 U. S. 409</a></span>, and because the further modifications Davis sought -- full-time, personal supervision whenever she attended patients and elimination of all clinical courses -- would have compromised the essential nature of the college\'s nursing program, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html#413">442 U. S. 413</a></span>-414.  Such a "fundamental alteration in the nature of a program" was far more than the reasonable modifications the statute or regulations required.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html#410">442 U. S. 410</a></span>.  <em>Davis</em> thus struck a balance between the statutory rights of the handicapped to be integrated into society and the legitimate interests of federal grantees in preserving the integrity of their programs:  while a grantee need not be required to make "fundamental" or "substantial" modifications to accommodate the handicapped, it may be required to make "reasonable" ones.  <em>Compare ibid. with id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html#412">442 U. S. 412</a></span>-413. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 469 U. S. 301</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The balance struck in <em>Davis</em> requires that an otherwise qualified handicapped individual must be provided with meaningful access to the benefit that the grantee offers.  The benefit itself, of course, cannot be defined in a way that effectively denies otherwise qualified handicapped individuals the meaningful access to which they are entitled; to assure meaningful access, reasonable accommodations in the grantee\'s program or benefit may have to be made. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  In this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 469 U. S. 302</a></p><p> case, respondents argue that the 14-day rule, or any annual durational limitation, denies meaningful access to Medicaid services in Tennessee.  We examine each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The 14-day limitation will not deny respondents meaningful access to Tennessee Medicaid services or exclude them from those services.  The new limitation does not invoke criteria that have a particular exclusionary effect on the handicapped; the reduction, neutral on its face, does not distinguish between those whose coverage will be reduced and those whose coverage will not on the basis of any test, judgment, or trait that the handicapped as a class are less capable of meeting or less likely of having.  Moreover, it cannot be argued that "meaningful access" to state Medicaid services will be denied by the 14-day limitation on inpatient coverage; nothing in the record suggests that the handicapped in Tennessee will be unable to benefit meaningfully from the coverage they will receive under the 14-day rule. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  The reduction in inpatient coverage will leave both handicapped and nonhandicapped Medicaid users with identical and effective hospital services fully available for their use, with both classes of users subject to the same durational limitation.  The 14-day limitation, therefore, does not exclude the handicapped from or deny them the benefits of the 14 days of care the State has chosen to provide.  <em>Cf. Jefferson v. Hackney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/535/case.html">406 U. S. 535</a></span> (1972).</p>\n<p>To the extent respondents further suggest that their greater need for prolonged inpatient care means that, to provide meaningful access to Medicaid services, Tennessee must single out the handicapped for <em>more</em> than 14 days of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 469 U. S. 303</a></p><p> coverage, the suggestion is simply unsound.  At base, such a suggestion must rest on the notion that the benefit provided through state Medicaid programs is the amorphous objective of "adequate health care."  But Medicaid programs do not guarantee that each recipient will receive that level of health care precisely tailored to his or her particular needs.  Instead, the benefit provided through Medicaid is a particular package of health care services, such as 14 days of inpatient coverage.  That package of services has the general aim of assuring that individuals will receive necessary medical care, but the benefit provided remains the individual services offered -- not "adequate health care."</p>\n<p>The federal Medicaid Act makes this point clear.  The Act gives the States substantial discretion to choose the proper mix of amount, scope, and duration limitations on coverage, as long as care and services are provided in "the best interests of the recipients."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(19).  The District Court found that the 14-day limitation would fully serve 95% of even handicapped individuals eligible for Tennessee Medicaid, and both lower courts concluded that Tennessee\'s proposed Medicaid plan would meet the "best interests" standard.  That unchallenged conclusion [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] indicates that Tennessee is free, as a matter of the Medicaid Act, to choose to define the benefit it will be providing as 14 days of inpatient coverage.</p>\n<p>Section 504 does not require the State to alter this definition of the benefit being offered simply to meet the reality that the handicapped have greater medical needs.  To conclude otherwise would be to find that the Rehabilitation Act requires States to view certain illnesses, <em>i.e.,</em> those </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 469 U. S. 304</a></p><p> particularly affecting the handicapped, as more important than others and more worthy of cure through government subsidization.  Nothing in the legislative history of the Act supports such a conclusion.  <em>Cf. Doe v. Colautti,</em> 592 F.2d 704 (CA3 1979) (State may limit covered-private-inpatient-pyschiatric care to 60 days even though State sets no limit on duration of coverage for physical illnesses).  Section 504 seeks to assure evenhanded treatment and the opportunity for handicapped individuals to participate in and benefit from programs receiving federal assistance.  <em>Southeastern Community College v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html">442 U. S. 397</a></span> (1979).  The Act does not, however, guarantee the handicapped equal results from the provision of state Medicaid, even assuming some measure of equality of health could be constructed.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) pursuant to the Act further support this conclusion. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  These regulations state that recipients of federal funds who provide health services cannot "provide a qualified handicapped person with benefits or services that are not as effective (as defined in \xc2\xa7 84.4(b)) as the benefits or services provided to others."  45 CFR \xc2\xa7 84.52(a)(3)(1984).  The regulations also prohibit a recipient of federal funding from adopting</p>\n<p>"criteria or methods of administration that  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 469 U. S. 305</a></p><p> have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient\'s program with respect to the handicapped."</p>\n<p>45 CFR \xc2\xa7 84.4(b)(4)(ii)(1984). [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>While these regulations, read in isolation, could be taken to suggest that a state Medicaid program must make the handicapped as healthy as the nonhandicapped, other regulations reveal that HHS does not contemplate imposing such a requirement.  Title 45 CFR \xc2\xa7 84.4(b)(2)(1984), referred to in the regulations quoted above, makes clear that</p>\n<p>"[f]or purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, but must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement. . . ."</p>\n<p>This regulation, while indicating that adjustments to existing programs are contemplated, [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>] also makes clear that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 469 U. S. 306</a></p><p> Tennessee is not required to assure that its handicapped Medicaid users will be as healthy as its nonhandicapped users.  Thus, to the extent respondents are seeking a distinct durational limitation for the handicapped, Tennessee is entitled to respond by asserting that the relevant benefit is 14 days of coverage.  Because the handicapped have meaningful and equal access to that benefit, Tennessee is not obligated to reinstate its 20-day rule or to provide the handicapped with more than 14 days of inpatient coverage.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>We turn next to respondents\' alternative contention, a contention directed not at the 14-day rule itself but rather at Tennessee\'s Medicaid <em>plan</em> as a whole.  Respondents argue that the inclusion of any annual durational limitation on inpatient coverage in a state Medicaid plan violates \xc2\xa7 504.  The thrust of this challenge is that all annual durational limitations discriminate against the handicapped because (1) the effect of such limitations falls most heavily on the handicapped and because (2) this harm could be avoided by the choice of other Medicaid plans that would meet the State\'s budgetary constraints without disproportionately disadvantaging the handicapped.  Viewed in this light, Tennessee\'s current plan is said to inflict a gratuitous harm on the handicapped that denies them meaningful access to Medicaid services.</p>\n<p>Whatever the merits of this conception of meaningful access, it is clear that \xc2\xa7 504 does not require the changes respondents seek.  In enacting the Rehabilitation Act and in subsequent amendments, [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] Congress did focus on several </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 469 U. S. 307</a></p><p> substantive areas -- employment, [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] education, [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] and the elimination of physical barriers to access [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] -- in which it considered the societal and personal costs of refusals to provide meaningful access to the handicapped to be particularly high. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  But nothing in the pre- or post-1973 legislative discussion of \xc2\xa7 504 suggests that Congress desired to make major inroads on the States\' longstanding discretion to choose the proper mix of amount, scope, and duration limitations on services covered by state Medicaid, <em>see Beal v. Doe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/438/case.html">432 U. S. 438</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/438/case.html#444">432 U. S. 444</a></span> (1977).  And, more generally, we have already stated, <em>supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/287/case.html#298">469 U. S. 298</a></span>-299, that \xc2\xa7 504 does not impose a general NEPA-1ike requirement on federal grantees. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 469 U. S. 308</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The costs of such a requirement would be far from minimal, and thus Tennessee\'s refusal to pursue this course does not, as respondents suggest, inflict a "gratuitous" harm on the handicapped.  On the contrary, to require that the sort of broad-based distributive decision at issue in this case always be made in the way most favorable, or least disadvantageous, to the handicapped, even when the same benefit is meaningfully and equally offered to them, would be to impose a virtually unworkable requirement on state Medicaid administrators.  Before taking any across-the-board action affecting Medicaid recipients, an analysis of the effect of the proposed change on the handicapped would have to be prepared.  Presumably, that analysis would have to be further broken down by class of handicap -- the change at issue here, for example, might be significantly less harmful to the blind, who use inpatient services only minimally, than to other subclasses of handicapped Medicaid recipients; the State would then have to balance the harms and benefits to various groups to determine, on balance, the extent to which the action disparately impacts the handicapped.  In addition, respondents offer no reason that similar treatment would not have to be accorded other groups protected by statute or regulation from disparate impact discrimination.</p>\n<p>It should be obvious that administrative costs of implementing such a regime would be well beyond the accommodations that are required under <em>Davis.</em>  As a result, Tennessee need not redefine its Medicaid program to eliminate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 469 U. S. 309</a></p><p> durational limitations on inpatient coverage, even if in doing so the State could achieve its immediate fiscal objectives in a way less harmful to the handicapped.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The 14-day rule challenged in this case is neutral on its face, is not alleged to rest on a discriminatory motive, and does not deny the handicapped access to or exclude them from the particular package of Medicaid services Tennessee has chosen to provide.  The State has made the same benefit -- 14 days of coverage equally accessible to both handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, and the State is not required to assure the handicapped "adequate health care" by providing them with more coverage than the nonhandicapped.  In addition, the State is not obligated to modify its Medicaid program by abandoning reliance on annual durational limitations on inpatient coverage.  Assuming, then, that \xc2\xa7 504 or its implementing regulations reach some claims of disparate impact discrimination, the effect of Tennessee\'s reduction in annual inpatient coverage is not among them.  For that reason, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondents had established a <em>prima facie</em> violation of \xc2\xa7 504.  The judgment below is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Medicaid was established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 343, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396 <em>et seq.</em>  Medicaid is a joint state-federal funding program for medical assistance in which the Federal Government approves a state plan for the funding of medical services for the needy and then subsidizes a significant portion of the financial obligations the State has agreed to assume.  Once a State voluntarily chooses to participate in Medicaid, the State must comply with the requirements of Title XIX and applicable regulations.  <em>Harris v.

First, for seven Justices, the outcome in the first prong of <em>Guardians</em> was settled by their view that a majority of the Court in <em>University of California Regents v. Bakke,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/265/case.html">438 U. S. 265</a></span> (1978), had already concluded that Title VI reached only intentional discrimination.  <em>See</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/582/case.html#607">463 U.

S. 616</a></span>-618 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), in the view of the seven Justices <em>Bakke</em> controlled as a matter of <em>stare decisis.</em>  Had these Justices not felt the force of this constraint, it is unclear whether they would have read an intent requirement into Title VI.  <em>See</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/582/case.html#626">463 U. S. 626</a></span> (OCONNOR, J., concurring in judgment) ("Were we construing Title VI without the benefit of any prior interpretation from this Court, one might well conclude that the statute was designed to redress more than purposeful discrimination") (citation omitted).  For that reason, the conclusion that, in response to factors peculiar to Title VI, <em>Bakke</em> locked in a certain construction of Title VI would not seem to have any obvious or direct applicability to \xc2\xa7 504.</p>\n<p>Second, by the time Congress enacted the Rehabilitation Act in 1973, nearly a decade of experience had been accumulated with the operation of the nondiscrimination provisions of Titles VI and VII.  By this time, model Title VI enforcement regulations incorporating a disparate impact standard had been drafted by a Presidential task force and the Justice Department, and every Cabinet Department and about 40 federal agencies had adopted standards in which Title VI was interpreted to bar programs with a discriminatory impact.  <em>See Guardians,</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/582/case.html#629">463 U. S. 629</a></span>-630 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  These regulations provoked some controversy in Congress, and in 1966 the House of Representatives rejected a proposed amendment that would have limited Title VI to only intentional discrimination.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/582/case.html#630">463 U. S. 630</a></span>-631.  Thus, when Congress in 1973 adopted virtually the same language for \xc2\xa7 504 that had been used in Title VI, Congress was well aware of the intent/impact issue and of the fact that similar language in Title VI consistently had been interpreted to reach disparate-impact discrimination.  In refusing expressly to limit \xc2\xa7 504 to intentional discrimination, Congress could be thought to have approved a disparate-impact standard for \xc2\xa7 504.  <em>See United States v.

However, the question of who is "otherwise qualified" and what actions constitute "discrimination" under the section would seem to be two sides of a single coin; the ultimate question is the extent to which a grantee is required to make reasonable modifications in its programs for the needs of the handicapped.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Davis,</em> we stated that \xc2\xa7 504 does not impose an "affirmative action obligation on all recipients of federal funds."  442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html#411">442 U.

Our use of the term "affirmative action" in this context has been severely criticized for failing to appreciate the difference between affirmative action and reasonable accommodation; the former is said to refer to a remedial policy for the victims of past discrimination, while the latter relates to the elimination of existing obstacles against the handicapped.  <em>See</em> Note, Accommodating the Handicapped:  The Meaning of Discrimination Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 55 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 881, 885-886 (1980); Note, Accommodating the Handicapped:  Rehabilitating Section 504 After <em>Southeastern,</em> 80 Colum.L.Rev. 171, 185-186 (1980); <em>see also Dopico v.

Regardless of the aptness of our choice of words in <em>Davis,</em> it is clear from the context of <em>Davis</em> that the term "affirmative action" referred to those "changes," "adjustments," or "modifications" to existing programs that would be "substantial," 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/397/case.html#410">442 U.
