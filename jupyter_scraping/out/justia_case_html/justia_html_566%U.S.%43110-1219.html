The patent examiner denied all of the claims for lack of an adequate written description.  Hyatt appealed to the Board, which approved some claims but denied others.  Pursuant to \xc2\xa7145, Hyatt filed a civil action against the Director, but the District Court declined to consider Hyatt\xe2\x80\x99s newly proffered written declaration in support of the adequacy of his description, thus limiting its review to the administrative record.  Applying the deferential \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d standard of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings, the court granted summary judgment to the Director.  On appeal, the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment, holding that patent applicants can introduce new evidence in \xc2\xa7145 proceedings, subject only to the limitations in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Nonetheless, the Director contends that background principles of administrative law govern the admissibility of new evidence and impose a deferential standard of review in \xc2\xa7145 proceedings.  As the Director concedes, however, judicial review in \xc2\xa7145 proceedings is not limited to the administrative record because the district court may consider new evidence.  If it does so, the district court must act as a factfinder and cannot apply the APA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard to PTO factual findings when those findings are contradicted by new evidence.  Moreover, the doctrine of administrative exhaustion\xe2\x80\x95the primary purpose of which is \xe2\x80\x9cthe avoidance of premature interruption of the administrative process,\xe2\x80\x9d McKart v. United States, \n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185\n\xe2\x80\x95does not apply because the PTO process is complete by the time a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding occurs.

Decisions interpreting R.\xc2\xa0S. 4915 thus inform this Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of \xc2\xa7145.  Both Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, \n\n112 U.\xc2\xa0S. 50\n, and Morgan v. Daniels, \n\n153 U.\xc2\xa0S. 120\n, describe the nature of R.\xc2\xa0S. 4915 proceedings, but the two opinions can be perceived as being in some tension.  Butterworth described the proceeding as an original civil action seeking de novo adjudication of the merits of a patent application, while Morgan described it as a suit for judicial review of agency action under a deferential standard.  The cases are distinguishable, however, because they addressed different circumstances.  Butterworth discussed a patent applicant\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the denial of his application, whereas Morgan involved an interference proceeding that would now be governed by \xc2\xa7146, not \xc2\xa7145, and in which no new evidence was presented.  Here, this Court is concerned only with a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding in which new evidence was presented to the District Court, so Butterworth guides this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Thus, a district court conducting a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding may consider all competent evidence adduced and is not limited to considering only new evidence that could not have been presented to the PTO.  The introduction of new evidence in \xc2\xa7145 proceedings is subject only to the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and if new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed factual question, de novo findings by the district court will be necessary for that new evidence to be taken into account along with the evidence before the Board.

In such a proceeding, the applicant may present evidence to the district court that he did not present to the PTO.  This case requires us to consider two questions.  First, we must decide whether there are any limitations on the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to introduce new evidence before the district court.  For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that there are no evidentiary restrictions beyond those already imposed by the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Second, we must determine what standard of review the district court should apply when considering new evidence.  On this question, we hold that the district court must make a de\xc2\xa0novo finding when new evidence is presented on a disputed question of fact.  In deciding what weight to afford that evidence, the district court may, however, consider whether the applicant had an opportunity to present the evidence to the PTO.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Patent Act of 1952 establishes the process by which the PTO examines patent applications.  A patent exam- iner first determines whether the application satisfies the statutory prerequisites for granting a patent.  \n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7131.  If the examiner denies the application, the applicant may file an administrative appeal with the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board).  \xc2\xa7134.  If the Board also denies the application, the Patent Act gives the disappointed applicant two options for judicial review of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The applicant may either: (1) appeal the decision directly to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, pursuant to \xc2\xa7141; or (2) file a civil action against the Director of the PTO in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to \xc2\xa7145.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn a \xc2\xa7141 proceeding, the Federal Circuit must review the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the same administrative record that was before the PTO.  \xc2\xa7144.  Thus, there is no opportunity for the applicant to offer new evidence in such a proceeding.  In Dickinson v. Zurko, \n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 150 (1999)\n, we addressed the standard that governs the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s review of the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings.  We held that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7701 et\xc2\xa0seq., applies to \xc2\xa7141 proceedings and that the Federal Circuit therefore should set aside the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings only if they are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unsupported by substantial evidence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 152 (quoting \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Zurko, we also noted that, unlike \xc2\xa7141, \xc2\xa7145 permits the applicant to present new evidence to the district court that was not presented to the PTO.  527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 164.  This opportunity to present new evidence is significant, not the least because the PTO generally does not accept oral testimony.  See Brief for Petitioner 40, n.\xc2\xa011.  We have not yet addressed, however, whether there are any limitations on the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to introduce new evidence in such a proceeding or the appropriate standard of review that a district court should apply when considering such evidence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1995, respondent Gilbert Hyatt filed a patent application that, as amended, included 117 claims.  The PTO\xe2\x80\x99s patent examiner denied each claim for lack of an adequate written description.  See \n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7112 (requiring pat- ent applications to include a \xe2\x80\x9cspecification\xe2\x80\x9d that provides, among other information, a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it).  Hyatt appealed the examiner\xe2\x80\x99s decision to the Board, which eventually approved 38 claims, but denied the rest.  Hyatt then filed a \xc2\xa7145 action in Federal Dis- trict Court against the Director of the PTO (Director), peti- tioner here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo refute the Board\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that his patent application lacked an adequate written description, Hyatt submitted a written declaration to the District Court.  In the declaration, Hyatt identified portions of the patent specification that, in his view, supported the claims that the Board held were not patentable.  The District Court determined that it could not consider Hyatt\xe2\x80\x99s declaration because applicants are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98precluded from presenting new is- sues, at least in the absence of some reason of justice put forward for failure to present the issue to the Patent Office.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Hyatt v. Dudas, Civ. Action No. 03\xe2\x80\x930901 (D DC, Sept. 30, 2005), p.\xc2\xa09, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a (quoting DeSeversky v. Brenner, 424 F.\xc2\xa02d 857, 858 (CADC 1970)).  Because the excluded declaration was the only additional evidence submitted by Hyatt in the \xc2\xa7145 proceeding, the evidence remaining before the District Court consisted entirely of the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s administrative record.  Therefore, the District Court reviewed all of the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings under the APA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  See supra, at 2; see also Mazzari v. Rogan, 323 F.\xc2\xa03d 1000, 1004\xe2\x80\x931005 (CA Fed. 2003).  Applying that standard, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Director.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHyatt appealed to the Federal Circuit.  A divided panel affirmed, holding that the APA imposed restrictions on the admission of new evidence in a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding and that the district court\xe2\x80\x99s review is not \xe2\x80\x9cwholly de novo.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hyatt v. Doll, 576 F.\xc2\xa03d 1246, 1269\xe2\x80\x931270 (2009).  The Federal Circuit granted rehearing en banc and vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment.  The en banc court first held \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress intended that applicants would be free to introduce new evidence in \xc2\xa7145 proceedings subject only to the rules applicable to all civil actions, the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d even if the applicant had no justification for failing to present the evidence to the PTO.  625 F.\xc2\xa03d 1320, 1331 (2010).  Reaffirming its precedent, the court also held that when new, conflicting evidence is introduced in a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding, the district court must make de\xc2\xa0 novo findings to take such evidence into account.

We granted certiorari, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011), and now affirm.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Director challenges both aspects of the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  First, the Director argues that a district court should admit new evidence in a \xc2\xa7145 action only if the proponent of the evidence had no reasonable opportunity to present it to the PTO in the first instance.  Second, the Director contends that, when new evidence is introduced, the district court should overturn the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s fac- tual findings only if the new evidence clearly establishes that the agency erred.  Both of these arguments share the premise that \xc2\xa7145 creates a special proceeding that is distinct from a typical civil suit filed in federal district court and that is thus governed by a different set of procedural rules.  To support this interpretation of \xc2\xa7145, the Director relies on background principles of administrative law and pre-existing practice under a patent statute that predated \xc2\xa7145.  For the reasons discussed below, we find that neither of these factors justifies a new evidentiary rule or a heightened standard of review for factual findings in \xc2\xa7145 proceedings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo address the Director\xe2\x80\x99s challenges, we begin with the text of \xc2\xa7145.  See, e.g., Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10).  Section 145 grants a disappointed patent applicant a \xe2\x80\x9cremedy by civil action against the Director.\xe2\x80\x9d  The section further explains that the district court \xe2\x80\x9cmay adjudge that such applicant is entitled to receive a patent for his invention, as specified in any of his claims involved in the decision of the [PTO], as the facts in the case may appear and such adjudication shall authorize the Director to issue such patent on compliance with the requirements of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  By its terms, \xc2\xa7145 neither imposes unique evidentiary limits in district court proceedings nor establishes a heightened standard of re- view for factual findings by the PTO.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the absence of express support for his position in the text of \xc2\xa7145, the Director argues that the statute should be read in light of traditional principles of administrative law, which Congress codified in the APA.  The Director notes that \xc2\xa7145 requires a district court to review the reasoned decisionmaking of the PTO, an executive agency with specific authority and expertise.  Accordingly, the Director contends that a district court should defer to the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings.  The Director further contends that, given the traditional rule that a party must exhaust his administrative remedies, a district court should consider new evidence only if the party did not have an opportunity to present it to the agency.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe reject the Director\xe2\x80\x99s contention that background principles of administrative law govern the admissibility of new evidence and require a deferential standard of review in a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding.  Under the APA, judicial review of an agency decision is typically limited to the administrative record.  See \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706.  But, as the Director concedes, \xc2\xa7145 proceedings are not so limited, for the district court may consider new evidence.  When the district court does so, it must act as a factfinder.  Zurko, 527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 164.  In that role, it makes little sense for the district court to apply a deferential standard of review to PTO factual findings that are contradicted by the new evidence.  The PTO, no matter how great its authority or expertise, cannot account for evidence that it has never seen.  Consequently, the district court must make its own findings de\xc2\xa0novo and does not act as the \xe2\x80\x9creviewing court\xe2\x80\x9d envisioned by the APA.  See \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe also conclude that the principles of administrative exhaustion do not apply in a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding.  The Director argues that applicants must present all available evidence to the PTO to permit the PTO to develop the necessary facts and to give the PTO the opportunity to properly apply the Patent Act in the first instance.  Brief for Petitioner 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (citing McKart v. United States, \n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185\n\xe2\x80\x93194 (1969)).  But as this Court held in McKart, a primary purpose of administrative exhaustion \xe2\x80\x9cis, of course, the avoidance of premature interruption of the administrative process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 193.  That rationale does not apply here because, by the time a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding occurs, the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s process is complete.  Section 145, moreover, does not provide for remand to the PTO to consider new evidence, and there is no pressing need for such a procedure because a district court, unlike a court of appeals, has the ability and the competence to receive new evidence and to act as a factfinder.  In light of these aspects of \xc2\xa7145 proceedings\xe2\x80\x94at least in those cases in which new evidence is presented to the district court on a dis- puted question of fact\xe2\x80\x94we are not persuaded by the Director\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xc2\xa7145 proceedings are governed by the deferential principles of agency review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHaving concluded that neither the statutory text nor background principles of administrative law support an evidentiary limit or a heightened standard of review for factual findings in \xc2\xa7145 proceedings, we turn to the evidentiary and procedural rules that were in effect when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7145 in 1952.  Although \xc2\xa7145 is a relatively modern statute, the language in that provision originated in the Act of July 8, 1870 (1870 Act), ch. 230, \n\n16Stat.\n198, and the history of \xc2\xa7145 proceedings can be traced back to the Act of July 4, 1836 (1836 Act), ch.\xc2\xa0357, \n\n5Stat.\n117.  Thus, we begin our inquiry with the 1836 Act, which established the Patent Office, the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, and first authorized judicial review of its decisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe 1836 Act provided that a patent applicant could bring a bill in equity in federal district court if his application was denied on the ground that it would interfere  with another patent.  Id., at 123\xe2\x80\x93124; see also B. Shipman, Handbook of the Law of Equity Pleading \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x93103, pp. 168\xe2\x80\x93171 (1897).  Three years later, Congress expanded that provision, making judicial review available whenever a patent was refused on any ground.  Act of Mar. 3, 1839 (1839 Act), \n\n5Stat.\n354.  Pursuant to these statutes, any disappointed patent applicant could file a bill in equity to have the district court \xe2\x80\x9cadjudge\xe2\x80\x9d whether the applicant was \xe2\x80\x9centitled, according to the principles and provisions of [the Patent Act], to have and receive a patent for his invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  1836 Act, \n\n5Stat.\n124.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1870, Congress amended the Patent Act again, adding intermediate layers of administrative review and in- troducing language describing the proceeding in the district court.  \n\n16Stat.\n198.  Under the 1870 Act, an applicant denied a patent by the primary examiner could appeal first to a three-member board of examiners-in-chief, then to the Commissioner for Patents, and finally to an en banc sitting of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Id., at 205.

The 1870 Act preserved the prior remedy of a bill in equity in district court for the applicant whose appeal was denied either by the Commissioner or by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.  Ibid.  The district court, in a proceeding that was distinct from the appeal considered on the administrative record by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, would \xe2\x80\x9cadjudge\xe2\x80\x9d whether the applicant was \xe2\x80\x9centitled, according to law, to receive a patent for his invention .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as the facts in the case may appear.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In 1878, Congress codified this provision of the 1870 Act as Revised Statute \xc2\xa74915 (R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915).  That statute was the immediate predecessor to \xc2\xa7145, and its core language remains largely unchanged in \xc2\xa7145.  Accordingly, both parties agree that R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 and the judicial decisions interpreting that statute should inform our understanding of \xc2\xa7145.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court described the nature of R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 proceedings in two different cases: Butterworth v.

In Butterworth, the Court held that the Secretary of the Interior, the head of the federal department in which the Patent Office was a bureau, had no authority to review a decision made by the Commissioner of Patents in an interference proceeding.  In its discussion, the Court described the remedy provided by R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 as\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9ca proceeding in a court of the United States having original equity jurisdiction under the patent laws, according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure.

There, a party challenged a factual finding by the Patent Office, but neither side presented additional evidence in the District Court.  Id., at 122\xe2\x80\x93123.  This Court described the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute as one over a question of fact that had already \xe2\x80\x9cbeen settled by a special tribunal [e]ntrusted with full power in the premises\xe2\x80\x9d and characterized the resulting District Court proceeding not as an independent civil action, but as \xe2\x80\x9csomething in the nature of a suit to set aside a judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 124.  Consistent with that view, the Court held that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s findings should not be overturned by \xe2\x80\x9ca mere preponderance of evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tViewing Butterworth and Morgan together, one might perceive some tension between the two cases.  Butterworth appears to describe an R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 proceeding as an original civil action, seeking de\xc2\xa0novo adjudication of the merits of a patent application.  Morgan, on the other hand, appears to describe an R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 proceeding as a suit for judicial review of agency action, governed by a deferential standard of review.  To resolve that apparent tension, the Director urges us to disregard the language in Butterworth as mere dicta and to follow Morgan.  He argues that Butterworth \xe2\x80\x9cshed[s] no light on the extent to which new evidence was admissible in R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 proceedings or on the standard of review that applied in such suits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 33.  The Director maintains that Morgan, in contrast, firmly established that a district court in such a proceeding performs a deferential form of review, governed by traditional principles of administrative law.  We reject the Director\xe2\x80\x99s position.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe think that the differences between Butterworth and Morgan are best explained by the fact that the two cases addressed different circumstances.  Butterworth discussed the character of an R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 proceeding in which a disappointed patent applicant challenged the Board\xe2\x80\x99s denial of his application.  Although that discussion was not strictly necessary to Butterworth\xe2\x80\x99s holding it was also not the kind of ill-considered dicta that we are inclined to ignore.  The Butterworth Court carefully examined the various pro- visions providing relief from the final denial of a patent application by the Commissioner of Patents to determine that the Secretary of the Interior had no role to play in that process.  112 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59\xe2\x80\x9364.  The Court further surveyed the decisions of the lower courts with regard to the nature of an R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 proceeding and concluded that its view was \xe2\x80\x9cthe uniform and correct practice in the Circuit Courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 61.  We note that this Court reiter- ated Butterworth\xe2\x80\x99s well-reasoned interpretation of R.\xc2\xa0S. 4915 in three later cases.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMorgan, on the other hand, concerned a different situation from the one presented in this case.  First, Morgan addressed an interference proceeding.  See 153 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 125 (emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe question decided in the Pat- ent Office is one between contesting parties as to priority of invention\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although interference proceedings were pre- viously governed by R.\xc2\xa0S. 4915, they are now governed by a separate section of the Patent Act, \n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7146, and therefore do not implicate \xc2\xa7145.  In addition, Morgan did not involve a proceeding in which new evidence was presented to the District Court.  See 153 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 122 (stating that the case \xe2\x80\x9cwas submitted, without any additional testimony, to the Circuit Court\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause in this case we are concerned only with \xc2\xa7145 proceedings in which new evidence has been presented to the District Court, Butterworth rather than Morgan guides our decision.  In Butterworth, this Court observed that an R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 proceeding should be conducted \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure\xe2\x80\x9d and that it should be \xe2\x80\x9cprepared and heard upon all competent evidence adduced and upon the whole merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  112 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 61.  Likewise, we conclude that a district court conducting a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding may consider \xe2\x80\x9call com- petent evidence adduced,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 61, and is not limited to considering only new evidence that could not have been presented to the PTO.  Thus, we agree with the Federal Circuit that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended that applicants would be free to introduce new evidence in \xc2\xa7145 proceedings subject only to the rules applicable to all civil actions, the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  625 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1331.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe also agree with the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding view that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed fact question, a de\xc2\xa0novo finding will be necessary to take such evidence into account together with the evidence before the board.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fregeau v. Mossinghoff, 776 F. 2d 1034, 1038 (1985).  As we noted in Zurko, the district court acts as a factfinder when new evidence is introduced in a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding.  527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 164.  The district court must assess the credibility of new witnesses and other evidence, determine how the new evidence comports with the existing administrative record, and decide what weight the new evidence deserves.  As a logical matter, the district court can only make these determinations de\xc2\xa0novo because it is the first tribunal to hear the evidence in question.  Furthermore, a de\xc2\xa0novo standard adheres to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s instruction in Butterworth that an R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa04915 proceeding be heard \xe2\x80\x9cupon the whole merits\xe2\x80\x9d and conducted \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  112 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 61.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough we reject the Director\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for a stricter evidentiary rule and an elevated standard of review in \xc2\xa7145 proceedings, we agree with the Federal Circuit that the district court may, in its discretion, \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the proceedings before and findings of the Patent Office in deciding what weight to afford an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s newly-admitted evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  625 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1335.  Though the PTO has special expertise in evaluating patent applications, the district court cannot meaningfully defer to the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings if the PTO considered a different set of facts.  Supra, at 8; cf. Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 19) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cif the PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment may lose significant force\xe2\x80\x9d).  For this reason, we conclude that the proper means for the district court to accord respect to decisions of the PTO is through the court\xe2\x80\x99s broad discretion over the weight to be given to evidence newly adduced in the \xc2\xa7145 proceedings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Director warns that allowing the district court to consider all admissible evidence and to make de\xc2\xa0novo findings will encourage patent applicants to withhold evidence from the PTO intentionally with the goal of pre- senting that evidence for the first time to a nonexpert judge.  Brief for Petitioner 23.  We find that scenario unlikely.  An applicant who pursues such a strategy would be intentionally undermining his claims before the PTO on the speculative chance that he will gain some advantage in the \xc2\xa7145 proceeding by presenting new evidence to a district court judge.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, we conclude that there are no limitations on a patent applicant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to introduce new evidence in a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding beyond those already present in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Moreover, if new evidence is presented on a disputed question of fact, the district court must make de\xc2\xa0novo factual findings that take account of both the new evidence and the administrative record before the PTO.  In light of these conclusions, the Federal Circuit was correct to vacate the judgment of the District Court, which excluded newly presented evidence under the view that it \xe2\x80\x9cneed not consider evidence negligently submitted after the end of administrative proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Civ.

S. 4915) proceeding as \xe2\x80\x9ca suit according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure\xe2\x80\x9d); In\xc2\xa0re Hien, \n\n166 U.\xc2\xa0S. 432, \n438 (1897)\n (same); In\xc2\xa0re Squire, 22 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 1015, 1016 (No. 13,269) (CC ED Mo. 1877) (in an R. S. 4915 proceeding, the parties were \xe2\x80\x9cat liberty to introduce additional evidence\xe2\x80\x9d under \xe2\x80\x9cthe rules and practice of a court of equity\xe2\x80\x9d); ante, at 10, 12, n.\xc2\xa04 (citing same cases).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsistent with ordinary equity practice and procedure, there may be situations in which a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct before the PTO calls into question the propriety of admitting evidence presented for the first time in a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding before a district court.  The most well-known example was presented in Barrett Co. v. Koppers Co., 22 F. 2d 395, 396 (CA3 1927), a case in which the Barrett Company, during proceedings before the Patent Office, \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly refused to disclose and to allow their witnesses to answer questions\xe2\x80\x9d essential to establishing the priority of its invention.  After the Patent Office ruled against it, the Barrett Company attempted to present in a subsequent R. S. 4915 proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cthe very subject-matter concerning which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. witnesses for the [patent] application were asked questions and the Barrett Company forbade them to answer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 396.  The Third Circuit understandably found the Barrett Company estopped from introducing evidence that it had \xe2\x80\x9cpurposely\xe2\x80\x9d withheld from prior factfinders, lest the company be allowed \xe2\x80\x9cto profit by [its] own .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. wrong doing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 397.  See also Dowling v. Jones, 67 F. 2d 537, 538 (CA2 1933) (L. Hand, J.) (describing Barrett as a case in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe Third Circuit refused to consider evidence which the inventor had deliberately suppressed\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons the Court articulates, \xc2\xa7145 proceedings are not limited to the administrative record developed be-fore the PTO and applicants are entitled to present new evidence to the district court.  Accordingly, as Judge Hand suggested, a court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable authority to exclude evidence in such proceedings is limited, and must be exercised with caution.  See Dowling, 67 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 538 (describing as \xe2\x80\x9cdoubtful\xe2\x80\x9d the proposition that a court should exclude evidence that was \xe2\x80\x9cnot suppressed, but merely neglected\xe2\x80\x9d before the Patent Office).  Thus, when a patent applicant fails to present evidence to the PTO due to ordinary negligence, a lack of foresight, or simple attorney error, the applicant should not be estopped from presenting the evidence for the first time in a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause there is no suggestion here that the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present the evidence in question to the PTO was anything other than the product of negligence or a lack of foresight, I agree that the applicant was entitled to present his additional evidence to the District Court.  But I do not understand today\xe2\x80\x99s decision to foreclose a district court\xe2\x80\x99s authority, consistent with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 13 (quoting Butterworth, 112 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 61), to exclude evidence \xe2\x80\x9cdeliber-ately suppressed\xe2\x80\x9d from the PTO or otherwise withheld in bad faith.  For the reasons set out by the Court, see ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, an applicant has little to gain by such tactics; such cases will therefore be rare.  In keeping with longstanding historical practice, however, I understand courts to retain their ordinary authority to exclude evidence from a \xc2\xa7145 proceeding when its admission would be inconsistent with regular equity practice and procedure.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith those observations, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in full.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
