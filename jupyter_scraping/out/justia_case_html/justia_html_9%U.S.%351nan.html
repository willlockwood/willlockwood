CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p>It is admitted by the counsel in this case that a bond cannot be delivered to the obligee as an escrow.  But it is contended that where there are several obligees constituting a co-partnership, it may be delivered as an escrow to one of the firm.  The Court, however, is of opinion that a delivery to one is a delivery to all.  It can never be necessary to the validity of a bond that all the obligees should be convened together at the delivery.</p>\n<p>Upon the other point, the counsel for the plaintiff in error has insisted that the plea is sufficient.</p>\n<p>But the Court thinks it so radically defective as to be bad even upon general demurrer.</p>\n<p>There is no allegation of fraud, and the circumstances pleaded do not in themselves amount to fraud.</p>\n<p>Fraud consists in intention, and that intention is a fact which ought to have been averred, for it is the gist of the plea, and would have been traversable.</p>\n<p>Upon what was the plaintiff below to take issue?  Upon all the circumstances stated in the plea which are mere inducement, or upon the conclusion that "the bond is void?"  If he had traversed the inducement, the issue would have been immaterial: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="158">Page 9 U. S. 158</a></p><p> if he had traversed the conclusion, it would have been putting in issue to the jury matter of law.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
