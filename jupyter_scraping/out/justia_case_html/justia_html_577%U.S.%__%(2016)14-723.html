Here, petitioner Montanile was seriously injured by a drunk driver, and his ERISA plan paid more than $120,000 for his medical expenses.  Montanile later sued the drunk driver, obtaining a $500,000 settlement.  Pursuant to the plan\xe2\x80\x99s subrogation clause, respondent plan administrator (the Board of Trustees of the National Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan, or Board), sought reimbursement from the settlement.

Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, whether the remedy a plaintiff seeks \xe2\x80\x9cis legal or equitable depends on [(1)] the basis for [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] claim and [(2)] the nature of the underlying remedies sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sereboff</i> v. <i>Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc.</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356,\n363 (2006)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Our precedents also prescribe a framework for resolving this inquiry.  To determine how to characterize the basis of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim and the nature of the remedies sought, we turn to standard treatises on equity, which establish the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic contours\xe2\x80\x9d of what equitable relief was typically available in premerger equity courts.  <i>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins.

But our cases do not resolve whether the <i>remedy</i> the Board now seeks\xe2\x80\x94enforcement of an equitable lien by agreement against the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s general assets\xe2\x80\x94is equitable in nature.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>First, in <i>Great-West</i>, we held that a plan with a claim for an equitable lien was\xe2\x80\x94in the circumstances presented- seeking a legal rather than an equitable remedy.  In that case, a plan sought to enforce an equitable lien by obtaining a money judgment from the defendants.  The plan could not enforce the lien against the third-party settlement that the defendants had obtained because the defendants never actually possessed that fund; the fund went directly to the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys and to a restricted trust.  We held that the plan sought a legal rem-edy, not an equitable one, even though the plan claimed that the money judgment was a form of restitution.  <i>Id.</i>, at 208\xe2\x80\x93209, 213\xe2\x80\x93214.  We explained that restitution in equity typically involved enforcement of \xe2\x80\x9ca constructive trust or an equitable lien, where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 213.  But the restitution sought in <i>Great-West</i> was legal\xe2\x80\x94not equitable\xe2\x80\x94because the specific funds to which the fiduciaries \xe2\x80\x9cclaim[ed] an entitlement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [we]re not in [the defendants\xe2\x80\x99] possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 214.  Since both the basis for the claim and the particular remedy sought were not equitable, the plan could not sue under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Next, in <i>Sereboff</i>, we held that both the basis for the claim and the remedy sought were equitable.  The plan there sought reimbursement from beneficiaries who had retained their settlement fund in a separate account.  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 359\xe2\x80\x93360.  We held that the basis for the plan\xe2\x80\x99s claim was equitable because the plan sought to enforce an equitable lien by agreement, a type of equitable lien created by an agreement to convey a particular fund to another party.  See <i>id.,</i> at 363\xe2\x80\x93364.  The lien existed in <i>Sereboff</i> because of the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 agreement with the plan to convey the proceeds of any third-party settlement.  We explained that a claim to enforce such a lien is equitable because the plan \xe2\x80\x9ccould rely on a familiar rul[e] of equity\xe2\x80\x9d to collect\xe2\x80\x94specifically, the rule \xe2\x80\x9cthat a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).  The underlying remedies that the plan sought also were equitable, because the plan \xe2\x80\x9csought specifically identifiable funds that were within the possession and control\xe2\x80\x9d of the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x94not recovery from the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cassets generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 362\xe2\x80\x93363 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, in <i>US Airways, Inc. </i>v. <i>McCutchen</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), we reaffirmed our analysis in <i>Sereboff</i> and again concluded that a plan sought to enforce an equitable claim by seeking equitable remedies.  As in <i>Sereboff</i>,<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cthe basis for [the plan\xe2\x80\x99s] claim was equitable\xe2\x80\x9d because the plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms created an equitable lien by agreement on a third-party settlement.  See 569 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And, as in <i>Sereboff</i>, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he nature of the recovery requested\xe2\x80\x9d by the plan \xe2\x80\x9cwas equitable because [it] claimed specifically identifiable funds within the [beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99] control\xe2\x80\x94that is, a portion of the settlement they had gotten.\xe2\x80\x9d  569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under these principles, the basis for the Board\xe2\x80\x99s claim here is equitable: The Board had an equitable lien by agreement that attached to Montanile\xe2\x80\x99s settlement fund when he obtained title to that fund.  And the nature of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s underlying <i>remedy</i> would have been equitable had it immediately sued to enforce the lien against the settlement fund then in Montanile\xe2\x80\x99s possession.  That does not resolve this case, however.  Our prior cases do not address whether a plan is still seeking an equitable remedy when the defendant, who once<i> </i>possessed the settlement fund, has dissipated it all, and the plan then seeks to recover out of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s general assets.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><b>To resolve this issue, we turn to standard equity trea-tises.  As we explain below, those treatises make clear that a plaintiff could ordinarily enforce an equitable lien only against specifically identified funds that remain in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s possession or against traceable items that the defendant purchased with the funds (<i>e.g., </i>identifiable property like a car).  A defendant\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of the entire identifiable fund on nontraceable items (like food or travel) destroys an equitable lien.

The plaintiff could not attach the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s general assets instead because those assets were not part of the specific thing to which the lien attached.  This rule applied to equitable liens by agreement as well as other types of equitable liens.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><b>The Board of Trustees nonetheless maintains that it can enforce its equitable lien against Montanile\xe2\x80\x99s general assets.  We consider the Board\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in turn.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">First, the Board argues that, while equity courts ordinarily required plaintiffs to trace a specific, identifiable fund in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s possession to which the lien attached, there is an exception for equitable liens by agreement.  The Board asserts that equitable liens by agreement require no such tracing, and can be enforced against a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s general assets.  According to the Board, we  recognized this exception in <i>Sereboff</i> by distinguishing between equitable restitution (where a lien attaches because the defendant misappropriated property from the plaintiff\xc2\xa0) and equitable liens by agreement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Board misreads <i>Sereboff</i>, which left untouched the rule that <i>all</i> types of equitable liens must be enforced against a specifically identified fund in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s possession.  See 1 Dobbs \xc2\xa74.3(3), at 601, 603.  The question we faced in <i>Sereboff </i>was whether plaintiffs seeking an equitable lien by agreement must \xe2\x80\x9cidentify an asset they originally possessed, which was improperly acquired and converted into property the defendant held.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 365.  We observed that such a requirement, although characteristic of restitutionary relief, does not  \xe2\x80\x9cappl[y] to equitable liens by agreement or assignment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (discussing <i>Barnes </i>v. <i>Alexander</i>,\n\n232 U.\xc2\xa0S. 117 (1914)\n).  That is because the basic premise of an equitable lien by agreement is that, rather than physically taking the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s property, the defendant constructively possesses a fund to which the plaintiff is entitled.  But the plaintiff must still identify a specific fund in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s possession to enforce the lien.  See <i>id.</i>, at 123 (\xe2\x80\x9cHaving a lien upon the fund, as soon as it was identified they could follow it into the hands of the appellant\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><b>Second, the Board contends that historical equity practice supports enforcement of its equitable lien against Montanile\xe2\x80\x99s general assets.  The Board identifies three methods that equity courts purportedly employed to effectuate this principle: substitute money decrees, deficiency judgments, and the swollen assets doctrine.  This argument also fails.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>We have long rejected the argument that \xe2\x80\x9cequitable relief\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) means \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever relief a court of equity is empowered to provide in the particular case atissue,\xe2\x80\x9d including ancillary legal remedies.  <i>Mertens, </i>508 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 256.  In \xe2\x80\x9cmany situations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an equity court could establish purely legal rights and grant legal remedies which would otherwise be beyond the scope of its authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).  But these legal remedies were not relief \xe2\x80\x9ctypically available in equity,\xe2\x80\x9d and interpreting them as such would eliminate any limit on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cequitable relief\xe2\x80\x9d and would \xe2\x80\x9crender the modifier superfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 256, 258 (emphasis deleted); see also <i>Great-West</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 210.  As we have explained\xe2\x80\x94and as the Board conceded at oral argument\xe2\x80\x94as a general rule, plaintiffs cannot enforce an equitable lien against a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s general assets.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <i>supra</i>.  The Board contends that there is an exception if the defendant wrongfully dissipates the equitable lien to thwart its enforcement.  But none of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s examples show that such relief was \xe2\x80\x9ctypically available\xe2\x80\x9d in equity.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The specific methods by which equity courts might have awarded relief from a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s general assets only confirm that the Board seeks legal, not equitable, remedies.  While equity courts sometimes awarded money decrees as a substitute for the value of the equitable lien, they were still legal remedies, because they were \xe2\x80\x9cwholly pecuniary and personal.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Pomeroy \xc2\xa71234, at 694.  The same is true with respect to deficiency judgments.  Equity courts could award both of these remedies as part of their ancillary jurisdiction to award complete relief.  But the treatises make clear that when equity courts did so, \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights of the parties are strictly legal, and the final remedy granted is of the kind which might be conferred by a court of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 <i>id.</i>, \xc2\xa7231, at 410; see also 1 Dobbs \xc2\xa72.7, at 180\xe2\x80\x93181, and \xc2\xa74.3(3), at 602 (similar); New Federal Equity Rules 10 (rev. 5th ed. 1925) (authorizing equity courts to award such relief).<b> </b>But legal remedies\xe2\x80\x94even legal remedies that a court of equity could sometimes award\xe2\x80\x94are not \xe2\x80\x9cequitable relief\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).  See <i>Mertens</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 256\xe2\x80\x93258.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>The swollen assets doctrine also does not establish that the relief the Board seeks is equitable.  Under the Board\xe2\x80\x99s view of this doctrine, even if a defendant spends all of a specifically identified fund, the mere fact that the defendant wrongfully had assets that belonged to another increased the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s available assets, and justifies recovery from his general assets.  But most equity courts and treatises rejected that theory.   See Taft, Note, A Defense of a Limited Use of the Swollen Assets Theory Where Money Has Wrongfully Been Mingled With Other Money, 39 Colum. L. Rev. 172, 175 (1939) (describing the swollen assets doctrine as \xe2\x80\x9coften .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. rejected by the courts\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Oesterle, Deficiencies of the Restitutionary Right to Trace Misappropriated Property in Equity and in UCC \xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x93306, 68 Cornell L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 172, 189, and n.\xc2\xa033 (1983)<i> </i>(similar).  To the extent that courts endorsed any version of the swollen assets theory, they adopted a more limited rule: that commingling a specifically identified fund\xe2\x80\x94to which a lien attached\xe2\x80\x94with a different fund of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s did not destroy the lien.  Instead, that commingling allowed the plaintiff to recover the amount of the lien from the entire pot of money.  See Restatement \xc2\xa7209, at 844; Scott, The Right To Follow Money Wrong-fully Mingled With Other Money, 27 Harv. L. Rev. 125, 125\xe2\x80\x93126 (1913).  Thus, even under the version of the swollen assets doctrine adopted by some courts, recovery out of Montanile\xe2\x80\x99s general assets\xe2\x80\x94in the absence of commingling\xe2\x80\x94would not have been \xe2\x80\x9ctypically available\xe2\x80\x9d relief.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><b>Finally, the Board argues that ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives\xe2\x80\x94of enforcing plan documents according to their terms and of protecting plan assets\xe2\x80\x94would be best served by allowing plans to enforce equitable liens against a participant\xe2\x80\x99s general assets.  The Board also contends that, unless plans can enforce reimbursement provisions against a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s general assets, plans will lack effective or cost-efficient remedies, and participants will dissipate any settlement as quickly as possible, before fiduciaries can sue.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have rejected these arguments before, and do so again.  \xe2\x80\x9c[\xc2\xa0V\xc2\xa0]ague notions of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98basic purpose\xe2\x80\x99 are .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. inadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding the <i>specific </i>issue under consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mertens</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 261.  Had Congress sought to prioritize the Board\xe2\x80\x99s policy arguments, it could have drafted \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) to mirror ERISA provisions governing civil actions.  One of those provisions, for instance, allows participants and beneficiaries to bring civil actions \xe2\x80\x9cto enforce [their] rights under the terms of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d and does not limit them to equitable relief.  <i>Great-West</i>, 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 221 (quoting\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B) (1994 ed.)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, our interpretation of \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) promotes ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes by \xe2\x80\x9callocat[ing] liability for plan-related misdeeds in reasonable proportion to respective actors\xe2\x80\x99 power to control and prevent the misdeeds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mertens</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 262.<i> </i>More than a decade has passed since we decided <i>Great-West</i>, and plans have developed safeguards against participants\xe2\x80\x99 and beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to evade reimbursement obligations.  Plans that cover medical expenses know how much medical care that participants and beneficiaries require, and have the incentive to investigate and track expensive claims.  Plan provisions\xe2\x80\x94like the ones here\xe2\x80\x94obligate participants and beneficiaries to notify the plan of legal process against third parties and to give the plan a right of subrogation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Board protests that tracking and participating in legal proceedings is hard and costly, and that settlements are often shrouded in secrecy.  The facts of this case undercut that argument.  The Board had sufficient notice of Montanile\xe2\x80\x99s settlement to have taken various steps to preserve those funds.  Most notably, when negotiations broke down and Montanile\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer expressed his intent to disburse the remaining settlement funds to Montanile unless the plan objected within 14 days, the Board could have\xe2\x80\x94but did not\xe2\x80\x94object.
