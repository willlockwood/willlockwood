His counsel moved to stay the proceedings, contending that Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 mental incompetence prevented him from rationally communicating with or assisting counsel, and that Gonzales was thus entitled to a stay because, under the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s Rohan decision, what is now \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599(a)(2) requires a stay when a petitioner is adjudged incompetent.  The District Court denied a stay, finding that the claims before it were record based or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 input.  Gonzales thereafter sought a writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit.  Applying Rohan and its recent decision in Nash\xe2\x80\x94which gave habeas petitioners a right to competence even on record-based appeals\xe2\x80\x94the court granted the writ, concluding that \xc2\xa73599 gave Gonzales the right to a stay pending a competency determination.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent Sean Carter, a death row inmate in Ohio, initiated federal habeas proceedings but eventually moved for a competency determination and stay of the proceedings.  The District Court granted the motion and found Carter incompetent to assist counsel.  Applying the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s Rohan test, it determined that Carter\xe2\x80\x99s assistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims.  It thus dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively tolled the statute of limitations.  On appeal, the Sixth Circuit, relying in part on Rees v. Peyton, \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 312\n (Rees I), located a statutory right to competence in \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74241, and found that a court could employ that provision whenever a capital habeas petitioner seeks to forgo his petition.  It thus ordered that Carter\xe2\x80\x99s petition be stayed indefinitely with respect to any claims requiring his assistance.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0Section 3599 does not provide a state prisoner a right to suspension of his federal habeas proceedings when he is adjudged incompetent.

Section 3599 guarantees federal habeas petitioners on death row the right to federally funded counsel, \xc2\xa73599(a)(2), and sets out various requirements that appointed counsel must meet, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73599(b)\xe2\x80\x93(e), but it does not direct district courts to stay proceedings when petitioners are found incompetent.  The assertion is also difficult to square with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional precedents.  If the \n \nSixth Amendment right carried with it an implied right to competence, the right to competence at trial would flow from that Amendment, not from the right to due process, see Cooper v. Oklahoma, \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 348\n.  But while the benefits flowing from the right to counsel at trial could be affected if an incompetent defendant is unable to communicate with his attorney, this Court has never said that the right to competence derives from the right to counsel.  And the Court will not assume or infer that Congress intended to depart from such precedent and locate a right to competence in federal habeas proceedings within the right to counsel.

But given the backward-looking, record-based nature of \xc2\xa72254 proceedings, counsel can generally provide effective representation to a habeas petitioner regardless of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s competence.  Rees I, supra, Rees v. Peyton, \n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 989\n, and Rees v. Superintendent of the Va. State Penitentiary, 516 U.\xc2\xa0S 802, which involved an incompetent death row inmate\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to withdraw his certiorari petition, offer no support for federal habeas petitioners seeking to stay district court proceedings or for the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinions in Rohan, Nash, or this case.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is also not supported by McFarland v. Scott, \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 849\n, in which this Court held that a district court could stay an execution after a capital prisoner had invoked his right to counsel but before he had filed his habeas petition.  In contrast, Gonzales is seeking to stay the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings, and he sought a stay more than six years after initiating his habeas petition, certainly ample time for his attorney to research and present the claims.

The Sixth Circuit based its conclusion largely on a misreading of Rees I, which did not recognize such a right.  Moreover, \xc2\xa74241 does not even apply to habeas proceedings.  By its terms, it applies only to trial proceedings prior to sentencing and \xe2\x80\x9cat any time after the commencement of probation or supervised release.\xe2\x80\x9d  Federal habeas proceedings, however, commence after sentencing, and federal habeas petitioners are incarcerated, not on probation.  Furthermore, \xc2\xa74241, like the rest of Title 18 generally, applies exclusively to federal defendants, not to state prisoners like Carter.  Finally, \xc2\xa74241(a) authorizes a district court to grant a motion for a competency determination if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental incompetence renders him \xe2\x80\x9cunable to understand .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense,\xe2\x80\x9d while a \xc2\xa72254 habeas proceeding is a civil action against a state-prison warden, in which the petitioner collaterally attacks his conviction in an earlier state trial.

In Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying a stay after finding that Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 claims were all record based or resolvable as a matter of law, regardless of his competence.  Review of a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s record-based claims subject to \xc2\xa72254(d) is limited to the record before the state court that heard the case on the merits.  Any evidence that Gonzales might have would be inadmissible.  In Carter\xe2\x80\x99s case, three of his claims do not warrant a stay because they were adjudicated on the merits in state postconviction proceedings and thus subject to review under \xc2\xa72254(d).  Thus, extrarecord evidence that he might have concerning these claims would be inadmissible.  It is unclear from the record whether he exhausted his fourth claim.  If it was exhausted, it too would be record based.  But even if it was both unexhausted and not procedurally defaulted, an indefinite stay would be inappropriate, since such a stay would permit petitioners to \xe2\x80\x9cfrustrate [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\xe2\x80\x99s] goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rhines v.

The convictions arose from Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 repeated stabbing of Darrel and Deborah Wagner in front of their 7-year-old son during a burglary of the Wagners\xe2\x80\x99 home.  Darrel Wagner died from the stabbing, while Deborah Wagner survived but spent five days in intensive care.  The trial court sentenced Gonzales to death on the murder charge and to various prison terms for the other crimes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter exhausting state remedies, Gonzales filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court on November 15, 1999.  While the petition was pending, Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 appointed counsel moved to stay the proceedings, contending that Gonzales was no longer capable of rationally communicating with or assisting counsel.  He argued that mental incompetence entitled Gonzales to a stay under Ninth Circuit precedent.  See Rohan v. Woodford, 334 F.\xc2\xa03d 803 (2003).  In Rohan, the Ninth Circuit held that the federal statute guaranteeing state capital prisoners a right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings, \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7848(q)(4)(B) (2000 ed.) (now codified as \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599(a)(2)), could not \xe2\x80\x9cbe faithfully enforced unless courts ensure that a petitioner is competent,\xe2\x80\x9d 334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 813.  Rohan thus concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere an incompetent capital habeas petitioner raises claims that could potentially benefit from his ability to communicate rationally, refusing to stay proceedings pending restoration of competence denies him his statutory right to assistance of counsel, whether or not counsel can identify with precision the information sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 819.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying Rohan, the District Court denied a stay after concluding that the claims properly before it were record based or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 input.  The court found it unnec-essary to determine whether Gonzales was incompetent, though it did find that he possessed \xe2\x80\x9cat least a limited capacity for rational communication.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gonzales v. Schriro, 617 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 849, 863 (Ariz. 2008).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGonzales thereafter filed an emergency petition for a writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit.  While Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 petition was pending, the Ninth Circuit decided Nash v. Ryan, 581 F.\xc2\xa03d 1048 (2009), which held that habeas petitioners have a right to competence on appeal, even though appeals are entirely record based.  Id., at 1050 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhile an appeal is record-based, that does not mean that a habeas petitioner in a capital case is relegated to a nonexistent role.  Meaningful assistance of appellate counsel may require rational communication between counsel and a habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d).  Applying Nash and Rohan, the court granted the writ of mandamus, concluding that even though Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cexhausted claims are record-based or legal in nature, he is entitled to a stay pending a competency determination\xe2\x80\x9d under \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599.

In analyzing that statute, the Rohan court relied on a Ninth Circuit en banc opinion in Calderon v. United\xc2\xa0States Dist. Court for Central Dist. of Cal., 163 F.\xc2\xa03d 530 (1998) (Kelly V), overruled in unrelated part, Woodford v.

The Rohan court purported to be bound by the \xe2\x80\x9crationale\xe2\x80\x9d of Kelly V\xe2\x80\x94that a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s incompetence could \xe2\x80\x9ceviscerate the statutory right to counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t Kelly V, supra, at 541\xe2\x80\x94and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s statutory rights depend on his ability to communicate rationally, compelling him to pursue relief while incompetent is no less an infringement than dismissing his late petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  334 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 814.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe are not persuaded by the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that a habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mental incompetency could \xe2\x80\x9cevis-cerate the statutory right to counsel\xe2\x80\x9d in federal habeas proceedings.  Given the backward-looking, record-based nature of most federal habeas proceedings, counsel can generally provide effective representation to a habeas petitioner regardless of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s competence.  Indeed, where a claim is \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d) (2006 ed.), counsel should, in most circumstances, be able to identify whether the \xe2\x80\x9cadjudication .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), without any evi-dence outside the record.  See Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]eview under [28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits. . . . This backward-looking language requires an examination of the state-court decision at the time it was made.  It follows that the record under review is limited to the record in existence at that same time\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the record before the state court\xe2\x80\x9d).

In Rees I, a state inmate on death row filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in District Court, alleging that the state-court conviction violated his constitutional rights.  384 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 313.  The District Court denied his petition, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Ibid.  Shortly after Rees\xe2\x80\x99 counsel filed a petition for certiorari with this Court, Rees directed his counsel to withdraw the petition and to forgo any further proceedings.  Counsel advised the Court that he could not accede to these instructions without a psychiatric evaluation of Rees, because there was some doubt as to Rees\xe2\x80\x99 mental competency.  Ibid.  In response, the Court directed the District Court to determine Rees\xe2\x80\x99 mental competence.  Id., at 313\xe2\x80\x93314.  After the District Court conducted a hearing and found Rees incompetent, the Court issued a one-sentence order directing that the petition for certiorari be \xe2\x80\x9cheld without action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rees v.

This conclusion is unwarranted.  Rees I concerned whether an incompetent habeas petitioner may withdraw his certiorari petition, and it provides no clear answer even to that question.  Likewise, the unique, one-sentence order in Rees II offered no rationale for the decision to hold Rees\xe2\x80\x99 petition.  As a result, Rees offers no support for federal habeas petitioners seeking to stay district court proceedings or for the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinions in Rohan, Nash, or this case.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGonzales barely defends the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa73599.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  He offers a single, halfhearted argument in support of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion based on our statement in McFarland v. Scott, \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 849, \n858 (1994)\n, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to counsel necessarily includes a right for that counsel meaningfully to research and present a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s habeas claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  But McFarland was addressing whether a district court could issue a stay of execution after a capital prisoner had filed a request for counsel but before he had filed his habeas petition.  Id., at 854\xe2\x80\x93858.  We held that a district court may stay a capital prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s execution once the prisoner has invoked his statutory right to counsel.  Id., at 859.  McFarland has no relevance here where Gonzales is not seeking a stay of execution, but rather a stay of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings.  Moreover, Gonzales moved for a stay more than six years after initiating his habeas petition.  This was certainly ample time for his attorney to research and present the claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that \xc2\xa73599 does not provide federal habeas petitioners with a \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory right\xe2\x80\x9d to competence.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit reached the same conclusion as the Ninth Circuit but located the statutory right to competence during habeas proceedings in \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74241.  Relying largely on Rees I, the Sixth Circuit concluded that \xc2\xa74241 provides a statutory right to competence.  644 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 333.  But as discussed, Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, supra, Rees I did not recognize a statutory right to competence in federal ha-beas proceedings.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Moreover, \xc2\xa74241 does not even apply to such proceedings.

The court shall grant the motion, or shall order such a hearing on its own motion, if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suf-fering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tBy its own terms, \xc2\xa74241 applies only to trial proceedings prior to sentencing and \xe2\x80\x9cat any time after the commencement of probation or supervised release.\xe2\x80\x9d  Federal habeas proceedings, however, commence after sentencing, and federal habeas petitioners, by definition, are incarcerated, not on probation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurthermore, \xc2\xa74241, like the rest of Title 18 generally, applies exclusively to federal defendants and probationers subject to prosecution by the United States.
