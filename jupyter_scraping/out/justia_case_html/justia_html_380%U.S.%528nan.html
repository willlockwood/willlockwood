CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We are called upon in this case to construe, for the first time, the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States:</p>\n<p>"The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax."</p>\n<p>The precise issue is whether \xc2\xa7 24-17.2 of the Virginia Code -- which provides that, in order to qualify to vote in federal elections, one must either pay a poll tax or file a witnessed or notarized certificate of residence [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] -- contravenes this command. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="530">Page 380 U. S. 530</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Prior to the adoption of the Twenty-fourth Amendment, the Virginia Constitution (Art. II, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 18-20) and statutes (Va.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 24-17, 24-67 (1950)) established uniform standards for qualification for voting in both federal and state elections.  The requirements were:  (1) United States citizenship; (2) a minimum age of twenty-one; (3) residence in the State for one year, in the city or county for six months, and in the voting precinct for thirty days; and (4) payment</p>\n<p>"at least six months prior to any election . . . to the proper officer all State </p><p><a class="page-number" name="531">Page 380 U. S. 531</a></p><p> poll taxes ($1.50 annually) assessed or assessable against him for three years next preceding . . . such election. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]"</p>\n<p>The statutes further provided for permanent registration. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Once registered, the voters could qualify for elections in subsequent years merely by paying the poll taxes.</p>\n<p>In 1963, in anticipation of the promulgation of the Twenty-fourth Amendment, the Governor of Virginia convened a special session of the Virginia General Assembly.  On November 21 of that year, the General Assembly enacted two Acts [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] designed</p>\n<p>"(1) to enable persons to register and vote in federal elections without the payment of poll tax or other tax, as required by the 24th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, (2) to continue in effect in all other elections the present registration and voting requirements of the Constitution of Virginia, and (3) to provide methods by which all persons registered to vote in federal or other elections may prove that they meet the residence requirements of \xc2\xa7 18 of the Constitution of Virginia. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]"</p>\n<p>"No changes were made with regard to qualification for voting in state elections.  With regard to federal elections, however, the payment of a poll tax as an absolute prerequisite to registration and voting was eliminated, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="532">Page 380 U. S. 532</a></p><p> and a provision was added requiring the federal voter to file a certificate of residence in each election year or, at his option, to pay the customary poll taxes.  The statute provides that the certificate of residence must be filed no earlier than October 1 of the year immediately preceding that in which the voter desires to vote, and not later than six months prior to the election.  The voter must state in the certificate (which must be notarized or witnessed) his present address, that he is currently a resident of Virginia, that he has been a resident since the date of his registration, and that he does not presently intend to remove from the city or county of which he is a resident prior to the next general election.  Va.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 24-17.2 (1964 Supp.).  Thus, as a result of the 1963 Acts, a citizen, after registration, may vote in both federal and state elections upon the payment of all assessable poll taxes.  Va.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 24-17 (1964 Supp.).  If he has not paid such taxes, he cannot vote in state elections, and may vote in federal elections only upon filing a certificate of residence in each election year.  Va.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 24-17.1, 24-17.2 (1964 Supp.)."</p>\n<p>The present appeal originated as two separate class actions, brought by appellees in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, attacking the foregoing provisions of the 1963 Virginia legislation as violative of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution of the United States, and the Fourteenth, Seventeenth, and Twenty-fourth Amendments thereto.  The complaints, which prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief, named as defendants (appellants here) the three members of the Virginia State Board of Elections and, in one case, the County Treasurer of Roanoke County, Virginia, and, in the other, the Director of Finance of Fairfax County.  The jurisdiction of the District Court was invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1331, 1343, 2201 (1958 ed.), and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="533">Page 380 U. S. 533</a></p><p> a court of three judges was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2281, 2284 (1958 ed.).</p>\n<p>The District Court denied the State\'s motion to stay the proceedings in order to give the Virginia courts an opportunity to resolve the issues and interpret the statutes involved.  The court further denied the State\'s motions to dismiss for failure to join indispensable parties, for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, and for want of a justiciable controversy. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  On the merits, the District Court held that the certificate of residence requirement was "a distinct qualification," or at least an "increase [in] the quantum of necessary proof of residence" imposed solely on the federal voter, and that it therefore violated Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, and the Seventeenth Amendment, which provide that electors choosing a Representative or Senator in the Congress of the United States "shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature."  The court rejected the argument that the residency certificate was merely a method, like the poll tax, of proving the residence qualification which is imposed on both federal and state voters.  Accordingly, the District Court entered an order declaring invalid the portions of the 1963 Virginia legislation which required the filing of a certificate of residence and enjoining appellants from requiring compliance by a voter with said portions of the 1963 Acts.  We noted probable jurisdiction.  379 U.S. 810.</p>\n<p>We hold that \xc2\xa7 24-17.2 is repugnant to the Twenty-fourth Amendment, and affirm the decision of the District </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 380 U. S. 534</a></p><p> Court on that basis.  We therefore find it unnecessary to determine whether that section violates Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, and the Seventeenth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>At the outset, we are faced with the State\'s contention that the District Court should have stayed the proceedings until the courts of Virginia had been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass on underlying issues of state law and to construe the statutes involved.  We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>In applying the doctrine of abstention, a federal district court is vested with discretion to decline to exercise or to postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction in deference to state court resolution of underlying issues of state law.  <em>Railroad Comm\'n v. Pullman Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/case.html">312 U. S. 496</a></span>. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Where resolution of the federal constitutional question is dependent upon, or may be materially altered by, the determination of an uncertain issue of state law, abstention may be proper in order to avoid unnecessary friction in federal-state relations, interference with important state functions, tentative decisions on questions of state law, and premature constitutional adjudication.  <em>E.g., Railroad Comm\'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., supra.</em>  The doctrine, however, contemplates that deference to state court adjudication only be made where the issue of state law is uncertain.  <em>Davis v.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  While the State suggests that the Virginia tribunals are</p>\n<p>"unquestionably far better equipped than the lower [federal] court to unravel the skeins of local law and administrative practices in which the Appellees\' claims are entangled, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] the State </p><p><a class="page-number" name="536">Page 380 U. S. 536</a></p><p> does not point to any provision in the legislation which leaves"</p>\n<p>"reasonable room for a construction by the Virginia courts which might avoid in whole or in part the necessity for federal constitutional adjudication, or at least materially change the nature of the problem."</p>\n<p><em>Harrison v. NAACP,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/167/case.html">360 U. S. 167</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/167/case.html#177">360 U. S. 177</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In spite of the clarity of the 1963 legislation, the State argues that the District Court should have abstained on the ground that, if the certificate of residence requirement were found to be a qualification distinct from those specified in the Virginia Constitution, it would be invalid as a matter of Virginia law, and "a crucial federal constitutional issue would accordingly disappear from the case."  We find little force in this argument.  The section of the Virginia Constitution (Art. II, \xc2\xa7 18) on which the State relies expressly limits the franchise to citizens who have met certain residency requirements. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The statute in issue, \xc2\xa7 24-17.2, requires the voter to certify that he meets those residence requirements.  It is thus difficult to envisage how \xc2\xa7 24-17.2 could be construed as setting forth a qualification not found in the Virginia Constitution. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 380 U. S. 537</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In addition to the clarity of the Virginia statutes, support for the District Court\'s refusal to stay the proceedings is found in the nature of the constitutional deprivation alleged and the probable consequences of abstaining.  <em>Griffin v.

The District Court was faced with two class actions attacking a statutory scheme allegedly impairing the right to vote in violation of Art.

As this Court has stressed on numerous occasions,</p>\n<p>"[t]he right to vote freely for the candidate of one\'s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government."</p>\n<p><em>Reynolds v.

In appraising the motion to stay proceedings, the District Court was thus faced with a claimed impairment of the fundamental civil rights of a broad class of citizens.  The motion was heard about two months prior to the deadline for meeting the statutory requirements and just eight months before the 1964 general elections.  Given the importance and immediacy of the problem, and the delay inherent in referring questions of state law to state tribunals, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] it is evident that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to abstain.  <em>Griffin v.

[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 380 U. S. 538</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Reaching the merits, it is important to emphasize that the question presented is not whether it would be within a State\'s power to abolish entirely the poll tax and require all voters -- state and federal -- to file annually a certificate of residence.  Rather, the issue here is whether the State of Virginia may constitutionally confront the federal voter with a requirement that he either pay the customary poll taxes as required for state elections or file a certificate of residence.  We conclude that this requirement constitutes an abridgment of the right to vote in federal elections in contravention of the Twenty-fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Prior to the proposal of the Twenty-fourth Amendment in 1962, federal legislation to eliminate poll taxes, either by constitutional amendment or statute, had been introduced in every Congress since 1939.  The House of Representatives passed anti-poll tax bills on five occasions and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 380 U. S. 539</a></p><p> the Senate twice proposed constitutional amendments. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Even though, in 1962, only five States retained the poll tax as a voting requirement, Congress reflected widespread national concern with the characteristics of the tax. Disenchantment with the poll tax was many-faceted. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  One of the basic objections to the poll tax was that it exacted a price for the privilege of exercising the franchise.  Congressional hearings and debates indicate a general repugnance to the disenfranchisement of the poor occasioned by failure to pay the tax. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>"While it is true that the amount of poll tax now required to be paid in the several States is small, and imposes only a slight economical obstacle for any citizen who desires to qualify in order to vote, nevertheless, it is significant that the voting in poll tax States is relatively low as compared to the overall population which would be eligible. . . .  [T]he historical analysis . . . indicates that, where the poll tax has been abandoned . . . voter participation increased."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep.No.1821, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3.  Another objection to the poll tax raised in the congressional hearings was that the tax usually had to be paid long before the election -- at a time when political campaigns were still quiescent -- which tended to eliminate from the franchise a substantial number of voters who did </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 380 U. S. 540</a></p><p> not plan so far ahead. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The poll tax was also attacked as a vehicle for fraud which could be manipulated by political machines by financing block payments of the tax. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  In addition, and of primary concern to many, the poll tax was viewed as a requirement adopted with an eye to the disenfranchisement of Negroes and applied in a discriminatory manner. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  It is against this background that Congress proposed, and three-fourths of the States ratified, the Twenty-fourth Amendment abolishing the poll tax as a requirement for voting in federal elections.</p>\n<p>Upon adoption of the Amendment, of course, no State could condition the federal franchise upon payment of a poll tax.  The State of Virginia accordingly removed the poll tax as an absolute prerequisite to qualification for voting in federal elections, but, in its stead substituted a provision whereby the federal voter could qualify either by paying the customary poll tax or by filing a certificate of residence six months before the election.</p>\n<p>It has long been established that a State may not impose a penalty upon those who exercise a right guaranteed by the Constitution.  <em>Frost &amp; Frost Trucking Co. v.

Significantly, the Twenty-fourth Amendment does not merely insure that the franchise shall not be "denied" by reason of failure to pay the poll tax; it expressly guarantees that the right to vote shall not be "denied or abridged" for that reason.  Thus, like the Fifteenth Amendment, the Twenty-fourth "nullifies sophisticated, as well as simple-minded modes" of impairing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="541">Page 380 U.

"It hits onerous procedural requirements which effectively handicap exercise of the franchise" by those claiming the constitutional immunity.  <em>Ibid.; cf. Gray v. Johnson,</em> 234 F.Supp. 743 (D.C.S.D.Miss.).</p>\n<p>Thus, in order to demonstrate the invalidity of \xc2\xa7 24-17.2 of the Virginia Code, it need only be shown that it imposes a material requirement solely upon those who refuse to surrender their constitutional right to vote in federal elections without paying a poll tax.  Section 24-17.2 unquestionably erects a real obstacle to voting in federal elections for those who assert their constitutional exemption from the poll tax.  As previously indicated, the requirement for those who wish to participate in federal elections without paying the poll tax is that they file in each election year, within a stated interval ending six months before the election, a notarized or witnessed certificate attesting that they have been continuous residents of the State since the date of registration (which might have been many years before under Virginia\'s system of permanent registration), and that they do not presently intend to leave the city or county in which they reside prior to the forthcoming election.  Unlike the poll tax bill which is sent to the voter\'s residence, it is not entirely clear how one obtains the necessary certificate.  The statutes merely provide for the distribution of the forms to city and county court clerks, and for further distribution to local registrars and election officials.  Va.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 24-28.1 (1964 Supp.).  Construing the statutes in the manner least burdensome to the voter, it would seem that the voter could either obtain the certificate of residence from local election officials or prepare personally "a certificate in form substantially" as set forth in the statute.  The certificate must then be filed "in person, or otherwise" with the city or county treasurer.  This is plainly a cumbersome procedure.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 380 U. S. 542</a></p><p> In effect, it amounts to annual re-registration, which Virginia officials have sharply contrasted with the "simple" poll tax system. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  For many, it would probably seem far preferable to mail in the poll tax payment upon receipt of the bill.  In addition, the certificate must be filed six months before the election, thus perpetuating one of the disenfranchising characteristics of the poll tax which the Twenty-fourth Amendment was designed to eliminate.  We are thus constrained to hold that the requirement imposed upon the voter who refuses to pay the poll tax constitutes an abridgment of his right to vote by reason of failure to pay the poll tax.</p>\n<p>The requirement imposed upon those who reject the poll tax method of qualifying would not be saved even if it could be said that it is no more onerous, or even somewhat less onerous, than the poll tax.  For federal elections, the poll tax is abolished absolutely as a prerequisite to voting, and no equivalent or milder substitute may be imposed.  Any material requirement imposed upon the federal voter solely because of his refusal to waive the constitutional immunity subverts the effectiveness of the Twenty-fourth Amendment, and must fall under its ban.</p>\n<p>Nor may the statutory scheme be saved, as the State asserts, on the ground that the certificate is a necessary substitute method of proving residence, serving the same function as the poll tax.  As this Court has held in analogous situations, constitutional deprivations may not be justified by some remote administrative benefit to the State.  <em>Carrington v. Rash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/89/case.html">380 U.

Moreover, in this case the State has not demonstrated that the alternative requirement is in any sense necessary to the proper administration of its election laws.  The forty-six States which do not require the payment of poll taxes have apparently found no great administrative burden in insuring that the electorate is limited to bona fide residents.  The availability of numerous devices to enforce valid residence requirements -- such as registration, use of the criminal sanction, purging of registration lists, challenges and oaths, public scrutiny by candidates and other interested parties -- demonstrates quite clearly the lack of necessity for imposing a requirement whereby persons desiring to vote in federal elections must either pay a poll tax or file a certificate of residence six months prior to the election.</p>\n<p>The Virginia poll tax was born of a desire to disenfranchise the Negro. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  At the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902, the sponsor of the suffrage plan of which the poll tax was an integral part frankly expressed the purpose of the suffrage proposal:</p>\n<p>"Discrimination!  Why, that is precisely what we propose; that, exactly, is what this Convention was elected for -- to discriminate to the very extremity of permissible action under the limitations of the Federal Constitution, with a view to the elimination of every negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 380 U. S. 544</a></p><p> The poll tax was later characterized by the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals as a device limiting \'the right of suffrage to those who took sufficient interest in the affairs of the State to qualify themselves to vote.\'  <em>Campbell v. Goode,</em> 172 Va. 463, 466, 2 S.E.2d 456, 457.  Whether, as the State contends, the payment of the poll tax is also a reliable indicium of continuing residence need not be decided, for even if the poll tax has served such an evidentiary function, the confrontation of the federal voter with a requirement that he either continue to pay the customary poll tax or file a certificate of residence could not be sustained.  For federal elections, the poll tax, regardless of the services it performs, was abolished by the Twenty-fourth Amendment.  That Amendment was also designed to absolve all requirements impairing the right to vote in federal elections by reason of failure to pay the poll tax.  Section 24-17.2 of the Virginia Code falls within this proscription."</p>\n<p>The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>Mr. Justice HARLAN agrees with this opinion insofar as it rests on the proposition that the Twenty-fourth Amendment forbids the use of a state poll tax for any purpose whatever in determining voter qualifications in all elections for federal office.
