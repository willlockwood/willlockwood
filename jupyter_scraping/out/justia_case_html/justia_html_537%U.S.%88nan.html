In 1996 he filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court advancing several constitutional claims, two of which raised difficult questions. The first challenged the competency of his trial counsel and the second made serious allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. After hearing extensive evidence on both claims, on April 8, 1998, the District Court entered an order granting relief on the first claim, but holding that the second was procedurally barred because it had not been fully exhausted in the state courts. <i>Abdur\'Rahman </i>v. <i>Bell, 999 </i>F. Supp. 1073 (MD Tenn. 1998). The procedural bar resulted from petitioner\'s failure to ask the Supreme Court of Tennessee to review the lower state courts\' refusal to grant relief on the prosecutorial misconduct claim. <i>Id., </i>at 1080-1083.</p><p>The District Court\'s ruling that the claim had not been fully exhausted appeared to be correct under Sixth Circuit precedent 2 and it was consistent with this Court\'s later holding in <i>O\'Sullivan </i>v. <i>Boerckel, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/838/case.html">526 U.

See In re: Order Establishing Rule 39, Rules of the Supreme Court of Tennessee: Exhaustion of Remedies. App. 278.

The proceedings that were thereafter initiated raised the questions the Court now refuses to decide.</p><p>On November 2, 2001, petitioner filed a motion, pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,4 seeking relief from the District Court judgment entered on April 8, 1998. The motion did not assert any new constitutional claims and did not rely on any newly discovered evidence. It merely asked the District Court to set aside its 1998 order terminating the habeas corpus proceeding and to decide the merits of the prosecutorial misconduct claim that had been held to be procedurally barred. The motion relied on the</p><p>respecting a claim of error. Rather, when the claim has been presented to the Court of Criminal Appeals or the Supreme Court, and relief has been denied, the litigant shall be deemed to have exhausted all available state remedies available for that claim."

On January 18, 2002, the Court of Appeals entered an order that endorsed the District Court\'s disposition of the Rule 60(b) motion, specifically including its characterization of the motion as a successive habeas petition. Nos. 98-6568/ 6569, 01-6504 (CA6), p. 2, App. 35, 36. In that order the Court of Appeals stated that the "district court properly found that a Rule 60(b) motion is the equivalent of a successive habeas corpus petition," and then held that Abdur\'Rahman\'s petition did not satisfy the gateway criteria set forth in \xc2\xa7 2244(b)(2) for the filing of such a petition. <i>Ibid. </i>It concluded that "all relief requested to this panel is denied." <i>Id., </i>at 37. In a second order, entered on February 11,2002, Nos. 98-6568/6569,01-6504 (CA6), id., at 38, the Court of Appeals referred to additional filings by petitioner and denied them alP</p><p>Thereafter we stayed petitioner\'s execution and granted his petition for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals\' disposition of his Rule 60(b) motion.9 535 U.

If it was the latter, petitioner clearly failed to follow the procedure specified in 28 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 2244(b)(3)(A).lO On the other hand, it is clear that if the motion was a valid Rule 60(b) filing, the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the District Court\'s denial of relief-either because that denial was a final order from which petitioner filed a timely appeal, or because the District Court had transferred the matter to the Court of Appeals pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1631.11 In either event the issue was properly before the Court of Appeals, and-since the jurisdictional bar in \xc2\xa7 2244(b)(3)(E) does not apply to Rule 60(b) motions-we certainly have jurisdiction to review the orders that the Court of Appeals entered on January 18 and February 11, 2002. Thus, in order to resolve both the jurisdictional issues and the questions presented in the certiorari petition, it is necessary to identify the difference, if any, between a Rule 60(b) motion and a second or successive habeas corpus application.</p><p>As Judge Tjoflat explained in a recent opinion addressing that precise issue, the difference is defined by the relief that the applicant seeks. Is he seeking relief from a federal court\'s final order entered in a habeas proceeding on one or more of the grounds set forth in Rule 60(b), or is he seeking relief from a state court\'s judgment of conviction on the basis of a new constitutional claim? Referring to the difference</p><p>10 Section 2244(b)(3)(A) provides: "Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application." Petitioner filed no such motion.</p><p>11 It is of particular importance that petitioner filed his notice of appeal in both the Court of Appeals and the District Court. Regardless of whether the District Court\'s transfer order divested that court of jurisdiction to conduct further proceedings, petitioner challenged the specific characterization of his Rule 60(b) motion before the two possible courts that could hear his claim.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="95">95</a></p><p>between a Rule 60(b) motion and a "second or successive" habeas corpus petition, Judge Tjoflat wrote:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The distinction lies in the harm each is designed to cure. A \'second or successive\' habeas corpus petition, as discussed above, is meant to address two specific types of constitutional claims by prisoners: (1) claims that \'rel[y] on a new rule of constitutional law,\' and (2) claims that rely on a rule of constitutional law and are based on evidence that \'could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence\' and would establish the petitioner\'s factual innocence. 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2244(b)(3)(A). Neither of these types of claims challenges the district court\'s previous denial of relief under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2254. Instead, each alleges that the contextual circumstances of the proceeding have changed so much that the petitioner\'s conviction or sentence now runs afoul of the Constitution.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"In contrast, a motion for relief under Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contests the integrity of the proceeding that resulted in the district court\'s judgment.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"When a habeas corpus petitioner moves for relief under, for example, Rule 60(b)(3), he is impugning the integrity of the district court\'s judgment rejecting his petition on the ground that the State obtained the judgment by fraud. Asserting this claim is quite different from contending, as the petitioner would in a successive habeas corpus petition, that his conviction or sentence was obtained \'in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\' 28 u. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2254(a).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"In sum, a \'second or successive\' habeas corpus petition, like all habeas corpus petitions, is meant to remedy constitutional violations (albeit ones which arise out of facts discovered or laws evolved after an initial habeas corpus proceeding), while a Rule 60(b) motion is de-</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="96">96</a></p><p>signed to cure procedural violations in an earlier proceeding-here, a habeas corpus proceeding-that raise questions about that proceeding\'s integrity.</p><p>"As a final note, I would add that this rule is not just consistent with case law, but it also comports with the fair and equitable administration of justice. If, for example, a death row inmate could show that the State indeed committed fraud upon the district court during his habeas corpus proceeding, it would be a miscarriage of justice if we turned a blind eye to such abuse of the judicial process. Nevertheless, this is the result that would occur if habeas corpus petitioners\' Rule 60(b) motions were always considered \'second or successive\' habeas corpus petitions. After all, a claim of prosecutorial fraud does not rely on \'a new rule of constitutional law\' and may not \'establish by clear and convincing evidence that ... no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\' 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2244(b)(2). It is a claim that nonetheless must be recognized." <i>Mobley </i>v. <i>Head, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/306/1096/">306 F.3d 1096</a>, 11001105 (CAll 2002) (dissenting opinion).</p><p>Judge Tjoflat\'s reasoning is fully consistent with this Court\'s decisions in <i>Stewart </i>v. <i>Martinez-Villareal, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/637/case.html">523 U.

Applying that reasoning to the present case, it is perfectly clear that the petitioner <i>filed </i>a proper Rule 60(b) motion. (Whether it should have been granted is a different question.) The motion did not purport to set forth the basis for a second or successive challenge to the state-court judgment of conviction. It did, however, seek relief from the final order entered by the federal court in the habeas proceeding, and it relied on grounds that are either directly or indirectly identified in Rule 60(b) as possible bases for such relief. Essentially it submitted that the "changes in the ... legal land-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="97">97</a></p><p>scape," <i>Agostini </i>v. <i>Felton, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/521/203/case.html">521 U. S. 203</a>, 215 (1997), effected by Tennessee\'s new rule demonstrated that the District Court\'s procedural bar ruling rested on a mistaken premise. In petitioner\'s view, that mistake constituted a "reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment" within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(6). Whether one ultimately agrees or disagrees with that submission, it had sufficient arguable merit to persuade at least four Members of this Court to grant his certiorari petition.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>In the District Court petitioner filed a comprehensive memorandum supporting his submission that his Rule 60(b) motion should be granted. App. 171-267. He has argued that the evidence already presented to the court proves that the prosecutor was guilty of serious misconduct; that affidavits executed by eight members of the jury that sentenced him to death establish that they would have not voted in favor of the death penalty if they had known the facts that the prosecutor improperly withheld or concealed from them; and that it is inequitable to allow an erroneous procedural ruling to deprive him of a ruling on the merits. In this Court, a brief filed by former prosecutors as <i>amici curiae </i>urges us to address the misconduct claim, stressing the importance of condemning the conduct disclosed by the record.12 Arguably it would be appropriate for us to do so in order to answer the second question presented in the certiorari petition. In my opinion, however, correct procedure requires that the merits of the Rule 60(b) motion be addressed in the first instance by the District Court.</p><p>The District Court has already heard the extensive evidence relevant to the prosecutorial misconduct claim, as well as the evidence that persuaded both the Tennessee appellate court and two federal courts that petitioner\'s trial counsel</p><p>12 See Brief for James F. Neal et al. as <i>Amici Curiae 24.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="98">98</a></p><p>was ineffective (relief was denied on this claim based on a conclusion that counsel\'s ineffectiveness did not affect the outcome of the trial). That court is, therefore, in the best position to evaluate the equitable considerations that may be taken into account in ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion. Moreover, simply as a matter of orderly procedure, the court in which the motion was properly filed is the one that should first evaluate its merits.</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit plainly erred when it characterized petitioner\'s Rule 60(b) motion as an application for a second or successive habeas petition and denied relief for that reason. The "federalism" concerns that motivated this Court\'s misguided decisions in <i>Coleman </i>v. <i>Thompson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/case.html">501 U. S. 722</a> (1991),13 and <i>O\'Sullivan </i>v. <i>Boer</i>ckel, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/838/case.html">526 U. S. 838</a> (1999), do not even arguably support the Sixth Circuit\'s disposition of petitioner\'s motion. I would therefore vacate the orders that that court entered on J anuary 18 and February 11, 2002, and remand the case to that court with instructions to direct the District Court to rule on the merits of the Rule 60(b) motion.</p><p>13 "This is a case about federalism." 501 U.
