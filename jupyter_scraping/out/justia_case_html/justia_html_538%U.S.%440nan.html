It employed respondent, Deborah Anne Wells, as a bookkeeper from 1986 until 1997. After her termination, she brought this action against the clinic alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of disability under Title I of the ADA. Petitioner denied that it was covered by the Act and moved for summary judgment, asserting that it did not have 15 or more employees for the 20 weeks required by the statute. It is undisputed that the accuracy of that assertion depends on whether the four physician-shareholders who own the professional corporation and constitute its board of directors are counted as employees.</p><p>The District Court, adopting the Magistrate Judge\'s findings and recommendation, granted the motion. Relying on an "economic realities" test adopted by the Seventh Circuit in <i>EEOC </i>v. <i>Dowd </i>&amp; <i>Dowd, Ltd., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/736/1177/">736 F.2d 1177</a>, 1178 (1984), the District Court concluded that the four doctors were "more analogous to partners in a partnership than to shareholders in a general corporation" and therefore were "not employees for purposes of the federal antidiscrimination laws." App. 89.</p><p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Noting that the Second Circuit had rejected the economic realities approach, the majority held that the use of any corporation, including a professional corporation, " \'precludes any examination designed to determine whether the entity is in fact a partnership.\'" <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/271/903/">271 F.3d 903</a>, 905</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="443">443</a></p><p>(2001) (quoting <i>Hyland </i>v. <i>New Haven Radiology Associates, </i>p. c., <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/794/793/">794 F.2d 793</a>, 798 <i>(CA2 </i>1986)).

Or. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7 58.185(3) (emphasis added). A licensed professional also is <i>jointly and severally liable </i>for such claims, albeit with some dollar limitations. Or. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7 58.185(4)-(9). Ordinary business corporation rules apply only to other aspects of the entity, apart from the provision of professional services. Or. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7 58.185(11). A professional corporation\'s activities must remain consistent with the requirements of the type of license in question, Or. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7 58.205, and it may merge only with other professional corporations, Or. Rev.

Rather, our inquiry is whether a shareholder-director is an employee or, alternatively, the kind of person that the common law would consider an employer.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="446">446</a></p><p>"those who are properly classified as partners are not \'employees\' for purposes of the anti-discrimination statutes"). The question whether a shareholder-director is an employee, however, cannot be answered by asking whether the shareholder-director appears to be the functional equivalent of a partner. Today there are partnerships that include hundreds of members, some of whom may well qualify as "employees" because control is concentrated in a small number of managing partners. Cf. <i>Hishon </i>v. <i>King </i>&amp; <i>Spalding, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/69/case.html">467 U. S. 69</a>, 79, n. 2 (1984) (Powell, J., concurring) ("[A]n employer may not evade the strictures of Title VII simply by labeling its employees as \'partners"\'); <i>EEOC </i>v. <i>Sidley Austin Brown </i>&amp; <i>Wood, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/315/696/">315 F.3d 696</a>, 709 (CA72002) (Easterbrook, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>Strother </i>v. <i>Southern California Permanente Medical Group, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/79/859/">79 F.3d 859</a> <i>(CA9 </i>1996). Thus, asking whether shareholder-directors are partners-rather than asking whether they are employees-simply begs the question.</p><p>Nor does the approach adopted by the Court of Appeals in this case fare any better. The majority\'s approach, which paid particular attention to "the broad purpose of the ADA," 271 F. 3d, at 905, is consistent with the statutory purpose of ridding the Nation of the evil of discrimination. See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 12101(b).6 Nevertheless, two countervailing considerations must be weighed in the balance. First, as the</p><p>6 The meaning of the term "employee" comes into play when determining whether an individual is an "employee" who may invoke the ADA\'s protections against discrimination in "hiring, advancement, or discharge," 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 12112(a), as well as when determining whether an individual is an "employee" for purposes of the 15-employee threshold. See \xc2\xa7 12111(5)(A); see also Brief for United States et al. as <i>Amici Curiae 10-11; Schmidt </i>v. <i>Ottawa Medical Center, P. </i>c., <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/322/461/">322 F.3d 461</a> (CA72003). Consequently, a broad reading of the term "employee" would-consistent with the statutory purpose of ridding the Nation of discrimination-tend to expand the coverage of the ADA by enlarging the number of employees entitled to protection and by reducing the number of firms entitled to exemption.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="447">447</a></p><p>dissenting judge noted below, the congressional decision to limit the coverage of the legislation to firms with 15 or more employees has its own justification that must be respectednamely, easing entry into the market and preserving the competitive position of smaller firms. See 271 F. 3d, at 908 (opinion of Graber, J.) ("Congress decided \'to spare very small firms from the potentially crushing expense of mastering the intricacies of the antidiscrimination laws, establishing procedures to assure compliance, and defending against suits when efforts at compliance fail\'" (quoting <i>Papa </i>v. <i>Katy Industries, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/166/937/">166 F.3d 937</a>, 940 <i>(CA7), </i>cert. denied, 528 U. S. 1019 (1999))). Second, as <i>Darden </i>reminds us, congressional silence often reflects an expectation that courts will look to the common law to fill gaps in statutory text, particularly when an undefined term has a settled meaning at common law. Congress has overridden judicial decisions that went beyond the common law in an effort to correct "\'the mischief\'" at which a statute was aimed. See 503 U. S., at 324-325.</p><p>Perhaps the Court of Appeals\' and the parties\' failure to look to the common law for guidance in this case stems from the fact that we are dealing with a new type of business entity that has no exact precedent in the common law. State statutes now permit incorporation for the purpose of practicing a profession, but in the past "the so-called learned professions were not permitted to organize as corporate entities." lA W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations \xc2\xa7 112.10 (rev. ed. 1997-2002). Thus, professional corporations are relatively young participants in the market, and their features vary from State to State. See generally 1 B. Bittker &amp; J. Eustice, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders ~ 2.06 (7th ed. 2002) (explaining that States began to authorize the creation of professional corporations in the late 1950\'s and that the momentum to form professional corporations grew in the 1970\'s).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="448">448</a></p><p>Nonetheless, the common law\'s definition of the masterservant relationship does provide helpful guidance. At common law the relevant factors defining the master-servant relationship focus on the master\'s control over the servant. The general definition of the term "servant" in the Restatement (Second) of Agency \xc2\xa7 2(2) (1957), for example, refers to a person whose work is "controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master." See also <i>id., </i>\xc2\xa7 220(1) ("A servant is a person employed to perform services in the affairs of another and who with respect to the physical conduct in the performance of the services is subject to the other\'s control or right to control"). In addition, the Restatement\'s more specific definition of the term "servant" lists factors to be considered when distinguishing between servants and independent contractors, the first of which is "the extent of control" that one may exercise over the details of the work of the other. <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa7 220(2)(a). We think that the common-law element of control is the principal guidepost that should be followed in this case.</p><p>This is the position that is advocated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency that has special enforcement responsibilities under the ADA and other federal statutes containing similar threshold issues for determining coverage.

S., at 323324-that may be relevant to "whether the employer controls the means and manner of the worker\'s work performance." EEOC Compliance Manual \xc2\xa7 605:0008, and n. 71.8 The guidelines list six factors to be considered in answering the narrower question, which they frame as "whether the individual acts independently and participates in managing the organization, or whether the individual is subject to the organization\'s control." <i>Id., </i>\xc2\xa7 605:0009.</p><p>We are persuaded by the EEOC\'s focus on the commonlaw touchstone of control, see <i>Skidmore </i>v. <i>Swift </i>&amp; <i>Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/case.html">323 U.

The employer can hire and fire employees, can assign tasks to employees and supervise their performance, and can decide how the profits and losses of the business are to be distributed. The mere fact that a person has a particular title-such as partner, director, or vice president-should not necessarily be used to determine whether he or she is an employee or a proprietor. See <i>ibid. </i>("An individual\'s title ... does not determine whether the individual is a partner, officer, member of a board of directors, or major shareholder, as opposed to an employee").

Rather, as was true in applying common-law rules to the independent-contractor-versusemployee issue confronted in <i>Darden, </i>the answer to whether a shareholder-director is an employee depends on "\'all of the incidents of the relationship ... with no one factor being decisive.\'" 503 U.

For example, they apparently control the operation of their clinic, they share the profits, and they are personally liable for malpractice claims. There may, however, be evidence in the record that would contradict those findings or support a contrary conclusion under the EEOC\'s standard that we endorse today.u Accordingly, as we did in <i>Darden, </i>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins, dissenting.</p><p>"There is nothing inherently inconsistent between the coexistence of a proprietary and an employment relationship." <i>Goldberg </i>v. <i>Whitaker House Cooperative, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/28/case.html">366 U. S. 28</a>, 32 (1961). As doctors performing the everyday work of petitioner Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P. <i>C., </i>the physician-shareholders function in several respects as</p><p>11 For example, the record indicates that the four director-shareholders receive salaries, Tr. of Oral Arg. 8, that they must comply with the standards established by the clinic, App. 66, and that they report to a personnel manager, <i>ibid.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="452">452</a></p><p>common-law employees, a designation they embrace for various purposes under federal and state law. Classifying as employees all doctors daily engaged as caregivers on Clackamas\' premises, moreover, serves the animating purpose of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act). Seeing no cause to shelter Clackamas from the governance of the ADA, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p><p>An "employee," the ADA provides, is "an individual employed by an employer." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 12111(4). Where, as here, a federal statute uses the word "employee" without explaining the term\'s intended scope, we ordinarily presume "Congress intended to describe the conventional masterservant relationship as understood by common-law agency doctrine." <i>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Darden, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/318/case.html">503 U. S. 318</a>, 322-323 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court today selects one of the common-law indicia of a master-servant relationship-control over the work of others engaged in the business of the enterprise-and accords that factor overriding significance. <i>Ante, </i>at 448. I would not so shrink the inquiry.</p><p>Are the physician-shareholders "servants" of Clackamas for the purpose relevant here? The Restatement defines "servant" to mean "an agent employed by a master to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the performance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master." Restatement (Second) of Agency \xc2\xa7 2(2) (1957) (hereinafter Restatement). When acting as clinic doctors, the physician-shareholders appear to fit the Restatement definition. The doctors provide services on behalf of the corporation, in whose name the practice is conducted. See Ore. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7 58.185(1)(a) (1998 Supp.) (shareholders of a professional corporation "render the specified professional services <i>of the corporation" </i>(emphasis added)). The doctors have employment contracts with Clackamas, App. 71, under which they receive salaries and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="453">453</a></p><p>yearly bonuses, Tr. of Oral Arg. 8, and they work at facilities owned or leased by the corporation, App. 29, 71. In performing their duties, the doctors must "compl[y] with ... standards [the organization has] established." <i>Id., </i>at 66; see Restatement, ch. 7, tit. B, Introductory Note, p. 479 ("[F]ully employed but highly placed employees of a corporation ... are not less servants because they are not controlled in their day-to-day work by other human beings. Their physical activities are controlled by their sense of obligation to devote their time and energies to the interests of the enterprise.").</p><p>The physician-shareholders, it bears emphasis, invite the designation "employee" for various purposes under federal and state law. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), much like the ADA, defines "employee" as "any individual employed by an employer." 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1002(6). Clackamas readily acknowledges that the physician-shareholders are "employees" for ERISA purposes. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7. Indeed, gaining qualification as "employees" under ERISA was the prime reason the physician-shareholders chose the corporate form instead of a partnership. See <i>id., </i>at 7. Further, Clackamas agrees, the physician-shareholders are covered by Oregon\'s workers\' compensation law, <i>ibid., </i>a statute applicable to "person[s] ... who ... furnish services for a remuneration, subject to the direction and control of an employer," Ore. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7 656.005(30) (1996 Supp.). Finally, by electing to organize their practice as a corporation, the physician-shareholders created an entity separate and distinct from themselves, one that would afford them limited liability for the debts of the enterprise. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 58.185(4), (5), (10), (11) (1998 Supp.). I see no reason to allow the doctors to escape from their choice of corporate form when the question becomes whether they are employees for purposes of federal antidiscrimination statutes.</p><p>Nothing in or about the ADA counsels otherwise. As the Court observes, the reason for exempting businesses with</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="454">454</a></p><p>fewer than 15 employees from the Act, was "to spare very small firms from the potentially crushing expense of mastering the intricacies of the antidiscrimination laws, establishing procedures to assure compliance, and defending against suits when efforts at compliance fail." <i>Ante, </i>at 447 (quotation from <i>Papa </i>v. <i>Katy Industries, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/166/937/">166 F.3d 937</a>, 940 <i>(CA7 </i>1999)). The inquiry the Court endorses to determine the physician-shareholders\' qualification as employees asks whether they "ac[t] independently and participat[e] in managing the organization, or ... [are] subject to the organization\'s control." <i>Ante, </i>at 449 (quoting 2 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Compliance Manual \xc2\xa7 605:0009 (2000)). Under the Court\'s approach, a firm\'s coverage by the ADA might sometimes turn on variations in ownership structure unrelated to the magnitude of the company\'s business or its capacity for complying with federal prescriptions.</p><p>This case is illustrative. In 1996, Clackamas had 4 physician-shareholders and at least 14 other employees for 28 full weeks; in 1997, it had 4 physician-shareholders and at least 14 other employees for 37 full weeks. App. 55-62; see 42 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 12111(5) (to be covered by the Act, an employer must have the requisite number of employees "for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year"). Beyond question, the corporation would have been covered by the ADA had one of the physician-shareholders sold his stake in the business and become a "mere" employee. Yet such a change in ownership arrangements would not alter the magnitude of Clackamas\' operation: In both circumstances, the corporation would have had at least 18 people on site doing the everyday work of the clinic for the requisite number of weeks.</p><p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\'s approach, which the Court endorses, it is true, "excludes from protection those who are most able to control the firm\'s practices and who, as a consequence, are least vulnerable to the discriminatory treatment prohibited by the Act." Brief for</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="455">455</a></p><p>United States et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>11; see 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 12111(8), 12112(a) (only "employees" are protected by the ADA). As this dispute demonstrates, however, the determination whether the physician-shareholders are employees of Clackamas affects not only whether they may sue under the ADA, but also-and of far greater practical importwhether employees like bookkeeper Deborah Anne Wells are covered by the Act. Because the character of the relationship between Clackamas and the doctors supplies no justification for withholding from clerical worker Wells federal protection against discrimination in the workplace, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
