After only one hour of delib- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1014">Page 490 U.S. 1012 , 1014</a></p><p> erations Monday morning, the jurors voted unanimously to impose the death penalty. </p><p> In Lowenfield, the Court observed that "[a]ny criminal defendant, and especially any capital defendant, being tried by a jury is entitled to the uncoerced verdict of that body." 484 U.S., at 241. To determine if coercion has occurred, courts must "consider the supplemental charge given by the trial court \'in its context and under all the circumstances.\' " Id., at 237 (citation omitted). We held that the particular supplemental charges and jury polling at issue had not resulted in coercion, but that other instructions and comments might require a different conclusion. Id., at 241. </p><p> In my view, this case presents a far more compelling circumstance for finding jury coercion than did Lowenfield. As the dissenting judge below observed, the holdout juror, given her emotional condition, the verbal attack upon her, and the judge\'s indication that he would have to investigate one or more jurors </p><ul>"may well have interpreted these statements as meaning the court expected a verdict on Monday and that it wanted her personally to resolve any lingering doubts she may have had about the appropriateness of imposing the death penalty. It is also highly likely [she] believed that, by agreeing to the death verdict on Monday, she could avoid the threatened investigation by the court and the attorneys of the jury room incident and of her reluctance to vote for death." 46 Cal.3d, at 548, 250 Cal.Rptr., at 596, 758 P.2d, at 1127.</ul> <p> The petitioner here was entitled to have the decision whether he " deserve[d] to live or die . . . made on scales that are not deliberately tipped toward death." Witherspoon v. Illinois, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/510/case.html">391 U.S. 510</a>, 521-522, n. 20, 1776-1777, n. 20 (1968). Because the actions of the trial judge in this case raise serious doubts about whether the context and circumstances of the death sentence in this case were coercive, and thus whether the scales of justice were in equipoise when the time for that decision came, I would grant the petition for review.
