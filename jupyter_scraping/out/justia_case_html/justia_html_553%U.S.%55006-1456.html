UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x931456.\xe2\x80\x83Argued February 25, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 2, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">Arrested after a search of the car he was driving through Texas toward Mexico revealed nearly $81,000 bundled in plastic bags and covered with animal hair in a secret compartment under the rear floorboard, petitioner was charged with, and convicted of, attempting to transport \xe2\x80\x9cfunds from a place in the United States to \xe2\x80\xa6 a place outside the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 knowing that the \xe2\x80\xa6 funds \xe2\x80\xa6 represent the proceeds of \xe2\x80\xa6 unlawful activity and \xe2\x80\xa6 that such transportation \xe2\x80\xa6 is designed \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of \xe2\x80\x9d the money, in violation of the federal money laundering statute, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i).  Affirming, the Fifth Circuit rejected as inconsistent with the statutory text petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Government must prove that he attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, but held that his extensive efforts to prevent the funds\xe2\x80\x99 detection during transportation showed that he sought to conceal or disguise their nature, location, source, ownership, or control.    </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Although \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i) does not require proof that the defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, neither can it be satisfied solely by evidence that the funds were concealed during transport.  The statutory text makes clear that a conviction requires proof that the transportation\xe2\x80\x99s purpose\xe2\x80\x94not merely its effect\xe2\x80\x94was to conceal or disguise one of the listed attributes: the funds\xe2\x80\x99 nature, location, source, ownership, or control.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The statute contains no \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of legitimate wealth\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  Although petitioner is correct that taking steps to make funds appear legitimate is the common meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney laundering,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court must be guided by a statute\xe2\x80\x99s words, not by its title\xe2\x80\x99s common meaning, to the extent they are inconsistent, see <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections</em> v. <em>Yeskey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/206/index.html">524 U. S. 206</a>, 212.  Here, Congress used broad language that captures more than classic money laundering: In addition to concealing or disguising the nature or source of illegal funds, Congress also sought to reach transportation designed to conceal or disguise the funds\xe2\x80\x99 location, ownership, or control.  Nor does the Court find persuasive petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to infuse a money-laundering requirement into the listed attributes.  Only the attribute \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d is coextensive with the funds\xe2\x80\x99 illegitimate character, but that does not mean that Congress intended nature to swallow the other attributes.  The Court is likewise skeptical of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that violating the statute\xe2\x80\x99s elements would necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate than they did before.  It is not necessarily true that concealing or disguising any one of the listed attributes may have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate by impeding law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s ability to identify illegitimate funds.  Finally, the Court disagrees with petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa71956(a)(2) must be aimed at something other than merely secretive transportation of illicit funds because that conduct is already punished by the bulk cash smuggling statute, 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75332.  Even if \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i) has no \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of legitimate wealth\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, the two statutes nonetheless target distinct conduct, in that \xc2\xa75332(a)(1) encompasses, <em>inter alios</em>, a defendant who, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement \xe2\x80\xa6 , knowingly conceals more than $10,000 \xe2\x80\xa6 and transports [it] from \xe2\x80\xa6 the United States to a place outside\xe2\x80\x9d the country.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The evidence that petitioner concealed the money during transportation is not sufficient to sustain his conviction.  In determining whether he knew that \xe2\x80\x9csuch transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i), was designed to conceal or disguise the specified attributes of the illegally obtained funds, the critical transportation was not the transportation of the funds within this country on the way to the border, but transportation \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a place in the United States to \xe2\x80\xa6 a place outside the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>\xe2\x80\x94here, from this country to Mexico.  Therefore, what the Government had to prove was that petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico was \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned,\xe2\x80\x9d at least in part, to conceal or disguise their \xe2\x80\x9cnature,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clocation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csource,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cownership,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court agrees with petitioner that merely hiding funds during transportation is not sufficient to violate the statute, even if substantial efforts have been expended to conceal the money.  This conclusion turns on \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s text, particularly the term \xe2\x80\x9cdesign,\xe2\x80\x9d which the dictionaries show means purpose or plan; <em>i.e.</em>, the transportation\xe2\x80\x99s intended aim.  Congress wrote \xe2\x80\x9cknowing that such transportation is designed \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal or disguise\xe2\x80\x9d a listed attribute, and when an act is \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to\xe2\x80\x9d do something, the most natural reading is that it has that something as its purpose.  Because the Fifth Circuit used \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d to refer not to the transportation\xe2\x80\x99s purpose but to the manner in which it was carried out, its use of the term in this context was consistent with the alternate meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d as structure or arrangement.  It is implausible, however, that Congress intended this meaning.  If it had, it could have expressed its intention simply by writing \xe2\x80\x9cknowing that such transportation conceals or disguises,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than the more complex formulation \xe2\x80\x9cknowing that such transportation \xe2\x80\xa6 is designed \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal or disguise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i).  It seems far more likely that Congress intended courts to apply the familiar criminal law concepts of purpose and intent than to focus exclusively on how a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cstructured\xe2\x80\x9d the transportation.  In addition, the structural meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d is both overinclusive and underinclusive: It would capture individuals who structured transportation in a secretive way but lacked any criminal intent (such as a person who hid illicit funds <em>en route </em>to turn them over to law enforcement); yet it would exclude individuals who fully intended to move the funds in order to impede detection by law enforcement but failed to hide them during transport.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, evidence that petitioner transported the cash bundled in plastic bags and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal hair was plainly probative of an underlying goal to prevent the funds\xe2\x80\x99 detection during the drive into Mexico.  However, even with the abundant evidence that petitioner had concealed the money in order to transport it, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own expert testified that the transportation\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was to compensate the Mexican leaders of the operation.  Thus, the evidence suggested that the transportation\xe2\x80\x99s secretive aspects were employed to <em>facilitate</em> it, but not necessarily that secrecy was its <em>purpose.  </em>Because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s extensive efforts to conceal the funds <em>en route</em> to Mexico was the only evidence the Government introduced to prove that the transportation was \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the [funds\xe2\x80\x99] nature, \xe2\x80\xa6 location, \xe2\x80\xa6 source, \xe2\x80\xa6 ownership, or \xe2\x80\xa6 control,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction cannot stand.

Petitioner argues that his conviction cannot stand because, while the evidence demonstrates that he took steps to hide illicit funds <em>en route </em>to Mexico, it does not show that the cross-border transport of those funds was designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.  Although we agree with the Government that the statute does not require proof that the defendant attempted to \xe2\x80\x9clegitimize\xe2\x80\x9d tainted funds, we agree with petitioner that the Government must demonstrate that the defendant did more than merely hide the money during its transport.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On July 14, 2004, petitioner Humberto Fidel Regalado Cuellar was stopped in southern Texas for driving errati-cally.  Driving south toward the Mexican border, about 114 miles away, petitioner had just passed the town of Eldorado.  In response to the officer\xe2\x80\x99s questions, petitioner, who spoke no English, handed the officer a stack of papers.  Included were bus tickets showing travel from a Texas border town to San Antonio on July 13 and, in the other direction, from San Antonio to Big Spring, Texas, on July 14.  A Spanish-speaking officer, Trooper Danny Nu\xc5\x84ez, was called to the scene and began questioning petitioner.  Trooper Nu\xc5\x84ez soon became suspicious because petitioner was avoiding eye contact and seemed very nervous.  Petitioner claimed to be on a 3-day business trip, but he had no luggage or extra clothing with him, and he gave conflicting accounts of his itinerary.  When Trooper Nu\xc5\x84ez asked petitioner about a bulge in his shirt pocket, petitioner produced a wad of cash that smelled of\nmarijuana.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner consented to a search of the Volkswagen Beetle that he was driving.  While the officers were searching the vehicle, Trooper Nu\xc5\x84ez observed petitioner standing on the side of the road making the sign of the cross, which he interpreted to mean that petitioner knew he was in trouble.  A drug detection dog alerted on the cash from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s shirt pocket and on the rear area of the car.  Further scrutiny uncovered a secret compartment under the rear floorboard, and inside the compartment the officers found approximately $81,000 in cash.  The money was bundled in plastic bags and duct tape, and animal hair was spread in the rear of the vehicle.  Petitioner claimed that he had previously transported goats in the vehicle, but Trooper Nu\xc5\x84ez doubted that goats could fit in such a small space and suspected that the hair had been spread in an attempt to mask the smell of marijuana.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There were signs that the compartment had been recently created and that someone had attempted to cover up the bodywork: The Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s carpeting appeared newer than the rest of the interior, and the exterior of the vehicle appeared to have been purposely splashed with mud to cover up toolmarks, fresh paint, or other work.  In the backseat, officers found a fast-food restaurant receipt dated the same day from a city farther north than petitioner claimed to have traveled.  After a check of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s last border crossing also proved inconsistent with his story, petitioner was arrested and interrogated.  He continued to tell conflicting stories about his travels.  At one point, before he knew that the officers had found the cash, he remarked to Trooper Nu\xc5\x84ez that he had to have the car in Mexico by midnight or else his family would be \xe2\x80\x9cfloating down the river.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 50.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner was charged with attempting to transport the proceeds of unlawful activity across the border, knowing that the transportation was designed \xe2\x80\x9cto conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\xe2\x80\x9d of the money.  18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i).  After a 2-day trial, the jury found petitioner guilty.  The District Court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence and sentenced petitioner to 78 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed and rendered a judgment of acquittal.  441 F.\xc2\xa03d 329 (2006).  Judge Smith\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion held that, although the evidence showed that petitioner concealed the money for the purpose of transporting it, the statute requires that the purpose of the transportation itself must be to conceal or disguise the unlawful proceeds.  <em>Id.,</em> at 333\xe2\x80\x93334.  Analogizing from cases interpreting another provision of the money laundering statute, the court held that the transportation must be undertaken in an attempt to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See <em>id.,</em> at 334.  Although the evidence showed intent to avoid detection while driving the funds to Mexico, it did not show that petitioner intended to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, and accordingly no rational trier of fact could have found petitioner guilty.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Judge Davis dissented, arguing that concealment during transportation is sufficient to violate \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i).  <em>Id.,</em> at 334\xe2\x80\x93336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit granted rehearing en banc and affirmed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  478 F.\xc2\xa03d 282 (2007).  The court rejected as inconsistent with the statutory text petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Government must prove that he attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.  <em>Id.,</em> at 290.  But it held that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s extensive efforts to prevent detection of the funds during transportation showed that petitioner sought to conceal or disguise the nature, location, and source, ownership, or control of the funds.  <em>Id.,</em> at 289\xe2\x80\x93290.  Judge Smith dissented for largely the same reasons set forth in his opinion for the original panel majority.  He emphasized the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cconcealing something to transport it, and transporting something to conceal it,\xe2\x80\x9d and explained that whether petitioner was doing the latter depended on whether his ultimate plan upon reaching his destination was to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the money.  <em>Id.,</em> at 296\xe2\x80\x93297.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal money laundering statute, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71956, prohibits specified transfers of money derived from unlawful activities.  Subsection (a)(1) makes it unlawful to engage in certain financial transactions, while subsection (a)(2) criminalizes certain kinds of transportation.  Petitioner was charged under the transportation provision: The indictment alleged that he attempted to transport illicit proceeds across the Mexican border \xe2\x80\x9cknowing that such transportation was designed in whole or in part to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, and control\xe2\x80\x9d of the funds.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  App. 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (citing \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i)).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first consider the \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal\xe2\x80\x9d element.  Petitioner argues that to satisfy this element, the Government must prove that the defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.  Petitioner would replace \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i).  This is consistent with the plain meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney laundering,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner argues, because that term is commonly understood to mean disguising illegally obtained money in order to make it appear legitimate.  In petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s view, this common understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney laundering\xe2\x80\x9d is implicit in both the transaction and transportation provisions of the statute because concealing or disguising any of the listed attributes would necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear legitimate, and, conversely, revealing any such attribute would necessarily reveal the funds as illicit.  The Government disagrees, contending that making funds appear legitimate is merely one way to accomplish money laundering, and that revealing a listed attribute would not necessarily reveal the funds\xe2\x80\x99 illicit nature.  In any event, the Government argues, the statute should not be cabined to target only classic money laundering because Congress intended to reach any conduct that impairs the ability of law enforcement to find and recover the unlawful proceeds.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with petitioner that taking steps to make funds appear legitimate is the common meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cmoney laundering.\xe2\x80\x9d  See American Heritage Dictionary 992 (4th ed. 2000) (hereinafter Am. Hert.) (defining \xe2\x80\x9claunder\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o disguise the source or nature of (illegal funds, for example) by channeling through an intermediate agent\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1027 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmoney-laundering\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he act of transferring illegally obtained money through legitimate people or accounts so that its original source cannot be traced\xe2\x80\x9d).  But to the extent they are inconsistent, we must be guided by the words of the operative statutory provision, and not by the common meaning of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s title.  See <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections</em> v. <em>Yeskey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/206/index.html">524 U. S. 206</a>, 212 (1998) (declining to use a statute\xe2\x80\x99s title to limit the meaning of the text).  Here, Congress used broad language that captures more than classic money laundering: In addition to concealing or disguising the nature or source of illegal funds, Congress also sought to reach transportation designed to conceal or disguise the location, ownership, or control of the funds.  For example, a defendant who smuggles cash into Mexico with the intent of hiding it from authorities by burying it in the desert may have engaged in transportation designed to conceal the location of those funds, but his conduct would not necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear legitimate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do we find persuasive petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to infuse a \xe2\x80\x9cclassic money laundering\xe2\x80\x9d requirement into the listed attributes.  Contrary to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument, revealing those attributes\xe2\x80\x94nature, location, source, ownership, or control\xe2\x80\x94would not necessarily expose the illegitimacy of the funds.  Digging up the cash buried in the Mexican desert, for example, would not necessarily reveal that it was derived from unlawful activity.  Indeed, of all the listed attributes, only \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d is coextensive with the funds\xe2\x80\x99 illegitimate character: Exposing the nature of illicit funds would, by definition, reveal them as unlawful proceeds.  But nature is only one attribute in the statute; that it may be coextensive with the creation of the appearance of legitimate wealth does not mean that Congress\nintended that requirement to swallow the other listed attributes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We likewise are skeptical of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that violating the elements of the statute would necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate than they did before.  It is true that concealing or disguising any one of the listed attributes may have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate\xe2\x80\x94largely because concealing or disguising those attributes might impede law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s ability to identify illegitimate funds\xe2\x80\x94but we are not convinced that this is necessarily so.  It might be possible for a defendant to conceal or disguise a listed attribute without also creating the appearance of legitimate wealth.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Abbell</em>, 271 F.\xc2\xa03d 1286, 1298 (CA11 2001) (noting that the transaction provision, although designed to punish those who \xe2\x80\x9cattemp[t] to legitimize their proceeds,\xe2\x80\x9d may be satisfied without proof that a particular defendant did so).  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of legitimate wealth\xe2\x80\x9d requirement simply has no basis in the operative provision\xe2\x80\x99s text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that the money laundering transportation provision must be aimed at something other than merely secretive transportation of illicit funds because that conduct is already punished by the bulk cash smuggling statute, 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75332 (2000 ed., Supp. V).  We disagree.  A comparison of the statutory language reveals that, even if no \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of legitimate wealth\xe2\x80\x9d requirement exists in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i), the two statutes nonetheless target distinct conduct.  The bulk cash smuggling provision encompasses, in relevant part, a defendant who,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwith the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement under section 5316, knowingly conceals more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments . . . and transports or transfers or attempts to transport or transfer such currency or monetary instruments from a place within the United States to a place outside of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75332(a)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\nTo be sure, certain conduct may fall within both statutes.  For example, both provisions may be violated by a defendant who intends to evade a relevant reporting requirement.  See \xc2\xa75332(a)(1) (transportation of funds \xe2\x80\x9cwith the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement\xe2\x80\x9d); 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(ii) (transportation of funds knowing that it is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid a transaction reporting requirement\xe2\x80\x9d).  But only the money laundering statute may be violated in the absence of such intent.  See \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i) (prohibiting transportation of illicit funds knowing that the transportation is designed to conceal or disguise a listed attribute).  Similarly, although both statutes encompass transportation of illicit funds, only the bulk cash smuggling statute also punishes the mere transportation of lawfully derived proceeds.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Compare 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75332(a) (omitting any requirement that the funds be unlawfully derived) with 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B) (requiring that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9ckno[w] that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation \xe2\x80\xa6 represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded that the statute contains no \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of legitimate wealth\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, we next consider whether the evidence that petitioner concealed the money during transportation is sufficient to sustain his conviction.  As noted, petitioner was convicted under \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i), which, in relevant part, makes it a crime to attempt to transport \xe2\x80\x9cfunds from a place in the United States to \xe2\x80\xa6 a place outside the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 knowing that the \xe2\x80\xa6 funds involved in the transportation \xe2\x80\xa6 represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation \xe2\x80\xa6 is designed in whole or in part \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, the Government was required in this case to prove that petitioner (1)\xc2\xa0attempted to transport funds from the United States to Mexico, (2)\xc2\xa0knew that these funds \xe2\x80\x9crepresent[ed] the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.,</em> drug trafficking, and (3)\xc2\xa0knew that \xe2\x80\x9csuch transportation\xe2\x80\x9d was designed to \xe2\x80\x9cconceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\xe2\x80\x9d of the funds.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is the last of these that is at issue before us, viz., whether petitioner knew that \xe2\x80\x9csuch transportation\xe2\x80\x9d was designed to conceal or disguise the specified attributes of the illegally obtained funds.  In this connection, it is important to keep in mind that the critical transportation was not the transportation of the funds within this country on the way to the border.  Instead, the term \xe2\x80\x9csuch transportation\xe2\x80\x9d means transportation \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a place in the United States to \xe2\x80\xa6 a place outside the United States\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here, from the United States to Mexico.  Therefore, what the Government had to prove was that petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico was \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned,\xe2\x80\x9d at least in part, to conceal or disguise their \xe2\x80\x9cnature,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clocation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csource,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cownership,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain his conviction because concealing or disguising a listed attribute of the funds during transportation cannot satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal\xe2\x80\x9d element.  Citing cases that interpret the identical phrase in the transaction provision to exclude \xe2\x80\x9cmere spending,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] petitioner argues that the transportation provision must exclude \xe2\x80\x9cmere hiding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Otherwise, petitioner contends, all cross-border transport of illicit funds would fall under the statute because people regularly make minimal efforts to conceal money, such as placing it inside a wallet or other receptacle, in order to secure it during travel.  The Government responds that concealment during transportation is sufficient to satisfy this element because it is circumstantial evidence that the ultimate purpose of the transportation\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, its \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds.  This standard would not criminalize all cross-border transport of illicit funds, the Government argues, because, just as in the transaction cases,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the statute encompasses only <em>substantial</em> efforts at concealment.  As a result, the Government agrees with the Court of Appeals that a violation of the transportation provision cannot be established solely by evidence that the defendant carried money in a wallet or concealed it in some other conventional or incidental way.  See 478 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 291 (characterizing the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s transportation of money in a box in<em> United States </em>v. <em>Dimeck, </em>24 F.\xc2\xa03d 1239, 1246 (CA10 1994), as a \xe2\x80\x9cminimal attempt at concealment\xe2\x80\x9d that is distinguishable from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ceffort to hide or conceal\xe2\x80\x9d the funds).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with petitioner that merely hiding funds during transportation is not sufficient to violate the statute, even if substantial efforts have been expended to conceal the money.  Our conclusion turns on the text of \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i), and particularly on the term \xe2\x80\x9cdesign.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this context, \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d means purpose or plan; <em>i.e.</em>, the intended aim of the transportation.  See Am. Hert. 491 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo formulate a plan for; devise\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o create or contrive for a particular purpose or effect\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s 478 (\xe2\x80\x9cA plan or scheme\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c[p]urpose or intention combined with a plan\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Brief for United States 14 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to conceive and plan out in the mind\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 611 (1993)).  Congress wrote \xe2\x80\x9cknowing that such transportation is designed \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal or disguise\xe2\x80\x9d a listed attribute of the funds, \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i), and when an act is \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to\xe2\x80\x9d do something, the most natural reading is that it has that something as its purpose.  The Fifth Circuit employed this meaning of design when it referred to the \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation design or plan to get the funds out of this country.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 478 F. 3d, at 289.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the Fifth Circuit went on to discuss the \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d of the transportation in a different sense.  It described the packaging of the money, its placement in the hidden compartment, and the use of animal hair to mask its scent as \xe2\x80\x9c<em>aspects</em> of the transportation\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwere designed to conceal or disguise\xe2\x80\x9d the nature and location of the cash.  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).  Because the Fifth Circuit used \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d to refer not to the purpose of the transportation but to the manner in which it was carried out, its use of the term in this context was consistent with the alternate meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d as structure or arrangement.  See Am. Hert. 491, 492 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo plan out in systematic, usually graphic form\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he purposeful or inventive arrangement of parts or details\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s 478 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe pattern or configuration of elements in something, such as a work of art\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government at times also appears to adopt this meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdesign.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for United States 21 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress focused on how the transportation itself was \xe2\x80\x98designed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 43 (arguing that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s design to move funds without detection is proof of a design to conceal or disguise the location and nature of the funds).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  If the statutory term had this meaning, it would apply whenever a person transported illicit funds in a secretive manner.  Judge Smith supplied an example of this construction: A petty thief who hides money in his shoe and then walks across the border to spend the money in local bars, see 478 F. 3d, at 301 (dissenting opinion), has engaged in transportation designed to conceal the location of the money because he has hidden it in an unlikely place.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think it implausible, however, that Congress intended this meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdesign.\xe2\x80\x9d  If it had, it could have expressed its intention simply by writing \xe2\x80\x9cknowing that such transportation conceals or disguises,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than the more complex formulation \xe2\x80\x9cknowing that such transportation \xe2\x80\xa6 is designed \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal or disguise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i).  It seems far more likely that Congress intended courts to apply the familiar criminal law concepts of purpose and intent than to focus exclusively on how a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cstructured\xe2\x80\x9d the transportation.  In addition, the structural meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d is both overinclusive and underinclusive: It would capture individuals who structured transportation in a secretive way but lacked any criminal intent (such as a person who hid illicit funds <em>en route </em>to turn them over to law enforcement); yet it would exclude individuals who fully intended to move the funds in order to impede detection by law enforcement but failed to hide them during the transportation.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, purpose and structure are often related.  One may employ structure to achieve a purpose: For example, the petty thief may hide money in his shoe to prevent it from being detected as he crosses the border with the intent to hide the money in Mexico.  See 478 F. 3d, at 301 (Smith, J., dissenting).  Although transporting money in a conventional manner may suggest no particular purpose other than simply to move it from one place to another, secretively transporting it suggests, at least, that the defendant did not want the money to be detected during transport.  In this case, evidence of the methods petitioner used to transport the nearly $81,000 in cash\xe2\x80\x94bundled in plastic bags and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal hair\xe2\x80\x94was plainly probative of an underlying goal to prevent the funds from being detected while he drove them from the United States to Mexico.  The same secretive aspects of the transportation also may be circumstantial evidence that the transportation itself was intended to avoid detection of the funds, because, for example, they may suggest that the transportation is only one step in a larger plan to facilitate the cross-border transport of the funds.  Cf.<em> id.</em>, at 289 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cconcealment of the funds during the U. S. leg of the trip [was] a vital part of the transportation design or plan to get the funds out of this country\xe2\x80\x9d).  But its probative force, in that context, is weak.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a difference between concealing something to transport it, and transporting something to conceal it,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 296\xe2\x80\x93297 (Smith, J., dissenting); that is, <em>how</em> one moves the money<em> </em>is distinct from <em>why</em> one moves the money.  Evidence of the former, standing alone, is not sufficient to prove the latter.    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case illustrates why: Even with abundant evidence that petitioner had concealed the money in order to transport it, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own expert witness\xe2\x80\x94ICE Agent Richard Nuckles\xe2\x80\x94testified that the purpose of the transportation was to compensate the leaders of the operation.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Tr. 179 (Oct. 12, 2004), App. 64\xe2\x80\x9365 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he bulk of [the money] generally goes back to Mexico, because the smuggler is the one who originated this entire process.  He\xe2\x80\x99s going to get a large cut of the profit, and that money has to be moved back to him in Mexico\xe2\x80\x9d).  The evidence suggested that the secretive aspects of the transportation were employed to <em>facilitate</em> the transportation, see 478 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 289 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cconcealment of the funds during the U. S. leg of the trip [was] a vital part of the transportation design or plan\xe2\x80\x9d), but not necessarily that secrecy was the <em>purpose</em> of the transportation.  Agent Nuckles testified that the secretive manner of transportation was consistent with drug smuggling, see Tr. 179\xe2\x80\x93180, App. 65\xe2\x80\x9366, but the Government failed to introduce any evidence that the reason drug smugglers move money to Mexico is to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Agent Nuckles also testified that Acuna, the Mexican border town to which petitioner was headed, has a cash economy and that U. S. currency is widely accepted there.  See Tr. 188\xe2\x80\x93189, App. 69.  The Fifth Circuit apparently viewed this as evidence that petitioner transported the money in order to conceal or disguise it: \xe2\x80\x9c[G]iven Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s largely cash economy, if [petitioner] had successfully transported the funds to Mexico without detection, the jury was entitled to find that the funds would have been better concealed or concealable after the transportation than before.\xe2\x80\x9d  478 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 292.  The statutory text makes clear, however, that a conviction under this provision requires proof that the purpose\xe2\x80\x94not merely effect\xe2\x80\x94of the transportation was to conceal or disguise a listed attribute.  Although the evidence suggested that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s transportation would have had the effect of concealing the funds, the evidence did not demonstrate that such concealment was the purpose of the transportation because, for instance, there was no evidence that petitioner knew about or intended the effect.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</f></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we conclude that the evidence introduced by the Government was not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s transportation was \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned in whole or in part \xe2\x80\xa6 to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source,\nthe ownership, or the control of the proceeds.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The provision of the money laundering statute under which petitioner was convicted requires proof that the transportation was \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\xe2\x80\x9d of the funds.  \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i).  Although this element does not require proof that the defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, neither can it be satisfied solely by evidence that a defendant concealed the funds during their transport.  In this case, the only evidence introduced to prove this element showed that petitioner engaged in extensive efforts to conceal the funds <em>en route</em> to Mexico, and thus his conviction cannot stand.

Although, as noted above, the Government introduced some evidence regarding the effect of transporting illegally obtained money to Mexico, the Government has not pointed to any evidence in the record from which it could be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico would have had one of the relevant effects.  </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962636">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nREGALADO CUELLAR V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Transporting the funds across the border would have had the<em> effect</em> of achieving this objective if, once the funds made it into Mexico, it would have been harder for law enforcement authorities in this country (1)\xc2\xa0to ascertain that the funds were drug proceeds (\xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d), (2)\xc2\xa0to find the funds (\xe2\x80\x9clocation\xe2\x80\x9d), (3)\xc2\xa0to determine where they came from (\xe2\x80\x9csource\xe2\x80\x9d), (4)\xc2\xa0to ascertain who owned them (\xe2\x80\x9cownership\xe2\x80\x9d), or (5)\xc2\xa0to find out who controlled them (\xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d).  But as the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at 15, the prosecution had to prove, not simply that the transportation of the funds\nfrom the United States to Mexico would have had one of these <em>effects</em>, <em>ibid.</em>, but that petitioner <em>knew</em> that achieving one of these effects was a <em>design</em> (<em>i.e.,</em> purpose) of the transportation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court also notes, <em>ante</em>, at 16, n.\xc2\xa08, a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intent is often inferred.  Here, proof of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and of the intent of the person or persons who \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned\xe2\x80\x9d the transportation would have been sufficient if the prosecution had introduced evidence showing, not only that taking \xe2\x80\x9cdirty\xe2\x80\x9d money across the border has one or more of the effects noted above, but that it is commonly known in the relevant circles (that is, among those who design and carry out \xe2\x80\x9csuch transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71956(a)(2)(B)) that taking \xe2\x80\x9cdirty\xe2\x80\x9d money to Mexico has one of the effects noted above.  Such evidence would permit a trier of fact to infer (1)\xc2\xa0that the person or persons who \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned\xe2\x80\x9d the plan to have the funds taken to Mexico intended to achieve the effect in question and (2)\xc2\xa0that a person like petitioner (that is, a person who is recruited to transport the funds) knew that this was the design.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, if the prosecution had introduced such evidence, the defense could have countered with any available proof showing (1)\xc2\xa0that in fact the achievement of these effects was not a design of the transportation or (2)\xc2\xa0that petitioner in fact did not know that achieving one of these effects was a purpose of the plan.  It would have then been up to the trier of fact to decide whether the statutory elements had been adequately proven.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial, as the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at 16, the Government introduced some evidence regarding the effect of transporting illegally obtained money to Mexico, but the Government has not pointed to any evidence in the record from which it could be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that a person like petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico would have had one of the relevant effects.  For this reason, I agree with the Court that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction cannot be sustained.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
