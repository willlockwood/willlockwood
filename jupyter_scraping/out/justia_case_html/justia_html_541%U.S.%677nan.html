Argued February 25, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 7, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Upon evidence that certain of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s valuable art works had either been seized by the Nazis or expropriated by Austria after World War II, respondent filed this action in Federal District Court to recover six of the paintings from petitioners, Austria and its instrumentality, the Austrian Gallery.  She asserts jurisdiction under \xc2\xa72 of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71330(a), which authorizes federal civil suits against foreign states \xe2\x80\x9cas to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity\xe2\x80\x9d under another section of the FSIA or under \xe2\x80\x9cany applicable international agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  She further asserts that petitioners are not entitled to immunity under the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexpropriation exception,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71605(a)(3), which expressly exempts from immunity certain cases involving \xe2\x80\x9crights in property taken in violation of international law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioners moved to dismiss based on, <em>inter alia</em>, the two-part claim that (1) as of 1948, when much of their alleged wrongdoing took place, they would have enjoyed absolute sovereign immunity from suit in United States courts, and that (2) nothing in the FSIA retroactively divests them of that immunity.  Rejecting this argument, the District Court concluded, among other things, that the FSIA applies retroactively to pre-1976 actions.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The FSIA applies to conduct, like petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged wrongdoing, that occurred prior to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s 1976 enactment and even prior to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 1952 adoption of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9crestrictive theory\xe2\x80\x9d of sovereign immunity.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court has long deferred to Executive Branch sovereign immunity decisions.  Until 1952, Executive policy was to request immunity in all actions against friendly sovereigns.  In that year, the State Department began to apply the \xe2\x80\x9crestrictive theory,\xe2\x80\x9d whereby immunity is recognized with regard to a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign or public acts, but not its private acts.  Although this change had little impact on federal courts, which continued to abide by the Department\xe2\x80\x99s immunity suggestions, <em>Verlinden B.\xc2\xa0V.</em> v. <em>Central Bank of Nigeria,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/480/index.html">461 U. S. 480</a>, 487, the change threw immunity decisions into some disarray: Foreign nations\xe2\x80\x99 diplomatic pressure sometimes prompted the Department to file suggestions of immunity in cases in which immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory; and when foreign nations failed to ask the Department for immunity, the courts had to determine whether immunity existed, so responsibility for such determinations lay with two different branches, <em>ibid.</em>  To remedy these problems, the FSIA codified the restrictive principle and transferred primary responsibility for immunity determinations to the Judicial Branch.  The Act grants federal courts jurisdiction over civil actions against foreign states and carves out the expropriation and other exceptions to its general grant of immunity.  In any such action, the district court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction depends on the applicability of one of those exceptions.  <em>Id., </em>at 493\xe2\x80\x93494.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This case is not controlled by <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html">511 U. S. 244</a>.  In describing the general presumption against retroactive application of a statute, the Court there declared, <em>inter alia</em>, that, if a federal law enacted after the events in suit does not expressly prescribe its own proper reach but does operate retroactively\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase his liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed\xe2\x80\x94it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring that result<em>.  Id.,</em> at 280.  Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer here.  None of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned above fits the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s clarification of sovereign immunity law.  However, the preliminary conclusion that the FSIA does not appear to \xe2\x80\x9coperate retroactively\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99s default rule creates some tension with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s observation in <em>Verlinden</em> that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute, but a codification of \xe2\x80\x9cthe standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of <em>substantive</em> federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U. S., at 496\xe2\x80\x93497 (emphasis added).  And while the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, that statement by itself falls short of the requisite express prescription.  Thus <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s default rule does not definitively resolve this case.  While <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antiretroactivity presumption aims to avoid unnecessary <em>post hoc</em> changes to legal rules on which private parties relied in shaping their primary conduct, however, foreign sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x99s principal purpose is to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some <em>present</em> protection from the inconvenience of suit, <em>Dole Food Co.</em> v. <em>Patrickson, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/468/index.html">538 U. S. 468</a>, 479.  In this <em>sui generis</em> context, it is more appropriate, absent contraindications, to defer to the most recent decision of the political branches on whether to take jurisdiction, the FSIA, than to presume that decision <em>inapplicable</em> merely because it postdates the conduct in question.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Nothing in the FSIA or the circumstances surrounding its enactment suggests that it should not be applied to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 1948 actions.  Indeed, clear evidence that Congress intended it to apply to preenactment conduct lies in its preamble\xe2\x80\x99s statement that foreign states\xe2\x80\x99 immunity <em>\xe2\x80\x9c[c]laims</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 should <em>henceforth</em> be decided by [American] courts \xe2\x80\xa6 in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71602 (emphasis added).  Though perhaps not sufficient to satisfy <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexpress command\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is unambiguous: Immunity \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not actions protected by immunity, but assertions of immunity to suits arising from those actions\xe2\x80\x94are the relevant conduct regulated by the Act and are \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d to be decided by the courts.  Thus, Congress intended courts to resolve <em>all</em> such claims \xe2\x80\x9cin conformity with [FSIA] principles\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.  The FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s overall structure strongly supports this conclusion: Many of its provisions unquestionably apply to cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Dole Food Co.,</em> <em>supra,</em> and its procedural provisions undoubtedly apply to all pending cases.  In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect.  Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s principal purposes: clarifying the rules judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0This holding is extremely narrow.  The Court does not review the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 determination that \xc2\xa71605(a)(3) applies here, comment on the application of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cact of state\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged wrongdoing, prevent the State Department from filing statements of interest suggesting that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction in particular cases implicating foreign sovereign immunity, or express an opinion on whether deference should be granted such filings in cases covered by the FSIA.  The issue here concerns only the interpretation of the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s reach\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cpure question of statutory construction \xe2\x80\xa6 well within the province of the Judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Cardoza&amp;nbhyph;Fonseca,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/index.html">480 U.

The journalist provided some of that evidence to respondent, who in turn filed this action to recover possession of six Gustav Klimt paintings.  Prior to the Nazi invasion of Austria, the paintings had hung in the palatial Vienna home of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a Czechoslovakian Jew and patron of the arts.  Respondent claims ownership of the paintings under a will executed by her uncle after he fled Austria in 1938.  She alleges that the Gallery obtained possession of the paintings through wrongful conduct in the years during and after World War II.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defendants (petitioners here)\xe2\x80\x94the Republic of Austria and the Austrian Gallery (Gallery), an instrumentality of the Republic\xe2\x80\x94filed a motion to dismiss the complaint asserting, among other defenses, a claim of sovereign immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, 142 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1187 (CD Cal. 2001), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 317 F.\xc2\xa03d 954 (CA9 2002), as amended, 327 F.\xc2\xa03d 1246 (2003).  We granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71602 <em>et seq</em>., which grants foreign states immunity from the jurisdiction of federal and state courts but expressly exempts certain cases, including \xe2\x80\x9ccases \xe2\x80\xa6 in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71605(a)(3), applies to claims that, like respondent\xe2\x80\x99s, are based on conduct that occurred before the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, and even before the United States adopted the so-called \xe2\x80\x9crestrictive theory\xe2\x80\x9d of sovereign immunity in 1952.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/987/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/987/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/987/index.html">539 U. S. 987</a> (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because this case comes to us from the denial of a motion to dismiss on the pleadings, we assume the truth of the following facts alleged in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Born in Austria in 1916, respondent Maria V. Altmann escaped the country after it was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938.  She settled in California in 1942 and became an American citizen in 1945.  She is a niece, and the sole surviving named heir, of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who died in Zurich, Switzerland, on November 13, 1945.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to 1938 Ferdinand, then a wealthy sugar magnate, maintained his principal residence in Vienna, Austria, where the six Klimt paintings and other valuable works of art were housed.  His wife, Adele, was the subject of two of the paintings.  She died in 1925, leaving a will in which she \xe2\x80\x9cask[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d her husband \xe2\x80\x9cafter his death\xe2\x80\x9d to bequeath the paintings to the Gallery.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  App. 187a, \xc2\xb6  ;81.  The attorney for her estate advised the Gallery that Ferdinand intended to comply with his wife\xe2\x80\x99s request, but that he was not legally obligated to do so because he, not Adele, owned the paintings.  Ferdinand never executed any document transferring ownership of any of the paintings at issue to the Gallery.  He remained their sole legitimate owner until his death.  His will bequeathed his entire estate to respondent, another niece, and a nephew.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On March 12, 1938, in what became known as the \xe2\x80\x9cAnschluss,\xe2\x80\x9d the Nazis invaded and claimed to annex Austria.  Ferdinand, who was Jewish and had supported efforts to resist annexation, fled the country ahead of the Nazis, ultimately settling in Zurich.  In his absence, according to the complaint, the Nazis \xe2\x80\x9cAryanized\xe2\x80\x9d the sugar company he had directed, took over his Vienna home, and divided up his artworks, which included the Klimts at issue here, many other valuable paintings, and a 400-piece porcelain collection.  A Nazi lawyer, Dr. Erich F\xc3\xbc  ;hrer, took possession of the six Klimts.  He sold two to the Gallery in 1941[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and a third in 1943, kept one for himself, and sold another to the Museum of the City of Vienna.  The immediate fate of the sixth is not known.  142 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1193.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1946 Austria enacted a law declaring all transactions motivated by Nazi ideology null and void.  This did not result in the immediate return of looted artwork to exiled Austrians, however, because a different provision of Austrian law proscribed export of \xe2\x80\x9cartworks \xe2\x80\xa6 deemed to be important to [the country\xe2\x80\x99s] cultural heritage\xe2\x80\x9d and required anyone wishing to export art to obtain the permission of the Austrian Federal Monument Agency.  App. 168a, \xc2\xb6  ;32.  Seeking to profit from this requirement, the Gallery and the Federal Monument Agency allegedly adopted a practice of \xe2\x80\x9cforc[ing] Jews to donate or trade valuable artworks to the [Gallery] in exchange for export permits for other works.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 168a, \xc2\xb6  ;33.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next year Robert Bentley, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s brother and fellow heir, retained a Viennese lawyer, Dr. Gustav Rinesch, to locate and recover property stolen from Ferdinand during the war.  In January 1948 Dr. Rinesch wrote to the Gallery requesting return of the three Klimts purchased from Dr. F\xc3\xbc  ;hrer.  A Gallery representative responded, asserting\xe2\x80\x94falsely, according to the complaint\xe2\x80\x94\n that Adele had bequeathed the paintings to the Gallery, and the Gallery had merely permitted Ferdinand to retain them during his lifetime.  <em>Id.</em>, at 170a, \xc2\xb6  ;40.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Later the same year Dr. Rinesch enlisted the support of Gallery officials to obtain export permits for many of Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s remaining works of art.  In exchange, Dr. Rinesch, purporting to represent respondent and her fellow heirs, signed a document \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledg[ing] and accept[ing] Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that in the event of his death he wished to follow the wishes of his deceased wife to donate\xe2\x80\x9d the Klimt paintings to the Gallery.  <em>Id</em>., at 177a, \xc2\xb6  ;56.  In addition, Dr. Rinesch assisted the Gallery in obtaining both the painting Dr. F\xc3\xbc  ;hrer had kept for himself and the one he had sold to the Museum of the City of Vienna.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  At no time during these transactions, however, did Dr. Rinesch have respondent\xe2\x80\x99s permission either \xe2\x80\x9cto negotiate on her behalf or to allow the [Gallery] to obtain the Klimt paintings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 178a, \xc2\xb6  ;61.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1998 a journalist examining the Gallery\xe2\x80\x99s files discovered documents revealing that at all relevant times Gallery officials knew that neither Adele nor Ferdinand had, in fact, donated the six Klimts to the Gallery.  The journalist published a series of articles reporting his findings, and specifically noting that Klimt\xe2\x80\x99s first portrait of Adele, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich all the [Gallery] publications represented as having been donated to the museum in 1936,\xe2\x80\x9d had actually been received in 1941, accompanied by a letter from Dr. F\xc3\xbc  ;hrer signed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Heil Hitler.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 181a, \xc2\xb6  ;67.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to these revelations, Austria enacted a new restitution law under which individuals who had been coerced into donating artworks to state museums in exchange for export permits could reclaim their property.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x94who had believed, prior to the journalist\xe2\x80\x99s investigation, that Adele and Ferdinand had \xe2\x80\x9cfreely donated\xe2\x80\x9d the Klimt paintings to the Gallery before the war\xe2\x80\x94\nimmediately sought recovery of the paintings and other artworks under the new law.  <em>Id</em>., at 178a\xe2\x80\x93179a, \xc2\xb6  ;61, 182a.  A committee of Austrian government officials and art historians agreed to return certain Klimt drawings and porcelain settings that the family had donated in 1948.  After what the complaint terms a \xe2\x80\x9csham\xe2\x80\x9d proceeding, however, the committee declined to return the six paintings, concluding, based on an allegedly purposeful misreading of Adele\xe2\x80\x99s will, that her precatory request had created a binding legal obligation that required her husband to donate the paintings to the Gallery on his death.  <em>Id.</em>, at 185a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent then announced that she would file a lawsuit in Austria to recover the paintings.  Because Austrian court costs are proportional to the value of the recovery sought (and in this case would total several million dollars, an amount far beyond respondent\xe2\x80\x99s means), she requested a waiver.  <em>Id.</em>, at 189a.  The court granted this request in part but still would have required respondent to pay approximately $350,000 to proceed.  <em>Ibid</em>.  When the Austrian Government appealed even this partial waiver, respondent voluntarily dismissed her suit and filed this action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint advances eight causes of action and alleges violations of Austrian, international, and California law.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  It asserts jurisdiction under \xc2\xa72 of the FSIA, which grants federal district courts jurisdiction over civil actions against foreign states \xe2\x80\x9cas to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity\xe2\x80\x9d under either another provision of the FSIA or \xe2\x80\x9cany applicable international agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71330(a).  The complaint further asserts that petitioners are not entitled to immunity under the FSIA because the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexpropriation exception,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71605(a)(3), expressly exempts from immunity all cases involving \xe2\x80\x9crights in property taken in violation of international law,\xe2\x80\x9d provided the property has a commercial connection to the United States or the agency or instrumentality that owns the property is engaged in commercial activity here.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss raising several defenses including a claim of sovereign immunity.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Their immunity argument proceeded in two steps.  First, they claimed that as of 1948, when much of their alleged wrongdoing took place, they would have enjoyed absolute immunity from suit in United States courts.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Proceeding from this premise, petitioners next contended that nothing in the FSIA should be understood to divest them of that immunity retroactively.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court rejected this argument, concluding both that the FSIA applies retroactively to pre-1976 actions and that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s expropriation exception extends to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s specific claims.  Only the former conclusion concerns us here.  Presuming that our decision in <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/244/index.html">511 U.

As further support for this finding, the court noted that the FSIA itself provides that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[c]laims of foreign states to immunity should <em>henceforth be decided</em> by courts of the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter.</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid</em>.

The court rested that conclusion on an analysis of American courts\xe2\x80\x99 then-prevalent practice of deferring to case-by-case immunity determinations by the State Department, and on that Department\xe2\x80\x99s expressed policy, as of 1949, of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reliev[ing] American courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of Nazi officials.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  317 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 965 (quoting Press Release No. 296, Jurisdiction of United States Courts Re Suits for Identifiable Property Involved in Nazi Forced Transfers (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/987/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/987/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/987/index.html">539 U.

In that case, the libellants claimed to be the rightful owners of a French ship that had taken refuge in the port of Philadelphia.  The Court first emphasized that the jurisdiction of the United States over persons and property within its territory \xe2\x80\x9cis susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus foreign sovereigns have no right to immunity in our courts.  <em>Id., </em>at 136.  Chief Justice Marshall went on to explain, however, that as a matter of comity, members of the international community had implicitly agreed to waive the exercise of jurisdiction over other sovereigns in certain classes of cases, such as those involving foreign ministers or the person of the sovereign.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Accepting a suggestion advanced by the Executive Branch, see <em>id.</em>, at 134, the Chief Justice concluded that the implied waiver theory also served to exempt the <em>Schooner Exchange</em>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca national armed vessel \xe2\x80\xa6 of the emperor of France\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94from United States courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.  <em>Id</em>.,<em> </em>at 145\xe2\x80\x93146.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In accordance with Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s observation that foreign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity rather than a constitutional requirement, this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cconsistently \xe2\x80\xa6 deferred to the decisions of the political branches\xe2\x80\x94in particular, those of the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x94on whether to take jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over particular actions against foreign sovereigns and their instrumentalities.  <em>Verlinden B.

Until 1952 the Executive Branch followed a policy of requesting immunity in all actions against friendly sovereigns.  461 U. S., at 486.

According to the classical or absolute theory of sovereign immunity, a sovereign cannot, without his consent, be made a respondent in the courts of another sovereign.  According to the newer or restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, the immunity of the sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign or public acts <em>(jure imperii)</em> of a state, but not with respect to private acts <em>(jure gestionis)</em>. \xe2\x80\xa6 [I]t will hereafter be the Department\xe2\x80\x99s policy to follow the restrictive theory \xe2\x80\xa6 in the consideration of requests of foreign governments for a grant of sovereign immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1a, 4a\xe2\x80\x935a.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained in our unanimous opinion in <em>Verlinden</em>, the change in State Department policy wrought by the \xe2\x80\x9cTate Letter\xe2\x80\x9d had little, if any, impact on federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 approach to immunity analyses: \xe2\x80\x9cAs in the past, initial responsibility for deciding questions of sovereign immunity fell primarily upon the Executive acting through the State Department,\xe2\x80\x9d and courts continued to \xe2\x80\x9cabid[e] by\xe2\x80\x9d that Department\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98suggestions of immunity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U. S., at 487.  The change did, however, throw immunity determinations into some disarray, as \xe2\x80\x9cforeign nations often placed diplomatic pressure on the State Department,\xe2\x80\x9d and political considerations sometimes led the Department to file \xe2\x80\x9csuggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 487\xe2\x80\x93488.  Complicating matters further, when foreign nations failed to request immunity from the State\nDepartment:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he responsibility fell to the courts to determine whether sovereign immunity existed, generally by reference to prior State Department decisions. . . . Thus, sovereign immunity determinations were made in two different branches, subject to a variety of factors, sometimes including diplomatic considerations.  Not surprisingly, the governing standards were neither clear nor uniformly applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1976 Congress sought to remedy these problems by enacting the FSIA, a comprehensive statute containing a \xe2\x80\x9cset of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every civil action against a foreign state or its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 488.  The Act \xe2\x80\x9ccodifies, as a matter of federal law, the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., and transfers primary responsibility for immunity determinations from the Executive to the Judicial Branch.  The preamble states that \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d both federal and state courts should decide claims of sovereign immunity in conformity with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s principles.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71602.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act itself grants federal courts jurisdiction over civil actions against foreign states, \xc2\xa71330(a),[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and over diversity actions in which a foreign state is the plaintiff, \xc2\xa71332(a)(4); it contains venue and removal provisions, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71391(f), 1441(d); it prescribes the procedures for obtaining personal jurisdiction over a foreign state, \xc2\xa71330(b); and it governs the extent to which a state\xe2\x80\x99s property may be subject to attachment or execution, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71609\xe2\x80\x931611.  Finally, the Act carves out certain exceptions to its general grant of immunity, including the expropriation exception on which respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint relies.  See <em>supra,</em> at 6\xe2\x80\x937, and n.\xc2\xa05.  These exceptions are central to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s functioning: \xe2\x80\x9cAt the threshold of every action in a district court against a foreign state, \xe2\x80\xa6 the court must satisfy itself that one of the exceptions applies,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9csubject-matter jurisdiction in any such action depends\xe2\x80\x9d on that application.  <em>Verlinden</em>, 461 U.

As noted above, however, we declined to review this aspect of the courts\xe2\x80\x99 opinions, confining our grant of certiorari to the issue of the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s general applicability to conduct that occurred prior to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s 1976 enactment, and more specifically, prior to the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s 1952 adoption of the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2, 8\xe2\x80\x939, and n. 8.  We begin our analysis of that issue by explaining why, contrary to the assumption of the District Court, 142 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1199\xe2\x80\x931201, and Court of Appeals, 317 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 963\xe2\x80\x93967, the default rule announced in our opinion in <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/244/index.html">511 U.

Stat. \xc2\xa71977A, as added, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 U.

The issue forced us to confront the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98apparent tension\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d between our rule that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 511 U.

We noted, for example, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 responsivity to political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Landgraf,</em> 511 U. S., at 266, and that retroactive statutes may upset settled expectations by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tak[ing] away or impair[ing] vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creat[ing] a new obligation, impos[ing] a new duty, or attach[ing] a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 269 (quoting <em>Society for Propagation of the Gospel</em> v. <em>Wheeler</em>, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CCNH 1814) (Story, J.)).  We further observed that these antiretroactivity concerns are most pressing in cases involving \xe2\x80\x9cnew provisions affecting contractual or property rights, matters in which predictability and stability are of prime importance.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 271.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, we sanctioned the application to all pending and future cases of \xe2\x80\x9cintervening\xe2\x80\x9d statutes that merely \xe2\x80\x9cconfe[r] or ous[t] jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 274.  Such application, we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cusually takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Similarly, the \xe2\x80\x9cdiminished reliance interests in matters of procedure\xe2\x80\x9d permit courts to apply changes in procedural rules \xe2\x80\x9cin suits arising before [the rules\xe2\x80\x99] enactment without raising concerns about retroactivity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 275.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Balancing these competing concerns, we described the presumption against retroactive application in the following terms:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court\xe2\x80\x99s first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute\xe2\x80\x99s proper reach.  If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.  When, however, the statute contains no such express command the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, <em>i.e.,</em> whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\xe2\x80\x99s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 280.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer in this case.  Although the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, see<em> infra,</em> at 18, that statement by itself falls short of an \xe2\x80\x9cexpres[s] prescri[ption of] the statute\xe2\x80\x99s proper reach.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under <em>Landgraf</em>, therefore, it is appropriate to ask whether the Act affects substantive rights (and thus would be impermissibly retroactive if applied to preenactment conduct) or addresses only matters of procedure (and thus may be applied to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred).  But the FSIA defies such categorization.  To begin with, none of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned in the above quotation fits the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s clarification of the law of sovereign immunity.  Prior to 1976 foreign states had a justifiable expectation that, as a matter of comity, United States courts would grant them immunity for their public acts (provided the State Department did not recommend otherwise), but they had no \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to such immunity.  Moreover, the FSIA merely opens United States courts to plaintiffs with pre-existing claims against foreign states; the Act neither \xe2\x80\x9cincrease[s those states\xe2\x80\x99] liability for past conduct\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[s] new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 280.  Thus, the Act does not at first appear to \xe2\x80\x9coperate retroactively\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the <em>Landgraf</em> default rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That preliminary conclusion, however, creates some tension with our observation in <em>Verlinden</em> that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute \xe2\x80\x9cconcern[ing] access to the federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d but a codification of \xe2\x80\x9cthe standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of <em>substantive</em> federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U. S., at 496\xe2\x80\x93497 (emphasis added).  Moreover, we noted in <em>Verlinden</em> that in any suit against a foreign sovereign, \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff will be barred from raising his claim in <em>any</em> court in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d unless one of the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions applies, <em>id.</em>, at 497 (emphasis added), and we have stated elsewhere that statutes that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>creat[e]</em> jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d where none otherwise exists \xe2\x80\x9cspea[k] not just to the power of a particular court but to the substantive rights of the parties as well,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/939/index.html">520 U. S. 939</a>, 951 (1997) (emphasis in original).  Such statutes, we continued, \xe2\x80\x9ceven though phrased in \xe2\x80\x98jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x99 terms, [are] as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s default rule does not definitively resolve this case.  In our view, however, <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antiretroactivity presumption, while not strictly confined to cases involving private rights, is most helpful in that context.  Cf. 511 U. S., at 271, n. 25 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he great majority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties\xe2\x80\x9d).  The aim of the presumption is to avoid unnecessary <em>post hoc</em> changes to legal rules on which parties relied in shaping their primary conduct.  But the principal purpose of foreign sovereign immunity has never been to permit foreign states and their instrumentalities to shape their conduct in reliance on the promise of future immunity from suit in United States courts.  Rather, such immunity reflects current political realities and relationships, and aims to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some <em>present</em> \xe2\x80\x9cprotection from the inconvenience of suit as a gesture of comity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dole Food Co.</em> v. <em>Patrickson, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/468/index.html"></a><a href="/us/538/468/index.html">538 U. S. 468</a>, 479 (2003).  Throughout history, courts have resolved questions of foreign sovereign immunity by deferring to the \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions of the political branches \xe2\x80\xa6 on whether to take jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Verlinden,</em> 461 U. S., at 486.  In this <em>sui generis</em> context, we think it more appropriate, absent contraindications, to defer to the most recent such decision\xe2\x80\x94namely, the FSIA\xe2\x80\x94than to presume that decision <em>inapplicable</em> merely because it postdates the conduct in question.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This leaves only the question whether anything in the FSIA or the circumstances surrounding its enactment suggests that we should not apply it to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 1948 actions.  Not only do we answer this question in the negative, but we find clear evidence that Congress intended the Act to apply to preenactment conduct.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, the preamble of the FSIA expresses Congress\xe2\x80\x99 understanding that the Act would apply to all postenactment claims of sovereign immunity.  That section provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Claims</em> of foreign states to immunity should <em>henceforth</em> be decided by courts of the United States and of the States in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71602 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThough perhaps not sufficient to satisfy <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexpress command\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is unambiguous: Immunity \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not actions protected by immunity, but assertions of immunity to suits arising from those actions\xe2\x80\x94are the relevant conduct regulated by the Act;[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] those claims are \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d to be decided by the courts.  As the District Court observed, see <em>supra,</em> at 8 (citing 142 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1201), this language suggests Congress intended courts to resolve <em>all</em> such claims \xe2\x80\x9cin conformity with the principles set forth\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act, regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s overall structure strongly supports this conclusion.  Many of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions unquestionably apply to cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976.  In <em>Dole Food Co.</em> v. <em>Patrickson, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/468/index.html"></a><a href="/us/538/468/index.html">538 U. S. 468</a> (2003), for example, we held that whether an entity qualifies as an \xe2\x80\x9cinstrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s grant of immunity depends on the relationship between the entity and the state at the time suit is brought rather than when the conduct occurred.  In addition, <em>Verlinden</em>, which upheld against constitutional challenge 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71330\xe2\x80\x99s grant of subject-matter jurisdiction, involved a dispute over a contract that predated the Act.  461 U. S., at 482\xe2\x80\x93483, 497.  And there has never been any doubt that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s procedural provisions relating to venue, removal, execution, and attachment apply to all pending cases.  Thus, the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s preamble indicates that it applies \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth,\xe2\x80\x9d and its body includes numerous provisions that unquestionably apply to claims based on pre-1976 conduct.  In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s principal purposes: clarifying the rules that judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims.  We have recognized that, to accomplish these purposes, Congress established a comprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe think that the text and structure of the FSIA demonstrate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intention that the FSIA be the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.  Sections 1604 and 1330(a) work in tandem: \xc2\xa71604 bars federal and state courts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state <em>is</em> entitled to immunity, and \xc2\xa71330(a) confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear suits brought by United States citizens and by aliens when a foreign state is <em>not</em> entitled to immunity.  As we said in <em>Verlinden</em>, the FSIA \xe2\x80\x98must be applied by the district courts in every action against a foreign sovereign, since subject-matter jurisdiction in any such action depends on the existence of one of the specified exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Argentine Republic</em> v. <em>Amerada Hess Shipping Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/428/index.html">488 U. S. 428</a>, 434\xe2\x80\x93435 (1989) (quoting <em>Verlinden</em>, 461 U. S., at 493).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe <em>Amerada Hess</em> respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims concerned conduct that postdated the FSIA, so we had no occasion to consider the Act\xe2\x80\x99s retroactivity.  Nevertheless, our observations about the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s inclusiveness are relevant in this case: Quite obviously, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purposes in enacting such a comprehensive jurisdictional scheme would be frustrated if, in postenactment cases concerning preenactment conduct, courts were to continue to follow the same ambiguous and politically charged \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98standards\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the FSIA replaced.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12 (quoting <em>Verlinden</em>, 461 U. S., at 487).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not endorse the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.  Indeed, we think it engaged in precisely the kind of detailed historical inquiry that the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s clear guidelines were intended to obviate.  Nevertheless, we affirm the panel\xe2\x80\x99s judgment because the Act, freed from <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antiretroactivity presumption, clearly applies to conduct, like petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged wrongdoing, that occurred prior to 1976 and, for that matter, prior to 1952 when the State Department adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude by emphasizing the narrowness of this holding.  To begin with, although the District Court and Court of Appeals determined that \xc2\xa71605(a)(3) covers this case, we declined to review that determination.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2, 8\xe2\x80\x939, and n.\xc2\xa08.  Nor do we have occasion to comment on the application of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cact of state\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged wrongdoing.  Unlike a claim of sovereign immunity, which merely raises a jurisdictional defense, the act of state doctrine provides foreign states with a substantive defense on the merits.  Under that doctrine, the courts of one state will not question the validity of public acts (acts <em>jure imperii)</em> performed by other sovereigns within their own borders, even when such courts have jurisdiction over a controversy in which one of the litigants has standing to challenge those acts.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  See <em>Underhill</em> v. <em>Hernandez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/168/250/index.html">168 U.

S. 398</a>, 401 (1964) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe act of state doctrine in its traditional formulation precludes the courts of this country from inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory\xe2\x80\x9d).  Petitioners principally rely on the act of state doctrine to support their assertion that foreign expropriations are public acts for which, prior to the enactment of the FSIA, sovereigns expected immunity.  Brief for Petitioners 18\xe2\x80\x9320.

S., at 280.  But because the FSIA in no way affects application of the act of state doctrine, our determination that the Act applies in this case in no way affects any argument petitioners may have that the doctrine shields their alleged wrongdoing.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, while we reject the United States\xe2\x80\x99 recommendation to bar application of the FSIA to claims based on pre-enactment conduct, Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em>, nothing in our holding prevents the State Department from filing statements of interest suggesting that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction in particular cases implicating foreign sovereign immunity.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  The issue now before us, to which the Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> is addressed, concerns interpretation of the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s reach\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cpure question of statutory construction \xe2\x80\xa6 well within the province of the Judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Cardoza&amp;nbhyph;Fonseca,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/index.html">480 U.

In contrast, should the State Department choose to express its opinion on the implications of exercising jurisdiction over <em>particular</em> petitioners in connection with <em>their</em> alleged conduct,[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] that opinion might well be entitled to deference as the considered judgment of the Executive on a particular question of foreign policy.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Verlinden,</em> 461 U.

S. 244</a>, 292 (1994) (opinion concurring in judgments, joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ.), I noted our \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent practice of giving immediate effect to statutes that alter a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  I explained this on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of provisions conferring or eliminating jurisdiction is to permit or forbid the exercise of judicial power\xe2\x80\x9d rather than to regulate primary conduct, so that the relevant time for purposes of retroactivity analysis is not when the underlying conduct occurred, but when judicial power was invoked.  <em>Id.</em>, at 293.  Thus, application of a new jurisdictional statute to cases filed after its enactment is not \xe2\x80\x9cretroactive\xe2\x80\x9d even if the conduct sued upon predates the statute.  <em>Ibid.</em>  I noted that this rule applied even when the <em>effect </em>of a jurisdiction-restricting statute in a particular case is to \xe2\x80\x9cdeny a litigant a forum for his claim entirely, or [to] leave him with an alternate forum that will deny relief for some collateral reason.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 292\xe2\x80\x93293 (citations omitted).  The logical corollary of this last statement is that a jurisdiction-expanding statute should be applied to subsequent cases even if it sometimes has the effect of <em>creating</em> a forum where none existed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent rejects this approach and instead undertakes a case-specific inquiry into whether United States courts would have asserted jurisdiction at the time of the underlying conduct.  <em>Post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9315 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  It justifies this approach on the basis of <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/939/index.html">520 U. S. 939</a> (1997).  For reasons noted by the Court, see <em>ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa015, I think reliance on that case is mistaken.  The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and the regime that it replaced, do not by their own force create or modify substantive rights; respondent\xe2\x80\x99s substantive claims are based primarily on California law, see <em>ante</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa04.  Federal sovereign-immunity law limits the jurisdiction of federal and state courts to entertain those claims, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71604\xe2\x80\x931605, but not respondent\xe2\x80\x99s right to seek redress elsewhere.  It is true enough that, as to a claim that no foreign court would entertain, the FSIA can have the accidental effect of rendering enforceable what was previously unenforceable.  But unlike a <em>Hughes Aircraft</em>-type statute, which confers or limits \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in every court where the claim might be brought, the FSIA affects substantive rights only accidentally, and not as a necessary and intended consequence of the law.

Adele Bloch-Bauer died in Vienna in 1925.  Her will asked her husband Ferdinand \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98kindly\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to donate, \xe2\x80\x9cupon his death,\xe2\x80\x9d six Klimt paintings to the Austrian Gallery (Gallery).  A year later, Ferdinand \xe2\x80\x9cformally assured the Austrian probate court that he would honor his wife\xe2\x80\x99s gift.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 2; 317 F.\xc2\xa03d 954, 959 (CA9 2002); 142 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1187, 1192\xe2\x80\x931193 (CD Cal. 2001); Brief for Petitioners 6.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.  When the Nazis seized power in Austria in 1938, Ferdinand fled to Switzerland.  The Nazis took over Bloch-Bauer assets, and a Nazi lawyer, Dr. F\xc3\xbc  ;hrer, liquidated Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s estate.  Dr. F\xc3\xbc  ;hrer disposed of five of the six Klimt paintings as follows: He sold or gave three to the Gallery; he sold one to the Museum of the City of Vienna; and he kept one.  (The sixth somehow ended up in the hands of a private collector who gave it to the Gallery in 1988.)  See <em>ante</em>, at 3; 317 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 959\xe2\x80\x93960.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.  Ferdinand died in Switzerland in 1945. His will did not mention the paintings, but it did name a residuary legatee, namely Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s niece, Maria Altmann, by then an American citizen.  As a residuary legatee Altmann received Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s rights to the paintings.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3; 317 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 960, 968; Brief for Petitioners 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.  In 1948, Bloch-Bauer family members, including Altmann, asked Austria to return a large number of family artworks.  At that time Austrian law prohibited export of \xe2\x80\x9cartworks \xe2\x80\xa6 deemed to be important to Austria\xe2\x80\x99s cultural heritage.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Austria granted Altmann permission to export some works of art <em>in return for </em>Altmann\xe2\x80\x99s recognition, in a legal agreement, of Gallery ownership of the five Klimt paintings.  (The Gallery already had three, the Museum of the City of Vienna transferred the fourth, and the Bloch-Bauer family, having recovered the fifth, which Dr. F\xc3\xbc  ;hrer had kept, donated it to the Gallery.)  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x935; 317 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 960; 142 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1193\xe2\x80\x931195; Brief for Petitioners 6\xe2\x80\x938; App. 168a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05.  Fifty years later, newspaper stories suggested that in 1948 the Gallery had followed a policy of asserting ownership of Nazi-looted works of art that it did not own.  Austria then enacted a restitution statute allowing individuals to reclaim properties that were subject to any such false assertion of ownership or coerced donation in exchange for export permits.  The statute also created an advisory board to determine the validity of restitution claims.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5; 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 1195\xe2\x80\x931196; Brief for Petitioners 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa06.  In 1999, Altmann brought claims for restitution of several items including the five Klimt paintings.  She told the advisory board that, in 1948, her lawyer had wrongly told her that the Gallery owned the five Klimt paintings irrespective of Nazi looting (title flowing from Adele\xe2\x80\x99s will or Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s statement of donative intent to the probate court).  In her view, her 1948 agreement amounted to a coerced donation. The advisory board ordered some items returned (16 Klimt drawings and 19 porcelain settings); but found that the 5 Klimt paintings belonged to the Gallery.  See 317 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 960\xe2\x80\x93962; 142 F.\xc2\xa0Supp 2d, at 1195\xe2\x80\x931196; Brief for Petitioners 8, and n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa07.  Altmann then brought this lawsuit against the Gallery, an agency or instrumentality of the Austrian Government, in federal court in Los Angeles.  She seeks return of the five Klimt paintings.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us does not concern the legal validity of title passed through Nazi looting.  Austria nowhere condones or bases its claim of ownership upon any such activity.  Rather, its legal claim to the paintings rests upon any or all of the following: Adele\xe2\x80\x99s 1925 will, Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s probate-court confirmation, and Altmann\xe2\x80\x99s 1948 agreement.  Nor does the locus of the lawsuit in Los Angeles reflect any legal determination about the merits of Austrian legal procedures.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at  5\xe2\x80\x936.  The Court of Appeals rejected Austria\xe2\x80\x99s <em>forum non conveniens</em> claim, not because of the Austrian courts\xe2\x80\x99 required posting of a $135,000 filing fee that is potentially refundable, App. 229a\xe2\x80\x93231a, but mainly because of Altmann\xe2\x80\x99s age, 317 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 973\xe2\x80\x93974.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sole issue before us is whether the \xe2\x80\x9cexpropriation exception\xe2\x80\x9d of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a)(3), withdrawing an otherwise applicable sovereign immunity defense, applies to this case.  The exception applies to \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and to any \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d of a foreign state.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71603, 1605(a)(3).  The exception deprives the entity of the sovereign immunity that the law might otherwise entitle it \xe2\x80\x9cin any case,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71605, where that entity \xe2\x80\x9cis engaged in a commercial activity in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d <em>and</em> the case is one \xe2\x80\x9cin which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71605(a)(3). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is conceded that the Gallery is an \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d of a foreign state, namely the Republic of Austria.  Nor can Austria now deny that the Gallery is \xe2\x80\x9cengaged in commercial activity in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The lower courts held that the Gallery\xe2\x80\x99s publishing and advertising activities satisfy this condition.  317 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 968\xe2\x80\x93\n969; 142 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1204\xe2\x80\x931205.  And our grant of certiorari did not embrace that aspect of the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 decision.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/987/index.html">539 U. S. 987</a> (2003); see <em>ante</em>, at 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what about the last element: Is this a \xe2\x80\x9ccase in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue\xe2\x80\x9d?  Altmann claims that Austria\xe2\x80\x99s 1948 actions (falsely asserting ownership of the paintings and extorting export permits in return for acknowledge of its ownership) violated either customary international law or a 1907 Hague Convention.  App. 203\xe2\x80\x93204; Brief for Respondent 4, 35; Hague Convention (IV) on the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Oct. 18, 1907, in 1 Dept. of State, Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776\xe2\x80\x931949, pp. 631, 653 (C. Bevans comp. 1968) (\xe2\x80\x9cAll seizure of \xe2\x80\xa6 works of art \xe2\x80\xa6 is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Austria replies that, even so, this part of the statute is not \xe2\x80\x9cretroactive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Austria means that \xc2\xa71605(a)(3), the expropriation exception, does not apply to events that occurred in 1948, almost 30 years before the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  The upshot is that if the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s general rule of immunity, \xc2\xa71604, applies retroactively to events in 1948 (as is undisputed here), but the expropriation exception, \xc2\xa71605(a)(3), does not apply retroactively, then the Gallery can successfully assert its sovereign immunity defense, preventing Altmann from pursuing her claim.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question, then, is whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s expropriation exception applies to takings that took place many years before its enactment.  The Court notes that Congress, when enacting the FSIA in 1976, wrote that the Act should \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d apply to any <em>claim</em> brought thereafter.  \xc2\xa71602; <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  The dissent believes that there is no logical inconsistency between an act that applies \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d and a reading of \xc2\xa71605(a)(3) that limits it to \xe2\x80\x9crights in property <em>taken after this Act came into force</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  I agree with the dissent that the word \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d (and similar words) cannot resolve this disagreement by themselves.  Nonetheless several additional considerations convince me that the Court is correct.  As Altmann argues, Congress intended the expropriation exception to apply retroactively, removing a defense of sovereign immunity where \xe2\x80\x9crights in property\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9ctaken in violation of international law,\xe2\x80\x9d irrespective of when that taking occurred.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First</em>, the literal language of the statute supports Altmann.  Several similar statutes and conventions limit their temporal reach by explicitly stating, for example, that the Act does \xe2\x80\x9cnot apply to proceedings <em>in respect of matters that occurred before the date of the coming into force of this Act</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  State Immunity Act 1978, \xc2\xa723(3), 10 Halsbury\xe2\x80\x99s Statutes 829, 845 (4th ed. 2001 reissue) (U.\xc2\xa0K.) (emphasis added); see also State Immunity Act 1979, \xc2\xa71(2) (Singapore); Foreign States Immunities Act, 1985, \xc2\xa77(1) (Austl.); European Convention on State Immunity, Art. 35(3).  The 1976 Act says nothing explicitly suggesting any such limitation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, the legal concept of sovereign immunity, as traditionally applied, is about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>status</em> at the time of suit, not about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>conduct</em> before the suit.  Thus King Farouk\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign status permitted him to ignore Christian Dior\xe2\x80\x99s payment demand for 11 \xe2\x80\x9cfrocks and coats\xe2\x80\x9d bought (while king) for his wife; but once the king lost his royal status, Christian Dior could sue and collect (for clothes sold <em>before </em>the abdication).  See <em>Ex-King Farouk of Egypt</em> v. <em>Christian Dior</em>, 84 Clunet 717, 24 I.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R. 228, 229 (CA Paris 1957) (Christian Dior \xe2\x80\x9cis entitled \xe2\x80\xa6 to bring\xe2\x80\x9d the ex-King to court \xe2\x80\x9cto answer for debts contracted\xe2\x80\x9d before his abdication \xe2\x80\x9cwhen, as from the date of his abdication, he is no longer entitled to claim \xe2\x80\xa6 immunity\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cHea[d] of State\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Queen</em> v. <em>Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate </em>(<em>Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte</em>), 1 App. Cas. 147, 201\xe2\x80\x93202 (1999) (opinion of Lord Browne-Wilkinson) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he head of state is entitled to the same immunity as the state itself\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. He too loses immunity ratione personae on ceasing to be head of state\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Ter K.</em> v. <em>The Netherlands, Surinam &amp; Indonesia</em>, 18 I.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R. 223 (DC Hague 1951) (affording Indonesia sovereign immunity after it became independent while the suit was pending).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, just last Term, we unanimously reaffirmed this classic principle when we held that a now-private corporation could not assert sovereign immunity, even though the events in question took place while a foreign government was its owner.  <em>Dole Food Co. </em>v. <em>Patrickson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/468/index.html">538 U. S. 468</a>, 479 (2003).  We added that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]oreign sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x9d is not about \xe2\x80\x9cchilling\xe2\x80\x9d or not chilling \xe2\x80\x9cforeign states or their instrumentalities in the conduct of their business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  Rather, the objective of the \xe2\x80\x9csovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine (in contrast to other <em>conduct</em>-related immunity doctrines) is simply to give foreign states and instrumentalities \xe2\x80\x9csome protection,\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of suit, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the inconvenience of suit as a gesture of comity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  Compare conduct-related immunity discussed in, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/731/index.html">457 U. S. 731</a>, 749 (1982) (absolute official immunity), <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U.

For example, in 1952, the Department issued the Tate Letter adopting a restrictive view of sovereign immunity, essentially holding foreign sovereign immunity inapplicable in respect to a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s <em>commercial</em> activity.

As the dissent acknowledges:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the Tate Letter\xe2\x80\x99s issuance, the Executive evaluated suits involving <em>pre-Tate Letter conduct under the Letter\xe2\x80\x99s new standard</em> when determining whether to submit suggestions of immunity to the courts.  The Court, likewise, seems to have understood the Tate Letter to require this sort of application.

Such actual reliance could not possibly exist in fact.

To suggest any such possibility, in respect to the expropriations carried out by the Nazi or Communist regimes, or any other such as I am aware, would approach the realm of fantasy.  While the matter is less clear in respect to less dramatic, more individualized, takings, I still find any actual reliance difficult to imagine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More likely, the dissent is thinking in terms of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable reliance,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 10, a legal construct designed to protect against unfairness.  But a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on future immunity here would have been unreasonable, hence no such protection is warranted.  A legally aware King Farouk or any of his counterparts would have or should have known that foreign sovereign immunity respects current status; it does not protect past conduct.  And its application is a matter, not of legal right, but of \xe2\x80\x9cgrace and comity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Verlinden</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 486; see also <em>Dole</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 479; <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the dissent itself ignores \xe2\x80\x9creliance\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as it assumes an expropriating nation\xe2\x80\x99s awareness that the Executive Branch could intervene and change the rules, for example, by promulgating the Tate Letter and applying it retroactively to pre-Tate Letter conduct.  Compare <em>post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, with Brief for Petitioners 11 (Austria expected absolute immunity in 1948), and Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 8 (same).  Nor does the dissent convincingly explain why, if the Executive Branch can change the scope of foreign sovereign immunity with retroactive effect, Congress (with Executive Branch approval) cannot \xe2\x80\x9ccodify\xe2\x80\x9d Executive Branch efforts.

The Solicitor General, on behalf of the United States, proposes a solution that may, at first glance, seem simple: Choose the date of the FSIA, roughly 1976, as a cutoff date and apply the \xc2\xa71605(a)(3) exception only to property \xe2\x80\x9ctaken\xe2\x80\x9d after that time.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  But the Solicitor General himself complicates the proposal by pointing out, correctly, that each of the different activities described in each of the separate paragraphs of \xc2\xa71605(a) evolved from different common law origins and consequently might demand a different cutoff date.  <em>Ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9ccommercial activity exception\xe2\x80\x9d applies to events arising after 1952; \xe2\x80\x9cwaiver exception\xe2\x80\x9d applies to all events).  Moreover, the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on the expropriation exception would give immunity to some entities that, before the FSIA, might not have expected immunity at all (say, because they were not then considered \xe2\x80\x9csovereign\xe2\x80\x9d).  Compare \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71603\xe2\x80\x931604 with Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa766(g), Comment <em>c</em>, and Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Note 2 (1965) (government corporations only entitled to immunity if exercising public functions); Harvard Research in International Law 483 (1932) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe use of the term \xe2\x80\x98State\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 results in excluding political subdivisions \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s solution is even more complicated.  It does not choose a cutoff date at all, but would remand for the lower courts to determine whether Austria\xe2\x80\x99s 1948 conduct would have fallen outside the scope of sovereign immunity under the Tate Letter\xe2\x80\x99s view of the matter.  <em>Post</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  Of course, Austria in 1948 could not possibly have relied on the Tate Letter, issued four years later.  But, more importantly, consider the historical inquiry the dissent sets for the courts: Determine in the year 2004 what the State Department in the years 1952\xe2\x80\x931976 would have thought about the Tate Letter as applied to the actions of an Austrian museum taken in the year 1948.  That inquiry does not only demand rarified historical speculation, it also threatens to create the very kind of legal uncertainty that the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactors hoped to put to rest.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71602 <em>et seq</em>.  As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s careful opinion illustrates, the case is difficult.  In my respectful view, however, its decision is incorrect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the outset, here is a summary of my primary concerns with the majority opinion: To reach its conclusion the Court must weaken the reasoning and diminish the force of the rule against the retroactivity of statutes, a rule of fairness based on respect for expectations; the Court abruptly tells foreign nations this important principle of American law is unavailable to them in our courts; this is so despite the fact that treaties and agreements on the subject of expropriation have been reached against a background of the immunity principles the Court now rejects; as if to mitigate its harsh result, the Court adds that the Executive Branch has inherent power to intervene in cases like this; this, however, is inconsistent with the congressional purpose and design of the FSIA; the suggestion reintroduces, to an even greater degree than before, the same influences the FSIA sought to eliminate from sovereign immunity determinations; the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning also implies a problematic answer to a separation-of-powers question that the case does not present and that should be avoided; the ultimate effect of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inviting foreign nations to pressure the Executive is to risk inconsistent results for private citizens who sue, based on changes and nuances in foreign affairs, and to add prospective instability to the most sensitive area of foreign relations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of our retroactivity principles, its rejection of the considered congressional and Executive judgment behind the FSIA, and its questionable constitutional implications require this respectful dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s passage followed 10 years of academic and legislative effort to establish a consistent framework for the determination of sovereign immunity when foreign nations are haled into our courts.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x93\n1487, p.\xc2\xa09 (1976) (hereinafter H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.).  As we explained in <em>Verlinden B. V.</em> v. <em>Central Bank of Nigeria,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/480/index.html">461 U. S. 480</a> (1983), the preceding 30 years had been marked by an emerging or common-law regime in which courts followed the principles set out in the letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, U. S. Dept. of State, to Acting U. S. Attorney General Philip B. Perlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull. 984\xe2\x80\x93985 (1952) (hereinafter Tate Letter or Letter).  See <em>ante</em>, at 11.  Even after the Tate Letter, however, courts continued to defer to the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s case-specific views on whether immunity was due.  See <em>Verlinden</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 487\xe2\x80\x93488.  This regime created \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable uncertainty,\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 9, and a \xe2\x80\x9ctroublesome\xe2\x80\x9d inconsistency in immunity determinations, 461 U. S., at 487.  The inconsistency was the predictable result of changes in administrations and shifting political pressures.  Congress acted to bring order to this legal uncertainty: \xe2\x80\x9c[U]niformity in decision \xe2\x80\xa6 is desirable since a disparate treatment of cases involving foreign governments may have adverse foreign relations consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at\xc2\xa013.  See also <em>id.,</em> at\xc2\xa07 (The \xe2\x80\x9c[FSIA] is urgently needed legislation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress placed even greater emphasis on the implications that inconsistency had for our citizens, concluding that the Act was needed to \xe2\x80\x9creduc[e] the foreign policy implications of immunity determinations and assur[e] litigants that these often crucial decisions are made on purely legal grounds and under procedures that insure due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no dispute that Congress enacted the FSIA to answer these problems, for the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is codified along with its governing provisions.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71602.  To this end, the Act provides specific principles by which courts are to decide claims for foreign sovereign immunity.  See ibid.</em>  So structured, the Act sought to implement its objectives by removing the Executive influence from the standard determination of sovereign immunity questions.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 7 (under the FSIA \xe2\x80\x9cU. S. immunity practice would conform to the practice in virtually every other country\xe2\x80\x94where sovereign immunity decisions are made exclusively by the courts and not by a foreign affairs agency\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question is whether the courts, by applying the statutory principles the FSIA announced, will impose a retroactive effect in a case involving conduct that occurred over 50 years ago, and nearly 30 years before the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  It is our general rule not to apply a statute if its application will impose a retroactive effect on the litigants.  See <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html">511 U. S. 244</a> (1994).  This is not a rule announced for the first time in <em>Landgraf;</em> it is an old and well-established principle.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a principle in the <em>English</em> common law, as ancient as the law itself, that a statute, even of its omnipotent parliament, is not to have a retrospective effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dash</em> v. <em>Van Kleeck</em>, 7 Johns. 477, 503 (N.\xc2\xa0Y. 1811) (Kent, C.\xc2\xa0J.); see also <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 265 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic\xe2\x80\x9d).  The principle stems from fundamental fairness concerns.  See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cElementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The single acknowledged exception to the rule against retroactivity is when the statute itself, by a clear statement, requires it.  See <em>id.,</em> at 264 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congressional enactments . . . will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Georgetown Univ. Hospital,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/204/index.html">488 U. S. 204</a>, 208 (1988))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FSIA does not meet this exception because it contains no clear statement requiring retroactive effect.  The majority concedes this at the outset of its analysis, saying the text of the FSIA \xe2\x80\x9cfalls short of an \xe2\x80\x98expres[s] prescri[ption of] the statute\xe2\x80\x99s proper reach.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Landgraf</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 280).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an awkward twist, however, the Court also maintains that the \xe2\x80\x9c[Act\xe2\x80\x99s] language is unambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19, and that it \xe2\x80\x9csuggests Congress intended courts to resolve <em>all </em>[foreign sovereign immunity] claims \xe2\x80\x98in conformity with the principles set forth\xe2\x80\x99 in the Act, regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  If the statute were in fact this clear, the exception would apply.  Nothing in our cases suggests that statutory language might be \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d yet still \xe2\x80\x9cnot sufficient to satisfy <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98express command.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  If the Court really thinks the statute is unambiguous, it should rest on that premise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the FSIA does command retroactive application unambiguously is not right.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71602 takes the pertinent \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d language in isolation.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x93\n19.  When that language instead is read in the context of the full section, it is quite clear that it does not speak to retroactivity.  The section is as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cCongress finds that the determination by United States courts of the claims of foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction of such courts would serve the interests of justice and would protect the rights of both foreign states and litigants in United States courts.  Under international law, states are not immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned, and their commercial property may be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments rendered against them in connection with their commercial activities.  Claims of foreign states to immunity should henceforth be decided by courts of the United States and of the States in conformity with the principles set forth in this [statute].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe first two sentences in \xc2\xa71602 describe the Act\xe2\x80\x99s intention to replace the former framework for sovereign immunity determinations with a new court-controlled regime.  The third sentence, which contains the \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d phrase, serves to make clear that the new regime replaces the old regime from that point on.  Compare \xc2\xa71602 (\xe2\x80\x9cimmunity [claims] should henceforth be decided by [American] courts . . . in conformity with the [Act\xe2\x80\x99s] principles\xe2\x80\x9d), with Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1056 (1976) (defining \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cfrom this point on\xe2\x80\x9d).  That does not address the topic of retroactivity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s principles were that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Act shall govern all claims, whenever filed, and involving conduct that occurred whenever in time,\xe2\x80\x9d the provision would command retroactive application.  A statement like this, however, cannot be found in the FSIA.  The statute says only that it must be applied \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth.\xe2\x80\x9d  That says no more than that the principles immediately apply from the point of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s effective date on, the same type of command that <em>Landgraf</em> rejected as grounds for an express command of retroactive application.  Cf. 511 U. S., at 257 (analyzing a statutory provision that provided it was to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98take effect upon enactment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  As Justice Stevens noted for the Court in that case: \xe2\x80\x9cA statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order for the term \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d to command retroactivity, it would have to be accompanied by reference to specific proceedings or claims (<em>i.e.</em>, specific as to when they were commenced, if they are pending, or when they were determined).  To confirm this one need only compare the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s isolated use of the term \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d to those statutory provisions that have been interpreted to require retroactive effect.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Carpenter</em> v. <em>Wabash R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/309/23/index.html">309 U. S. 23</a>, 27 (1940) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe statute applies to \xe2\x80\x98equity receiverships of railroad corporations now \xe2\x80\xa6 pending in any court of the United States\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Freeborn</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> 2 Wall. 160, 162 (1865) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all cases of appeal \xe2\x80\xa6 heretofore prosecuted and now pending in the Supreme Court of the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 may be heard and determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 255\xe2\x80\x93256 (explaining that before the FSIA was enacted, another bill was passed by Congress but vetoed by the President with \xe2\x80\x9clanguage expressly calling for [retroactive] application of many of its provisions\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 255, n. 8 (citing the following example of a provision containing an express command for retroactive applications: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[These] sections \xe2\x80\xa6 shall apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of the enactment of this Act\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  On its own, \xe2\x80\x9chenceforth\xe2\x80\x9d does not speak with the precision and clarity necessary to command retroactivity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intention as to retroactivity can be measured by the fact that the FSIA does not bear the same language as some other statutes and conventions Congress has authored does not change the analysis.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5 (concurring opinion).  To accept that interpretive approach is to abandon our usual insistence on a clear statement.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the FSIA does not exempt itself from the usual rule against retroactivity with a clear statement, our cases require that we consider the character of the statute, and of the rights and liabilities it creates, to determine if its application will impose retroactive effect on the parties.  See <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 280 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen . . . the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, <em>i.e.,</em> whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\xe2\x80\x99s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed\xe2\x80\x9d).  If it does, we must refuse to apply it in that manner.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The essential character of the FSIA is jurisdictional.  The conclusion that it allows (or denies) jurisdiction follows from the language of the statute.  See \xc2\xa71602 (the Act involves \xe2\x80\x9cthe determination by United States courts of the claims of foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction of such courts\xe2\x80\x9d).  By denying immunity in certain classes of cases\xe2\x80\x94those in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s succeeding provisions\xe2\x80\x94the FSIA, in effect, grants jurisdiction over those disputes.  The Court as much as admits all this, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cthe FSIA \xe2\x80\xa6 opens United States courts to plaintiffs with pre-existing claims against foreign states.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s mechanism of establishing jurisdictional effects (<em>i.e.</em>, either allowing jurisdiction or denying it) has important implications for the retroactivity question.  On the one hand, jurisdictional statutes, as a class, tend not to impose retroactive effect.  As the Court explained in <em>Landgraf</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cApplication of a new jurisdictional rule usually \xe2\x80\x98takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.\xe2\x80\x99  Present law normally governs in such situations because jurisdictional statutes \xe2\x80\x98speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of the parties.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 274 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, there is a subclass of statutes that, though jurisdictional, do impose retroactive effect.  These are statutes that confer jurisdiction where before there was none.  That is, they altogether create jurisdiction.  We explained the distinction in a unanimous opinion in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cStatutes merely addressing which</em> court shall have jurisdiction to entertain a particular cause of action can fairly be said merely to regulate the secondary conduct of litigation and not the underlying primary conduct of the parties.  Such statutes affect only <em>where</em> a suit may be brought, not <em>whether</em> it may be brought at all.  The 1986 amendment, however, does not merely allocate jurisdiction among forums.  Rather, it <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed; it thus speaks not just to the power of a particular court but to the substantive rights of the parties as well.  Such a statute, even though phrased in \xe2\x80\x98jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x99 terms, is as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.\xe2\x80\x9d  <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/939/index.html">520 U. S. 939</a>, 951 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principles of <em>Hughes Aircraft</em> establish that retroactivity analysis of a jurisdictional statute is incomplete unless it asks whether the provision confers jurisdiction where there was none before.  Again, this is common ground between the majority and this dissent.  The majority recognizes the import of <em>Hughes Aircraft</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding and affirms that courts may not apply statutes that confer jurisdiction over a cause of action for which no jurisdiction existed when the sued-upon conduct occurred.  \xe2\x80\x9cSuch statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98even though phrased in \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d terms, [are] as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other[s].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 17 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Hughes Aircraft</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 951).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the FSIA creates new jurisdiction, <em>Hughes Aircraft</em> controls and instructs us not to apply it to cases involving preenactment conduct.  On the other hand, if the FSIA did not create new jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94including where it in fact stripped previously existing jurisdiction from the courts\xe2\x80\x94\nwe may apply its statutory terms without fear of working any retroactive effect.  See <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 342\xe2\x80\x93343, n. 3 (1997) (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., joined by Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough in <em>Hughes Aircraft</em> we recently rejected a presumption favoring retroactivity for jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> statutes, nothing in <em>Hughes</em> disparaged our longstanding practice of applying jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> statutes to pending cases\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To this point, then, I am in agreement with the Court on certain relevant points\xe2\x80\x94the FSIA does not contain a clear retroactivity command; the statute is jurisdictional in nature; and jurisdictional statutes impose retroactive effect when they confer jurisdiction where none before existed.  Now, however, our paths diverge.  For though the majority concedes these critical issues, it does not address the question to which they lead: Does the FSIA confer jurisdiction where before there was none?  Rather than asking that obvious question, the Court retreats to non sequitur.  After this recitation of the <em>Hughes Aircraft </em>rule and with no causal reasoning from it, the Court concludes: \xe2\x80\x9cThus, <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s default rule does not definitively resolve this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  It requires a few steps to undertake the analysis the Court omits, but in the end the proper conclusion is that, assuming the court on remand found immunity existed under the pre-FSIA regime, the statute does create jurisdiction where there was none before.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The analysis begins with 1948, when the conduct occurred.  See <em>INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html">533 U. S. 289</a>, 321 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he judgment whether a particular statute acts retroactively \xe2\x80\x98should be informed and guided by \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Hadix, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/343/index.html">527 U. S. 343</a>, 358 (1999) (in turn quoting <em>Landgraf</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 270))).  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 expectations were then formed by an emerging or common law framework governing claims of foreign sovereign immunity in American courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Parties in 1948 would have expected courts to apply this general law of foreign sovereign immunity in the future, and so also to apply whatever rules the courts \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovered\xe2\x80\x9d (if one subscribes to Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s view of common law) or \xe2\x80\x9ccreated\xe2\x80\x9d (if one subscribes to Holmes\xe2\x80\x99) in the intervening time between the party\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and its being subject to suit.  Compare 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *68 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he only method of proving, that this or that maxim is a rule of the common law, is by shewing that it hath been always the custom to observe it\xe2\x80\x9d), with Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 457, 466 (1897) (\xe2\x80\x9cBehind the logical form [of common law decision making] lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legislative grounds, often an inarticulate and unconscious judgment, it is true, and yet the very root and nerve of the whole proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d).  To conduct the analysis, then, we should ask how the jurisdictional effects the FSIA creates compare to those that would govern were the prior regime still in force.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is little dispute that in 1948 foreign sovereigns, and all other litigants, understood foreign sovereign immunity law to support three valid expectations.  (1) Nations could expect that a baseline rule of sovereign immunity would apply.  (2) They could expect that if the Executive made a statement on the issue of sovereign immunity that would be controlling.  And (3), they could expect that they would be able to petition the Executive for intervention on their behalf.  See <em>National City Bank of N. Y.</em> v. <em>Republic of China</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/356/index.html">348 U. S. 356</a>, 358\xe2\x80\x93361 (1955) (summing up the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to sovereign immunity questions); <em>id.,</em> at 366\xe2\x80\x93368 (Reed, J., dissenting) (summing up the same principles).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These three expectations were little different in 1976, before the FSIA was passed.  The Tate Letter did announce the policy of restrictive foreign sovereign immunity, and this was an important doctrinal development.  The policy, however, was within the second expectation that the Executive could shape the framework for foreign sovereign immunity.  Under the second category, a foreign sovereign would have expected its immunity to be controlled by such a statement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Executive\xe2\x80\x99s post-Tate Letter practices and a statement by the Court confirm this is the correct way to understand both the operation of the general law of foreign relations and the expectations it built.  After the Tate Letter\xe2\x80\x99s issuance, the Executive evaluated suits involving pre-Tate Letter conduct under the Letter\xe2\x80\x99s new standard when determining whether to submit suggestions of immunity to the courts.  The Court, likewise, seems to have understood the Tate Letter to require this sort of application.  In <em>National City Bank of N. Y.</em>, the Court suggested that the Letter governed in a case involving pre-1952 conduct, though careful consideration of the question was unnecessary there.  348 U. S., at 361.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The governing weight the Tate Letter had as a statement of Executive policy does not detract from the third expectation foreign sovereigns continued to have\xe2\x80\x94that they could petition the Executive for case-specific statements.  Thus, in <em>National City Bank of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em> the Court took note that the Government had not submitted a case-specific suggestion as to immunity.  See <em>id.,</em> at 364 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur State Department neither has been asked nor has it given the slightest intimation that in its judgment allowance of counterclaims in such a situation would embarrass friendly relations with the Republic of China\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, to measure a foreign sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of liability for conduct committed in 1948, the Court should apply the three discussed, interlocking principles of law, which the parties then expected.  The Court of Appeals did not address the question in this necessary manner.  Rather than determining how the jurisdictional result produced by the FSIA differs from the result a court would reach if it applied the legal principles that governed before the enactment of the FSIA, the court instead asked what the Executive would have done in 1948.  See 317 F.\xc2\xa03d 954, 965 (CA9 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cDetermining whether the FSIA may properly be applied thus turns on the question whether Austria could legitimately expect to receive immunity from the executive branch of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is not the appropriate way to measure Austria\xe2\x80\x99s expectations.  It is an unmanageable inquiry; and it usurps the authority the Executive, as it is constituted today, has under the pre-FSIA regime.  In essence, the Court of Appeals wrongly assumed responsibility for the political question, rather than confining its judgment to the legal one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Answering the legal question, in contrast, requires applying the principles noted above: We assume a baseline of sovereign immunity and then look to see if there is any Executive statement on the sovereign immunity issue that displaces the presumption of immunity.  There is, of course, at least one Executive statement on the issue that displaces the immunity presumption to some degree.  It is the Tate Letter itself.  By the Tate Letter the Executive established, as a general rule, that the doctrine of restrictive sovereign immunity would be followed.  In general, the doctrine provided immunity for suits involving public acts and denied it for suits involving commercial or private acts.  26 Dept. State Bull., at 984.  These principles control, as the Executive has taken no case-specific position in the instant matter.  If petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct would not be subject to suit under the Tate Letter principles, the FSIA cannot alter that result without imposing retroactive effect, creating new jurisdiction in American courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners and the United States, appearing as <em>amicus</em> <em>curiae</em>, argue that the Tate Letter doctrine would grant immunity (<em>i.e.,</em> deny jurisdiction) for suits involving expropriation.  They say the Tate Letter rules contain no\nprinciple that parallels \xc2\xa71605(a)(3), the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s expropriation exception on which respondent relies to establish jurisdiction:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe expropriation exception \xe2\x80\xa6 was a new development in the doctrine of sovereign immunity when the FSIA was enacted\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [I]n <em>Victory Transport Inc</em>. v. <em>Comisaria General de Abastecimientos y Transportes</em>, 336 F.\xc2\xa02d 354 (CA2 1964), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/934/index.html">381 U. S. 934</a> (1965)[,] [t]he court explained that, even under the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, foreign states continued to enjoy immunity with respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 suits respecting the \xe2\x80\x98nationalization\xe2\x80\x99 of property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis argument may be correct in the end; but, it should be noted, the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on <em>Victory Transport, Inc</em>. v. <em>Comisaria General</em>,<em> </em>336 F.\xc2\xa02d 354 (CA2 1964), is not conclusive.  <em>Victory Transport</em> does not say that nationalizations of property are <em>per se</em> exempt under the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity is to try to accommodate the interest of individuals doing business with foreign governments in having their legal rights determined by the courts, with the interest of foreign governments in being free to perform certain political acts without undergoing the embarrassment or hindrance of defending the propriety of such acts before foreign courts\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Such [immune] acts are generally limited to the following categories:</p>\n<p align="left">.     .     .     .     .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) legislative acts, such as nationalization.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at at 360 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs the court\xe2\x80\x99s language makes clear, the pertinent category of exempt action is legislative action, of which nationalization was but one example.  The expropriation alleged in this case was not a legislative act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners can still prevail by showing that there would have been no jurisdiction under the pre-FSIA governing principles.  That could be established by showing that the conduct at issue was considered a public act under those principles and that the principles contain no expropriation exception similar to that codified in \xc2\xa71605(a)(3), which would deny otherwise available immunity.  We need not, and ought not, resolve the question in the first instance.  Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals has yet addressed it.  The issue is complex and would benefit from more specific briefing, arguments, and consideration of the international law sources bearing upon the scope of immunity the Tate Letter announced.  I would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings to consider the question.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By declaring that this statute is not subject to the usual presumption against retroactivity, and so avoiding the critical issue in this case, the Court puts the force and the validity of our precedent in <em>Hughes Aircraft</em> into serious question.  The Court, in rejecting the usual analysis, states three rationales to justify its approach.  The\narguments neither distinguish this case from <em>Hughes Aircraft </em>nor suffice to explain rejecting the rule against retroactivity.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court suggests the retroactivity analysis should not apply because the rights at issue are not private rights.  See <em>ante,</em> at 17 (\xe2\x80\x9c[The] antiretroactivity presumption, while not strictly confined to cases involving private rights, is most helpful in that context\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is unconvincing.  First, the language from <em>Landgraf</em> on which the Court relies undercuts its position.  It confirms, in clear terms, that retroactivity presumptions work equally in favor of governments.  Per Justice Stevens, the Court said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the great majority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties, we have applied the presumption in cases involving new monetary obligations that fell only on the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 271, n. 25.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if <em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reference to private rights could be read to establish that retroactivity analysis does not strictly protect government\xe2\x80\x94and I do not see how that is possible in light of the above-quoted language\xe2\x80\x94the <em>Landgraf</em> passage refers to the Federal Government.  If the distinction mattered for retroactivity purposes, presumably it would have been on the basis that Congress, by virtue of authoring the legislation, is itself fully capable of protecting the Federal Government from having its rights degraded by retroactive laws.  Private parties, it might be said, do not have the same built-in assurance.  Here, of course, the Federal Government is not a party; instead a foreign government is.  Foreign governments are as vulnerable as private parties to the disruption caused by retroactive laws.  Indeed, foreign sovereigns may have less recourse than private parties to prevent or remedy retroactive legislation, since they cannot hold Congress responsible through the election process.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s private-rights argument, therefore, does not sustain its departure from our usual presumption against retroactivity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority tries to justify departing from our usual principles in a second way.  It argues that the purposes of foreign sovereign immunity are not concerned with allowing \xe2\x80\x9cforeign states and their instrumentalities to shape their conduct in reliance on the promise of future immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Justice Breyer takes the suggestion further.  He argues not that foreign sovereign immunity doctrine is not concerned with reliance interests but, even further, that in fact foreign sovereigns have no reliance interests in receiving immunity in our courts.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.  This reasoning overlooks the plain fact that there are reliance interests of vast importance involved, interests surely as important as those stemming from contract rights between two private parties.  As the Executive has made clear to us, these interests span a range of time after the conduct, even up to the present day.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 8.  For example, at stake may be pertinent treaty rights and international agreements intended to remedy the earlier conduct.  These are matters in which the negotiating parties may have acted on a likely assumption of sovereign immunity, as defined and limited by pre-FSIA expectations: \xe2\x80\x9c[The] conduct at issue [has been] extensively addressed through treaties, agreements, and separate legislation that were all adopted against the background assumption [of the pre-FSIA foreign sovereign immunity regime].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Lurking in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s and Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s contrary suggestions is the implication that the expectations of foreign powers are minor or infrequent.  Surely that is not the case.  By today\xe2\x80\x99s decision the Court opens foreign nations worldwide to vast and potential liability for expropriation claims in regards to conduct that occurred generations ago, including claims that have been the subject of international negotiation and agreement.  There are, then, reliance interests of magnitude, which support the usual presumption against retroactivity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, the statement that the purposes of foreign sovereign immunity have not much to do with the presumption against retroactivity carries little weight; the presumption against retroactivity has independent justification.  The Court has noted this, saying that the purposes of the underlying substantive law are not conclusive of the retroactivity analysis.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt will frequently be true \xe2\x80\xa6 that retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully.  That consideration, however, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 285\xe2\x80\x93286 (footnote omitted).  As a result, diminished concerns of unfair surprise and upset expectations\xe2\x80\x94even assuming they existed\xe2\x80\x94do not displace the usual presumption.  That is why in <em>Landgraf</em>, though \xe2\x80\x9cconcerns of unfair surprise and upsetting expectations [were] attenuated in the case of intentional employment discrimination, which ha[d] been unlawful for more than a generation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded, nevertheless, that it could not give the statute retroactive effect.  <em>Id.,</em> at 282\xe2\x80\x93283, n. 35.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, lastly, adds in a footnote that the \xe2\x80\x9cFSIA differs from the statutory amendment at issue in <em>Hughes Aircraft</em>\xe2\x80\x9d because in <em>Hughes Aircraft</em> the jurisdictional limitation attached directly to the cause of action and so ensured that suit could be brought only in accordance with the jurisdictional provision (and any changes to it).  <em>Ante</em>, at 17, n. 15.  With the FSIA, in contrast, the jurisdictional limitation is not attached to the cause of action.  The result, the Court implies, is that even if a pre-FSIA jurisdictional bar applied in American courts, suit on the California cause of action might still have been able to have been brought in foreign courts, and such availability of suit would defeat retroactivity concerns.  <em>Ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Act does not . . . purport to limit <em>foreign</em> countries\xe2\x80\x99 decisions about what claims against which defendants their courts will entertain\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Scalia, J., concurring).  What is of concern in the retroactivity analysis that <em>Hughes Aircraft</em> sets out, however, is the internal integrity of American statutes, not of whether an American law allows suit where before none was allowed elsewhere in the world.  This is unsurprising, as the task of canvassing what causes of action foreign countries might have allowed before a new jurisdictional regime made such suits also viable in American courts would be a most difficult task to assign American courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, the majority turns away from our usual retroactivity analysis because \xe2\x80\x9cthis [is a] <em>sui generis</em> context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Having created a new, extra exception that frees it from the usual analysis, it can conclude simply that the usual rule \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not control the outcome in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  The implications of this holding are not entirely clear, for the new exception does not rest on any apparent principle.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a stark contrast between the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis and that of the Courts of Appeals that have addressed the question.  In this case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, like every other Court of Appeals to have considered the question, concluded that the FSIA must be interpreted under the usual retroactivity principles, just like any other statute.  See 317 F.\xc2\xa03d 954.  Accord, <em>Hwang Geum Joo</em> v. <em>Japan</em>, 332 F.\xc2\xa03d 679 (CADC 2003); <em>Carl Marks &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</em>, 841 F.\xc2\xa02d 26 (CA2 1988); <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China</em>, 794 F.\xc2\xa02d 1490 (CA11 1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion to which the <em>sui generis</em> rule leads the Court shows the rule lacks a principled basis: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e think it more appropriate, absent contraindications, to defer to the most recent [decision by the political branches on the foreign sovereign immunity question]\xe2\x80\x94namely, the FSIA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18<em>.</em>  The question, however, is not whether the FSIA governs, but how to interpret the FSIA.  The Court seems to think the FSIA implicitly adopts a presumption of retroactivity, though our cases instruct just the opposite.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n <em>Hughes Aircraft</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 we \xe2\x80\xa6 rejected a presumption favoring retroactivity for jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lindh,</em> 521 U. S., at 342, n. 3  (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., joined by Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer would supplement the rationale for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s deciding the case outside the bounds of our usual mode of retroactivity analysis.  He says the Court can take this path because sovereign immunity \xe2\x80\x9cis about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>status</em> at the time of suit, not about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>conduct</em> before the suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  The argument is a variant of that made by respondent.  See Brief for Respondent 27 (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Dole Food</em> controls the result in this case\xe2\x80\x9d).  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument fails, of course, because in this case the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 status at the time of suit is that of the sovereign, not that of private parties.  That distinction alone makes misplaced reliance on <em>Dole Food Co.</em> v. <em>Patrickson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/468/index.html">538 U. S. 468</a> (2003) (holding that a now-private corporation could not assert sovereign immunity in a suit involving events that occurred when the entity was owned by a foreign sovereign).  Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s further reasoning, however, is also unacceptable.  When jurisdictional rules are at stake, status and conduct factors will at times intersect.  Most assuredly, we would not disown the usual retroactivity principles in a case involving a status-based jurisdictional statute that creates jurisdiction over private litigants where before there was none simply because the creation of jurisdiction turned in part on the status of one of the litigants.  Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s additional rationale, however, has this very implication.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We should not ignore the statutory retroactivity analysis just because the parties and the Court have failed to consider it before.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (Breyer, J., concurring) (relying on the fact that in <em>Verlinden</em> the Court applied the FSIA to a contract that predated the Act).  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]his Court has never considered itself bound [by prior <em>sub silentio</em> holdings] when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us.\xe2\x80\x99  <em>Hagans</em> v. <em>Lavine,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/index.html">415 U. S. 528</a>, 535, n. 5 (1974).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Will</em> v. <em>Michigan Dept. of State Police,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/index.html">491 U. S. 58</a>, 63, n. 4 (1989) (alteration in original).  Reliance on the fact that the immunity principles were applied retroactively in the common-law context of the pre-FSIA regime is also irrelevant.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7 (Breyer, J., concuring).  This case concerns the retroactive effect of enacted statutory law, not of court decisions interpreting the common law.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision contains another proposition difficult to justify and that itself does considerable damage to the FSIA.  Abandoning standard retroactivity principles, the Court attempts to compensate for the harsh results it reaches by inviting case by case intervention by the Executive.  This does serious harm to the constitutional balance between the political branches.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court says that the Executive may make suggestions of immunity regarding FSIA determinations and implies that courts should give such suggestions deference.  See <em>ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]hould the State Department choose to express its opinion on the implications of exercising jurisdiction over <em>particular</em> petitioners in connection with <em>their</em> alleged conduct, that opinion might well be entitled to deference as the considered judgment of the Executive\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  That invitation would be justified if the Court recognized that the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s role was retrospective only, <em>i.e.</em>, implicated only in suits involving preenactment conduct and only as a means for resolving the retroactivity analysis.  The law that governed before the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment allowed unilateral Executive authority in that regard.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the <em>Landgraf</em> analysis, however, removes the possibility of that being the basis for the invitation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court instead reaches its conclusion about the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s role by reliance on the general constitutional principle that the Executive has a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cvast share of responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24 (quoting <em>American Ins. Assn.</em> v. <em>Garamendi,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/396/index.html">539 U. S. 396</a>, 414 (2003)).  This prospective constitutional conclusion, which the Court offers almost as an aside, has fundamental implications for the future of the statute and raises serious separation-of-powers concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question the Court seems inclined to resolve\xe2\x80\x94can the foreign affairs power of the Executive supersede a statutory scheme set forth by Congress\xe2\x80\x94is simply not presented by the facts of this case.  We would confront the question only if the case involved postenactment conduct and if the Executive had filed a suggestion of immunity, which, by its insistence, superceded the statute\xe2\x80\x99s directive.  Those circumstances would present a difficult question.  Compare U. S. Const., Art. II, \xc2\xa72, with Art. I, \xc2\xa71; <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa78, cls. 3, 9\xe2\x80\x9311, 18; Art. III, \xc2\xa71; <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa72, cl. 1.  See also See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 12 (setting out the constitutional authority on which Congress relied to enact the FSIA).  See generally <em>Internationl Bancorp, LLC</em> v. <em>Societe Des Bains De Mer Et Du Cercle Des Etrangers</em>, 329 F.\xc2\xa03d 359, 367\xe2\x80\x93368 (CA4 2003) (noting the complicated intersection where the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s and the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s foreign affairs responsibilities overlap, in a case involving foreign trade).  The separation-of-powers principles at stake also implicate judicial independence, which is compromised by case\nby case, selective determinations of jurisdiction by the Executive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court makes a serious mistake, in my view, to address the question when it is not presented.  It magnifies this error by proceeding with so little explanation, particularly in light of the strong arguments against its conclusion.  The Solicitor General, on behalf of the Executive, agrees that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cpresents the sole basis for civil litigants to obtain jurisdiction over a foreign state in United States courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 1.  This understanding is supported by the lack of textual support for the contrary position in the Act and by the majority\xe2\x80\x99s own assessment of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt announcement that the FSIA may well be subject to Executive override undermines the Act\xe2\x80\x99s central purpose and structure.  As the Court acknowledges, before the Act, \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity determinations [had been thrown] into some disarray, as \xe2\x80\x98foreign nations often placed diplomatic pressure on the State Department,\xe2\x80\x99 and political considerations sometimes led the Department to file \xe2\x80\x98suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (quoting <em>Verlinden,</em> 461 U. S., at 487).  See also <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  Congress intended the FSIA to replace this old and unsatisfactory methodology of Executive decisionmaking.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The President endorsed the objective in full, recommending the bill upon its introduction in Congress, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at\xc2\xa06, and signing the bill into law upon its presentment.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s surprising constitutional conclusion suggests that the FSIA accomplished none of these aims.  The Court states that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s directives may well be short-circuited by the sole directive of the Executive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court adds a disclaimer that it \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[es] no opinion on the question whether such deference should be granted [to the Executive] in cases covered by the FSIA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  The disclaimer, however, is inadequate to remedy the harm done by the invitation, for it is belied by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own terms: Executive statements \xe2\x80\x9csuggesting that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction in particular cases implicating foreign sovereign immunity \xe2\x80\xa6 might well be entitled to deference as the considered judgment of the Executive on a particular question of foreign policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (citing as an example a case in which Executive foreign policy superceded state law).  Taking what the Court says at face value, the Court does express an opinion on the question: Its opinion is that the Executive statement may well be entitled to deference, and so may well supercede federal law that gives courts jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, as it seems, the Court seeks to free the Executive from the dictates of enacted law because it fears that to do otherwise would consign some litigants to an unfair retroactive application of the law, it adds illogic to the illogic of its own creation.  Only application of our traditional analysis guards properly against unfair retroactive effect, \xe2\x80\x9censur[ing] that Congress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 268.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where postenactment conduct is at stake, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach promises unfortunate disruption.  It promises to reintroduce Executive intervention in foreign sovereign immunity determinations to an even greater degree than existed before the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Before the Act, foreign nations only tended to need the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s protection from the courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction in instances involving private acts.  The Tate Letter ensured their public acts would remain immune from suit, even without Executive intervention.  Now, there is a potential for Executive intervention in a much larger universe of claims.  The FSIA has no public act/private act distinction with respect to certain categories of conduct, such as expropriations.  Foreign nations now have incentive to seek Executive override of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional rules for both public and private acts in those categories of cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the FSIA, Congress tried to settle foreign sovereigns\xe2\x80\x99 prospective expectations for being subject to suit in American courts and to ensure fair and evenhanded treatment to our citizens who have claims against foreign sovereigns.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  This was in keeping with strengthening the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s ability to secure negotiated agreements with foreign nations against whom our citizens may have claims.  Over time, agreements of this sort have been an important tool for the Executive.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Agreement Relating to the Agreement of Oct. 24, 2000, Concerning the Austrian Fund \xe2\x80\x9cReconciliation, Peace and Cooperation,\xe2\x80\x9d Jan. 23, 2001, U. S.-Aus., 2001 WL 935261 (settling claims with Austria); Claims of U. S. Nationals, Nov. 5, 1964, U. S.-Yugo., 16 U. S. T. 1, T. I. A. S. No. 5750 (same with Yugoslavia); Settlement of Claims of U. S. Nationals, July 16, 1960, U. S.-Pol., 11 U. S. T. 1953, T. I. A. S. No. 4545 (same with Poland).  Uncertain prospective application of our foreign sovereign immunity law may weaken the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s ability to secure such agreements by compromising foreign sovereigns\xe2\x80\x99 ability to predict the liability they face in our courts and so to assess the ultimate costs and benefits of any agreement.  See <em>supra</em>, at 16 (citing Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em>).</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The presumption against retroactivity has comprehended, and always has been intended to comprehend, the wide universe of cases that a court might confront.  That includes this one.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s departure from precedent should not be overlooked.  It has disregarded our \xe2\x80\x9cwidely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Landgraf,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 272, and treated the principles discussed in <em>Landgraf</em> as if they describe a limited and precise rule that courts should apply only in particularized contexts.  Our unanimous rejection of this approach in <em>Hughes Aircraft</em> applies here as well:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent [the Court] contends that <em>only</em> statutes with one of [<em>Landgraf</em>\xe2\x80\x99s particularly stated] effects are subject to our presumption against retroactivity, [it] simply misreads our opinion in <em>Landgraf</em>.  The language upon which [it] relies does not purport to define the outer limit of impermissible retroactivity.  Rather, our opinion in <em>Landgraf</em>, like that of Justice Story, merely described that any such effect constituted a <em>sufficient</em>, rather than a <em>necessary</em>, condition for invoking the presumption against retroactivity.\xe2\x80\x9d  520 U. S., at 947.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach further leads to the unprecedented conclusion that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Article I power might well be insufficient to accomplish the central objective of the FSIA.  The Court, in addition, injects great prospective uncertainty into our relations with foreign sovereigns.  Application of our usual presumption against imposing retroactive effect would leave powerful precedent intact and avoid these difficulties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
