Those deposits stopped the ac-crual of interest that Ford would otherwise owe once the audits were completed and the amount of its underpayment was finally determined.  See \xc2\xa76601; Rev. Proc. 84\xe2\x80\x9358, 1984\xe2\x80\x932 Cum. Bull. 501.  Later, Ford requested that the IRS treat the deposits as advance payments of the additional tax that Ford owed.  Eventually the parties determined that Ford had overpaid its taxes in the relevant years, thereby entitling Ford to a return of the over-payment as well as interest.  But the parties disagreed about when the interest began to run under \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76611(b)(1).  Ford argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe date of overpayment\xe2\x80\x9d was the date that it first remitted the deposits to the IRS.  Ibid.  The Government countered that the date of overpayment was the date that Ford requested that the IRS treat the remittances as payments of tax.  The difference between the parties\xe2\x80\x99 competing interpretations of \xc2\xa76611(b) is worth some $445 million.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFord sued the Government in Federal District Court, asserting jurisdiction under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(a)(1).  The Government did not contest the court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  See Brief in Opposition 3, n.\xc2\xa03.  The District Court accepted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa76611(b) and granted its motion for judgment on the pleadings.  A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that \xc2\xa76611 is a waiver of sovereign immunity that must be construed strictly in favor of the Government.  508 Fed.

In Ford\xe2\x80\x99s view, it is \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346\xe2\x80\x94not \xc2\xa76611\xe2\x80\x94that waives the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from this suit, and \xc2\xa76611(b) is a substantive provision that should not be construed strictly.  See G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez v. Potter, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 474, \n491 (2008)\n; United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 465\n\xe2\x80\x93473 (2003).  In its response to Ford\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari, however, the Government contended for the first time that \xc2\xa71346(a)(1) does not apply at all to this suit; it argues that the only basis for jurisdiction, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe only general waiver of sovereign immunity that encompasses [Ford\xe2\x80\x99s] claim,\xe2\x80\x9d is the Tucker Act, \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71491(a).  Brief in Opposition 3, n.\xc2\xa03.  Although the Government acquiesced in jurisdiction in the lower courts, if the Government is now correct that the Tucker Act applies to this suit, jurisdiction over this case was proper only in the United States Court of Federal Claims.  See \xc2\xa71491(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court \xe2\x80\x9cis one of final review, \xe2\x80\x98not of first view.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  FCC v.

The Sixth Circuit should have the first opportunity to consider the Government\xe2\x80\x99s new contention with respect to jurisdiction in this case.  Depending on that court\xe2\x80\x99s answer, it may also consider what impact, if any, the jurisdictional determination has on the merits issues, especially whether or not \xc2\xa76611 is a waiver of sovereign immunity that should be construed strictly.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
