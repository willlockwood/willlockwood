The means test instructs a debtor to determine his \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the amount he has available to reimburse creditors\xe2\x80\x94by deducting from his current monthly income \xe2\x80\x9camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\xe2\x80\x9d for, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance or support.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)(A)(i).  For a debtor whose income is above the median for his State, the means test indentifies which expenses qualify as \xe2\x80\x9camounts reasonably necessary to be expended.\xe2\x80\x9d  As relevant here, the statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he debtor\xe2\x80\x99s monthly expenses shall be the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for the area in which the debtor resides.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Standards are tables listing standardized expense amounts for basic necessities, which the IRS prepares to help calculate taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to pay overdue taxes.  The IRS also creates supplemental guidelines known as the \xe2\x80\x9cCollection Financial Standards,\xe2\x80\x9d which describe how to use the tables and what the amounts listed in them mean.  The Local Standards include an allowance for transportation expenses, divided into vehicle \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d and vehicle \xe2\x80\x9cOperating Costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Collection Financial Standards explain that \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d cover monthly loan or lease payments on an automobile; the expense amounts listed are based on nationwide car financing data.  The Collection Financial Standards further state that a taxpayer who has no car payment may not claim an allowance for ownership costs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When petitioner Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief, he listed respondent (FIA) as an unsecured creditor.  Among his assets, Ransom reported a car that he owns free of any debt.  In determining his monthly expenses, he nonetheless claimed a car-ownership deduction of $471, the full amount specified in the \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d table, as well as a separate $388 deduction for car-operating costs.  Based on his means-test calculations, Ransom proposed a bankruptcy plan that would result in repayment of approximately 25% of his unsecured debt.  FIA objected on the ground that the plan did not direct all of Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s disposable income to unsecured creditors.  FIA contended that Ransom should not have claimed the car-ownership allowance because he does not make loan or lease payments on his car.  Agreeing, the Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of the plan.  The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take the car-ownership deduction.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation begins with the language of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that a debtor may claim only \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d expense amounts listed in the Standards.  Because the Code does not define the key word \xe2\x80\x9capplicable,\xe2\x80\x9d the term carries its ordinary meaning of appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit.  What makes an expense amount \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d in this sense is most naturally understood to be its correspondence to an individual debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial circumstances.  Congress established a filter, permitting a debtor to claim a deduction from a National or Local Standard table only if that deduction is appropriate for him.  And a deduction is so appropriate only if the debtor will incur the kind of expense covered by the table during the life of the plan.  Had Congress not wanted to separate debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not, it could have omitted the term \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d altogether.  Without that word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each category listed in the Standards.  Interpreting the statute to require a threshold eligibility determination thus ensures that \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading draws support from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s context and purpose.  The Code initially defines a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s disposable income as his \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent monthly income \xe2\x80\xa6 less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71325(b)(2).  It then instructs that such reasonably necessary amounts \xe2\x80\x9cshall be determined in accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d the means test.  \xc2\xa71325(b)(3).  Because Congress intended the means test to approximate the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable expenditures on essential items, a debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incurring an expense in the relevant category.  Further, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose\xe2\x80\x94to ensure that debtors pay creditors the maximum they can afford\xe2\x80\x94is best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with the statutory text, to reflect a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to afford repayment.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The vehicle-ownership category covers only the costs of a car loan or lease.  The expense amount listed ($471) is the average monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide; it is not intended to estimate other conceivable expenses associated with maintaining a car.  Maintenance expenses are the province of the separate \xe2\x80\x9cOperating Costs\xe2\x80\x9d deduction.  A person who owns a car free and clear is entitled to the \xe2\x80\x9cOperating Costs\xe2\x80\x9d deduction for all driving-related expenses.  But such a person may not claim the \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d deduction, because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car loan or lease.  The IRS\xe2\x80\x99 Collection Financial Standards reinforce this conclusion by making clear that individuals who have a car but make no loan or lease payments may take only the operating-costs deduction.  Because Ransom owns his vehicle outright, he incurs no expense in the \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d category, and that expense amount is therefore not \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d to him.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301 <em>et seq</em>.  To determine how much income the debtor is capable of paying, Chapter 13 uses a statutory formula known as the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans test.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7707(b)(2) (2006 ed. and Supp. III), 1325(b)(3)(A) (2006 ed.).  The means test instructs a debtor to deduct specified expenses from his current monthly income.  The result is his \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the amount he has available to reimburse creditors.  \xc2\xa71325(b)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns the specified expense for vehicle-ownership costs.  We must determine whether a debtor like petitioner Jason Ransom who owns his car outright, and so does not make loan or lease payments, may claim an allowance for car-ownership costs (thereby reducing the amount he will repay creditors).  We hold that the text, context, and purpose of the statutory provision at issue preclude this result.  A debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take the car-ownership deduction.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCongress enacted the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA or Act) to correct perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 559 U.

For a debtor whose income is above the median for his State, the means test identifies which expenses qualify as \xe2\x80\x9camounts reasonably necessary to be expended.\xe2\x80\x9d  The test supplants the pre-BAPCPA practice of calculating debtors\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable expenses on a case-by-case basis, which led to varying and often inconsistent determinations.

Rather than authorizing all debtors to take deductions in all listed categories, Congress established a filter: A debtor may claim a deduction from a National or Local Standard table (like \xe2\x80\x9c[Car] Ownership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d) if but only if that deduction is appropriate for him.  And a deduction is so appropriate only if the debtor has costs corresponding to the category covered by the table\xe2\x80\x94that is, only if the debtor will incur that kind of expense during the life of the plan.  The statute underscores the necessity of making such an individualized determination by referring to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s </em>applicable monthly expense amounts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94in other words, the expense amounts applicable (appropriate, etc.) to each particular debtor.  Identifying these amounts requires looking at the financial situation of the debtor and asking whether a National or Local Standard table is relevant to him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Congress had not wanted to separate in this way debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not, it could have omitted the term \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d altogether.  Without that word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each category listed in the Standards.  Congress presumably included \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve a different result.  See <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 12 (2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e must give effect to every word of a statute wherever possible\xe2\x80\x9d).  Interpreting the statute to require a threshold determination of eligibility ensures that the term \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading of \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d also draws support from the statutory context.  The Code initially defines a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s disposable income as his \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent monthly income \xe2\x80\xa6 less amounts <em>reasonably necessary to be expended</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71325(b)(2) (emphasis added).  The statute then instructs that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]mounts reasonably necessary to be expended \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be determined in accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d the means test.  \xc2\xa71325(b)(3).  Because Congress intended the means test to approximate the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable expenditures on essential items, a debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incurring an expense in the relevant category.  If a debtor will not have a particular kind of expense during his plan, an allowance to cover that cost is not \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the statute.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, consideration of BAPCPA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose strengthens our reading of the term \xe2\x80\x9capplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress designed the means test to measure debtors\xe2\x80\x99 disposable income and, in that way, \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that [they] repay creditors the maximum they can afford.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 2.  This purpose is best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with the statutory text, to reflect a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to afford repayment.  Cf. <em>Hamilton, </em>560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (rejecting an interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code that \xe2\x80\x9cwould produce [the] senseless resul[t]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cdeny[ing] creditors payments that the debtor could easily make\xe2\x80\x9d).  Requiring a debtor to incur the kind of expenses for which he claims a means-test deduction thus advances BAPCPA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we conclude that a person cannot claim an allowance for vehicle-ownership costs unless he has some expense falling within that category, the question in this case becomes: What expenses does the vehicle-ownership category cover?

Only if that category also covers other costs associ-\nated with having a car would Ransom be entitled to this\ndeduction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The less inclusive understanding is the right one: The ownership category encompasses the costs of a car loan or lease and nothing more.  As noted earlier, the numerical amounts listed in the \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d table are \xe2\x80\x9cbase[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 on the five-year average of new and used car financing data compiled by the Federal Reserve Board.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Brief for Respondent 3a.

App. to Brief for Respondent 3a; see <em>supra</em>, at 4.  Although the statute does not incorporate the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s guidelines, courts may consult this material in interpreting the National and Local Standards; after all, the IRS uses those tables for a similar purpose\xe2\x80\x94to determine how much money a delinquent taxpayer can afford to pay the Government.  The guidelines of course cannot control if they are at odds with the statutory language.  But here, the Collection Financial Standards\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of the car-ownership deduction reinforces our conclusion that, under the statute, a debtor seeking to claim this deduction must make some loan or lease payments.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because Ransom owns his vehicle free and clear of any encumbrance, he incurs no expense in the \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d category of the Local Standards.  Accordingly, the car-ownership expense amount is not \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d to him, and the Ninth Circuit correctly denied that deduction.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s argument to the contrary relies on a different interpretation of the key word \xe2\x80\x9capplicable,\xe2\x80\x9d an objection to our view of the scope of the \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d category, and a criticism of the policy implications of our approach.  We do not think these claims persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ransom first offers another understanding of the term \xe2\x80\x9capplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  A debtor, he says, determines his \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d deductions by locating the box in each National or Local Standard table that corresponds to his geographic location, income, family size, or number of cars.  Under this approach, a debtor \xe2\x80\x9cconsult[s] the table[s] alone\xe2\x80\x9d to determine his appropriate expense amounts.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 16.  Because he has one car, Ransom argues that his \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d allowance is the sum listed in the first column of the \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d table ($471); if he had a second vehicle, the amount in the second column ($332) would also be \xe2\x80\x9capplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  On this approach, the word \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d serves a function wholly internal to the tables; rather than filtering out debtors for whom a deduction is not at all suitable, the term merely directs each debtor to the correct box (and associated dollar amount of deduction) within every table.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This alternative reading of \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d fails to comport with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, context, or purpose.  As intimated earlier, <em>supra, </em>at 7\xe2\x80\x938, Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would render the term \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.  Assume Congress had omitted that word and simply authorized a deduction of \xe2\x80\x9cthe debtor\xe2\x80\x99s monthly expense amounts\xe2\x80\x9d specified in the Standards.  That language, most naturally read, would direct each debtor to locate the box in every table corresponding to his location, income, family size, or number of cars and to deduct the amount stated.  In other words, the language would instruct the debtor to use the exact approach Ransom urges.  The word \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessary to accomplish that result; it is necessary only for the different purpose of dividing debtors eligible to make use of the tables from those who are not.  Further, Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d would sever the connection between the means test and the statutory provision it is meant to implement\xe2\x80\x94the authorization of an allowance for (but only for) \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d expenses.  Expenses that are wholly fictional are not easily thought of as reasonably necessary.  And finally, Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would run counter to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s overall purpose of ensuring that debtors repay creditors to the extent they can\xe2\x80\x94here, by shielding some $28,000 that he does not in fact need for loan or lease payments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As against all this, Ransom argues that his reading is\xc2\xa0necessary to account for the means test\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d expenses\xe2\x80\x94more fully stated, between the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>applicable</em> monthly expense amounts\xe2\x80\x9d specified in the Standards and the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>actual</em> monthly expenses for \xe2\x80\xa6 Other Necessary Expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis added).  The latter phrase enables a debtor to deduct his actual expenses in particular categories that the IRS designates relating mainly to taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 health and welfare.  Internal Revenue Manual \xc2\xa75.15.1.10(1), http://www.irs.gov/irm/part5/ irm_05-015-001.html#d0e1381.  According to Ransom, \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d cannot mean the same thing as \xe2\x80\x9cactual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 40.  He thus concludes that \xe2\x80\x9can \xe2\x80\x98applicable\xe2\x80\x99 expense can be claimed [under the means test] even if no \xe2\x80\x98actual\xe2\x80\x99 expense was incurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our interpretation of the statute, however, equally avoids conflating \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d costs.  Although the expense amounts in the Standards apply only if the debtor incurs the relevant expense, the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-pocket cost may well not control the amount of the deduction.  If a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s actual expenses exceed the amounts listed in the tables, for example, the debtor may claim an allowance only for the specified sum, rather than for his real expenditures.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  For the Other Necessary Expense categories, by contrast, the debtor may deduct his actual expenses, no matter how high they are.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Our reading of the means test thus gives full effect to \xe2\x80\x9cthe distinction between \xe2\x80\x98applicable\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98actual\xe2\x80\x99 without taking a further step to conclude that \xe2\x80\x98applicable\xe2\x80\x99 means \xe2\x80\x98nonexistent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Ross-Tousey</em>, 368 B.\xc2\xa0R. 762, 765 (Bkrtcy.

This case provides a prime example.  The \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d table features two columns labeled \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Car\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Car.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  Standing alone, the table does not specify whether it refers to the first and second cars <em>owned </em>(as Ransom avers), or the first and second cars for which the debtor incurs <em>ownership costs</em> (as FIA maintains)\xe2\x80\x94and so the table does not resolve the issue in dispute.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Kimbro</em>, 389 B.\xc2\xa0R. 518, 533 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA6 2008) (Fulton, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne cannot really \xe2\x80\x98just look up\xe2\x80\x99 dollar amounts in the tables without either referring to IRS guidelines for using the tables or imposing pre-existing assumptions about how [they] are to be navigated\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  Some amount of interpretation is necessary to decide what the deduction is for and whether it is applicable to Ransom; and so we are brought back full circle to our prior analysis.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ransom next argues that viewing the car-ownership deduction as covering no more than loan and lease payments is inconsistent with a separate sentence of the means test that provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).  The car-ownership deduction cannot comprise <em>only</em> loan and lease payments, Ransom contends, because those payments are <em>always</em> debts.  See Brief for Petitioner 28, 44\xe2\x80\x9345.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ransom ignores that the \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d sentence governs the full panoply of deductions under the National and Local Standards and the Other Necessary Expense categories.  We hesitate to rely on that general provision to interpret the content of the car-ownership deduction because Congress did not draft the former with the latter specially in mind; any friction between the two likely reflects only a lack of attention to how an across-the-board exclusion of debt payments would correspond to a particular IRS allowance.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Further, the \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d sentence by its terms functions only to exclude, and not to authorize, deductions.  It cannot establish an allowance for non-loan or -lease ownership costs that no National or Local Standard covers.  Accordingly, the \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d sentence does nothing to alter our conclusion that the \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d table does not apply to a debtor whose car is not encumbered.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ransom finally contends that his view of the means test is necessary to avoid senseless results not intended by Congress.  At the outset, we note that the policy concerns Ransom emphasizes pale beside one his reading creates: His interpretation, as we have explained, would frustrate BAPCPA\xe2\x80\x99s core purpose of ensuring that debtors devote their full disposable income to repaying creditors.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  We nonetheless address each of Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s policy arguments in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ransom first points out a troubling anomaly: Under our interpretation, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ebtors can time their bankruptcy filing to take place while they still have a few car payments left, thus retaining an ownership deduction which they would lose if they filed just after making their last payment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 54.  Indeed, a debtor with only a single car payment remaining, Ransom notes, is eligible to claim a monthly ownership deduction.  <em>Id., </em>at 15, 52.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this kind of oddity is the inevitable result of a standardized formula like the means test, even more under Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s reading than under ours.  Such formulas are by their nature over- and under-inclusive.  In eliminating the pre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median-income debtors\xe2\x80\x99 expenses, on the ground that it leant itself to abuse, Congress chose to tolerate the occasional peculiarity that a brighter-line test produces.  And Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s alternative reading of the statute would spawn its own anomalies\xe2\x80\x94even placing to one side the fundamental strangeness of giving a debtor an allowance for loan or lease payments when he has not a penny of loan or lease costs.  On Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s view, for example, a debtor entering bankruptcy might purchase for a song a junkyard car\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9can old, rusted pile of scrap metal [that would] si[t] on cinder blocks in his backyard,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>In\xc2\xa0re Brown</em>, 376 B.\xc2\xa0R. 601, 607 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Tex. 2007)\xe2\x80\x94in order to deduct the $471 car-ownership expense and reduce his payment to creditors by that amount.  We do not see why Congress would have preferred that result to the one that worries Ransom.  That is especially so because creditors may well be able to remedy Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cone payment left\xe2\x80\x9d problem.  If car payments cease during the life of the plan, just as if other financial circumstances change, an unsecured creditor may move to modify the plan to increase the amount the debtor must repay.  See 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71329(a)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ransom next contends that denying the ownership allowance to debtors in his position \xe2\x80\x9csends entirely the wrong message, namely, that it is advantageous to be deeply in debt on motor vehicle loans, rather than to pay them off.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 55.  But the choice here is not between thrifty savers and profligate borrowers, as Ransom would have it.  Money is fungible: The $14,000 that Ransom spent to purchase his Camry outright was money he did not devote to paying down his credit card debt, and Congress did not express a preference for one use of these funds over the other.  Further, Ransom\xe2\x80\x99s argument mistakes what the deductions in the means test are meant to accomplish.  Rather than effecting any broad federal policy as to saving or borrowing, the deductions serve merely to ensure that debtors in bankruptcy can afford essential items.  The car-ownership allowance thus safeguards a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to retain a car throughout the plan period.  If the debtor already owns a car outright, he has no need for this protection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ransom finally argues that a debtor who owns his car free and clear may need to replace it during the life of the plan; \xe2\x80\x9c[g]ranting the ownership cost deduction to a vehicle that is owned outright,\xe2\x80\x9d he states, \xe2\x80\x9caccords best with economic reality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 52.  In essence, Ransom seeks an emergency cushion for car owners.  But nothing in the statute authorizes such a cushion, which all debtors presumably would like in the event some unexpected need arises.  And a person who enters bankruptcy without any car at all may also have to buy one during the plan period; yet Ransom concedes that a person in this position cannot claim the ownership deduction.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 20.  The appropriate way to account for unanticipated expenses like a new vehicle purchase is not to distort the scope of a deduction, but to use the method that the Code provides for all Chapter 13 debtors (and their creditors): modification of the plan in light of changed circumstances.  See \xc2\xa71329(a)(1); see also <em>supra</em>, at 17.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on BAPCPA\xe2\x80\x99s text, context, and purpose, we hold that the Local Standard expense amount for transportation \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d to a debtor who will not incur any such costs during his bankruptcy plan.  Because the \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership Costs\xe2\x80\x9d category covers only loan and lease payments and because Ransom owns his car free from any debt or obligation, he may not claim the allowance.  In short, Ransom may not deduct loan or lease expenses when he does not have any.

Because the means test does not apply to Chapter 13 debtors whose incomes are below the median, those debtors must prove on a case-by-case basis that each claimed expense is reasonably necessary.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71325(b)(2) and (3).  If a below-median-income debtor cannot take a deduction for a nonexistent expense, we doubt Congress meant to provide such an allowance to an above-median-income debtor\xe2\x80\x94the very kind of debtor whose perceived abuse of the bankruptcy system inspired Congress to enact the means test.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In addition, the IRS has categorized taxes, including those associated with car ownership, as an \xe2\x80\x9cOther Necessary Expens[e],\xe2\x80\x9d for which a debtor may take a deduction.

The dissent questions what possible basis except incorporation could justify our consulting the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s view, <em>post</em>, at 4, n.,<em> </em>but we think that basis obvious: The IRS <em>creates</em> the National and Local Standards referenced in the statute, revises them as it deems necessary, and uses them every day.  The agency might, therefore, have something insightful and persuasive (albeit not controlling) to say about them.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The parties and the Solicitor General as <em>amicus curiae</em> dispute the proper deduction for a debtor who has expenses that are <em>lower</em> than the amounts listed in the Local Standards.

The Government concurs with this view, provided (as we require) that a debtor has <em>some</em> expense relating to the deduction.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 19\xe2\x80\x9321.  FIA, relying on the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s practice, contends to the contrary that a debtor may claim only his actual expenditures in this circumstance.  Brief for Respondent 12, 45\xe2\x80\x9346 (arguing that the Local Standards function as caps).  We decline to resolve this issue.  Because Ransom incurs no ownership expense at all, the car-ownership allowance is not applicable to him in the first instance.  Ransom is therefore not entitled to a deduction under either approach.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For the same reason, the allowance for \xe2\x80\x9capplicable monthly expense amounts\xe2\x80\x9d at issue here differs from the additional allowances that the dissent cites for the deduction of actual expenditures.  See <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (noting allowances for \xe2\x80\x9cactual expenses\xe2\x80\x9d for care of an elderly or chronically ill household member, \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II), and for home energy costs, \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(V)).</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The interpretive problem is not, as the dissent suggests, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether to claim a deduction for one car or for two,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 3, but rather whether to claim a deduction for <em>any </em>car that is owned if the debtor has no ownership costs.  Indeed, if we had to decide this question on the basis of the table alone, we might well decide that a debtor who does not make loan or lease payments cannot claim an allowance.  The table, after all, is titled \xe2\x80\x9cOwnership <em>Costs</em>\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94suggesting that it applies to those debtors who incur such costs.  And as noted earlier, the dollar amounts in the table represent average automobile loan and lease payments nationwide (with all other car-related expenses approximated in the separate \xe2\x80\x9cOperating Costs\xe2\x80\x9d table).  See <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Ransom himself concedes that not every debtor falls within the terms of this table; he would exclude, and thus prohibit from taking a deduction, a person who does not own a car.

I agree with the conclusion of the three other Courts of Appeals to address the question: that a debtor who owns a car free and clear is entitled to the car-ownership allowance.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Washburn,</em> 579 F. 3d 934 (CA8 2009); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Tate,</em> 571 F. 3d 423 (CA5 2009); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Ross-Tousey,</em> 549 F. 3d 1148 (CA7 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory text at issue is the phrase enacted in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), \xe2\x80\x9capplicable monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards,\xe2\x80\x9d 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).  The Court holds that the word \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d in this provision imports into the Local Standards a directive in the Internal Revenue Service\xe2\x80\x99s Collection Financial Standards, which have as their stated purpose \xe2\x80\x9cto help determine a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pay a delinquent tax liability,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Brief for Respondent 1a.  That directive says that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a taxpayer has no car payment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Ownership Cost provisions of the Local Standards will not apply.  <em>Id.</em>, at 3a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That directive forms no part of the Local Standards to which the statute refers; and the fact that portions of the Local Standards are to be disregarded for revenue-collection purposes says nothing about whether they are to be disregarded for purposes of Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Court believes, however, that unless the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s Collection Financial Standards are imported into the Local Standards, the word \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d would do no work, violating the principle that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98we must give effect to every word of a statute wherever possible.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (quoting <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 12 (2004)).  I disagree.  The canon against superfluity is not a canon against verbosity.  When a thought could have been expressed more concisely, one does not always have to cast about for some additional meaning to the word or phrase that could have been dispensed with.  This has always been understood.  A House of Lords opinion holds, for example, that in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in addition to and not in derogation of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the last part adds nothing but emphasis.  <em>Davies</em> v. <em>Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries</em>,<em> Ltd.</em>, [1942] A.\xc2\xa0C. 601, 607.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems to me that is the situation here.  To be sure, one can say \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the attached table\xe2\x80\x9d; but it is acceptable (and indeed I think more common) to say \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the applicable provisions of the attached table.\xe2\x80\x9d  That seems to me the fairest reading of \xe2\x80\x9capplicable monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is especially so for the Ownership Costs portion of the Local Standards, which had no column titled \xe2\x80\x9cNo Car.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here the expense amount would be that shown for one car (which is all the debtor here owned) rather than that shown for two cars; and it would be no expense amount if the debtor owned no car, since there is no \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d provision for that on the table.  For operating and public transportation costs, the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d amount would similarly be the amount provided by the Local Standards for the geographic region in which the debtor resides.  (The debtor would not first be required to prove that he actually operates the cars that he owns, or, if does not own a car, that he actually uses public transportation.)  The Court claims that the tables \xe2\x80\x9care not self-defining,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ome amount of interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d is necessary in choosing whether to claim a deduction at all, for one car, or for two.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  But this problem seems to me more metaphysical than practical.  The point of the statutory language is to entitle debtors who own cars to an ownership deduction, and I have little doubt that debtors will be able to choose correctly whether to claim a deduction for one car or for two.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the meaning attributed to the word by the Court were intended, it would have been most precise to say \xe2\x80\x9cmonthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, if applicable for IRS collection purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  And even if utter precision was too much to expect, it would at least have been more natural to say \xe2\x80\x9cmonthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, <em>if applicable</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  That would make it clear that amounts specified under those Standards may nonetheless not be applicable, justifying (perhaps) resort to some source other than the Standards themselves to give meaning to the condition.  The very next paragraph of the Bankruptcy Code uses that formulation (\xe2\x80\x9cif applicable\xe2\x80\x9d) to limit to actual expenses the deduction for care of an elderly or chronically ill household member: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he debtor\xe2\x80\x99s monthly expenses may include, <em>if applicable</em>, the continuation of actual expenses paid by the debtor that are reasonable and necessary\xe2\x80\x9d for that purpose.  11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Elsewhere as well, the Code makes it very clear when prescribed deductions are limited to actual expenditures.  Section 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) itself authorizes deductions for a host of expenses\xe2\x80\x94health and disability insurance, for example\xe2\x80\x94only to the extent that they are \xe2\x80\x9cactual . . . expenses\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Additional deductions for energy are allowed, but again only if they are \xe2\x80\x9cactual expenses\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9creasonable and necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(V).  Given the clarity of those limitations to actual outlays, it seems strange for Congress to limit the car-ownership deduction to the somewhat peculiar category \xe2\x80\x9ccars subject to any amount whatever of<em> </em>outstanding indebtedness\xe2\x80\x9d by the mere word \xe2\x80\x9capplicable,\xe2\x80\x9d meant as incorporation of a limitation that appears in instructions to IRS agents.*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not find the normal meaning of the text undermined by the fact that it produces a situation in which a\ndebtor who owes no payments on his car nonetheless gets the operating-expense allowance.  For the Court\xe2\x80\x99s more strained interpretation still produces a situation in which a debtor who owes only a single remaining payment on his car gets the full allowance.  As for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s imagined horrible in which \xe2\x80\x9ca debtor entering bankruptcy might purchase for a song a junkyard car,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17: That is fairly matched by the imagined horrible that, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, a debtor entering bankruptcy might purchase a junkyard car for a song plus a $10 promissory note payable over several years.  He would get the full ownership expense deduction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation does not, as promised, maintain \xe2\x80\x9cthe connection between the means test and the statutory provision it is meant to implement\xe2\x80\x94the authorization of an allowance for (but only for) \xe2\x80\x98reasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x99 expenses,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12.  Nor do I think this difficulty is eliminated by the <em>deus ex machina</em> of 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71329(a)(1), which according to the Court would allow an unsecured creditor to \xe2\x80\x9cmove to modify the plan to increase the amount the debtor must repay,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17.  Apart from the fact that, as a practical matter, the sums involved would hardly make this worth the legal costs, allowing such ongoing revisions of matters specifically covered by the rigid means test would return us to \xe2\x80\x9cthe pre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median-income debtors\xe2\x80\x99 expenses,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16.  If the BAPCPA had thought such adjustments necessary, surely it would have taken the much simpler and more logical step of providing going in that the ownership expense allowance would apply only so long as monthly payments were due.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reality is, to describe it in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own terms, that occasional overallowance (or, for that matter, underallowance) \xe2\x80\x9cis the inevitable result of a standardized formula like the means test . . . . Congress chose to tolerate the occasional peculiarity that a brighter-line test produces.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Our job, it seems to me, is not to eliminate or reduce those \xe2\x80\x9coddit[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., but to give the formula Congress adopted its fairest meaning.  In my judgment the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable monthly expense amounts\xe2\x80\x9d for operating costs \xe2\x80\x9cspecified under the . . . Local Standards,\xe2\x80\x9d are the amounts specified in those Standards for either one car or two cars, whichever of those is applicable.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0The Court protests that I misunderstand its use of the Collection Financial Standards.  Its opinion does not, it says, find them to be incorporated by the Bankruptcy Code; they simply \xe2\x80\x9creinforc[e] our conclusion that . . . a debtor seeking to claim this deduction must make some loan or lease payments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  True enough, the opinion says that the Bankruptcy Code \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not incorporate the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s guidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d but it immediately continues that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts may consult this material in interpreting the National and Local Standards\xe2\x80\x9d so long as it is not \xe2\x80\x9cat odds with the statutory language.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In the present context, the real-world difference between finding the guidelines incorporated and finding it appropriate to consult them escapes me, since I can imagine no basis for consulting them unless Congress meant them to be consulted, which would mean they are incorporated.  And without incorporation, they <em>are </em>at odds with the statutory language, which otherwise contains no hint that eligibility for a Car Ownership deduction requires anything other than ownership of a car.   \xc2\xa0</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></font></div>'
