Although phrased as a direction to New York\'s intermediate appellate courts, \xc2\xa7 5501 (c)\'s "deviates materially" standard, as construed by New York\'s courts, instructs state trial judges as well. Pp. 422-425.</p><p>(b) In cases like Gasperini\'s, in which New York law governs the claims for relief, the Court must determine whether New York law also supplies the test for federal-court review of the size of the verdict. Federal diversity jurisdiction provides an alternative forum for the adjudication of state-created rights, but it does not carry with it generation of rules of substantive law. Under the doctrine of <i>Erie R. Co. </i>v. <i>Tompkins, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/case.html">304 U. S. 64</a>, federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law. Classification of a law as "substantive" or "procedural" for <i>Erie </i>purposes is sometimes a challenging endeavor. <i>Guaranty Trust Co. </i>v. <i>York, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/99/case.html">326 U. S. 99</a>, an early interpretation of <i>Erie, </i>propounded an "outcome-determination" test: "[D]oes it significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court to disregard a law of a State that would be controlling in an action upon the same claim by the same parties in a State court?" 326 U. S., at 109. A later pathmarking case, qualifying <i>Guaranty Trust, </i>explained that the "outcome-determination" test must not be applied mechanically to sweep in all manner of variations; instead, its application must be guided by "the twin aims of the <i>Erie </i>rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws." <i>Hanna </i>v. <i>Plumer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/460/case.html">380 U. S. 460</a>, 468.</p><p>Informed by these decisions, the Court concludes that, although \xc2\xa7 5501(c) contains a procedural instruction assigning decisionmaking authority to the New York Appellate Division, the State\'s objective is manifestly substantive. More rigorous comparative evaluations attend application of \xc2\xa7 5501(c)\'s "deviates materially" standard than the common-law "shock the conscience" test. If federal courts ignore the change in the New York standard and persist in applying the "shock the conscience" test to damage awards on claims governed by New York law, "\'substantial\' variations between state and federal [money judgments]" may be expected. See <i>id., </i>at 467-468. The Court therefore agrees with the Second Circuit that New York\'s check on excessive damages warrants application in federal court, for <i>Erie\'s </i>doctrine precludes a recovery in federal court significantly larger than the recovery that would have been tolerated in state court. Pp. 426-431.</p><hr/><p></p><p><a class="page-name">417</a></p><p>(c) Nonetheless, when the Second Circuit used \xc2\xa7 5501(c) as the standard for federal appellate review, it did not attend to "[a]n essential characteristic of [the federal court] system." <i>Byrd </i>v. <i>Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/356/525/case.html">356 U. S. 525</a>, 537. The Seventh Amendment, which governs proceedings in federal court, but not in state court, bears not only on the allocation of trial functions between judge and jury, the issue in <i>Byrd; </i>it also controls the allocation of authority to review verdicts, the issue of concern here. In keeping with the historic understanding, the Seventh Amendment\'s Reexamination Clause does not inhibit the authority of trial judges to grant new trials "for any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the United States." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a). In contrast, appellate review of a federal trial court\'s denial of a motion to set aside a jury\'s verdict as excessive is a relatively late, and less secure, development. Such review, once deemed inconsonant with the Seventh Amendment\'s Reexamination Clause, has not been expressly approved by this Court before today. See, <i>e. g., Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. </i>v. <i>Kelco Disposal, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/257/case.html">492 U. S. 257</a>,279, n. 25. Circuit decisions unanimously recognize, however, that appellate review, confined to abuse of discretion, is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment as a control necessary and proper to the fair administration of justice. The Court now approves this line of decisions. Pp.431-436.</p><p>(d) In this case, the principal state and federal interests can be accommodated. New York\'s dominant interest in having its substantive law guide the allowable damages arising out of a state-law claim for relief can be respected, without disrupting the federal system, once it is recognized that the federal district court is capable of applying the State\'s "deviates materially" standard. The Court recalls, in this regard, that the "deviates materially" standard serves as the guide to be applied in trial as well as appellate courts in New York. Within the federal system, practical reasons combine with Seventh Amendment constraints to lodge in the district court, not the court of appeals, primary responsibility for application of \xc2\xa7 5501 (c)\'s check. District court applications of the "deviates materially" standard would be subject to appellate review under the standard the Circuits now employ when inadequacy or excessiveness is asserted on appeal: abuse of discretion. Pp. 436-439.</p><p>(e) It does not appear that the District Court checked the jury\'s verdict against the relevant New York decisions. Accordingly, the Court vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals and instructs that court to remand the case to the District Court so that the trial judge, revisiting his ruling on the new trial motion, may test the jury\'s verdict against CPLR \xc2\xa7 5501 (c)\'s "deviates materially" standard.

He earned his living primarily in radio and print media and only occasionally sold his photographic work. During the course of his seven-year stint in Central America, Gasperini took over 5,000 slide transparencies, depicting active war zones, political leaders, and scenes from daily life. In 1990, Gasperini agreed to supply his original color transparencies to The Center for Humanities, Inc. (Center) for use in an educational videotape, Conflict in Central America. Gasperini selected 300 of his slides for the Center; its videotape included 110 of them. The Center agreed to return the original transparencies, but upon the completion of the project, it could not find them.</p><p>Gasperini commenced suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, invoking the court\'s diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1332.1 He alleged several state-law claims for relief, including breach of contract, conversion, and negligence. See App. 5-6. The Center conceded liability for the lost transparencies and the issue of damages was tried before a jury.</p><p>1 Plaintiff Gasperini, petitioner here, is a citizen of California; defendant Center, respondent here, is incorporated, and has its principal place of business, in New York.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="420">420</a></p><p>At trial, Gasperini\'s expert witness testified that the "industry standard" within the photographic publishing community valued a lost transparency at $1,500. See <i>id., </i>at 227. This industry standard, the expert explained, represented the average license fee a commercial photograph could earn over the full course of the photographer\'s copyright, i. <i>e., </i>in Gasperini\'s case, his lifetime plus 50 years. See <i>id., </i>at 228; see also 17 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 302(a). Gasperini estimated that his earnings from photography totaled just over $10,000 for the period from 1984 through 1993. He also testified that he intended to produce a book containing his best photographs from Central America. See App. 175.</p><p>After a three-day trial, the jury awarded Gasperini $450,000 in compensatory damages. This sum, the jury foreperson announced, "is [$]1500 each, for 300 slides." <i>Id., </i>at 313. Moving for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59, the Center attacked the verdict on various grounds, including excessiveness. Without comment, the District Court denied the motion. See App. to Pet. for Cert.12a.</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the judgment entered on the jury\'s verdict. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/66/427/">66 F.3d 427</a> (1995). Mindful that New York law governed the controversy, the Court of Appeals endeavored to apply CPLR \xc2\xa7 5501(c), which instructs that, when a jury returns an itemized verdict, as the jury did in this case, the New York Appellate Division "shall determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if it deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation." The Second Circuit\'s application of \xc2\xa7 5501(c) as a check on the size of the jury\'s verdict followed Circuit precedent elaborated two weeks earlier in <i>Consorti </i>v. <i>Armstrong World Industries, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/64/781/">64 F.3d 781</a>, superseded, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/72/1003/">72 F.3d 1003</a> (1995). Surveying Appellate Division decisions that reviewed damage awards for lost transparencies, the Second Circuit concluded that testimony on industry standard alone was insufficient to justify a verdict; prime among other fac-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="421">421</a></p><p>tors warranting consideration were the uniqueness of the slides\' subject matter and the photographer\'s earning leveI.2</p><p>Guided by Appellate Division rulings, the Second Circuit held that the $450,000 verdict "materially deviates from what is reasonable compensation." 66 F. 3d, at 431. Some of Gasperini\'s transparencies, the Second Circuit recognized, were unique, notably those capturing combat situations in which Gasperini was the only photographer present. <i>Id., </i>at 429. But others "depicted either generic scenes or events at which other professional photojournalists were present." <i>Id., </i>at 431. No more than 50 slides merited a $1,500 award, the court concluded, after "[g]iving Gasperini every benefit of the doubt." <i>Ibid. </i>Absent evidence showing significant earnings from photographic endeavors or concrete plans to publish a book, the court further determined, any damage award above $100 each for the remaining slides would be excessive. Remittiturs "presen[t] difficult problems for appellate courts," the Second Circuit acknowledged, for court of appeals judges review the evidence from "a cold paper record." <i>Ibid. </i>Nevertheless, the Second Circuit set aside the $450,000 verdict and ordered a new trial, unless Gasperini agreed to an award of $100,000.</p><p>2 See Blackman v.

Application of \xc2\xa7 5501(c) at the trial level is key to this case.</p><p>To determine whether an award "deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation," New York state courts look to awards approved in similar cases. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Leon </i>v. <i>J </i>&amp; <i>M Peppe Realty Corp., </i>190 App. Div. 2d 400, 416, 596 N. Y.

The Center answers yes. The "deviates materially" standard, it argues, is a substantive standard that must be applied by federal appellate courts in diversity cases. The Second Circuit agreed. See 66 F. 3d, at 430; see also <i>Consorti, </i>72 F. 3d, at 1011 ("[CPLR \xc2\xa7 5501(c)] is the substantive rule provided by New York law."). Gasperini, emphasizing that \xc2\xa7 5501(c) trains on the New York Appellate Division, characterizes the provision as procedural, an allocation of decisionmaking authority regarding damages, not a hard cap on the amount recoverable. Correctly comprehended, Gasperini urges, \xc2\xa7 5501(c)\'s direction to the Appellate Division cannot be given effect by federal appellate courts without violating the Seventh Amendment\'s Reexamination Clause.</p><p>As the parties\' arguments suggest, CPLR \xc2\xa7 5501(c), appraised under <i>Erie R. Co. </i>v. <i>Tompkins, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/case.html">304 U. S. 64</a> (1938), and decisions in <i>Erie\'s </i>path, is both "substantive" and "procedural": "substantive" in that \xc2\xa7 5501(c)\'s "deviates materially" standard controls how much a plaintiff can be awarded; "procedural" in that \xc2\xa7 5501(c) assigns decisionmaking authority to New York\'s Appellate Division. Parallel application of \xc2\xa7 5501(c) at the federal appellate level would be out of sync with the federal system\'s division of trial and appellate court functions, an allocation weighted by the Seventh Amendment. The dispositive question, therefore, is whether federal courts can give effect to the substantive thrust of \xc2\xa7 5501(c) without untoward alteration of the federal scheme for the trial and decision of civil cases.</p><p align="center">\nA</p><p>Federal diversity jurisdiction provides an alternative forum for the adjudication of state-created rights, but it does not carry with it generation of rules of substantive law.

An essential characteristic of that system is the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it distributes trial functions between judge and jury and, under the influence-if not the command-of the Seventh Amendment, assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact to the jury." <i>Ibid. </i>(footnote omitted).</p></blockquote><p>The Seventh Amendment, which governs proceedings in federal court, but not in state court,14 bears not only on the allocation of trial functions between judge and jury, the issue in <i>Byrd; </i>it also controls the allocation of authority to review verdicts, the issue of concern here. The Amendment reads:</p><blockquote><p>\n"In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law." U. S. Const., Arndt. 7.</p></blockquote><p><i>Byrd </i>involved the first Clause of the Amendment, the "trial by jury" Clause. This case involves the second, the "re-examination" Clause. In keeping with the historic un-</p><p>ployees. Therefore, defendant maintained, the plaintiff ranked as a "statutory employee" whose sole remedy was under the State\'s workers\' compensation law. The sameness of the work plaintiff and defendant\'s own employees performed presented a fact question, but in state court, a jury trial would not have been available to resolve it.</p><p>14 See <i>Walker </i>v. <i>Sauvinet, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/90/case.html">92 U.

Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a). That authority is large. See 6A Moore\'s Federal Practice , 59.05[2], pp. 59-44 to 59-46 (2d ed. 1996) ("The power of the English common law trial courts to grant a new trial for a variety of reasons with a view to the attainment of justice was well established prior to the establishment of our Government."); see also <i>Aetna Casualty </i>&amp; <i>Surety Co. </i>v. <i>Yeatts, </i>122 F.2d 350, 353 (CA4 1941) ("The exercise of [the trial court\'s power to set aside the jury\'s verdict and grant a new trial] is not in derogation of the right of trial by jury but is one of the historic safeguards of that right."); <i>Blunt </i>v. <i>Little, </i>3 F.

"The trial judge in the federal system," we have reaffirmed, "has ... discretion to grant a new trial if the verdict appears to [the judge] to be against the weight of the evidence." <i>Byrd, </i>356 U.

This discretion includes overturning verdicts for excessiveness and ordering a new trial without qualification, or conditioned on the verdict winner\'s refusal to agree to a reduction (remittitur).

We subsequently recognized that, even in cases in which the <i>Erie </i>doctrine was not in play-cases arising wholly under federal lawthe question was not settled; we twice granted certiorari to decide the unsettled issue, but ultimately resolved the cases on other grounds. See <i>Grunenthal </i>v. <i>Long Island R. Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/156/case.html">393 U. S. 156</a>, 158 (1968); <i>Neese </i>v. <i>Southern R.

But in successive reminders that the question was worthy of this Court\'s attention, we noted, without disapproval, that courts of appeals engage in review of district court excessiveness determina-</p><p>ing the "incongruous position" that "a federal trial court may deny a motion for a new trial where the plaintiff consents to decrease the judgment to a proper amount," but may not condition denial of the motion on "the defendant\'s consent to a comparable increase in the recovery." <i>Dimick </i>v. <i>Schiedt, </i>293 U.

We noted the Circuit decisions in point, <i>id., </i>at 157, n. 3, and, in <i>Browning-Ferris, </i>we again referred to appellate court abuse-of-discretion review:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[T]he role of the district court is to determine whether the jury\'s verdict is within the confines set by state law, and to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered.

S., at 279.18</p></blockquote><p>As the Second Circuit explained, appellate review for abuse of discretion is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment as a control necessary and proper to the fair administration of justice: "We must give the benefit of every doubt to the judgment of the trial judge; but surely there must be an upper limit, and whether that has been surpassed is not a question of fact with respect to which reasonable men may differ, but a question of law." <i>Dagnello </i>v. <i>Long Island R.

We agree with the Second Circuit, however, that "[f]or purposes of deciding whether state or federal law is applicable, the question whether an award of <i>compensatory </i>damages exceeds what is permitted by law is not materially different from the question whether an award of <i>punitive </i>damages exceeds what is permitted by law." <i>Consorti </i>v. <i>Armstrong World Industries, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/72/1003/">72 F.3d 1003</a>, 1012 (1995).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="436">436</a></p><p>, 59.08[6], at 59-177 to 59-185 (same).19 We now approve this line of decisions, and thus make explicit what Justice Stewart thought implicit in our <i>Grunenthal </i>disposition: "[N]othing in the Seventh Amendment ... precludes appellate review of the trial judge\'s denial of a motion to set aside [a jury verdict] as excessive." 393 U.

Rule 59(a) is as encompassing as it is uncontroversial. It is indeed "Hornbook" law that a most usual ground for a Rule 59 motion is that "the damages are excessive." See C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 676-677 (5th ed. 1994). Whether damages are excessive for the claim-in-suit must be governed by <i>some law. </i>And there is no candidate for that governance other than the law that gives rise to the claim for relief-here, the law of New York.

The majority persuasively shows, however, that New York has not merely adopted a new procedure for allocating the decisionmaking function between trial and appellate courts. <i>Ante, </i>at 422425. Instead, New York courts have held that all jury awards, not only those reviewed on appeal, must conform to the requirement that they not "deviat[e] materially" from amounts awarded in like cases. <i>Ante, </i>at 425. That New York has chosen to tie its damages ceiling to awards traditionally recovered in similar cases, rather than to a legislatively determined but inflexible monetary sum, is none of our concern.</p><p>Given the nature of the state-law command, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit correctly concluded in <i>Consorti </i>v. <i>Armstrong World Industries, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/64/781/">64 F.3d 781</a>, superseded, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/72/1003/">72 F.3d 1003</a> (1995), that New York\'s excessiveness standard applies in federal court in diversity cases controlled by New York law. <i>Consorti </i>erred in basing that conclusion in part on the fact that a New York statute requires that State\'s appellate division to apply the standard, but it was nevertheless faithful to the Rules of Decision Act, as construed in <i>Erie R. Co. </i>v. <i>Tompkins, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/case.html">304 U. S. 64</a> (1938), in holding that a state-law limitation on the size of a judgment could not be ignored.1 Similarly, the Court of Appeals</p><p>1 Because there is no conceivable conflict between Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 and the application of the New York damages limit, this case is controlled by <i>Erie </i>and the Rules of Decision Act, rather than by the Rules Enabling Act\'s limitation on federal procedural rules that conflict with state substantive rights. See Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 693, 698 (1974); see also <i>Sibbach </i>v. <i>Wilson </i>&amp; <i>Co., 312 </i>U. S. 1 (1941).

I endorse both opinions in these respects.</p><p>Although the majority agrees with the Court of Appeals that New York law establishes the size of the damages that may be awarded, it chooses to vacate and remand. The majority holds that a federal court of appeals should review for abuse of discretion a district court\'s decision to deny a motion for new trial based on a jury\'s excessive award. As a result, it concludes that the District Court should be given the opportunity to apply in the first instance the "deviates materially" standard that New York law imposes. <i>Ante, </i>at 439.</p><p>The District Court had its opportunity to consider the propriety of the jury\'s award, and it erred. The Court of Appeals has now corrected that error after "drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of" petitioner. 66 F. 3d, at 431. As there is no reason to suppose that the Court of Appeals has reached a conclusion with which the District Court could permissibly disagree on remand, I would not require the District Court to repeat a task that has already been well performed by the reviewing court.

S. 80</a>, 87 (1914) ("It may be admitted that if it were true that the excess appeared as [a] matter of law; that if, for instance, the statute fixed a maximum and the verdict exceeded it, a question might arise for this court"); 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 2820, pp. 207-209 (2d ed. 1995). Indeed, for the last 30 years, we have consistently reserved the question whether the Constitution permits such review, <i>ante, </i>at 434-435, and, in the meantime, every Court of Appeals has agreed that the Seventh Amendment establishes no bar. 11 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa7 2820, at 209.</p><p>Taking the question to be an open one, I start with certain basic principles. It is well settled that jury verdicts are not binding on either trial judges or appellate courts if they are unauthorized by law. A verdict may be insupportable as a matter of law either because of deficiencies in the evidence or because an award of damages is larger than permitted by law. If an award is excessive as a matter of law-in a diversity case if it is larger than applicable state law permits-a trial judge has a duty to set it aside. A failure to do so is an error of law that the court of appeals has a duty to correct on appeal.</p><p>These principles are sufficiently well established that no Seventh Amendment issue would arise if an appellate court ordered a new trial because a jury award exceeded a monetary cap on allowable damages. That New York has chosen to define its legal limit in less mathematical terms does not require a different constitutional conclusion.</p><p>New York\'s limitation requires a legal inquiry that cannot be wholly divorced from the facts, but that quality does not necessarily make the question one for the factfinder rather</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="443">443</a></p><p>than the reviewing court.

S. 690</a>, 696-697 (1996); <i>Markman </i>v. <i>Westview Instruments, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/517/370/case.html">517 U. S. 370</a>, 388-390 (1996); <i>Thompson </i>v. <i>Keohane, </i>516 U. S. 90, 112-116 (1995). Such appellate review is proper because mixed questions require courts to construe all record inferences in favor of the factfinder\'s decision and then to determine whether, on the facts as found below, the legal standard has been met. See <i>Or</i>nelas, 517 U. S., at 696-697 (quoting <i>Pullman-Standard </i>v. <i>Swint, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/273/case.html">456 U. S. 273</a>, 289, n. 19 (1982)). In following that procedure here, the Court of Appeals did not reexamine any fact determined by a jury. 66 F. 3d, at 431. It merely identified that portion of the judgment that constitutes "unlawful excess." See <i>Dimick </i>v. <i>Schiedt, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/474/case.html">293 U. S. 474</a>, 486 (1935).2</p><p>Even if review by the Court of Appeals implicates the Reexamination Clause, it was "according to the rules of the common law." U. S. Const., Arndt. 7. At common law, the trial judge sitting <i>nisi prius </i>recommended whether a judicial panel sitting en bane at Westminster should accept the jury\'s award.

However, because the <i>nisi </i>prius judge often did not serve on the en bane court, the "court above" was in essentially the same position as a modern court of appeals. It considered the legality of the jury\'s award in light of the trial judge\'s opinion, but without any firsthand knowledge of what had transpired below. See Blume, Review of Facts in Jury Cases-The Seventh Amendment, 20 J. Am. Jud. Soc. 130, 131 (1936).3</p><p>Petitioner also contends that at common law the en bane court could only grant a new trial if the trial judge so recommended. That contention is undermined by numerous cases in which the "court above" granted new trials without making any reference to the trial judge\'s view of the damages. See, <i>e. g., Honda Motor Co. </i>v. <i>Oberg, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/512/415/case.html">512 U. S. 415</a>, 422-425 (1994) (citing cases).4 Moreover, early English cases repeatedly state that the power to order a new trial when the jury returned an excessive award rested with "the Court," rather than the judge below,5 and Blackstone identifies excessive</p><p>3 For that reason, JUSTICE SCALIA is wrong to contend that the court at Westminster acted in no more of an appellate fashion when it entertained motions for new trials in causes tried at bar than when it entertained them in causes tried at <i>nisi prius. Post, </i>at 456. In the former cases, the en bane court would entertain a motion for new trial after having heard the evidence itself. In the latter, it would sometimes entertain the motion only after having heard the report on the evidence of the <i>nisi prius </i>judge.</p><p>4 Although <i>Honda </i>itself involved review of punitive damages awards, we expressly noted that there was no basis for suggesting "that different standards of judicial review were applied for punitive and compensatory damages before the 20th century," 512 U. S., at 422, n. 2. Indeed, many of the decisions we relied upon in <i>Honda </i>involved compensatory damages, and there is some authority to suggest that judicial review of the former has a more secure historical pedigree than does judicial review of the latter.</p><p>5 See, <i>e. g., Bright </i>v. <i>Eynon, </i>1 Burr. 390, 97 Eng. Rep. 365, 368 (K.

Blackstone, Commentaries *387.</p><p>Even when read most favorably to petitioner, therefore, no meaningful distinction exists between the common-law practice by which the "court above" considered a new trial motion in the first instance, and the practice challenged here, by which an appellate court reviews a district court\'s ruling on a new trial motion. See Riddell, 26 Yale L. J., at 57. As Justice Stone explained, in a dissenting opinion joined by Chief Justice Hughes, Justice Brandeis, and Justice Cardozo:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[The Seventh Amendment], intended to endure for unnumbered generations, is concerned with substance and not with form. There is nothing in its history or language to suggest that the Amendment had any purpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial as it was known to the common law before the adoption of the Constitution. For that reason this Court has often refused to construe it as intended to perpetuate in changeless form the <i>minutiae </i>of trial practice as it existed in the English courts in 1791. From the beginning, its language has been regarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the Amendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury trial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them from suits in equity and admiralty, see <i>Parsons </i>v. <i>Bedford, </i>3 Pet. 433, 446, and to safeguard the jury\'s function from any encroachment which the common law did not permit.</p></blockquote><p>and circumstances of the particular case, and directed with a view to the attainment of justice"); <i>Wood </i>v. <i>Gunston, </i>Sty. 466, 82 Eng. Rep. 867 (K. B. 1655) ("It is in the discretion of the Court in some cases to grant a new tryal, but this must be a judicial, and not an arbitrary discretion, and it is frequent in our books for the Court to take notice of miscarriages of juries, and to grant new tryals upon them ... ").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="446">446</a></p><blockquote><p>\n"Thus interpreted, the Seventh Amendment guarantees that suitors in actions at law shall have the benefits of trial of issues of fact by a jury, but it does not prescribe any particular procedure by which these benefits shall be obtained, or forbid any which does not curtail the function of the jury to decide questions of fact as it did before the adoption of the Amendment. It does not restrict the court\'s control of the jury\'s verdict, as it had previously been exercised, and it does not confine the trial judge, in determining what issues are for the jury and what for the court, to the particular forms of trial practice in vogue in 1791." <i>Dimick </i>v. <i>Schiedt, 293 </i>U. S., at 490-491.</p></blockquote><p>Because the Framers of the Seventh Amendment evinced no interest in subscribing to every procedural nicety of the notoriously complicated English system, see Henderson, The Background of the Seventh Amendment, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 289, 290 (1966), the common-law practice certainly does not demonstrate that the Reexamination Clause prohibits federal appellate courts from ensuring compliance with statelaw limits on jury awards.</p><p>Nor does early and intricate English history justify the more limited assertion that federal appellate courts must be limited to a particular, highly deferential standard of excessiveness review. Common-law courts were hesitant to disturb jury awards, but less so in cases in which "a reasonably certain measure of damages is afforded." 1 D. Graham, Law of New Trials in Cases Civil and Criminal 452 (2d ed. 1855); Washington, Damages in Contract at Common Law, 47 L. Q. Rev. 345, 363-364 (1931).</p><p>Here, New York has prescribed an objective, legallimitation on damages. If an appellate court may reverse a jury\'s damages award when its own conscience has been shocked, 66 F. 3d, at 430, or its sense of justice outraged, <i>Dagnello </i>v. <i>Long Island R. Co., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/289/797/">289 F.2d 797</a>, 802 (CA2 1961); cf. <i>Honda Motor Co. </i>v. <i>Oberg, </i>512 U. S., at 422-424 (citing English</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="447">447</a></p><p>cases), it may surely follow a sovereign\'s command that it do so when a jury has materially deviated from awards granted by other juries. If anything, the New York standard, though less deferential, is more certain.6</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>For the reasons set forth above, I agree with the majority that the Reexamination Clause does not bar federal appellate courts from reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. I confess to some surprise, however, at its conclusion that "\'the influence-if not the command-of the Seventh Amendment,\'" <i>ante, </i>at 432 (quoting <i>Byrd </i>v. <i>Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/356/525/case.html">356 U. S. 525</a>, 537 (1958) (footnote omitted)), requires federal courts of appeals to review district court applications of state-law excessiveness standards for an "abuse of discretion." <i>Ante, </i>at 438.</p><p>The majority\'s persuasive demonstration that New York law sets forth a substantive limitation on the size of jury awards seems to refute the contention that New York has merely asked appellate courts to reexamine facts. The majority\'s analysis would thus seem to undermine the conclusion that the Reexamination Clause is relevant to this case.</p><p>Certainly, our decision in <i>Byrd </i>does not make the Clause relevant. There, we considered only whether the Seventh Amendment\'s first clause should influence our decision to give effect to a state-law rule denying the right to a jury</p><p>6 Our <i>per curiam </i>decision in <i>Donovan </i>v. <i>Penn Shipping Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/648/case.html">429 U. S. 648</a> (1977), provides no support for the proposition that federal appellate courts are confined to a federal standard of excessiveness. That case held only that a plaintiff who had consented to a remittitur could not challenge its adequacy on appeal. <i>Id., </i>at 649. Although we stated in dicta that "[t]he proper role of the trial and appellate courts in the federal system in reviewing the size of jury verdicts is, however, a matter of federal law," <i>ibid., </i>that broad statement was supported by citation to two cases, <i>Hanna </i>v. <i>Plumer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/460/case.html">380 U. S. 460</a> (1965), and <i>Byrd </i>v. <i>Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/356/525/case.html">356 U.

That holding in no way requires us to consult the Amendment\'s second clause to determine the standard of review for a district court\'s application of state substantive law.</p><p>My disagreement is tempered, however, because the majority carefully avoids defining too strictly the abuse-ofdiscretion standard it announces. To the extent that the majority relies only on "practical reasons" for its conclusion that the Court of Appeals should give some weight to the District Court\'s assessment in determining whether state substantive law has been properly applied, <i>ante, </i>at 438, I do not disagree with its analysis.</p><p>As a matter of federal-court administration, we have recognized in other contexts the need for according some deference to the lower court\'s resolution of legal, yet factintensive, questions. See <i>Ornelas </i>v. <i>United States, </i>517 U. S., at 699; <i>Pierce </i>v. <i>Underwood, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/552/case.html">487 U. S. 552</a>, 558, n. 1 (1988). Indeed, it is a familiar, if somewhat circular, maxim that deems an error of law an abuse of discretion.</p><p>In the end, therefore, my disagreement with the label that the majority attaches to the standard of appellate review should not obscure the far more fundamental point on which we agree. Whatever influence the Seventh Amendment may be said to exert, <i>Erie </i>requires federal appellate courts sitting in diversity to apply "the damage-control standard state law supplies." <i>Ante, </i>at 438.</p><p align="center">\nIV</p><p>Because I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and because I do not agree that the Seventh Amendment in any respect influences the proper analysis of the question presented, I respectfully dissent.</p><p>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.</p><p>Today the Court overrules a longstanding and wellreasoned line of precedent that has for years prohibited fed-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="449">449</a></p><p>eral appellate courts from reviewing refusals by district courts to set aside civil jury awards as contrary to the weight of the evidence. One reason is given for overruling these cases: that the Courts of Appeals have, for some time now, decided to ignore them. Such unreasoned capitulation to the nullification of what was long regarded as a core component of the Bill of Rights-the Seventh Amendment\'s prohibition on appellate reexamination of civil jury awardsis wrong. It is not for us, much less for the Courts of Appeals, to decide that the Seventh Amendment\'s restriction on federal-court review of jury findings has outlived its usefulness.</p><p>The Court also holds today that a state practice that relates to the division of duties between state judges and juries must be followed by federal courts in diversity cases. On this issue, too, our prior cases are directly to the contrary.</p><p>As I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I respectfully dissent.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Because the Court and I disagree as to the character of the review that is before us, I recount briefly the nature of the New York practice rule at issue. Section 5501(c) of the N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules (CPLR) (McKinney 1995) directs New York intermediate appellate courts faced with a claim "that the award is excessive or inadequate and that a new trial should have been granted" to determine whether the jury\'s award "deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation." In granting respondent a new trial under this standard, the Court of Appeals necessarily engaged in a two-step process. As it has explained the application of \xc2\xa7 5501(c), that provision "requires the reviewing court to determine the range it regards as reasonable, and to determine whether the particular jury award deviates materially from that range." <i>Consorti </i>v. <i>Armstrong World Industries, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/72/1003/">72 F.3d 1003</a>, 1013 (CA2 1995) (amended). The first of these two steps-the determination as to "rea-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="450">450</a></p><p>sonable" damages-plainly requires the reviewing court to reexamine a factual matter tried by the jury: the appropriate measure of damages, on the evidence presented, under New York law. The second step-the determination as to the degree of difference between "reasonable" damages and the damages found by the jury (whether the latter "deviates materially" from the former)-establishes the degree of judicial tolerance for awards found not to be reasonable, whether at the trial level or by the appellate court. No part of this exercise is appropriate for a federal court of appeals, whether or not it is sitting in a diversity case.</p><p align="center">\nA</p><p>Granting appellate courts authority to decide whether an award is "excessive or inadequate" in the manner of CPLR \xc2\xa7 5501(c) may reflect a sound understanding of the capacities of modern juries and trial judges. That is to say, the people of the State of New York may well be correct that such a rule contributes to a more just legal system. But the practice of <i>federal </i>appellate reexamination of facts found by a jury is precisely what the People of the several States considered <i>not </i>to be good legal policy in 1791. Indeed, so fearful were they of such a practice that they constitutionally prohibited it by means of the Seventh Amendment.</p><p>That Amendment was Congress\'s response to one of the principal objections to the proposed Constitution raised by the Anti-Federalists during the ratification debates: its failure to ensure the right to trial by jury in civil actions in federal court. The desire for an explicit constitutional guarantee against reexamination of jury findings was explained by Justice Story, sitting as Circuit Justice in 1812, as having been specifically prompted by Article Ill\'s conferral of "appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact" upon the Supreme Court. "[O]ne of the most powerful objections urged against [the Constitution]," he recounted, was that this au-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="451">451</a></p><p>thority "would enable that court, with or without a new jury, to re-examine the whole facts, which had been settled by a previous jury." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Wonson, </i>28 F. Cas. 745, 750 (No. 16,750) (CC Mass.).l</p><p>The second clause of the Amendment responded to that concern by providing that "[i]n [s]uits at common law ... no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law." U. S. Const., Arndt. 7. The Reexamination Clause put to rest "apprehensions" of "new trials by the appellate courts," <i>Wonson, </i>28 F. Cas., at 750, by adopting, in broad fashion, "the rules of the common law" to govern federal-court interference with jury determinations.2 The</p><p>1 This objection was repeatedly made following the Constitutional Convention, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Martin, Genuine Information, in 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 172, 221-222 (M. Farrand ed. 1911); Gerry, Reply to a Landholder, <i>id., </i>at 298, 299, and at the ratifying conventions in the States, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>3 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 525, 540-541, 544-546 (1863) (Virginia Convention, statements of Mr. Mason and Mr. Henry); 4 <i>id., </i>at 151, 154 (North Carolina Convention, statements of Mr. Bloodworth and Mr. Spencer).</p><p>Prior to adoption of the Amendment, these concerns were addressed by Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789,1 Stat. 73, which expressly directed, in providing for "reexamin[ation]" of civil judgments "upon a writ of error," that "there shall be no reversal in either [the Circuit or Supreme Court] ... for any error of fact." \xc2\xa722, 1 Stat. 84-85. That restriction remained in place until the 1948 revisions of the Judicial Code. See 62 Stat. 963, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2105 (1946 ed., Supp. II).</p><p>2 The Amendment was relied upon at least twice to prevent actual new trials. In <i>Wonson </i>itself, Justice Story rejected the United States\' claim of right to retry, on appeal, a matter unsuccessfully put before a jury in the District Court-notwithstanding acceptance of such a practice under local law. The court based its ruling on statutory grounds, but its interpretation of its statutory jurisdiction was dictated by its view that a contrary interpretation would contravene the Seventh Amendment. 28 F. Cas., at 750. And in <i>Justices </i>v. <i>Murray, </i>9 Wall. 274, 281 (1870), this Court relied on <i>Wonson </i>in invalidating under the Seventh Amendment a federal habeas statute that provided for removal of certain judgments from state courts for purposes of retrial in federal court.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="452">452</a></p><p>content of that law was familiar and fixed. See, <i>e. g., ibid. </i>("[T]he common law here alluded to is not the common law of any individual state, (for it probably differs in all), but it is the common law of England, the grand reservoir of all our jurisprudence"); <i>Dimick </i>v. <i>Schiedt, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/474/case.html">293 U. S. 474</a>, 487 (1935) (Seventh Amendment "in effect adopted the rules of the common law, in respect of trial by jury, as these rules existed in 1791"). It quite plainly barred reviewing courts from entertaining claims that the jury\'s verdict was contrary to the evidence.</p><p>At common law, review of judgments was had only on writ of error, limited to questions of law. See, <i>e. g., Wonson, supra, </i>at 748; 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 405 (1768) ("The writ of error only lies upon matter of <i>law </i>arising upon the face of the proceedings; so that no evidence is required to substantiate or support it"); 1 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 213-214 (7th ed. 1956); cf. <i>Ross </i>v. <i>Rittenhouse, </i>2 Dall. 160, 163 (Pa. 1792) (McKean, C. J.). That principle was expressly acknowledged by this Court as governing federal practice in <i>Parsons </i>v. <i>Bedford, 3 </i>Pet. 433 (1830) (Story, J.). There, the Court held that no error could be assigned to a district court\'s refusal to allow transcription of witness testimony "to serve as a statement of facts in case of appeal," notwithstanding the right to such transcription under state practices made applicable to federal courts by Congress. <i>Id., </i>at 443 (emphasis deleted). This was so, the Court explained, because "[t]he whole object" of the transcription was "to present the evidence here in order to establish the error of the verdict in matters of fact," <i>id., </i>at 445-a mode of review simply unavailable on writ of error, see <i>id., </i>at 446, 448. The Court concluded that Congress had not directed federal courts to follow state practices that would change "the effect or conclusiveness of the verdict of the jury upon the facts litigated at the trial," <i>id., </i>at 449, because it had "the most serious doubts whether</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="453">453</a></p><p>[that] would not be unconstitutional" under the Seventh Amendment, <i>id., </i>at 448.</p><blockquote><p>\n"This is a prohibition to the courts of the United States to re-examine any facts tried by a jury in any other manner. The only modes known to the common law to reexamine such facts, are the granting of a new trial by the court where the issue was tried, or to which the record was properly returnable; or the award of a venire facias de novo, by an appellate court, for some error of law which intervened in the proceedings.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"[I]f the evidence were now before us, it would not be competent for this court to reverse the judgment for any error in the verdict of the jury at the trial .... " <i>Id., </i>at 447-449.</p></blockquote><p>Nor was the common-law proscription on reexamination limited to review of the correctness of the jury\'s determination of liability on the facts. No less than the existence of liability, the proper measure of damages "involves only a question of fact," <i>St. Louis, </i>1. <i>M. </i>&amp; S. <i>R. Co. </i>v. <i>Craft, 237 </i>U.

Co. </i>v. <i>Moore, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/121/558/case.html">121 U. S. 558</a>, 574 (1887).

The rules of the common-law practice incorporated in the Seventh Amendment, it is claimed, did <i>not </i>prevent judges sitting in an appellate capacity from granting a new trial on the ground that an award was contrary to the weight of the evidence. This claim simply does not withstand examination of the actual practices of the courts at common law. The weight of the historical record strongly supports the view of the common law taken in our early cases.</p><p>At common law, all major civil actions were initiated before panels of judges sitting at the courts of Westminster. Trial was not always held at the bar of the court, however. The inconvenience of having jurors and witnesses travel to Westminster had given rise to the practice of allowing trials to be held in the countryside, before a single itinerant judge. This <i>nisi prius </i>trial, as it was called, was limited to the jury\'s deciding a matter of fact in dispute; once that was accomplished, the verdict was entered on the record whichalong with any exceptions to the instructions or rulings of the <i>nisi prius </i>judge-was then returned to the en banc court at Westminster. See generally 1 Holdsworth, History of English Law, at 223-224, 278-282; G. Radcliffe &amp; G. Cross, The English Legal System 90-91, 183-186 (3d ed. 1954). Requests for new trials were made not to the <i>nisi prius </i>judge, but to the en banc court, prior to further proceedings and entry of judgment. See 1 Holdsworth, <i>supra, </i>at 282; Riddell, New Trial at the Common Law, 26 Yale L. J. 49, 53, 57 (1916).

See Blume, Review of Facts in Jury Cases-The Seventh Amendment, 20 J. Am. Jud. Soc. 130, 131 (1936); Riddell, <i>supra, </i>at 55-57, 60. There are two difficulties with this argument. The first is the characterization of the court at Westminster as an appellate body. The court\'s role with respect to the initiation of the action, the entertaining of motions for new trial, and the entry of judgment was the same in all cases-whether the cause was tried at the bar or at <i>nisi prius. </i>To regard its actions in deciding a motion for a new trial as "appellate" in the latter instance supposes a functional distinction where none existed. The second difficulty is that when the trial had been held at <i>nisi prius, </i>the judges of the en bane court apparently would order a new trial only if the <i>nisi prius </i>judge certified that he was dissatisfied with the verdict. To be sure, there are many cases where no mention is made of the judge\'s certificate, but there are many indications that it was a required predicate to setting aside a verdict rendered at <i>nisi prius, </i>and respondent has been unable to identify a single case where a new trial was granted in the absence of such certification. In short, it would seem that a new trial could not</p><p>4 The grounds for granting a new trial were "want of notice of trial; or any flagrant misbehavior of the party prevailing towards the jury, which may have influenced their verdict; or any gross misbehavior of the jury among themselves: also if it appears by the judge\'s report, certified to the court, that the jury have brought in a verdict without or contrary to evidence, so that he is reasonably dissatisfied therewith; or if they have given exorbitant damages; or if the judge himself has misdirected the jury, so that they found an unjustifiable verdict." 3 W.

Even if there were some doubt on the point, we should be hesitant to advance our view of the common law over that of our forbears, who were far better acquainted with the subject than we are.

Rev. 91, 92 (1940) ("An exhaustive examination of the early English cases has revealed not a single case where an English court at common law ever granted a new trial, as being against the evidence, unless the judge or judges who sat with the jury stated in open court, or certified, that the verdict was against the evidence and he was dissatisfied with the verdict").</p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS understands Blackstone to say that new trials were granted for <i>excessiveness </i>even where the <i>nisi prius </i>judge was not dissatisfied with the damages awarded, see <i>ante, </i>at 444-445. Blackstone\'s phrasing certainly allows for this reading, see n. 4, <i>supra, </i>but what indications we have suggest that the dissatisfaction of the presiding judge played the same role where the motion for new trial was based on a claim of excessive damages as where based on a claim of an erroneous verdict. See, <i>e. g., Boulsworth </i>v. <i>Pilkington, </i>Jones, T. 200, 84 Eng. Rep. 1216 (K. B. 1685); <i>Redshaw </i>v. <i>Brook, </i>2 Wils. K. B. 405, 95 Eng.

The cases cited by JUSTICE STEVENS, <i>ante, </i>at 444-445, n. 5, are not at all to the contrary: In one, the case was tried at the bar of the court, so that there was no <i>nisi prius </i>judge, see <i>Wood </i>v. <i>Gunston, </i>Sty. 466, 82 Eng. Rep. 867 (K. B. 1655); in the other, the judge who had presided at trial was on the panel that ruled on the new trial motion, and recommended a new trial, see <i>Bright </i>v. <i>Eynon, supra, </i>at 390-391, 396-397, 97 Eng. Rep., at 365, 368.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="458">458</a></p><p>tions for new trials is one that has already been clearly and categorically answered, by our precedents. As we said in <i>Dimick </i>v. <i>Schiedt, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/474/case.html">293 U. S. 474</a> (1935), in discussing the status of remittitur under "the rules of the common law," a doctrine that "has been accepted as the law for more than a hundred years and uniformly applied in the federal courts during that time" and "finds some support in the practice of the English courts prior to the adoption of the Constitution" will not lightly "be reconsidered or disturbed," <i>id., </i>at 484485. The time to question whether orders on motions for a new trial were in fact reviewable at common law has long since passed. Cases of this Court reaching back into the early 19th century establish that the Constitution forbids federal appellate courts to "reexamine" a fact found by the jury at trial; and that this prohibition encompasses review of a district court\'s refusal to set aside a verdict as contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p><p align="center">\nC</p><p>The Court, as is its wont of late, all but ignores the relevant history. It acknowledges that federal appellate review of district-court refusals to set aside jury awards as against the weight of the evidence was "once deemed inconsonant with the Seventh Amendment\'s Reexamination Clause," <i>ante, </i>at 434, but gives no indication of why ever we held that view; and its citation of only one of our cases subscribing to that proposition fails to convey how long and how clearly it was a fixture of federal practice, see <i>ibid. </i>(citing only <i>Lincoln </i>v. <i>Power, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/151/436/case.html">151 U. S. 436</a> (1894)). That our earlier cases are so poorly recounted is not surprising, however, given the scant analysis devoted to the conclusion that "appellate review for abuse of discretion is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment," <i>ante, </i>at 435.</p><p>No precedent of this Court affirmatively supports that proposition. The cases upon which the Court relies neither</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="459">459</a></p><p>affirmed nor rejected the practice of appellate weight-ofthe-evidence review that has been adopted by the courts of appeals-a development that, in light of our past cases, amounts to studied waywardness by the intermediate appellate bench. Our unaccountable reluctance, in <i>Grunenthal </i>v. <i>Long Island R. Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/156/case.html">393 U. S. 156</a>, 158 (1968), and <i>Neese </i>v. <i>Southern R. Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/77/case.html">350 U. S. 77</a> (1955), to stand by our precedents, and the undeniable illogic of our disposition of those two cases-approving ourselves a district-court denial of a new trial motion, so as not to have to confront the lawfulness of reversal by the court of appeals-is authority of only the weakest and most negative sort. Nor can any weight be assigned to our statement in <i>Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. </i>v. <i>Kelco Disposal, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/257/case.html">492 U. S. 257</a>, 279 (1989), seemingly approving appellate abuse-of-discretion review of denials of new trials where punitive damages are claimed to be excessive. <i>Browning-Ferris, </i>like <i>Grunenthal </i>and <i>Neese, </i>explicitly avoided the question that is before us today, see 492 U. S., at 279, n. 25. Even more significantly, <i>BrowningFerris </i>involved review of a jury\'s <i>punitive </i>damages award. Unlike the measure of actual damages suffered, which presents a question of historical or predictive fact, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Craft, </i>237 U. S., at 661, the level of punitive damages is not really a "fact" "tried" by the jury. In none of our cases holding that the Reexamination Clause prevents federal appellate review of claims of excessive damages does it appear that the damages had a truly "punitive" component.</p><p>In any event, it is not <i>this </i>Court\'s statements that the Court puts forward as the basis for dispensing with our prior cases.

See <i>ante, </i>at 435-436. To its credit, one of those treatises describes the "dramatic change in doctrine" represented by appellate abuse-of-discretion review of denials of new trial orders generally as having been "accomplished by a blizzard of dicta" that, through repetition alone, has "given legitimacy to a doctrine of doubtful constitutionality." 11 C.

And as for commentators\' observations that it would be "\'astonishing\'" for us actually to heed our precedents, see <i>ibid., </i>quoting 11 Wright, Miller, &amp; Kane, \xc2\xa7 2820, at 212, they are no more than a prediction of inconstancy-which the Court today fulfills.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="461">461</a></p><p>is possible to characterize an appeal of a denial of new trial as raising a "legal question," it is not possible to review such a claim without engaging in a "reexamin[ationJ" of the "facts tried by the jury" in a manner "otherwise" than allowed at common law. Determining whether a particular award is excessive requires that one first determine the nature and extent of the harm-which undeniably requires reviewing the facts of the case. That the court\'s review also entails application of a legal standard (whether "shocks the conscience," "deviates materially," or some other) makes no difference, for what is necessarily <i>also </i>required is <i>reexamination of facts </i>found by the jury.</p><p>In the last analysis, the Court frankly abandons any pretense at faithfulness to the common law, suggesting that "the meaning" of the Reexamination Clause was not "fixed at <i>1791," ante, </i>at 436, n. 20, contrary to the view that all our prior discussions of the Reexamination Clause have adopted, see <i>supra, </i>at 451-454. The Court believes we can ignore the very explicit command that "no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law" because, after all, we have not insisted that juries be all male, or consist of 12 jurors, as they were at common law. <i>Ante, </i>at 436, n. 20. This is a desperate analogy, since there is of course no comparison between the specificity of the command of the Reexamination Clause and the specificity of the command that there be a "jury."

This disposition contradicts the principle that "[t]he proper role of the trial and appellate courts in the federal system in reviewing the size of jury verdicts is ... a matter of federal law." <i>Donovan </i>v. <i>Penn Shipping Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/648/case.html">429 U.

Indeed, it is at least partly for this reason that the Court rejects direct application of \xc2\xa7 5501(c) at the appellate level as inconsistent with an "\'essential characteristic\'" of the federal court system-by which the Court presumably means abuse-of-discretion review of denials of motions for new trials. See <i>ante, </i>at 431, 437-438. But the scope of the Court\'s concern is oddly circumscribed. The "essential characteristic" of the federal jury, and, more specifically, the role of the federal trial court in reviewing jury judgments, apparently counts for little. The Court approves the "ac-</p><p>was one of "form" rather than "substance," quoting Lord Mansfield to the effect that \'\'\'for form\'s sake, we must set aside the whole verdict.\'\'\' <i>Id., </i>at 498 (quoting <i>Edie </i>v. <i>East India Co., </i>1 Black W. 295, 298, 96 Eng.

Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 2522 (2d ed. 1995), for its discussion of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), which permits post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law.

Cooperative, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/356/525/case.html">356 U.

S. 257</a> (1989), and gave an answer altogether contrary to the one provided today. <i>Browning-Ferris </i>rejected a request to fashion a federal common-law rule limiting the size of punitive damages awards in federal courts, reaffirming the principle of <i>Erie R.

But the opinion expressly stated that "[f]ederal law ... will control on those issues involving the proper review of the jury award by a federal district court and court of appeals." <i>Id., </i>at 278-279. "In reviewing an award of punitive damages," it said, "the role of the district court is to determine whether the jury\'s verdict is within the confines set by state law, and to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered." <i>Id., </i>at 279. The same distinction necessarily applies where the</p><p>9 Since I reject application of the New York standard on other grounds, I need not consider whether it constitutes "reexamination" of a jury\'s verdict in a manner "otherwise ... than according to the rules of the common law."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="464">464</a></p><p>judgment under review is for compensatory damages: State substantive law controls what injuries are compensable and in what amount; but federal standards determine whether the award exceeds what is lawful to such degree that it may be set aside by order for new trial or remittitur.10</p><p>The Court does not disavow those statements in <i>Browning-Ferris </i>(indeed, it does not even discuss them), but it presumably overrules them, at least where the state rule that governs "whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered" is characterized as "substantive" in nature. That, at any rate, is the reason the Court asserts for giving \xc2\xa7 5501(c) dispositive effect. The objective of that provision, the Court states, "is manifestly substantive," <i>ante, </i>at 429, since it operates to "contro[l] how much a plaintiff can be awarded" by "tightening the range of tolerable awards," <i>ante, </i>at 425, 426. Although "less readily classified" as substantive than "a statutory cap on damages," it nonetheless "was designed to provide an analogous control," <i>ante, </i>at 428, 429, by making a new trial mandatory when the award "deviat[es] materially" from what is reasonable, see <i>ante, </i>at 428-429.</p><p>I do not see how this can be so. It seems to me quite wrong to regard this provision as a "substantive" rule for <i>Erie </i>purposes. The "analog[y]" to "a statutory cap on damages," <i>ante, </i>at 428, 429, fails utterly. There is an absolutely fundamental distinction between a <i>rule of law </i>such as that, which would ordinarily be imposed upon the jury in the trial court\'s instructions, and a <i>rule of review, </i>which simply determines how closely the jury verdict will be scrutinized for</p><p>10 JUSTICE STEVENS thinks that if an award" \'exceeds what is lawful,\'" the result is "legal error" that "may be corrected" by the appellate court. <i>Ante, </i>at 443, n. 2. But the sort of "legal error" involved here is the imposition of legal consequences (in this case, damages) in light of <i>facts </i>that, under the law, may not warrant them. To suggest that every fact may be reviewed, because what may ensue from an erroneous factual determination is a "legal error," is to destroy the notion that there is a factfinding function reserved to the jury.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="465">465</a></p><p>compliance with the instructions. A tighter standard for reviewing jury determinations can no more plausibly be called a "substantive" disposition than can a tighter appellate standard for reviewing trial-court determinations. The one, like the other, provides additional assurance <i>that the law has been complied with; </i>but the other, like the one, <i>leaves the law unchanged.</i></p><p>The Court commits the classic <i>Erie </i>mistake of regarding whatever changes the outcome as substantive, see <i>ante, </i>at 428-431. That is not the only factor to be considered. See <i>Byrd, supra, </i>at 537 ("[W]ere \'outcome\' the only consideration, a strong case might appear for saying that the federal court should follow the state practice. But there are affirmative countervailing considerations at work here"). Outcome determination "was never intended to serve as a talisman," <i>Hanna </i>v. <i>Plumer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/460/case.html">380 U. S. 460</a>, 466-467 (1965), and does not have the power to convert the most classic elements of the <i>process </i>of assuring that the law is observed into the substantive law itself. The right to have a jury make the findings of fact, for example, is generally thought to favor plaintiffs, and that advantage is often thought significant enough to be the basis for forum selection. But no one would argue that <i>Erie </i>confers a right to a jury in federal court wherever state courts would provide it; or that, were it not for the Seventh Amendment, <i>Erie </i>would require federal courts to dispense with the jury whenever state courts do so.</p><p>In any event, the Court exaggerates the difference that the state standard will make. It concludes that different outcomes are likely to ensue depending on whether the law being applied is the state "deviates materially" standard of \xc2\xa7 5501(c) or the "shocks the conscience" standard. See <i>ante, </i>at 429-430. Of course it is not the federal <i>appellate </i>standard but the federal <i>district-court </i>standard for granting new trials that must be compared with the New York standard to determine whether substantially different results will obtain-and it is far from clear that the district-court standard</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="466">466</a></p><p><i>ought </i>to be "shocks the conscience." 11 Indeed, it is not even clear (as the Court asserts) that "shocks the conscience" <i>is </i>the standard (erroneous or not) actually applied by the district courts of the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit\'s test for reversing a grant of a new trial for an excessive verdict is whether the award was <i>"clearly </i>within the maximum limit of a reasonable range," <i>Ismail </i>v. <i>Cohen, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/899/183/">899 F.2d 183</a>, 186 (CA2 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), so any district court that uses that standard will be affirmed. And while many district-court decisions express the "shocks the conscience" criterion, see, <i>e. g., Koerner </i>v. <i>Club Mediterranee, </i>S. <i>A., </i>833 F. Supp. 327, 333 (SDNY 1993), some have used a standard of "indisputably egregious," <i>Banff </i>v. <i>Ex</i>press, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 1065, 1069 (SDNY 1995), or have adopted the inverse of the Second Circuit\'s test for reversing a grant of new trial, namely, <i>"clearly </i>outside the maximum limit of a reasonable range," <i>Paper Corp. </i>v. <i>Schoeller Technical Papers, Inc., </i>807 F. Supp. 337, 350-351 (SDNY 1992). Moreover, some decisions that <i>say </i>"shocks the conscience" in fact apply a rule much less stringent. One case, for example, says that <i>any </i>award that would not be sustained under the New York "deviates materially" rule "shocks the conscience." See <i>In re Joint Eastern </i>&amp; S. <i>Dist. Asbestos Litigation, </i>798 F. Supp. 925, 937 (E&amp;SDNY 1992), rev\'d on other grounds, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/995/343/">995 F.2d 343</a>, 346 (CA2 1993). In sum, it is at least highly questionable whether the consistent outcome differential claimed by the Court even exists. What seems to me far more likely to produce forum shopping is the consistent difference between the state and federal <i>appellate </i>standards, which the Court leaves untouched. Under the Court\'s</p><p>11 That the "shocks the conscience" standard was not the traditional one would seem clear from the opinion of Justice Story, quoted approvingly by the Court, <i>ante, </i>at 433, to the effect that remittitur should be granted "if it should clearly appear that the jury ... have given damages excessive in relation to the person or the injury." <i>Blunt </i>v. <i>Little, </i>3 F. Cas. 760, 761-762 (No. 1,578) <i>(CC </i>Mass. 1822).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="467">467</a></p><p>disposition, the Second Circuit reviews only for abuse of discretion, whereas New York\'s appellate courts engage in a <i>de novo </i>review for material deviation, giving the defendant a double shot at getting the damages award set aside. The only result that would produce the conformity the Court erroneously believes <i>Erie </i>requires is the one adopted by the Second Circuit and rejected by the Court: <i>de novo </i>federal appellate review under the \xc2\xa7 5501(c) standard.</p><p>To say that application of \xc2\xa7 5501(c) in place of the federal standard will not consistently produce disparate results is not to suggest that the decision the Court has made today is not a momentous one. The <i>principle </i>that the state standard governs is of great importance, since it bears the potential to destroy the uniformity of federal practice and the integrity of the federal court system. Under the Court\'s view, a state rule that directed courts "to determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if it deviates <i>in any degree </i>from <i>the proper measure of compensation" </i>would have to be applied in federal courts, effectively requiring federal judges to determine the amount of damages <i>de novo, </i>and effectively taking the matter away from the jury entirely. Cf. <i>Byrd, </i>356 U. S., at 537-538. Or consider a state rule that allowed the defendant a second trial on damages, with judgment ultimately in the amount of the lesser of two jury awards. Cf. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Wonson, </i>28 F. Cas., at 747-748 (describing Massachusetts practice by which a second jury trial could be had on appeal). Under the reasoning of the Court\'s opinion, even such a rule as that would have to be applied in the federal courts.</p><p>The foregoing describes why I think the Court\'s <i>Erie </i>analysis is flawed. But in my view, one does not even reach the <i>Erie </i>question in this case. The standard to be applied by a district court in ruling on a motion for a new trial is set forth in Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that "[a] new trial may be granted ... for any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="468">468</a></p><p>actions at law <i>in the courts of the United States." </i>(Emphasis added.) That is undeniably a federal standard.12 Federal District Courts in the Second Circuit have interpreted that standard to permit the granting of new trials where" \'it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result\'" and letting the verdict stand would result in a " \'miscarriage of justice.\'" <i>Koerner </i>v. <i>Club Mediterranee, </i>S. <i>A., supra, </i>at 331 (quoting <i>Bevevino </i>v. <i>Saydjari, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/574/676/">574 F.2d 676</a>, 684 (CA2 1978)). Assuming (as we have no reason to question) that this is a correct interpretation of what Rule 59 requires, it is undeniable that the Federal Rule is "\'sufficiently broad\' to cause a \'direct collision\' with the state law or, implicitly, to \'control the issue\' before the court, thereby leaving no room for the operation of that law." <i>Burlington Northern R. Co. </i>v. <i>Woods, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/1/case.html">480 U. S. 1</a>, 4-5 (1987). It is simply not possible to give controlling effect both to the federal standard and the state standard in reviewing the jury\'s award. That being so, the court has no choice but to apply the Federal Rule, which is an exercise of what we have called Congress\'s "power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either," <i>Hanna, 380 </i>U. S., at 472.</p><p>***</p><p>There is no small irony in the Court\'s declaration today that appellate review of refusals to grant new trials for error of fact is "a control necessary and proper to the fair adminis-</p><p>12 I agree with the Court\'s entire progression of reasoning in its footnote <i>22, ante, </i>at 437, leading to the conclusion that <i>state </i>law must determine "[w]hether damages are excessive." But the question whether damages are excessive is quite separate from the question of when a jury award may be set aside for excessiveness. See <i>supra, </i>at 465. It is the latter that is governed by Rule 59; as <i>Browning-Ferris </i>said, district courts are "to determine, by reference to <i>federal standards developed under Rule </i>59, whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered," 492 U. S., at 279 (emphasis added).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="469">469</a></p><p>tration of justice," <i>ante, </i>at 435. It is objection to <i>precisely </i>that sort of "control" by federal appellate judges that gave birth to the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment. Alas, those who drew the Amendment, and the citizens who approved it, did not envision an age in which the Constitution means whatever this Court thinks it ought to mean-or indeed, whatever the courts of appeals have recently thought it ought to mean.</p><p>When there is added to the revision of the Seventh Amendment the Court\'s precedent-setting disregard of Congress\'s instructions in Rule 59, one must conclude that this is a bad day for the Constitution\'s distinctive Article III courts in general, and for the role of the jury in those courts in particular. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
