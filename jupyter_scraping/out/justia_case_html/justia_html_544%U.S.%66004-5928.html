DRETKE<br/>\n544 U.

S.\xc2\xa0T. 77, 100\xe2\x80\x93101, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No.\xc2\xa06820, without regard to procedural default doctrines; and second, whether a federal court should give effect, as a matter of judicial comity and uniform treaty interpretation, to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  543 U. S. ___ (2004).  After we granted certiorari, Medell\xc3\xadn filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, relying in part upon a memorandum from President George W. Bush that was issued after we granted certiorari.  This state-court proceeding may provide Medell\xc3\xadn with the very reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that he now seeks in the present proceeding.  The merits briefing in this case also has revealed a number of hurdles Medell\xc3\xadn must surmount before qualifying for federal habeas relief in this proceeding, based on the resolution of the questions he has presented here.  For these reasons we dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  See <em>Ticor Title Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Brown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/117/index.html">511 U. S. 117</a>, 121\xe2\x80\x93122 (1994) <em>(per curiam); The Monrosa</em> v. <em>Carbon Black Export, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/359/180/index.html">359 U. S. 180</a>, 183\xe2\x80\x93184 (1959); <em>Goins</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/306/622/index.html">306 U. S. 622</a> (1939).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn, a Mexican national, confessed to participating in the gang rape and murder of two girls in 1993.  He was convicted and sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed on direct appeal.  Medell\xc3\xadn then filed a state habeas corpus action, claiming for the first time that Texas failed to notify him of his right to consular access as required by the Vienna Convention.  The state trial court rejected this claim, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn then filed this federal habeas corpus petition, again raising the Vienna Convention claim.  The District Court denied the petition.  Subsequently, while Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s application to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for a certificate of appealability was pending, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c), the ICJ issued its decision in <em>Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v. <em>U. S.)</em>, 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), in which the Republic of Mexico had alleged violations of the Vienna Convention with respect to Medell\xc3\xadn and other Mexican nationals facing the death penalty in the United States.  The ICJ determined that the Vienna Convention guaranteed individually enforceable rights, that the United States had violated those rights, and that the United States must \xe2\x80\x9cprovide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the [affected] Mexican nationals\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether the violations \xe2\x80\x9ccaused actual prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d without allowing procedural default rules to bar such review.  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6 121\xe2\x80\x93122, 153.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals denied Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s application for a certificate of appealability.  It did so based on Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default, see <em>Breard</em> v. <em>Greene,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/371/index.html"></a><a href="/us/523/371/index.html">523 U. S. 371</a>, 375 (1998) <em>(per curiam)</em>, and its prior holdings that the Vienna Convention did not create an individually enforceable right, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Jimenez-Nava</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d 192, 195 (CA5 2001).  371 F.\xc2\xa03d 270 (CA5 2004).  While acknowledging the existence of the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Avena</em> judgment, the court gave no dispositive effect to that judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More than two months after we granted certiorari, and a month before oral argument in this case, President Bush issued a memorandum that stated the United States would discharge its international obligations under the <em>Avena</em> judgment by \xe2\x80\x9chaving State courts give effect to the [ICJ] decision in accordance with general principles of comity in cases filed by the 51 Mexican nationals addressed in that decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9a.  Relying on this memorandum and the <em>Avena</em> judgment as separate bases for relief that were not available at the time of his first state habeas corpus action, Medell\xc3\xadn filed a successive state application for a writ of habeas corpus just four days before oral argument here.  That state proceeding may provide Medell\xc3\xadn with the review and reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that the ICJ required, and that Medell\xc3\xadn now seeks in this proceeding.  This new development, as well as the factors discussed below, leads us to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are several threshold issues that could independently preclude federal habeas relief for Medell\xc3\xadn, and thus render advisory or academic our consideration of the questions presented.  These issues are not free from doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, even accepting, <em>arguendo</em>, the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Vienna Convention\xe2\x80\x99s consular access provisions, a violation of those provisions may not be cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding.  In <em>Reed</em> v. <em>Farley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/339/index.html">512 U. S. 339</a> (1994), this Court recognized that a violation of federal statutory rights ranked among the \xe2\x80\x9cnonconstitutional lapses we have held not cognizable in a postconviction proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d unless they meet the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental defect\xe2\x80\x9d test announced in our decision in <em>Hill</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/368/424/index.html">368 U. S. 424</a>, 428 (1962).  512 U. S., at 349 (plurality opinion); see also <em>id</em>., at 355\xe2\x80\x93356 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In order for Medell\xc3\xadn to obtain federal habeas relief, Medell\xc3\xadn must therefore establish that <em>Reed</em> does not bar his treaty claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, with respect to any claim the state court \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d habeas relief in federal court is available only if such adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1); see <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Visciotti,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/19/index.html">537 U. S. 19</a>, 22\xe2\x80\x9327 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The state habeas court, which disposed of the case before the ICJ rendered its judgment in <em>Avena</em>, arguably \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d three claims.  It found that the Vienna Convention did not create individual, judicially enforceable rights and that state procedural default rules barred Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s consular access claim.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the state trial court found that Medell\xc3\xadn \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] to show that he was harmed by any lack of notification to the Mexican consulate concerning his arrest for capital murder; [Medell\xc3\xadn] was provided with effective legal representation upon [his] request; and [his] constitutional rights were safeguarded.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Medell\xc3\xadn would have to overcome the deferential standard with regard to all of these findings before obtaining federal habeas relief on his Vienna Convention claim.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, a habeas corpus petitioner generally cannot enforce a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d of law.  <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html">489 U. S. 288</a> (1989).  Before relief could be granted, then, we would be obliged to decide whether or how the <em>Avena</em> judgment bears on our ordinary \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, Medell\xc3\xadn requires a certificate of appealability in order to pursue the merits of his claim on appeal.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c)(1).  A certificate of appealability may be granted only where there is \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial showing of the denial of a <em>constitutional</em> right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72253(c)(2) (emphasis added).  To obtain the necessary certificate of appealability to proceed in the Court of Appeals, Medell\xc3\xadn must demonstrate that his allegation of a <em>treaty</em> violation could satisfy this standard.  See <em>Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U. S. 473</a>, 483 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, Medell\xc3\xadn can seek federal habeas relief only on claims that have been exhausted in state court.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(b)(1)(A), (b)(3).  To gain relief based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s memorandum or ICJ judgments, Medell\xc3\xadn would have to show that he exhausted all available state-court remedies.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of the possibility that the Texas courts will provide Medell\xc3\xadn with the review he seeks pursuant to the <em>Avena</em> judgment and the President\xe2\x80\x99s memorandum, and the potential for review in this Court once the Texas courts have heard and decided Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s pending action, we think it would be unwise to reach and resolve the multiple hindrances to dispositive answers to the questions here presented.  Accordingly, we dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Of course Medell\xc3\xadn, or the State of Texas, can seek certiorari in this Court from the Texas courts\xe2\x80\x99 disposition of the state habeas corpus application.  In that instance, this Court would in all likelihood have an opportunity to review the Texas courts\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of the President\xe2\x80\x99s memorandum and <em>Case Concerning Avena</em> <em>and other Mexican Nationals </em>(<em>Mex. </em>v. <em>U. S.</em>), 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), unencumbered by the issues that arise from the procedural posture of this action.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Federal District Court reviewing that finding observed:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMedell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s allegations of prejudice are speculative.  The police officers informed Medell\xc3\xadn of his right to legal representation before he confessed to involvement in the murders.  Medell\xc3\xadn waived his right to advisement by an attorney.  Medell\xc3\xadn does not challenge the voluntary nature of his confession.  There is no indication that, if informed of his consular rights, Medell\xc3\xadn would not have waived those rights as he did his right to counsel.  Medell\xc3\xadn fails to establish a \xe2\x80\x98causal connection between the [Vienna Convention] violation and [his] statements.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a\xe2\x80\x9385a (brackets in original).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In <em>Breard</em> v. <em>Greene,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/371/index.html"></a><a href="/us/523/371/index.html">523 U. S. 371</a> (1998) <em>(per curiam)</em>, we addressed the claim that Virginia failed to notify a Paraguayan national of his Vienna Convention right to consular access.  In denying various writs, motions, and stay applications, we noted that the Vienna Convention \xe2\x80\x9carguably confers on an individual the right to consular assistance following arrest\xe2\x80\x9d; that Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default doctrine applied to the Vienna Convention claim; and that a successful Vienna Convention claimant likely must demonstrate prejudice.  <em>Id.,</em> at 375\xe2\x80\x93377.  At the time of our <em>Breard</em> decision, however, we confronted no final ICJ adjudication.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0On March 8, 2005, Medell\xc3\xadn filed a successive state habeas action based on Tex.

S.\xc2\xa0T. 77, 100\xe2\x80\x93101, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 6820.  The Convention called for prompt notice of Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s arrest to the Mexican consul.  Medell\xc3\xadn could then seek consular advice and assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After unsuccessful challenges to his conviction and sentence, first in state court, later in federal court, Medell\xc3\xadn sought this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review.  His petition for certiorari, which this Court granted, rests primarily on a judgment rendered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on March 31, 2004: <em>Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v. <em>U. S.)</em>, 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. No. 128 <em>(Avena).</em>  Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s petition also draws support from  an ICJ judgment of the same order earlier rendered against the United States: <em>LaGrand Case (F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0G. </em>v. <em>U. S.)</em>, 2001 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 466 (Judgment of June 27) <em>(LaGrand)</em>.  The ICJ held in <em>Avena</em> that the failure to accord Vienna Convention rights to Medell\xc3\xadn and other similarly situated Mexican nationals necessitated review and reconsideration of their convictions and sentences by United States courts.  Further, the ICJ specified, procedural default doctrines could not be invoked to bar the required review and reconsideration.  Medell\xc3\xadn sought certiorari on two questions: (1) Are courts in the United States bound by the <em>Avena</em> judgment; (2) Should courts in the United States give effect to the <em>Avena</em> and <em>LaGrand </em>judgments \xe2\x80\x9cin the interest of judicial comity and uniform treaty interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner i.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 28, 2005, President Bush announced:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he United States will discharge its international obligations under the decision of the International Court of Justice in <em>[Avena]</em>, by having State courts give effect to the decision in accordance with general principles of comity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 9a (hereinafter President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum).</p>\n<p align="left">\nMedell\xc3\xadn thereupon moved to stay further proceedings in this Court pending his pursuit of remedies in Texas court, as contemplated by the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum.  I would grant Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s stay motion as the most conservative among courses the Court might take.

(\xe2\x80\x9cPresident Bush\xe2\x80\x99s determination and the <em>Avena</em> Judgment constitute two separate sources of binding federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Texas courts are now positioned immediately to adjudicate these cleanly presented issues in the first instance.

Three specific issues deserve further consideration: (1) whether the International Court of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s favor, <em>Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex.</em> v. <em>U.

These tentative predictions are not, in my view, reason enough to avoid questions that are as compelling now as they were when we granted a writ of certiorari, and that remain properly before this Court.

The problem may have considerable ramifications, because foreign nationals are regularly subject to state criminal justice systems.  For example, in 2003, over 56,000 noncitizens were held in state prisons.  Noncitizens accounted for over 10% of the prison populations in California, New York, and Arizona.  U. S.

Foreign Nationals and the Death Penalty in the United States, Reported Foreign Nationals Under Sentence of Death in the U. S., http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/\narticle.php?did=198&amp;scid=31.  In <em>Avena</em>, the ICJ determined that the United States had breached its obligation to inform 51 Mexican nationals, all sentenced to death in this country, of their right to consular notification.  Medell\xc3\xadn is just one of them.  2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. No. 128, \xc2\xb6106.  His case thus presents, and the Court in turn avoids, questions that will inevitably recur.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jos\xc3\xa9 Ernesto Medell\xc3\xadn told the officers who arrested him in Texas that he was born in Laredo, Mexico.  App. JA 15.  He also told the Harris County Pretrial Services that he is not an American citizen.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 165a.  Nonetheless, Medell\xc3\xadn was arrested, detained, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death without ever being informed that he could contact the Mexican consul.  Mexican consular authorities only became aware of Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s predicament some six weeks after his conviction was affirmed, when he wrote them a letter from Texas\xe2\x80\x99 death row.  Since coming into contact with his consul, Medell\xc3\xadn has maintained that Texas authorities violated his rights under the Convention and has sought (among other relief) an evidentiary hearing to determine whether he was prejudiced by the violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, Medell\xc3\xadn filed a state application for a writ of habeas corpus.  The Texas trial court denied relief, reasoning in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c13.Based on the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s lack of objection at trial to the alleged failure to inform him of his rights under the Vienna Convention, the applicant is procedurally barred from presenting his habeas claim that the alleged violation of the Vienna Convention violated his constitutional rights.  <em>Hodge</em> v. <em>State</em>, 631 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 754, 757 (Tex.

While that petition was pending, the ICJ announced its interpretation of Article 36 in a case that Germany had brought against the United States after Arizona failed to advise two German capital defendants about consular notification.  <em>LaGrand</em>, <em>supra</em>.  Consistent with Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s own arguments about the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, the ICJ decided in <em>LaGrand </em>that the treaty confers individual rights and requires that state procedural default rules sometimes give way when foreign national defendants raise Vienna Convention claims.  See <em>id.</em>, at 490\xe2\x80\x93491, 497\xe2\x80\x93498.  Medell\xc3\xadn  argued to the District Court that the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Article 36 was definitive, persuasive, and should control the resolution of his claim.  Rejecting these and other arguments, the District Court denied relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn then sought to obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c).  A COA may issue only if the applicant has demonstrated that \xe2\x80\x9creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner [in the district court] or that the issues presented were \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U.

See <em>Avena</em>, <em>supra</em>.  The ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Avena</em> issued while Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s application for a COA was pending.  Repeating the construction it had given to Article 36 in <em>LaGrand</em>, the ICJ decided that Medell\xc3\xadn and 50 others were entitled to review and reconsideration of their convictions and sentences because the United States, through various individual States, had violated their Vienna Convention rights.  <em>Avena</em>, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xb6153.  The Court of Appeals noted the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s pronouncements in <em>LaGrand</em> and <em>Avena</em>, and nonetheless concluded that Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s treaty claim lacked the requisite merit for a COA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari on two questions.  First, does <em>Avena</em> have preclusive effect in our courts?  Second, if our courts are not bound to apply <em>Avena</em> as a rule of decision, must they give the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision effect for sake of uniform treaty interpretation or comity?  These questions refer to substantial, debatable issues in Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s Vienna Convention claim.  I would therefore vacate the denial of a COA and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At every step, the federal courts must evaluate Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s Vienna Convention claim through the framework of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which controls the process by which a state prisoner may obtain federal habeas relief.  And wherever the Convention, which has been in continuous force since 1969, conflicts with this subsequently enacted statute, the statute must govern.  <em>Reid</em> v. <em>Covert</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/1/index.html">354 U.

According to \xc2\xa72253(c)(2), a COA may issue \xe2\x80\x9conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\xe2\x80\x9d  Texas maintains that prisoners may only appeal district courts\xe2\x80\x99 adverse decisions involving constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x94that Congress did not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional\xe2\x80\x9d in the statute as shorthand for all of the federal claims traditionally heard in habeas.

By obliging applicants to make a threshold showing before their cases are aired out on appeal, the COA serves an important screening function and conserves the resources of appellate courts.  To that end, the existence of a COA is jurisdictional insofar as a prisoner cannot appeal in habeas without one.  See <em>id</em>., at 335\xe2\x80\x93336.  Accordingly, a federal court must verify that that a COA has issued before hearing the merits of a habeas appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It does not follow, however, that courts must raise and decide predicate arguments about the validity of a COA independently, without prompting from the parties, even when ordinary waiver rules would apply, as they must with true jurisdictional arguments.  If that were so, an appellate court, presiding over an appeal after the district court had issued a COA, would always be required to check that a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial showing\xe2\x80\x9d had been made and a cognizable right asserted\xe2\x80\x94even in the absence of controversy between the parties.  We have never imposed such a rule, and it would undermine the efficiency of the COA process.  Cf. <em>Young</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 124 F.\xc2\xa03d 794, 799 (CA7 1997).  Predicate considerations for a COA\xe2\x80\x94whether a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial showing\xe2\x80\x9d has been made or a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional right\xe2\x80\x9d asserted\xe2\x80\x94are not the sorts of considerations that remain open for review throughout the entire case.  Compare <em>Peguero</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/23/index.html">526 U. S. 23</a> (1999) (considering whether a violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a)(2) provided a basis for collateral relief), with Brief for United States in <em>Peguero</em> v. <em>United States</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1998, No. 97\xe2\x80\x939217, p. 6, n.\xc2\xa05 (arguing that \xc2\xa72253(c) deprived the Court of jurisdiction because a constitutional right was not at stake).  Thus, because Texas did not argue below that a treaty-based claim cannot support an application for a COA, it cannot raise the argument now.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Texas also adverts to another AEDPA provision, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), which it says is fatal to Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s treaty claim.  The statute provides that a writ of habeas corpus shall not issue on behalf of a person in state custody with respect to any claim \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\xe2\x80\x94(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s claim clears these hurdles is an appropriate consideration for an appellate court contemplating whether to grant a COA, and for this Court reviewing the denial of a COA.  See <em>Miller-El</em>, 537 U. S., at 349\xe2\x80\x93350 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cA circuit justice or judge must deny a COA \xe2\x80\xa6 if all reasonable jurists would conclude that a substantive provision of the federal habeas statute bars relief\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id</em>., at 336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s Vienna Convention claim is not entitled to deference under \xc2\xa72254(d), and thus should not constrain a final decision in federal court about whether he deserves habeas relief.  The Texas court gave two reasons for dismissing the claim.  First, it applied its procedural default rule to Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of right under the Vienna Convention.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  In so doing, it did not adjudicate the merits of the relevant federal question\xe2\x80\x94whether, under Article 36(2), the treaty overrides state procedural default rules.  Second, the Texas court appears to have reasoned that private individuals (as opposed to offended nations) can never enforce any treaty in court.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  This reasoning is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d our precedents and, therefore, is not entitled to deference in subsequent federal proceedings.  \xe2\x80\x9cA state-court decision will certainly be contrary to our clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 405 (2000); see also <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Payton</em>, <em>ante,</em> at 7.  The Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s blanket rule plainly contradicts our governing law, for it is axiomatic that, while treaties are compacts between nations, \xe2\x80\x9ca treaty may also contain provisions which confer certain rights upon the citizens or subjects of one of the nations residing in the territorial limits of the other, which partake of the nature of municipal law, and which are capable of enforcement as between private parties in the courts of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Head Money Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/112/580/index.html">112 U. S. 580</a>, 598 (1884).  The Texas court neither asked nor answered the right question: whether an individual can bring a claim under <em>this</em> particular treaty.  Accordingly, any consideration of Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s Vienna Convention claim for habeas relief in federal court\xe2\x80\x94including his assertion that <em>Avena</em> provides a binding rule of decision\xe2\x80\x94must proceed <em>de novo</em>.  See <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 406.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court catalogs a number of other, nonjurisdictional questions that, in its view, justify dismissing the case because they could preclude ultimate habeas relief for Medell\xc3\xadn.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Apparently the Court agrees that it would be impossible or imprudent to decide these questions today.  It seems odd to me to leave them undecided and yet to rely on them as reason to avoid the weighty questions that <em>are</em> undeniably properly before us.  Given the posture of this case, our modest task is to decide only whether Medell\xc3\xadn has presented claims worthy of a COA, and the majority points to issues outside the scope of that inquiry.  Anyway, it is not our practice generally, when remanding a case to the lower courts after resolving discrete questions, to canvass all of the possible permutations of what could happen before a final resolution.  Thus, while the Court points to questions that are, of course, important, none ought to detain us here.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, Texas and the United States have made no mention of <em>Reed</em> v. <em>Farley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/339/index.html">512 U. S. 339</a> (1994), and <em>Hill</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/368/424/index.html">368 U. S. 424</a> (1962), depriving Medell\xc3\xadn of an opportunity to discuss their applicability to his case\xe2\x80\x94a complicated question.  Second, while Texas did argue in its certiorari papers that Medell\xc3\xadn had already received a prejudice analysis in state habeas, see Brief in Opposition 14\xe2\x80\x9316, it abandoned this argument in its brief on the merits.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>International Business Machines Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/843/index.html">517 U. S. 843</a>, 855, n.\xc2\xa03 (1996) (the Court does not address abandoned arguments).  Here, Texas argues that Medell\xc3\xadn cannot show prejudice in a<em> future </em>proceeding, not that he has already failed to show prejudice or that the state court thought (not unreasonably) that the Vienna Convention had been satisfied by its prejudice analysis.  See Brief for Respondent 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  Moreover, Medell\xc3\xadn has maintained an unfulfilled request for an evidentiary hearing about prejudice.  The ICJ, for its part, appears to believe that Medell\xc3\xadn has yet to receive the prejudice analysis that the Vienna Convention requires; otherwise, it would not have ruled\xe2\x80\x94after the state habeas proceedings had concluded\xe2\x80\x94that the United States must still provide \xe2\x80\x9creview and reconsideration\xe2\x80\x9d of his sentence to determine if he suffered \xe2\x80\x9cactual prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Avena,</em> 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. No. 128, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6121\xe2\x80\x93122, 153.  Third, the Court is correct to observe that, before obtaining relief, Medell\xc3\xadn would have to contend with <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html">489 U. S. 288</a> (1989).  The Court of Appeals never discussed <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s applicability to Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Whether <em>Teague</em> bars relief for Medell\xc3\xadn is itself a highly debatable question that should be part of a proper COA analysis upon remand.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhile a COA ruling is not the occasion for a ruling on the merit of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miller-El</em>, 537 U. S., at 331, some assessment of Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s arguments is necessary to explain why the COA\xe2\x80\x99s denial should be vacated.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, Apr. 18, 1961, Art.\xc2\xa0I [1970] 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 326, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 6820 (hereinafter Optional Protocol).  The United States was party to the Optional Protocol until recently.  See Letter from Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State, to Kofi A. Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations (Mar. 7, 2005) (notifying the Secretary-General that the United States hereby withdraws from the Optional Protocol).  And the ICJ decided <em>LaGrand</em> and <em>Avena</em> pursuant to the Optional Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s grant of authority.  The first question on which we granted certiorari asks whether American courts are now bound to follow the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Avena</em> when deciding Vienna Convention claims.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Medell\xc3\xadn is right to say that they must, then the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of his Vienna Convention claim is not merely debatable, but wrong in result and in reasoning.  In terms of result, the ICJ made clear that it would be improper to dismiss Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s claim, for once the United States had committed \xe2\x80\x9cinternationally wrongful acts,\xe2\x80\x9d the necessary \xe2\x80\x9cremedy to make good these violations should consist in an obligation on the United States to permit review and reconsideration of [the 51 Mexican] nationals\xe2\x80\x99 cases by the United States courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Avena</em>, 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. No. 128, \xc2\xb6121.  The ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is also irreconcilable with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s.  The ICJ specified that the Convention confers rights on individual defendants, and that applying state procedural default rules to prevent them from vindicating their rights violates the treaty, for the treaty requires that its purposes be given \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98full effect.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6106, 113.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn argues that once the United States undertakes a substantive obligation (as it did in the Vienna Convention), and at the same time undertakes to abide by the result of a specified dispute resolution process (as it did by submitting to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction through the Optional Protocol), it is bound by the rules generated by that process no less than it is by the treaty that is the source of the substantive obligation.  In other words, because <em>Avena</em> was decided on the back of a self-executing treaty, see <em>infra, </em>at 15, it must be given effect in our domestic legal system just as the treaty itself must be.  Medell\xc3\xadn asserts, at bottom, that <em>Avena</em>, like a treaty, has the status of supreme law of the land.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, Texas and the United States argue that the issue turns in large part on how to interpret Article 94(1) of the United Nations Charter, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice in any case to which it is a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  59 Stat. 1051.  They maintain that the charter imposes an international duty only on our political branches.  A contrary result could deprive the Executive of necessary discretion in foreign relations, and may improperly displace this Court\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities to an international body.  For his part, Medell\xc3\xadn says that Article 94(1) cannot answer the question of whether, under domestic law and the Supremacy Clause, our courts are bound to comply with the international obligation reflected in <em>Avena</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals passed on whether it was bound by <em>Avena</em>, and decided that the issue was not worthy of a COA.  In so doing, it noted some conflict between <em>Avena</em> and our decision in <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Greene</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/371/index.html">523 U. S. 371</a>, 376 (1998) <em>(per curiam).</em>  How to resolve that conflict is a difficult question.  Reasonable jurists can vigorously disagree about whether and what legal effect ICJ decisions have in our domestic courts, and about whether Medell\xc3\xadn can benefit from such effect in this posture.  The Court of Appeals should have granted a COA and given the issue further consideration.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also granted certiorari on a second, alternative question that asks whether and what weight American courts should give to <em>Avena</em>, perhaps for sake of uniform treaty interpretation, even if they are not bound to follow the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  That question can only be answered by holding up the <em>Avena</em> interpretation of the treaty against the domestic court\xe2\x80\x99s own conclusions, and then deciding how and to what extent the two should be reconciled.  See <em>Olympic Airways</em> v. <em>Husain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/644/index.html">540 U. S. 644</a>, 660\xe2\x80\x93661 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting); <em>Air France</em> v. <em>Saks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/392/index.html">470 U. S. 392</a>, 404 (1985).  Accordingly, the second question presented encompassed two other issues, both pressed and passed upon below, that are themselves debatable and thus grounds for a COA: whether the Vienna Convention creates judicially enforceable rights and whether it sometimes trumps state procedural default rules.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has remarked that Article 36 of the Vienna Convention \xe2\x80\x9carguably confers on an individual the right to consular assistance following arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Breard</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 376.  The United States maintains, on the contrary, that Article 36 does not give foreign nationals a judicially enforceable right to consular access.  On that theory, a detained foreign national may <em>never</em> complain in court\xe2\x80\x94even in the course of a trial or on direct review\xe2\x80\x94about a state\xe2\x80\x99s failure to \xe2\x80\x9cinform the person concerned without delay of his rights under\xe2\x80\x9d Article 36.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 101.  The complainant must be the sending state, and any remedy is political, diplomatic, or between the states in international law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When called upon to interpret a treaty in a given case or controversy, we give considerable weight to the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of our treaty obligations.  See <em>Kolovrat</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/187/index.html">366 U. S. 187</a>, 194 (1961); <em>Charlton</em> v. <em>Kelly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/229/447/index.html">229 U. S. 447</a>, 468 (1913).  But a treaty\xe2\x80\x99s meaning is not beyond debate once the Executive has interpreted it.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Chan</em> v. <em>Korean Air Lines, Ltd.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/122/index.html">490 U. S. 122</a>, 136 (1989) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (observing that the Court was rejecting a view of the Warsaw Convention that had consistently been adopted by the Executive Branch and had been pressed by the United States in that case); <em>Perkins</em> v. <em>Elg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/307/325/index.html">307 U. S. 325</a>, 328, 337\xe2\x80\x93342 (1939) (declining to adopt Executive\xe2\x80\x99s treaty interpretation); <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Browne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/205/309/index.html">205 U.

Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 26.  Chief Justice Marshall explained that a self-executing treaty is domestic law.  It \xe2\x80\x9coperates of itself,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca rule for the Court,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent to an act of the legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Neilson</em>, 2 Pet. 253, 314 (1829).  Because the Convention is self-executing, then, its guarantees are susceptible to judicial enforcement just as the provisions of a statute would be.  See <em>Head Money Cases</em>, 112 U. S., at 598\xe2\x80\x93599 (\xe2\x80\x9cA treaty, then, is a law of the land as an act of Congress is, whenever its provisions prescribe a rule by which the rights of the private citizen or subject may be determined.  And when such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court of justice, that court resorts to the treaty for a rule of decision for the case before it as it would to a statute\xe2\x80\x9d); see generally L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the United States Constitution 206\xe2\x80\x93209 (2d ed. 1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To ascertain whether Article 36 confers a right on individuals, we first look to the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s text as we would with a statute\xe2\x80\x99s.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alvarez-Machain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/655/index.html">504 U. S. 655</a>, 663 (1992); <em>Air France</em> v. <em>Saks</em>, 470 U. S., at 397.  Article 36(1)(b) entails three different obligations for signatory host countries.  Their competent authorities shall (1) inform the consul of its nationals\xe2\x80\x99 detentions, (2) forward communication from a detained national to his consulate, and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cinform the person concerned without delay of <em>his rights under this sub-paragraph</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 101 (emphasis added).  Of these, the third exclusively concerns the detained individual, and it is the only obligation expressed in the language of rights.  If Article 36(1) conferred no rights on the detained individual, its command to \xe2\x80\x9cinform\xe2\x80\x9d the detainee of \xe2\x80\x9chis rights\xe2\x80\x9d might be meaningless.  Other provisions in the treaty appear to refer back to individual rights.  See Art. 36(1)(a), <em>ibid.;</em> Art. 36(2),<em> ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the questions of whether a treaty is self-executing and whether it creates private rights and remedies are analytically distinct.  If Article 36(1)(b) imposed only two obligations on signatory countries\xe2\x80\x94to notify the consul and forward correspondence\xe2\x80\x94then Medell\xc3\xadn could not invoke the treaty as a source of personal rights by virtue of its self-executing character.  But the treaty goes further\xe2\x80\x94imposing an obligation to inform the individual of his rights in the treaty.  And if a statute were to provide, for example, that arresting authorities \xe2\x80\x9cshall inform a detained person without delay of his right to counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d I question whether more would be required before a defendant could invoke that statute to complain in court if he had not been so informed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has repeatedly enforced treaty-based rights of individual foreigners, allowing them to assert claims arising from various treaties.  These treaties, often regarding reciprocity in commerce and navigation, do not share any special magic words.  Their rights-conferring language is arguably no clearer than the Vienna Convention\xe2\x80\x99s is, and they do not specify judicial enforcement.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Asakura</em> v. <em>Seattle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/265/332/index.html">265 U. S. 332</a>, 340 (1924) (allowing Japanese national to bring a claim under a United States-Japan treaty requiring that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98citizens or subjects of each of the [two countries] shall have liberty \xe2\x80\xa6 to carry on trade\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the other\xe2\x80\x99s territory, and holding that a local licensing ordinance for pawnbrokers could not be applied to the Japanese petitioner without violating the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee); <em>Kolovrat, supra</em>, at 192, and n. 6 (sustaining Yugoslavians\xe2\x80\x99 claim against enforcement of Oregon inheritance law limiting their right to inherit, when United States-Serbia Treaty promised that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]n all that concerns the right of acquiring, possessing or disposing of every kind of property \xe2\x80\xa6 citizens of [each country in the other] shall enjoy the rights which the respective laws grant \xe2\x80\xa6 in each of these states to the subjects of the most favored nation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, the United States acknowledges with approval that other provisions of the Vienna Convention, which relate to consular privileges and immunities, have been the source of judicially enforced individual rights.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 26, n. 7 (citing <em>Risk</em> v. <em>Halvorsen</em>, 936 F.\xc2\xa02d 393, 397 (CA9 1991) (deciding whether Article 43 of the Vienna Convention defeated jurisdiction under 28 U.

Although Article 43 is phrased in terms of courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction, its violations could theoretically also be vindicated exclusively in political and diplomatic processes, but have not been.

The preamble to the Vienna Convention, for example, states that \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of such privileges and immunities [contained in the treaty] is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of functions by consular posts on behalf of their respective States.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 79.  Moreover, State Department and congressional statements contemporaneous with the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s ratification say or indicate that the Convention would not require significant departures from existing practice.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Li</em>, 206 F.\xc2\xa03d 56, 64\xe2\x80\x9365 (CA1 2000); but see <em>id</em>., at 73\xe2\x80\x9375 (Torruella, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The United States interprets such statements to mean that the political branches did not contemplate a role for the treaty in ordinary criminal proceedings.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  The Government also asserts that the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s previous litigation behavior in Article 36 cases is consistent with the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s treaty interpretation presented here.  <em>Id</em>., at 22\xe2\x80\x9323; see also <em>Li</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 64.  I would allow fuller consideration of this issue upon the granting of a COA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, even if the Convention does confer individual rights, there remains the question of whether such rights can be forfeited according to state procedural default rules.  Article 36(2) of the treaty provides: \xe2\x80\x9cThe rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State, subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this Article are intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 101.  Medell\xc3\xadn contends that this provision requires that state procedural default rules sometimes be set aside so that the treaty can be given \xe2\x80\x9cfull effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In <em>Breard</em>, in the course of denying a stay of imminent execution and accompanying petitions, we concluded that the petitioner had defaulted his Article 36 claim by failing to raise it in state court prior to seeking collateral relief in federal court.  523 U. S., at 375\xe2\x80\x93376.  Subsequently in <em>Avena,</em> as explained above, the International Court of Justice interpreted Article 36(2) differently.  <em>Avena</em>, 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. No. 128, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6112\xe2\x80\x93113.  In the past the Court has revisited its interpretation of a treaty when new international law has come to light.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Percheman</em>, 7 Pet. 51, 89 (1833).  Even if <em>Avena</em> is not itself a binding rule of decision in this case, it may at least be occasion to return to the question of Article 36(2)\xe2\x80\x99s implications for procedural default.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, I would not decide that question today.  All that is required of Medell\xc3\xadn now is to show that his case is debatable.  He has done at least that much.  Because of the COA posture, we cannot, and I would not, construe Article 36 definitively here.  I would conclude only that Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s arguments about the treaty themselves warrant a COA.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons explained, I would vacate the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision to deny Medell\xc3\xadn a COA with which to proceed, and remand for further proceedings.  After we granted certiorari in this case, the President informed his Attorney General that the United States would discharge its obligations under the <em>Avena</em> judgment \xe2\x80\x9cby having State courts give effect to the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 9a.  Medell\xc3\xadn has since filed a successive petition in state court.  It is possible that the Texas court will grant him relief on the basis of the President\xe2\x80\x99s memorandum.  On remand, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit may have wished to consider that possibility when scheduling further federal proceedings, and to hold the case on its docket until Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s successive petition was resolved in state court.  See <em>Landis</em> v. <em>North American Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/248/index.html">299 U. S. 248</a>, 254 (1936).</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court suggests that Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Avena</em> may be a distinct claim, and that he may not have properly exhausted it in state court.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  But Medell\xc3\xadn has maintained a single claim throughout the state and federal habeas proceedings\xe2\x80\x94that Texas violated his rights under the Vienna Convention and that he is entitled to a remedy for that violation.  Pointing to <em>Avena</em> as a rule of decision for the adjudication of that claim is akin to pointing to a new decision from this Court to bolster an existent claim for relief.  In neither case has petitioner made a new claim as opposed to a new argument supporting his pending claim.  Cf. <em>Yee</em> v. <em>Escondido</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/519/index.html">503 U.

It asks: \xe2\x80\x9cshould a court in the United States give effect to the judgments in <em>Avena</em> and <em>LaGrand</em>\xe2\x80\x9d?  Brief for Petitioner i.  This question cannot be read to ask for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98effect\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to be given in the strict sense of the law of judgments, <em>ante</em>, at 4-5 (Ginsburg, J., concurring): Because Medell\xc3\xadn was not a beneficiary of the judgment in <em>LaGrand Case (F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0G.</em> v. <em>U. S./em&gt;.<em>)</em>, 2001 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 466 (Judgment of June 27), a case between Germany and the United States, the judgment in <em>LaGrand</em> cannot be enforced as to Medell\xc3\xadn.  What he asks is that American courts reach the same interpretation of the Vienna Convention as did the body charged with adjudicating international disputes arising out of the Convention\xe2\x80\x94in part for the sake of \xe2\x80\x9cuniform treaty interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner i.  This understanding of the second question takes account, as it should, of the fact that the correct, independent interpretation of the Vienna Convention was the central question in the habeas proceedings below.  Moreover, it is consistent with the practical way we decide what is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly included\xe2\x80\x9d in a question presented.

See <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring); see also <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Souter, J., dissenting).  But, in the absence of majority support for a stay, I would vacate the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remand the case rather than simply dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  I join Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, for she would do the same.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6, 19\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s legal argument that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican courts are now bound to follow the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Avena</em>\xe2\x80\x9d is substantial, and the Fifth Circuit erred in holding the contrary.  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 11 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting); see 371 F.\xc2\xa03d 270, 279\xe2\x80\x93280 (2004).  By vacating its judgment and remanding the case, we would remove from the books an erroneous legal determination that we granted certiorari to review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor would a remand \xe2\x80\x9cinvite the Fifth Circuit to conduct proceedings rival to those\xe2\x80\x9d unfolding in the Texas courts.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).  Rather, I should expect the Fifth Circuit to recognize two practical circumstances that favor its entering a stay.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting); see also <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the President has decided that state courts should follow <em>Avena</em>.  See <em>Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex.</em> v<em>. U. S.)</em>,<em> </em>2004 I.\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31); George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 9a.  And that fact permits Medell\xc3\xadn to argue in the Texas courts that the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination\xe2\x80\x94taken together with (1) the self-executing nature of the treaty, (2) the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s signature on the Optional Protocol, (3) the International Court of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s (ICJ) determination that the United States give Medell\xc3\xadn (and 50 other Mexican nationals) \xe2\x80\x9c<em>judicial</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, court, \xe2\x80\x9creview and reconsideration\xe2\x80\x9d of their Convention-based claims, \xe2\x80\x9cby means of [the United States\xe2\x80\x99] own choosing,\xe2\x80\x9d and (4) the United States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cundertak[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d in the United Nations Charter to comply with ICJ judgments\xe2\x80\x94requires Texas to follow the <em>Avena </em>decision in Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s case. <em> Avena, supra,</em> \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6 138\xe2\x80\x93143, 153(9) (emphasis added); Charter of the United Nations, Art. 94.1, 59 Stat. 1051; cf. <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Hylton</em>, 3 Dall. 199, 237 (1796) (treaties \xe2\x80\x9csuperior to the Constitution and laws of any individual state\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted));<em> Sale </em>v. <em>Haitian Centers Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/155/index.html">509 U.

Ann., Arts. 11.01, 11.071 (Vernon 2005) (Texas courts possess jurisdiction to hear Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s claims).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, several Members of this Court have confirmed that the federal questions implicated in this case are important, thereby suggesting that further review here after the Texas courts reach their own decisions may well be appropriate.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (it is \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d to address and resolve any significant legal ICJ-related issues that may arise in the state-court proceedings).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first consideration means that Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s claims when considered in state court are stronger than when considered in federal court\xe2\x80\x94and suggests the very real possibility of his victory in state court.  The second consideration means that a loss in state court would likely be followed by review in this Court.  Taken together they mean that, by staying the case on remand, the Fifth Circuit could well avoid the need for any further federal proceedings, or at least obtain additional guidance from this Court before taking further action.  Given these practical circumstances, it seems to me unlikely that, were we to remand this case, the Fifth Circuit would move forward on its own, rather than stay its hand until the conclusion of proceedings in the state courts and possibly here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons and those set forth by Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, I agree with the course of action she suggests and respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to dismiss the writ.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961848">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOUTER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nMEDELLIN V.

S.)</em>, 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31) <em>(Avena)</em>, supporting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s right to litigate a claimed violation of the Convention, and to litigate free of state and federal procedural bars, is preclusive in our domestic courts; and (2) whether <em>Avena</em> and the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s earlier judgment in <em>LaGrand Case (F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0G.</em> v. <em>U. S.)</em>, 2001 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 466 (Judgment of June 27), are at least entitled to enforcement for the sake of comity or uniform treaty interpretation.  Prior to argument here, the President advised the Attorney General that the United States would discharge its international obligations under the <em>Avena</em> judgment \xe2\x80\x9cby having State courts give effect to the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 9a.  Medell\xc3\xadn accordingly has gone back to state court in Texas to seek relief on the basis of the <em>Avena</em> judgment and the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  Since action by the Texas courts could render moot the questions on which we granted certiorari (not to mention the subsidiary issues spotted in the <em>per curiam</em> and dissenting opinions), I think the best course for this Court would be to stay further action for a reasonable time as the Texas courts decide what to do; that way we would not wipe out the work done in this case so far, and we would not decide issues that may turn out to require no action.  We would, however, remain in a position to address promptly the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s obligation under the judgment of the ICJ if that should prove necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because a majority of the Court does not agree to a stay, I think the next best course would be to take up the questions on which certiorari was granted, to the extent of their bearing on the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that there was no room for reasonable disagreement, meriting a COA, about Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s right to relief under the Convention.  The Court of Appeals understandably thought itself constrained by our decision in <em>Breard</em> v. <em>Greene,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/371/index.html">523 U. S. 371</a> (1998) <em>(per curiam)</em>, which the court viewed as binding until this Court said otherwise.  It is of course correct to face the possibility of saying otherwise today, since Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s case now presents a Vienna Convention claim in the shadow of a final ICJ judgment that may be entitled to considerable weight, if not preclusive effect.  This case is therefore not <em>Breard</em>, and the Court of Appeals should be free to take a fresh look.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is one of several reasons why I join Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion, but I do so subject to caveats.  We should not at this point limit the scope of proceedings on remand; the issues outlined in Part III\xe2\x80\x93B of Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion are implicated here by Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s request that domestic courts defer to the ICJ for the sake of uniform treaty interpretation.  Whether these issues would be open for consideration by the Court of Appeals in their own right, independent of the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, is not before us here, nor should our discussion of them and other matters in Part III be taken as limiting the enquiry by the Court of Appeals, were a remand possible.  I would, however, limit further proceedings by providing that the Court of Appeals should take no further action until the anticipated Texas litigation responding to the President\xe2\x80\x99s position had run its course, since action in the Texas courts might remove any occasion to proceed under the federal habeas petition.  Taking Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s proposed course subject to this limitation would eliminate the risk of further unnecessary federal rulings, but would retain federal jurisdiction and the option to act promptly, which petitioner deserves after litigating this far.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</em></div>'
