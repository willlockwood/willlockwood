S. 720</a> (1982), we held that a State generally may impose a nondiscriminatory tax upon a private company\'s proceeds from contracts with the Federal Government. This case asks us to determine whether that same rule applies when the federal contractor renders its services on an Indian reservation. We hold that it does.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Under the Federal Lands Highways Program, 23 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 204, the Federal Government finances road construction and improvement projects on federal public roads, including Indian reservation roads. Various federal agencies oversee the planning of particular projects and the allocation of funding to them. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 202(d), 204. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs has the responsibility to "plan, survey, design and construct" Indian reservation roads. 25 CFR \xc2\xa7 170.3 (1998).</p><p>Over a several-year period, the Bureau of Indian Affairs contracted with Blaze Construction Company to build, repair, and improve roads on the Navajo, Hopi, Fort Apache, Colorado River, Tohono O\'Odham, and San Carlos Apache Indian Reservations in Arizona. Blaze is incorporated under the laws of the Blackfeet Tribe of Montana and is owned by a member of that Tribe. But, as the company concedes, Blaze is the equivalent of a non-Indian for purposes of this case because none of its work occurred on the Blackfeet Reservation.

Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 42-1306, 42-1310.16 (1991). Blaze protested the assessment and prevailed at the end of administrative proceedings, but, on review, the Arizona Tax Court granted summary judgment in the Department\'s favor. The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed. 190 Ariz. 262, 947 P. 2d 836 (1997). It rejected the Department\'s argument that our decision in <i>New Mexico, supra, </i>controlled the case and held that federal law pre-empted the application of Arizona\'s transaction privilege tax to Blaze. The Arizona Supreme Court denied the Department\'s petition for review, with one justice voting to grant the petition. We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1117 (1998), and now reverse.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>In <i>New Mexico, </i>we considered whether a State could impose gross receipts and use taxes on the property, income, and purchases of private federal contractors. To remedy "the confusing nature of our precedents" in this area, 455 U. S., at 733, we announced a clear rule:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[T]ax immunity is appropriate in only one circumstance: when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned." <i>Id., </i>at 735.</p></blockquote><p>We reasoned that this "narrow approach" to the scope of governmental tax immunity "accord[ed] with competing constitutional imperatives, by giving full range to each sovereign\'s taxing authority." <i>Id., </i>at 735-736 (citing <i>Graves </i>v. <i>New York ex rel. O\'Keefe, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/466/case.html">306 U. S. 466</a>, 483 (1939)). For that immunity to be expanded beyond these "narrow constitu-</p><p>1 The Department initially also sought to tax Blaze\'s proceeds from contracts with tribal housing authorities but eventually dropped its claim.

OF REVENUE <i>v. </i>BLAZE CONSTR.

S., at 737 (emphasis added); see also <i>Carson </i>v. <i>Roane-Anderson Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/232/case.html">342 U. S. 232</a>, 234 (1952). Applying those principles, we upheld each of the taxes at issue in that case because the legal incidence of the taxes fell on the contractors, not the Federal Government; the contractors could not be considered agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government; and Congress had not expressly exempted the contractors\' activities from taxation but, rather, had expressly repealed a pre-existing statutory exemption. See <i>New Mexico, </i>455 U. S., at 743-744.</p><p>These principles control the resolution of this case. Absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption, federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona\'s transaction privilege tax. See <i>id., </i>at 737; <i>James </i>v. <i>Dravo Contracting </i>Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/302/134/case.html">302 U. S. 134</a>, 161 (1937). The incidence of Arizona\'s transaction privilege tax falls on Blaze, not the Federal Government. Blaze does not argue that it is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government, and <i>New Mexico\'s </i>clear rule would have foreclosed any such argument under these circumstances. Nor has Congress exempted these contracts from taxation. Cf. <i>Carson, supra, </i>at 234.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Arizona Court of Appeals held (and Blaze urges here) that the tax cannot be applied to activities taking place on Indian reservations.2 After it employed a</p><p>2 Blaze also appears to argue that Arizona\'s tax infringes on the Tribes\' right to make their own decisions and be governed by them and that this is sufficient, by itself, to preclude application of Arizona\'s tax. See <i>Williams </i>v. <i>Lee, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/case.html">358 U. S. 217</a>, 220 (1959). Our decisions upholding state taxes in a variety of on-reservation settings squarely foreclose that argument. See, <i>e. g., Washington </i>v. <i>Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/134/case.html">447 U. S. 134</a>, 156 (1980); <i>Moe </i>v. <i>Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html">425 U.

In cases involving taxation of on-reservation activity, we have undertaken this "particularized examination," <i>Ramah Navajo School Bd., Inc. </i>v. <i>Bureau of Revenue of </i>N. <i>M., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/832/case.html">458 U.

Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 88 Stat. 2203, 25 U. S.

Where a tribe enters into such a contract, it assumes greater responsibility over the management of the federal funds and the operation of certain federal programs. See, <i>e. </i>g., 25 CFR \xc2\xa7 900.3(b)(4) (1998). Here, the Tribes on whose reservations Blaze\'s work was performed have not exercised this option, and the Federal Government has retained contracting responsibility.
