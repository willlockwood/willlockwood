To help ensure certainty and fairness in those sentences, federal district courts are required to consider the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines.  Prior to sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepares a presentence investigation report to help the court determine the applicable Guidelines range.  Ultimately, the district court is responsible for ensuring the Guidelines range it considers is correct.  At times, however, an error in the calculation of the Guidelines range goes unnoticed by the court and the parties.  On appeal, such errors not raised in the district court may be remedied under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), provided that, as established in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Olano</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 725: (1) the error was not \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally relinquished or abandoned,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) the error is plain, and (3) the error \xe2\x80\x9caffected the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Molina-Martinez</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  If those conditions are met, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court of appeals should exercise its discretion to correct the forfeited error if the error \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at ___.

In calculating the Guidelines range, the Probation Office\xe2\x80\x99s presentence report mistakenly counted a state misdemeanor conviction twice.  As a result, the report yielded a Guidelines range of 77 to 96 months, when the correctly calculated range would have been 70 to 87 months.  Rosales-Mireles did not object to the error in the District Court, which relied on the miscalculated Guidelines range and sentenced him to 78 months of imprisonment.  On appeal, Rosales-Mireles challenged the incorrect Guidelines range for the first time.  The Fifth Circuit found that the Guidelines error was plain and that it affected Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 substantial rights because there was a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability that he would have been subject to a different sentence but for the error.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Fifth Circuit nevertheless declined to remand the case for resentencing, concluding that Rosales-Mireles had not established that the error would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings because neither the error nor the resulting sentence \xe2\x80\x9cwould shock the conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A miscalculation of a Guidelines sentencing range that has been determined to be plain and to affect a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights calls for a court of appeals to exercise its discretion under Rule 52(b) to vacate the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence in the ordinary case.

Like the narrow rule rejected in <i>Olano, </i>which would have called for relief only for a miscarriage of justice, the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s shock-the-conscience standard too narrowly confines the extent of the court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 discretion.  It is not reflected in Rule 52(b), nor in how the plain-error doctrine has been applied by this Court, which has reversed judgments for plain error based on inadvertent or unintentional errors by the court or the parties below and has remanded cases involving such errors, including sentencing errors, for consideration of <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s fourth prong.  The errors are not required to amount to a \xe2\x80\x9cpowerful indictment\xe2\x80\x9d of the system.  The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the district judge\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompetence or integrity\xe2\x80\x9d also unnecessarily narrows <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s instruction to correct an error if it seriously affects \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The effect of the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s heightened standard is especially pronounced in cases like this one.  An error resulting in a higher range than the Guidelines provide usually establishes a reasonable probability that a defendant will serve a prison sentence greater than \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to fulfill the purposes of incarceration,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a).  See <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___. <i> </i>That risk of unnecessary deprivation of liberty particularly undermines the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings in the context of a plain Guidelines error because Guidelines miscalculations ultimately result from judicial error, as the district court is charged in the first instance with ensuring the Guidelines range it considers is correct.  Moreover, remands for resentencing are relatively inexpensive proceedings compared to remands for retrial.  Ensuring the accuracy of Guidelines determinations also furthers the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s goal of achieving uniformity and proportionality in sentencing more broadly, since including uncorrected sentences based on incorrect Guidelines ranges in the data the Commission collects could undermine the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make appropriate revisions to the Guidelines.  Because any exercise of discretion at the fourth prong of <i>Olano</i> inherently requires \xe2\x80\x9ca case-specific and fact-intensive\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry, <i>Puckett</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129, 142, countervailing factors may satisfy the court of appeals that the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the proceedings will be preserved absent correction.  But there are no such factors in this case.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The Government and dissent maintain that even though the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s standard was inaccurate, Rosales-Mireles is still not entitled to relief.  But their arguments are unpersuasive.  They caution that granting this type of relief would be inconsistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements that discretion under Rule 52(b) should be exercised \xe2\x80\x9csparingly,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 373, 389, and reserved for \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Kenmore Granville Hotel Co.</i>,\n\n297 U.\xc2\xa0S. 160.  In contrast to the <i>Jones </i>remand, however, no additional jury proceedings would be required in a remand for resentencing based on a Guidelines miscalculation.  Plus, the circumstances of Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 case are exceptional under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, as they are reasonably likely to have resulted in a longer prison sentence than necessary and there are no countervailing factors that otherwise further the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  The Government and dissent also assert that Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 sentence is presumptively reasonable because it falls within the corrected Guidelines range.  But a court of appeals can consider a sentence\xe2\x80\x99s substantive reasonableness only after it ensures \xe2\x80\x9cthat the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gall</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 38, 51.  If a district court cannot properly determine whether, considering all sentencing factors, including the correct Guidelines range, a sentence is \xe2\x80\x9csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a), the resulting sentence would not bear the reliability that would support a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption of reasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d on review.  See 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51.  And regardless of its ultimate reasonableness, a sentence that lacks reliability because of unjust procedures may well undermine public perception of the proceedings.  Finally, the Government and dissent maintain that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision will create an opportunity for \xe2\x80\x9csandbagging\xe2\x80\x9d that Rule 52(b) is supposed to prevent.  But that concern fails to account for the realities at play in sentencing proceedings, where it is highly speculative that a defendant would benefit from a strategy of deliberately forgoing an objection in the district court, with hopes of arguing for reversal under plain-error review later.

This can be a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex\xe2\x80\x9d undertaking.  <i>Molina-Martinez</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4).  The United States Probation Office, operating as an arm of the district court, first creates a presentence investigation report, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich includes a calculation of the advisory Guidelines range it considers to be applicable<i>.\xe2\x80\x9d</i> <i> Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 3); see Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 32(c)(1)(A), (d)(1); United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa71B1.1(a) (Nov. 2016) (USSG).  That calculation derives from an assessment of the \xe2\x80\x9coffense characteristics, offender characteristics, and other matters that might be relevant to the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rita </i>v.<i> United States</i>,551 U. S. 338, 342 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Specifically, an offense level is calculated by identifying a base level for the offense of conviction and adjusting that level to account for circumstances specific to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s case, such as how the crime was committed and whether the defendant accepted responsibility.  See USSG \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71B1.1(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(5).  A numerical value is then attributed to any prior offenses committed by the defendant, which are added together to generate a criminal history score that places the defendant within a particular criminal history category.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71B1.1(a)(6), 4A1.1.  Together, the offense level and the criminal history category identify the applicable Guidelines range.  \xc2\xa71B1.1(a)(7).</p><p>B</p><p>The district court has the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the Guidelines range it considers is correct, and the \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ailure to calculate the correct Guidelines range constitutes procedural error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Peugh</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 537.  Given the complexity of the calculation, however, district courts sometimes make mistakes.  It is unsurprising, then, that \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be instances when a district court\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing of a defendant within the framework of an incorrect Guidelines range goes unnoticed\xe2\x80\x9d by the parties as well, which may result in a defendant raising the error for the first time on appeal.  <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Those defendants are not entirely without recourse.</p><p>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the [district] court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Olano</i>,507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 725 (1993), the Court established three conditions that must be met before a court may consider exercising its discretion to correct the error.  \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, there must be an error that has not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned.  Second, the error must be plain\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, clear or obvious.  Third, the error must have affected the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (citations omitted).  To satisfy this third condition, the defendant ordinarily must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98show a reasonable probability that, but for the error,\xe2\x80\x99 the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Dominguez Benitez</i>,542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 74, 76, 82 (2004)).  Once those three conditions have been met, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court of appeals should exercise its discretion to correct the forfeited error if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is this last consideration, often called <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s fourth prong, that we are asked to clarify and apply in this case.</p><p>C</p><p>Petitioner Florencio Rosales-Mireles pleaded guilty to illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71326(a), (b)(2).  The Probation Office in its presentence investigation report mistakenly counted a 2009 state conviction of misdemeanor assault twice.  This double counting resulted in a criminal history score of 13, which placed Rosales-Mireles in criminal history category VI.  Combined with his offense level of 21, that yielded a Guidelines range of 77 to 96 months.  Had the criminal history score been calculated correctly, Rosales-Mireles would have been in criminal history category V, and the resulting Guidelines range would have been 70 to 87 months.  See USSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table).</p><p>Rosales-Mireles did not object to the double-counting error before the District Court.  Relying on the erroneous presentence investigation report, and after denying Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 request for a downward departure, the District Court sentenced Rosales-Mireles to 78 months of imprisonment, one month above the lower end of the Guidelines range that everyone thought applied.</p><p>On appeal, Rosales-Mireles argued for the first time that his criminal history score and the resulting Guidelines range were incorrect because of the double counting of his 2009 conviction.  Because he had not objected in the District Court, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reviewed for plain error.  850 F.\xc2\xa03d 246, 248 (2017).</p><p>Applying the <i>Olano</i> framework, the Fifth Circuit concluded that Rosales-Mireles had established that the Guidelines miscalculation constituted an error that was plain, satisfying <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s first two conditions.  It also held that the error affected Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 substantial rights, thus satisfying the third condition, because there was \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that he would have been subject to a different sentence but for the error.\xe2\x80\x9d  850 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 249.  In reaching that conclusion, the Fifth Circuit rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Rosales-Mireles would have received the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines error, because the District Court had denied a downward departure \xe2\x80\x9cbased, in part, on Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 criminal history,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cerroneously included an extra conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The Fifth Circuit nevertheless declined to exercise its discretion to vacate and remand the case for resentencing because it concluded that Rosales-Mireles failed to establish that the error would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  In its view, \xe2\x80\x9cthe types of errors that warrant reversal are ones that would shock the conscience of the common man, serve as a powerful indictment against our system of justice, or seriously call into question the competence or integrity of the district judge.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Id.</i>, at 250 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Because Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 sentence of 78 months fell within the correct range of 70 to 87 months, the Fifth Circuit held that neither the error nor the resulting sentence \xe2\x80\x9cwould shock the conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s articulation of <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s fourth prong<i> </i>is out of step with the practice of other Circuits.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  We granted certiorari to resolve that conflict, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017), and now reverse.</p><p>II</p><p>A</p><p>Although \xe2\x80\x9cRule 52(b) is permissive, not mandatory,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Olano</i>, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 735, it is well established that courts \xe2\x80\x9cshould\xe2\x80\x9d correct a forfeited plain error that affects substantial rights \xe2\x80\x9cif the error \xe2\x80\x98seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 736 (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Atkinson</i>,297 U.\xc2\xa0S. 157, 160 (1936); alteration omitted); see also <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935).

See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Silber</i> v. <i>United States</i>,370 U.\xc2\xa0S. 717, 717\xe2\x80\x93718 (1962) (<i>per curiam</i>) (reversing judgment for plain error as a result of insufficient indictment); <i>Brasfield</i> v. <i>United States</i>,272 U.\xc2\xa0S. 448, 449\xe2\x80\x93450 (1926) (reversing judgment for plain error where the trial judge improperly inquired of a jury\xe2\x80\x99s numerical division); <i>Clyatt</i> v. <i>United States</i>,197 U.\xc2\xa0S. 207, 222 (1905) (reversing judgment for plain error where the Government presented insufficient evidence to sustain conviction).  The Court also \xe2\x80\x9croutinely remands\xe2\x80\x9d cases involving inadvertent or unintentional errors, including sentencing errors, for consideration of <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s fourth prong with the understanding that such errors may qualify for relief.  <i>Hicks </i>v.<i> United States</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).</p><p>The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s additional focus on errors that \xe2\x80\x9cserve as a powerful indictment against our system of justice, or seriously call into question the competence or integrity of the district judge,\xe2\x80\x9d 850 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 250 (internal quotation marks omitted), similarly alters the Rule 52(b) standard.  The Court has never said that errors must amount to a \xe2\x80\x9cpowerful indictment\xe2\x80\x9d of the system, a phrase which implies by its terms that the only errors worthy of correction are those that rise to the level of grossly serious misconduct.  Similarly, the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the \xe2\x80\x9ccompetence or integrity of the district judge\xe2\x80\x9d narrows <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s instruction that an error should be corrected if it seriously affects \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  In articulating such a high standard, the Fifth Circuit substantially changed <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s fourth prong.</p><p>B</p><p>The effect of the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s heightened standard is especially pronounced in a case like this one.  A plain Guidelines error that affects a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights is precisely the type of error that ordinarily warrants relief under Rule 52(b).</p><p>In <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, the Court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a defendant is sentenced under an incorrect Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x94whether or not the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate sentence falls within the correct range\xe2\x80\x94the error itself can, and most often will, be sufficient to show a reasonable probability of a different outcome absent the error.\xe2\x80\x9d  578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  In other words, an error resulting in a higher range than the Guidelines provide usually establishes a reasonable probability that a defendant will serve a prison sentence that is more than \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to fulfill the purposes of incarceration.18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a); <i>Tapia</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 325.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo a prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d this prospect of additional \xe2\x80\x9ctime behind bars is not some theoretical or mathematical concept.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barber</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>,560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 474, 504 (2010) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny amount of actual jail time\xe2\x80\x9d is significant, <i>Glover</i> v. <i>United States</i>,531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 198, 203 (2001), and \xe2\x80\x9cha[s] exceptionally severe consequences for the incarcerated individual [and] for society which bears the direct and indirect costs of incarceration,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v. <i>Jenkins</i>, 854 F.\xc2\xa03d 181, 192 (CA2 2017).  The possibility of additional jail time thus warrants serious consideration in a determination whether to exercise discretion under Rule 52(b).  It is crucial in maintaining public perception of fairness and integrity in the justice system that courts exhibit regard for fundamental rights and respect for prisoners \xe2\x80\x9cas people.\xe2\x80\x9d  T. Tyler, Why People Obey the Law 164 (2006).</p><p>The risk of unnecessary deprivation of liberty par- ticularly undermines the fairness, integrity, or public rep- utation of judicial proceedings in the context of a plain Guidelines error because of the role the district court plays in calculating the range and the relative ease of correcting the error.  Unlike \xe2\x80\x9ccase[s] where trial strategies, in retrospect, might be criticized for leading to a harsher sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d Guidelines miscalculations ultimately result from judicial error.  <i>Glover</i>, 531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 204; see also <i>Peugh</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 537.  That was especially so here where the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s error in imposing Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 sentence was based on a mistake made in the presentence investigation report by the Probation Office, which works on behalf of the District Court.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9ca remand for resentencing, while not costless, does not invoke the same difficulties as a remand for retrial does.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cA resentencing is a brief event, normally taking less than a day and requiring the attendance of only the defendant, counsel, and court personnel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Williams</i>, 399 F.\xc2\xa03d 450, 456 (CA2 2005).</p><p>Ensuring the accuracy of Guidelines determinations also serves the purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cproviding certainty and fairness in sentencing\xe2\x80\x9d on a greater scale.28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(f); see also \xc2\xa7991(b)(1)(B); <i>Booker</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 264.  The Guidelines assist federal courts across the country in achieving uniformity and proportionality in sentencing.  See <i>Rita</i>, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 349.  To realize those goals, it is important that sentencing proceedings actually reflect the nature of the offense and criminal history of the defendant, because the United States Sentencing Commission relies on data developed during sentencing proceedings, including information in the presentence investigation report, to determine whether revisions to the Guidelines are necessary.  See <i>id.,</i> at 350.  When sentences based on incorrect Guidelines ranges go uncorrected, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make appropriate amendments is undermined.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>In broad strokes, the public legitimacy of our justice system relies on procedures that are \xe2\x80\x9cneutral, accurate, consistent, trustworthy, and fair,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cprovide opportunities for error correction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bowers &amp; Robinson, Perceptions of Fairness and Justice: The Shared Aims and Occasional Conflicts of Legitimacy and Moral Credibility, 47 Wake Forest L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 211, 215\xe2\x80\x93216 (2012).  In considering claims like Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99, then, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat reasonable citizen wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear a rightly diminished view of the judicial process and its integrity if courts refused to correct obvious errors of their own devise that threaten to require individuals to linger longer in federal prison than the law demands?\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v.<i> Sabillon-Umana</i>, 772 F.\xc2\xa03d 1328, 1333\xe2\x80\x931334 (CA10 2014) (Gorsuch, J.).  In the context of a plain Guidelines error that affects substantial rights, that diminished view of the proceedings ordinarily will satisfy <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s fourth prong, as it does in this case.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  As the Fifth Circuit itself concluded, there is a reasonable probability that, without correction of the Guidelines error, Rosales-Mireles will spend more time in prison than the District Court otherwise would have considered necessary.  850 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 249.  That error was based on a mistake by the Probation Office, a mistake that can be remedied through a relatively inexpensive resentencing proceeding.</p><p>Of course, any exercise of discretion at the fourth prong of <i>Olano</i> inherently requires \xe2\x80\x9ca case-specific and fact-intensive\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  <i>Puckett</i> v. <i>United States</i>,556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129, 142 (2009); see also <i>Young</i>, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, n.\xc2\xa014.  There may be instances where countervailing factors satisfy the court of appeals that the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the proceedings will be preserved absent correction.  But on the facts of this case, there are no such factors.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p><p>III</p><p>The United States and the dissent agree with Rosales-Mireles that the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s formulation of the standard for the exercise of discretion under Rule 52(b) \xe2\x80\x9cis an inaccurate description\xe2\x80\x9d of <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s fourth prong.  Brief for United States 34; <i>post, </i>at 1, n.\xc2\xa01 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s standard is higher than the one articulated in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents\xe2\x80\x9d).  They nevertheless maintain that Rosales-Mireles is not entitled to relief. We are unpersuaded, though a few points merit brief discussion.</p><p>First, the United States and the dissent caution that a grant of relief in Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 case and in others like his would be inconsistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements that discretion under Rule 52(b) should be exercised \xe2\x80\x9csparingly,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States</i>,527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 373, 389 (1999), and reserved for \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Atkinson</i>, 297 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 160.  As an initial matter, <i>Jones </i>and the cases it relies on for the point that discretion should be exercised \xe2\x80\x9csparingly\xe2\x80\x9d would have required additional jury proceedings on remand, either at resentencing or retrial.  See 527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 384, 389; see also <i>Young</i>,470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Frady</i>,456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 152 (1982); <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Kibbe</i>,431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 145 (1977).  As we have explained, a decision remanding a case to the district court for resentencing on the basis of a Guidelines miscalculation is far less burdensome than a retrial, or other jury proceedings, and thus does not demand such a high degree of caution.</p><p>In any event, the circumstances surrounding Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 case are exceptional within the meaning of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent on plain-error review, as they are reasonably likely to have resulted in a longer prison sentence than necessary and there are no countervailing factors that otherwise further the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  The fact that, as a result of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, most defendants in Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 situation will be eligible for relief under Rule 52(b) does not justify a decision that ignores the harmful effects of allowing the error to persist.</p><p>Second, the United States and the dissent assert that, because Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 sentence falls within the cor- rected Guidelines range, the sentence is presumptively rea- sonable and \xe2\x80\x9cless likely to indicate a serious injury to the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 20\xe2\x80\x9321; see also <i>post, </i>at 10.  A substantive reasonableness determination, however, is an entirely separate inquiry from whether an error warrants correction under plain-error review.</p><p>Before a court of appeals can consider the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gall</i>, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51.  This makes eminent sense, for the district court is charged in the first instance with determining whether, taking all sentencing factors into consideration, including the correct Guidelines range, a sentence is \xe2\x80\x9csufficient, but not greater than necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a).  If the district court is unable properly to undertake that inquiry because of an error in the Guidelines range, the resulting sentence no longer bears the reliability that would support a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption of reasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d on review.  See <i>Gall</i>, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51. Likewise, regardless of its ultimate reason- ableness, a sentence that lacks reliability because of unjust procedures may well undermine public perception of the proceedings.  See Hollander-Blumoff, The Psychology of Procedural Justice in the Federal Courts, 63 Hastings L.\xc2\xa0J. 127, 132\xe2\x80\x93134 (2011) (compilation of psychology research showing that the fairness of procedures influences perceptions of outcomes).  The mere fact that Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 sentence falls within the corrected Guidelines range does not preserve the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>Third, the United States and the dissent contend that our decision \xe2\x80\x9ccreates the very opportunity for \xe2\x80\x98sandbagging\xe2\x80\x99 that Rule 52(b) is supposed to prevent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post,</i> at 5; Brief for United States 17\xe2\x80\x9318, 27.  But that concern fails to account for the realities at play in sentencing proceedings.  As this Court repeatedly has explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Guidelines are \xe2\x80\x98the starting point for every sentencing calculation in the federal system,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Hughes</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9) (quoting <i>Peugh</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 542).  It is hard to imagine that defense counsel would \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately forgo objection <i>now</i>\xe2\x80\x9d to a plain Guidelines error that would subject her client to a higher Guidelines range, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause [counsel] perceives some slightly expanded chance to argue for \xe2\x80\x98plain error\xe2\x80\x99 <i>later</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>United States</i>,568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 266, 276 (2013) (emphasis in original).  Even setting aside the conflict such a strat- egy would create with defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ethical obligations to represent her client vigorously and her duty of candor toward the court, any benefit from such a strategy is highly speculative.  There is no guarantee that a court of appeals would agree to a remand, and no basis to believe that a district court would impose a lower sentence upon resentencing than the court would have imposed at the original sentencing proceedings had it been aware of the plain Guidelines error.</p><p>IV</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Fifth Circuit abused its discretion in applying an unduly burdensome articulation of <i>Olano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s fourth prong and declining to remand Rosales-Mireles\xe2\x80\x99 case for resentencing.  In the ordinary case, as here, the failure to correct a plain Guidelines error that affects a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights will seriously affect the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Compare 850 F.\xc2\xa03d 246, 250 (CA5 2017), with <i>United States </i>v.<i> Dahl</i>, 833 F.\xc2\xa03d 345, 357, 359 (CA3 2016); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Figueroa-Ocasio</i>, 805 F.\xc2\xa03d 360, 367\xe2\x80\x93368, 373\xe2\x80\x93374 (CA1 2015); <i>United States </i>v.<i> Sabillon-Umana</i>, 772  F.\xc2\xa03d 1328, 1333\xe2\x80\x931334 (CA10 2014) (Gorsuch, J.); <i>United States </i>v.<i> Joseph</i>, 716 F.\xc2\xa03d 1273, 1281 (CA9 2013); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Garrett</i>, 528 F.\xc2\xa03d 525, 527, 529\xe2\x80\x93530 (CA7 2008). </span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2">2</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Similarly, the work of the Federal Bureau of Prisons is hindered by uncorrected Guidelines errors, because the Bureau relies, in part, on aspects of the Guidelines calculation in designating and classifying prisoners based on security and program needs.

And, based on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of it today, this presumption certainly must be difficult to rebut.  The Court matter-of-factly asserts, in a single sentence with no analysis, that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are no [countervailing] factors\xe2\x80\x9d in this case that counsel in favor of affirmance.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  It does so without even discussing the particular details of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime, what happened at his sentencing, the reasoning that the District Court employed, the difference between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s calculated Guidelines range and the correct one, or where his sentence fell relative to the correct Guidelines range.  This approach is neither \xe2\x80\x9ccase-specific\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cfact-intensive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Puckett</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 142.  The Court candidly admits as much.

The Court expressly states that Guidelines errors will satisfy the fourth prong in \xe2\x80\x9cthe ordinary case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 15.  But this Court has repeatedly held that the fourth prong limits courts\xe2\x80\x99 discretion to \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect[ing] only \xe2\x80\x98particularly egregious errors.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Young</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 15.  Because Rule 52(b) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is not a run-of-the-mill remedy,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Frady</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 163, n.\xc2\xa014, relief should be granted \xe2\x80\x9csparingly\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the rare case,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Jones </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 373, 389 (1999), and only in \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Atkinson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 160.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision turns that principle on its head by making relief available \xe2\x80\x9cin the ordinary case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 1.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court asserts that relief under plain-error review need not be exceptional or rare when a remand would not require \xe2\x80\x9cadditional jury proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 12.  But that distinction has no basis in the text of Rule 52(b) or this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  The only Rule 52(b) precedent that the Court cites for this assertion is <i>Molina-Martinez </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 15).  See <i>ante,</i> at 9.  That decision rejected the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s categorical rule requiring defendants to present \xe2\x80\x9cadditional evidence\xe2\x80\x9d (beyond the Guidelines error itself) to prove prejudice under the third prong of plain-error review.  See 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).  In dicta it suggested that, \xe2\x80\x9cin the ordinary case,\xe2\x80\x9d the Guidelines error would be enough to satisfy the third prong\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the error affect substantial rights.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 15).  And it rebuffed the Government\xe2\x80\x99s pragmatic \xe2\x80\x9cconcern over the judicial resources needed\xe2\x80\x9d if Guidelines errors usually satisfy the third prong of plain-error review.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 14).  But <i>Molina-Martinez</i> did not discuss the fourth prong of plain-error review, which is at issue here and is an independent requirement, see <i>Olano</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 737.  Nor did it relax the plain-error standard whenever reversal would not require \xe2\x80\x9cadditional jury proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 12.  Thus, <i>Molina-Martinez</i> gives no support to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s innovation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Additionally, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement of remands based on ordinary Guidelines errors undermines \xe2\x80\x9cthe policies that underpin Rule 52(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Dominguez Benitez</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 82.  As explained, the plain-error standard encourages defendants to make timely objections in order to avoid sandbagging and to prevent wasteful reversals and remands.  After today, however, most defendants who fail to object to a Guidelines error will be in virtually the same position as those who do.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, especially when combined with <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, means that plain Guidelines errors will satisfy Rule 52(b) in all but the unusual case.  That creates the very opportunity for \xe2\x80\x9csandbagging\xe2\x80\x9d that Rule 52(b) is supposed to prevent, <i>Puckett</i>, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 134 (internal quotation marks omitted), by allowing a defendant who is aware of a mistake in the presentence report to \xe2\x80\x9csimply relax and wait to see if the sentence later str[ikes] him as satisfactory,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Vonn</i>, 535 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 73.  Oddly, defendants who do not object to a Guidelines error could be in a better position than ones who do.  An objection would give the district court a chance to explain why it would \xe2\x80\x9carrive at the same sentencing conclusion\xe2\x80\x9d even if the defendant was correct about an alleged Guidelines error, which would \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] clear\xe2\x80\x9d that the Guidelines error did not \xe2\x80\x9cadversely affect the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Sabillon-Umana</i>, 772 F.\xc2\xa03d 1328, 1334 (CA10 2014).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision thus inverts Rule 52(b) by giving defendants an incentive to withhold timely objections and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98game\xe2\x80\x99 the system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Puckett</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 140.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if it were appropriate to create rebuttable presumptions under the fourth prong of plain-error review, the Court is wrong to conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d Guidelines error will \xe2\x80\x9cseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 1.  Whether a district court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to correctly calculate the advisory Guidelines range satisfies the fourth prong of plain-error review will depend on the circumstances of each case.  And the circumstances of this case prove the folly of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s presumption.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court asserts that plain Guidelines errors must ordinarily be corrected to ensure that defendants do not \xe2\x80\x9clinger longer in federal prison than the law demands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the Guidelines are not \xe2\x80\x9claw.\xe2\x80\x9d  They neither \xe2\x80\x9cdefine criminal offenses\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cfix the permissible sentences for criminal offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Beckles </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 5) (emphasis deleted).

They provide advice about what sentencing range the Sentencing Commission believes is appropriate, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they \xe2\x80\x98do not constrain\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d district courts.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Accordingly, district courts are free to disagree with the Guidelines range, for reasons as simple as a policy disagreement with the Sentencing Commission.  See <i>Pepper </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476, 501 (2011);\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73661.

Although the Guidelines range is one of the factors that courts must consider at sentencing,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a), judges need not give the Guidelines range any particular weight.  The only thing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe law demands\xe2\x80\x9d is that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence be substantively reasonable and within the applicable statutory range.  See <i>Jones </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932); <i>Kimbrough</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 85, 113\xe2\x80\x93114 (2007) (Scalia, J.,  concurring).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court also justifies its presumption by repeatedly stressing the importance of procedural rules to the public\xe2\x80\x99s perception of judicial proceedings.  See <i>ante,</i> at 10 (<i>\xe2\x80\x9c</i>[T]he public legitimacy of our justice system relies on procedures\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ante,</i> at 13 (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]njust procedures may well undermine public perception of [sentencing] proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).  It even cites a hodgepodge of psychological studies on procedural justice.  <i>Ante</i>, at 13 (citing Hollander-Blumoff, The Psychology of Procedural Justice in the Federal Courts, 63 Hastings L.\xc2\xa0J. 127, 132\xe2\x80\x93134 (2011) (Hollander-Blumoff)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Putting aside the obvious problems with this research,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] the Court contradicts our precedents by suggesting that adhering to procedure has prime importance for purposes of the fourth prong.  This Court has repeatedly concluded that purely procedural errors\xe2\x80\x94ones that likely did not affect the substantive outcome\xe2\x80\x94do not satisfy the fourth prong of plain-error review.  In <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461 (1997), for example, the District Court failed to submit a materiality element to the jury, but this Court found that the fourth prong of plain-error review was not   </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">satisfied because \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidence supporting materiality was \xe2\x80\x98overwhelming.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 470.  Reversal based on errors that have no actual \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98effect on the judgment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d this Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970)).  Similarly, in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cotton</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624 (2002), the indictment failed to allege a fact that increased the statutory maximum, but the evidence of that fact \xe2\x80\x9cwas \xe2\x80\x98overwhelming\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98essentially uncontroverted.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 633.  This Court held that reversing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence based on such a technicality would be \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he real threat .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the \xe2\x80\x98fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 634.  And in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Marcus</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258 (2010), the Second Circuit had held that an <i>ex post facto</i> error automatically satisfies the plain-error standard, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98no matter how unlikely\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d it was that the jury actually convicted the defendant based on conduct that predated the statute of conviction.  <i>Id.,</i> at 261 (emphasis deleted).  In reversing that decision, this Court emphasized that, \xe2\x80\x9cin most circumstances, an error that does not affect the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict does not significantly impugn the \xe2\x80\x98fairness,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98integrity,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98public reputation\xe2\x80\x99 of the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 265\xe2\x80\x93266.  Thus, the Court is mistaken when it asserts that, because Guidelines errors are procedural mistakes, they are particularly likely to implicate the fourth prong of plain error.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">While the Court holds that the ordinary Guidelines error will satisfy the fourth prong of plain-error review, it admits that there can be \xe2\x80\x9cinstances where countervailing factors\xe2\x80\x9d preclude defendants from satisfying the fourth prong.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  Because the Court does not question our existing plain-error precedents, see <i>ante, </i>at 12, the burden presumably remains on defendants to establish that there are no such countervailing factors, and to persuade the appellate court that any countervailing factor identified by the Government is insufficient.  See <i>Vonn</i>, 535 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 63 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] defendant has the further burden to persuade the court that the error seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Dominguez Benitez</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 82 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he burden of establishing entitlement to relief for plain error is on the defendant claiming it\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the Court does not explain what the defendant in this case has done to satisfy his burden.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If this case is an ordinary one, it highlights the folly of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new rebuttable presumption.  Petitioner Florencio Rosales-Mireles has a penchant for entering this country illegally and committing violent crimes\xe2\x80\x94especially against women.  A Mexican citizen, Rosales-Mireles entered the United States illegally in 1997.  In 2002, he was convicted of assault for throwing his girlfriend to the floor of their apartment and dragging her outside by her hair.  In 2009, he was convicted of aggravated assault with serious bodily injury and assault causing bodily injury to a family member.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  His convictions stemmed from an altercation in which he attempted to stab one man and did stab another\xe2\x80\x94once in the shoulder and twice in the chest.  In January 2010, Rosales-Morales was removed to Mexico.  But that same month he reentered the United States illegally.  In 2015, he was convicted in Texas state court of assaulting his wife and 14-year-old son.  During the altercation, Rosales-Mireles grabbed his wife by the hair and punched her in the face repeatedly.</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"> </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Most recently, Rosales-Mireles pleaded guilty to illegal reentry.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71326(a), (b)(2).  The District Court sentenced him to 78 months in prison, which was within the Guidelines range he argued for on appeal.  See <i>ante, </i>at 4.  In choosing that sentence, the District Court emphasized that it was \xe2\x80\x9cthe second time he\xe2\x80\x99s come to the courts for being here illegally\xe2\x80\x9d; that he had \xe2\x80\x9cattempted to hide in the United States with multiple aliases, birth dates, [and] Social Security numbers\xe2\x80\x9d; and that his \xe2\x80\x9cassaultive behavior\xe2\x80\x9d spanned from \xe2\x80\x9cat least .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. 2001 to 2015.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 20.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The sentence that Rosales-Mireles received was not only within both the improperly and properly calculated Guidelines ranges but also in the bottom half of both possible ranges.  See <i>ante,</i> at 4.  If the District Court had used the proper Guidelines range at his initial sentencing, then the sentence that it ultimately gave Rosales-Mireles would have been presumptively reasonable on appeal.  See 850 F.\xc2\xa03d 246, 250 (CA5 2017); <i>Rita </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 338, 347 (2007).  And the Fifth Circuit determined that his sentence was in fact reasonable.  See<i> </i>850 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 250\xe2\x80\x93251.  Leaving that reasonable sentence in place would not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Young</i>, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 15.
