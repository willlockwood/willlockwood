But if my said half-brother shall not, within the time aforesaid, become a citizen as aforesaid, I then direct that my said trustees, or the survivor or survivors of them, shall sell and dispose of the said land hereby directed to be conveyed to him on two years\' credit, with interest from the date to be paid annually, and the money and interest arising from such sale to be transmitted to my said half-brother, to whom I give and bequeath the same.  But should my said half-brother become a citizen of the United States or be otherwise qualified to hold real estate within the same before his death, it is then my will and desire that he shall have the sole and absolute disposal of all the estate hereinbefore devised or bequeathed to him, notwithstanding he may not have obtained deeds therefor from my said trustees."</p>\n<p>The testator died in October, 1799.</p>\n<p>Allen Campbell a native of Ireland, came to the State of Kentucky in December, 1799, and continued to reside therein until September, 1804, when he died.</p>\n<p>On 18 December, 1800, the Legislature of Kentucky passed a law reciting that by the laws then in force, aliens could not hold lands therein, and it is considered the interest of the state that such prohibition should be done away.  It then provides that any alien, other than alien enemies, who <em>shall have actually resided</em> within the commonwealth two years shall, during the continuance of his residence therein after that period, be enabled to hold, receive, and pass any right, title, or interest to any lands or other estate in the same manner and under the same regulations as the citizens of the state.  It was held that the full effect and benefit of this act and the clear intention of the legislature requires a construction which gives to it a <em>prospective,</em> as well as <em>retrospective,</em> application, and under this construction, Allen Campbell became qualified to, take and hold the title to the land in question as if he had been a citizen of the state.  The devise to Allen Campbell was a good executory devisee, depending on the contingency of his becoming a citizen of the United States or being otherwise qualified to hold real estate.  This contingency was not too remote.  It must necessarily not only from the nature of the contingency, but by express limitation in the devise, happen in the lifetime of the devisee, if ever, and upon the happening of this contingency, there can be no doubt but the devisee took an estate in fee. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 34 U.

Upon the erection of a part of Virginia into a separate state, these premises become a part of the State of Kentucky.</p>\n<p>At the time of the making of his last will and testament, 25 July, 1786, John Campbell who was never married, had a brother of the whole blood, Robert Campbell, also a citizen of the State of Virginia, a father, a half-brother, named Allen Campbell, and a sister of the whole blood named Sarah Beard, who was a widow and had children.  His father, half-brother, and sister were natives of Ireland and subjects of the King of Great Britain and Ireland in 1786.  The father of John Campbell died before him.  By his will, which was duly proved and recorded on 13 January, 1800, John Campbell devised his estate, both real and personal, to James Milligan, William Elliot, and Phillip Ross, and the survivor and survivors of them, in trust for the uses and purposes stated in the will.</p>\n<p>The provisions of the will of John Campbell out of which the controversy between the parties to this case arose were the following:</p>\n<p>"I do further direct that after the decease of my said father, all the profits of my lands within five miles of the mouth of Bear Grass shall be annually paid to the guardian of my said half-brother, Allen Campbell during his minority, to be applied to his education and maintenance, if so much be required therefor; if not, then the overplus to be laid out on interest by my said trustees till my said half-brother shall arrive at the age of twenty-one years or marry; but upon either of the said contingencies\' happening, the aforesaid profits shall then and thenceforth be paid to my said half-brother, for and during the term of five _____, and if within that time my said half-brother shall become a citizen of the United States or be otherwise qualified by law to take and hold real estate within the same, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 34 U.

It is my further will and desire that in case my said half-brother shall die before the expiration of the aforesaid term of five years after his arrival at the age of twenty-one years, the land intended by the next preceding clause to be devised to him shall be sold by my said trustees on two years\' credit, and the money arising from such sale, when received, shall be transmitted to the guardians of the children which my said half-brother may leave, to be by the said guardians lent out on interest, and an equal division shall be made thereof amongst them; but should my said half-brother become a citizen of the United States of America or be otherwise qualified to hold real estate within the same before his death, it is then my will and desire that he shall have the sole and absolute disposal of all the estate hereinbefore devised and bequeathed to him, notwithstanding he may not have obtained deeds therefor from my said trustees.

That the premises in question passed in fee to Allen Campbell the half-brother of John Campbell under his will, and at the death of said Allen passed, by descent, from him to Robert Campbell and Sarah Beard, and then from him to her, provided the jury believed from the evidence 1st, that said John Campbell was a citizen of the United States, and died in October 1789, and had never been married; 2d, that said Allen Campbell came to the State of Kentucky in December, 1799, and continued to reside therein until September, 1804, and then died intestate, and had never been married; 3d, that said Robert Campbell was a citizen of the United States and half-brother of the said Allen; that said Sarah Beard was half-sister of said Allen and came to Kentucky in October, 1800, and continued to reside therein until the death of said Allen; that said Robert Campbell died in August, 1805, intestate, and had never been married, and that said Sarah Beard was the sister of the said Robert Campbell.</p>\n<p>The jury found the following verdict, on which the court gave a judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p>"We, the jury, find that the tenant has more right to hold the tenement as he now holds it in the written count mentioned, than the demandants to have it as they now demand it."</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs took a bill of exceptions and sued out this writ of error. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="313">Page 34 U.

When the lands were surrendered to him and he was put into possession of the same, it was as the owner and proprietor thereof in fee, as devisee under the will of his half-brother, John Campbell.  He continued to occupy the same until his death, claiming it as his own and occasionally selling various parts thereof.  After the death of Robert Campbell, Sarah Beard, as the heir of Allen Campbell as to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 34 U. S. 311</a></p><p> one moiety and heir of Robert Campbell of another moiety, claimed the whole estate.</p>\n<p>On the trial in the circuit court, the demandants prayed the court to instruct the jury that unless they find from the evidence that the surviving trustees of Colonel Campbell\'s will conveyed by deed the land in contest to Allen Campbell that the law is for the demandants.</p>\n<p>That unless they find from the evidence that Allen Campbell was naturalized according to the laws of the United States, that the law is with the demandants.</p>\n<p>That from the facts agreed and the evidence offered, the law is for the demandants, and they ought to find accordingly.</p>\n<p>The court refused to give the instructions as prayed, and the defendant moved the following instructions to the jury, which were given.  That the premises in question passed in fee to Allen Campbell the half-brother of John Campbell under his will, and at the death of said Allen passed, by descent, from him to Robert Campbell and Sarah Beard, and then from him to her, provided the jury believed from the evidence 1st, that said John Campbell was a citizen of the United States, and died in October 1789, and had never been married; 2d, that said Allen Campbell came to the State of Kentucky in December, 1799, and continued to reside therein until September, 1804, and then died intestate, and had never been married; 3d, that said Robert Campbell was a citizen of the United States and half-brother of the said Allen; that said Sarah Beard was half-sister of said Allen and came to Kentucky in October, 1800, and continued to reside therein until the death of said Allen; that said Robert Campbell died in August, 1805, intestate, and had never been married, and that said Sarah Beard was the sister of the said Robert Campbell.</p>\n<p>The jury found the following verdict, on which the court gave a judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p>"We, the jury, find that the tenant has more right to hold the tenement as he now holds it in the written count mentioned, than the demandants to have it as they now demand it."</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs took a bill of exceptions and sued out this writ of error. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="313">Page 34 U. S. 313</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE THOMPSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It is a writ of right for the recovery of a piece or tract of land, the title to which is admitted to have been duly and legally vested in John Campbell.  Both parties claim under the will of John Campbell as the source of title.</p>\n<p>The demandants claim under a deed from Richard Taylor, the surviving executor of John Campbell bearing date 21 April, 1826, to Joseph Beard, Elizabeth Megowan, and the heirs of William Beard.  The tenant claims under a devise in the will of John Campbell, and the decision of the case depends mainly upon the construction to be given to this devise.</p>\n<p>The evidence in the cause being closed, each of the parties moved the court for instructions to the jury.  The demandants prayed the court to instruct the jury that unless they find from the evidence that the surviving trustee of Colonel Campbell\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="314">Page 34 U. S. 314</a></p><p> will conveyed by deed the land in contest to Allen Campbell the law is for the demandants.</p>\n<p>That unless they find from the evidence that Allen Campbell was naturalized according to the laws of the United States, that the law is with the demandants.</p>\n<p>That from the facts agreed, and the evidence offered, the law is for the demandants, and that they ought to find accordingly.</p>\n<p>These instructions the court refused to give, but, on the prayer of the tenant, gave the following instructions.</p>\n<p>That the premises in question passed in fee to Allen Campbell the half-brother of John Campbell under the will, and at the death of the said Allen passed by descent from him to Robert Campbell and Sarah Beard, and from him, Robert Campbell to her, Sarah Beard, provided the jury believed 1, that John Campbell was a citizen of the United States, and died in October 1799, and had never been married; 2, that the said Allen Campbell came to the State of Kentucky in December 1799, and continued to reside therein until September 1804, and then died intestate, and had never been married; 3, that the said Robert Campbell was a citizen of the United States and half-brother of the said Allen; that Sarah Beard was half-sister of the said Allen and came to Kentucky in October, 1800, and continued to reside therein until the death of the said Allen; that the said Robert Campbell died in August, 1805, intestate, and has never been married; and that the said Sarah Beard was the sister of the said Robert Campbell.</p>\n<p>The material facts in this case are not at all drawn in question.  They are agreed upon by a stipulation contained in the record.  And we must at all events assume for the purpose of the present decision that the jury has found all the facts hypothetically put by the court in the instruction given to them, and upon the assumption of which the court instructed the jury that in point of law the demandants were not entitled to recover, and whether this instruction was correct is the question now before the Court.</p>\n<p>Upon the argument here, several objections have been made to the right of the demandants to recover in this action, claiming, as they do, different titles which cannot, as is alleged, be set up under a joint action in this manner.  This, however, is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="315">Page 34 U. S. 315</a></p><p> rather matter of form, and as the case is before us on the merits and has been fully argued, we pass by this objection without stopping to inquire whether it was well founded or not.</p>\n<p>The clause in the will of John Campbell upon which the right to the land in question depends is as follows.</p>\n<p>"And if within that time my said half-brother, Allen Campbell, shall become a citizen of the United States or be otherwise qualified by law to take and hold real estate within the same, I then direct that my said trustees, or the survivor or survivors of them, shall convey to him, my said half-brother, Allen Campbell his heirs or assigns, in fee simple, all the lands hereinbefore described in this devise.  But if my said half-brother shall not, within the time aforesaid, become a citizen as aforesaid, I then direct that my said trustees, or the survivor or survivors of them, shall sell and dispose of the said lands hereby directed to be conveyed to him on two years\' credit, with interest from the date, to be paid annually.  And the money and interest arising from such sale to be transmitted to my said half-brother, to whom I give and bequeath the same."</p>\n<p>The testator then provides for the disposition of these lands and the proceeds thereof in case his said half-brother shall die before the expiration of the aforesaid term of five years after his arrival at the age of twenty-one years, and then adds the following clause:</p>\n<p>"But should my said half-brother become a citizen of the United States of America or be otherwise qualified to hold real estate within the same before his death, it is then my will and desire that he shall have the sole and absolute disposal of all the estate hereinbefore devised and bequeathed to him, notwithstanding he may not have obtained deeds therefor from my said trustees."</p>\n<p>It is contended on the part of the demandants that under this will, the legal estate of the land in question is vested in the executors and trustees, and that Allen Campbell did not take any legal estate under the will and could not acquire it except by deed from the trustees or the survivor of them.  And they contend that Richard Taylor was such survivor, and they claim under the deed from him of 21 April, 1826.  But if Richard Taylor had no authority to convey this land, the demandants fail entirely to show any title whatever in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="316">Page 34 U. S. 316</a></p><p> land.  His authority to convey the land lies at the foundation of the right set up by them.</p>\n<p>Richard Taylor is not named as one of the trustees.  The trustees named are James Milligan, Charles Simms, William Elliot, and Philip Ross, who are also appointed executors, and to whom the testator devises his estate, both real and personal, in trust for the uses and purposes provided and declared in his will.  It is true that he afterwards, in a codicil, names Richard Taylor as one of his executors.  But the estate was vested in the other executors named, as trustees, and Taylor, in his capacity merely as executor, acquired no title to the land or any authority to sell it.</p>\n<p>But it is unnecessary to rest the case upon this point, as it is very clear that under the will of John Campbell, his half-brother, Allen Campbell, took an estate in fee simple as an executory devise, without any deed from the trustees.</p>\n<p>The intention of the testator in this respect cannot be mistaken.  Allen Campbell was an alien, and was not or might not be qualified to take and hold real estate.  The title was accordingly vested in trustees, with directions to convey the same to him when he should become qualified by law to take and hold the same.  And if he should not within a specified time become qualified to take and hold real estate, the trustees are directed to sell the land and transmit the avails thereof to the said Allen Campbell, thus providing for all supposed contingencies with respect to the situation of the devisee and to enable him to receive the benefit of the devise.  But that his right and title to this estate might not at all depend upon the trustees, he devises the land directly to the said Allen Campbell if he should at any time before his death become a citizen of the United States or be otherwise qualified to hold real estate, notwithstanding he may not have obtained deeds therefor from his said trustees.</p>\n<p>This was a good executory devise depending on the contingency of his becoming a citizen of the United States or otherwise qualified to hold real estate.  This contingency was not too remote.  It must necessarily, not only from the nature of the contingency but by express limitation in the devise, happen in the lifetime of the devisee, if ever.  And upon the happening of this contingency there can be no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="317">Page 34 U. S. 317</a></p><p> doubt but the devisee took an estate in fee.  The words in the will are amply sufficient to pass an estate in fee.  And the only remaining inquiry is whether Allen Campbell, before his death, became qualified to take and hold real estate in the State of Kentucky.  And this will depend upon the act of the legislature of that state passed on 18 December, 1800, which is as follows:</p>\n<p>"Whereas, by the laws now in force in this commonwealth, aliens cannot hold lands therein, and whereas it is considered the true interest of this state that such prohibitions be done away, be it therefore enacted, &amp;c., that any alien, other than alien enemies, who shall have actually resided within this commonwealth two years shall, during the continuance of his residence herein after the said period, be enabled to hold, receive and pass any right, title, or interest to any lands or other estate known within this commonwealth in the same manner and under the same regulations as the citizens of this state may lawfully do."</p>\n<p>2 Littell\'s Laws 400.</p>\n<p>The evidence in the record shows, and it is so found by the jury, that Allen Campbell came to the State of Kentucky in December, 1799, and continued to reside therein until September, 1804, when he died intestate, never having been married.  It is argued on the part of the demandants that this law only embraces aliens who shall have resided within the state two years before the passing of the act, and does not, therefore, reach the case of Allen Campbell.</p>\n<p>This is certainly too narrow an interpretation of this law to meet the obvious intention of the legislature, even admitting that such is the strict grammatical construction.</p>\n<p>The preamble in the act may be resorted to to aid in the construction of the enacting clause when any ambiguity exists.  That preamble evidently shows that the intention of the legislature was to make a general provision for removing the disability of aliens to hold real estate, and this founded upon state policy doubtless for the purpose of encouraging the settlement of the country, and this object would be in a great measure defeated by restricting the act to aliens who shall have resided two years in the state before the passing of the act.  The condition upon which aliens are placed on the same footing with citizens with respect to the right of holding and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 34 U. S. 318</a></p><p> disposing of land is a two-years\' residence within the state, and the full effect and benefit of the act, and the clear intention of the legislature, require a construction which gives to it a prospective as well as retrospective application.  And under this construction, Allen Campbell became qualified to take and hold the title to the land in question and pass the same in the same manner as if he had been a citizen of the state.  No constitutional objection can be made to this act.  It does not profess to naturalize aliens.  It is not necessary that they should be made citizens in order to hold and pass real estate, and the condition upon which this may be done is a matter resting entirely with the state legislature.
