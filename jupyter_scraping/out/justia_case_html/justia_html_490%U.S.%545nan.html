No one survived the resulting crash.  Petitioner brought a tort action in state court, claiming that San Diego Gas and Electric Company had negligently positioned and inadequately illuminated the transmission lines, and that the city of San Diego\'s negligent maintenance of the airport\'s runway lights had rendered them inoperative the night of the crash.  When she later discovered that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was in fact the party responsible for the runway lights, petitioner filed the present action against the United States in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.  The complaint based jurisdiction upon the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1346(b), alleging negligence in the FAA\'s operation and maintenance of the runway lights and performance of air traffic control functions.  Almost a year later, she moved to amend the federal complaint to include claims against the original state court defendants, as to which no independent basis for federal jurisdiction existed.  The District Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 490 U. S. 547</a></p><p> granted petitioner\'s motion and asserted "pendent" jurisdiction under Mine Workers v. <em>Gibbs,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html">383 U.

App. to Pet. for Cert. A-8 to A-9.  The District Court certified an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1292(b).  That court summarily reversed on the basis of its earlier opinion in <em>Ayala v. United States,</em> 550 F.2d 1196 (1977), <em>cert. dism\'d,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/982/case.html">435 U. S. 982</a></span> (1978), which had categorically rejected pendent party jurisdiction under the FTCA. We granted certiorari, 488 U.S. 815 (1988), to resolve a split among the Circuits on whether the FTCA permits an assertion of pendent jurisdiction over additional parties.  <em>Compare, e.g., Ayala v. United States, supra,</em> with <em>Lykins v. Pointer, Inc.,</em> 725 F.2d 645 (CA11 1984), and <em>Stewart v. United States,</em> 716 F.2d 755 (CA10 1982), <em>cert. denied,</em> 469 U.S. 1018 (1984).</p>\n<p>The FTCA provides that "the district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States" for certain torts of federal employees acting within the scope of their employment.  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1346(b).  Petitioner seeks to append her claims against the city and the utility to her FTCA action against the United States, even though this would require the District Court to extend its authority to additional parties for whom an independent jurisdictional base -- such as diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1332(a)(1) -- is lacking.</p>\n<p>In 1807, Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the Court that</p>\n<p>"courts which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by written law, cannot transcend that jurisdiction.  It is unnecessary to state the reasoning on which this opinion is founded, because it has been repeatedly given by this court; and with the decisions heretofore rendered on this point, no member of the bench has, even for an instant, been dissatisfied."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/75/case.html">Ex parte Bollman,</a></span></em> 4 Cranch 75,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/75/case.html#93">8 U.

S. 506</a></span> (1813).</p>\n<p>Despite this principle, in a line of cases by now no less well established, we have held, without specific examination of jurisdictional statutes, that federal courts have "pendent" claim jurisdiction -- that is, jurisdiction over nonfederal claims between parties litigating other matters properly before the court -- to the full extent permitted by the Constitution.  <em>Mine Workers v. Gibbs, supra; Hurn v. Oursler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/289/238/case.html">289 U. S. 238</a></span> (1933); <em>Siler v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/213/175/case.html">213 U. S. 175</a></span> (1909). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Gibbs,</em> which has come to stand for the principle in question, held that</p>\n<p>"[p]endent jurisdiction, in the sense of judicial <em>power,</em> exists whenever there is a claim \'arising under [the] Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority . . . ,\' U.S.Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, and the relationship </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 490 U. S. 549</a></p><p> between that claim and the state claim permits the conclusion that the entire action before the court comprises but one constitutional \'case.\'"</p>\n<p>383 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html#725">383 U. S. 725</a></span> (emphasis in original). The requisite relationship exists, <em>Gibbs</em> said, when the federal and nonfederal claims "derive from a common nucleus of operative fact" and are such that a plaintiff "would ordinarily be expected to try them in one judicial proceeding."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Petitioner contends that the same criterion applies here, leading to the result that her state law claims against San Diego Gas and Electric Company and the city of San Diego may be heard in conjunction with her FTCA action against the United States.</p>\n<p>Analytically, petitioner\'s case is fundamentally different from <em>Gibbs</em> in that it brings into question what has become known as pendent <em>party</em> jurisdiction, that is, jurisdiction over parties not named in any claim that is independently cognizable by the federal court. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We may assume, without deciding, that the constitutional criterion for pendent party jurisdiction is analogous to the constitutional criterion for pendent claim jurisdiction, and that petitioner\'s state law claims pass that test.  Our cases show, however, that, with respect to the addition of parties, as opposed to the addition of only claims, we will not assume that the full constitutional power has been congressionally authorized, and will not read jurisdictional statutes broadly.  In <em>Zahn v. International Paper Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/291/case.html">414 U. S. 291</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/291/case.html#301">414 U. S. 301</a></span> (1973), we refused to allow a plaintiff pursuing a diversity action worth less than the jurisdictional minimum of $10,000 to append his claim to the jurisdictionally adequate diversity claims of other members of a plaintiff class -- even though all of the <em>claims</em> would together </p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 490 U. S. 550</a></p><p> have amounted to a single "case" under <em>Gibbs, see Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/case.html">437 U. S. 365</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/case.html#372">437 U. S. 372</a></span> (1978).  We based this holding upon "the statutes defining the jurisdiction of the District Court," 414 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/291/case.html#292">414 U. S. 292</a></span>, and did not so much as mention <em>Gibbs.</em></p>\n<p>Two years later, the nontransferability of <em>Gibbs</em> to pendent party claims was made explicit.  In <em>Aldinger v. Howard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html">427 U. S. 1</a></span> (1976), the plaintiff brought federal claims under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 against individual defendants, and sought to append to them a related state claim against Spokane County, Washington.  (A federal \xc2\xa7 1983 claim was unavailable against the county because of this Court\'s decision in <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span> (1961).) [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We specifically disapproved application of the <em>Gibbs</em> mode of analysis, finding a "significant legal difference."  427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#15">427 U. S. 15</a></span>.  "[T]he addition of a completely new party," we said, "would run counter to the well-established principle that federal courts . . . are courts of limited jurisdiction marked out by Congress."  <em>Ibid.</em>  "Resolution of a claim of pendent party jurisdiction . . . calls for careful attention to the relevant statutory language."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#17">427 U. S. 17</a></span>.  We held in <em>Aldinger</em> that the jurisdictional statute under which suit was brought, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343, which conferred district court jurisdiction over civil actions of certain types "authorized by law to be commenced," did not mean to include as "authorized by law" a state law claim against a party that had been statutorily insulated from similar federal suit.  The county had been "<em>excluded</em> from liability in \xc2\xa7 1983, and therefore by reference in the grant of jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1343(3)."  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>We reaffirmed and further refined our approach to pendent party jurisdiction in <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/case.html#372">437 U. S. 372</a></span>-375 -- a case, like <em>Zahn,</em> involving the diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1332(a)(1), but focusing on the requirement that the suit be "between . . . citizens of different </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 490 U. S. 551</a></p><p>states," rather than the requirement that it "excee[d] the sum or value of $10,000."  We held that the jurisdiction which \xc2\xa7 1332(a)(1) confers over a "matter in controversy" between a plaintiff and defendant of diverse citizenship cannot be read to confer pendent jurisdiction over a different, nondiverse defendant, even if the <em>claim</em> involving that other defendant meets the <em>Gibbs</em> test.  "<em>Gibbs,</em>" we said,</p>\n<p>"does not end the inquiry into whether a federal court has power to hear the nonfederal claims along with the federal ones.  Beyond this constitutional minimum, there must be an examination of the posture in which the nonfederal claim is asserted and of the specific statute that confers jurisdiction over the federal claim,"</p>\n<p>437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/case.html#373">437 U. S. 373</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The most significant element of "posture" or of "context," <em>id.</em> at 376, in the present case (as in <em>Zahn, Aldinger,</em> and <em>Kroger</em>) is precisely that the added claims involve added parties over whom no independent basis of jurisdiction exists.  While in a narrow class of cases a federal court may assert authority over such a claim "ancillary" to jurisdiction otherwise properly vested -- for example, when an additional party has a claim upon contested assets within the court\'s exclusive control, <em>see, e.g., Krippendorf v. Hyde,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/110/276/case.html">110 U. S. 276</a></span> (1884); <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/65/450/case.html">Freeman v.

As in <em>Kroger,</em> the relationship between petitioner\'s added claims and the original complaint is one of "mere factual similarity," which is of no consequence, since</p>\n<p>"neither the convenience of the litigants nor considerations of judicial economy can suffice to justify extension of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction,"</p>\n<p>437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/case.html#376">437 U.

S. 376</a></span>, the party seeking to bring the added claims had little choice but to be in federal rather than state court, since the FTCA permits the Federal Government to be sued only there.  But that alone is not enough, since we have held that suits against the United States under the Tucker Act, 24 Stat. 505 (which can of course be brought only in federal court, <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1346(a)(2), 1491(a)(1)), cannot include private defendants.  <em>United States v. Sherwood,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/584/case.html">312 U. S. 584</a></span> (1941).</p>\n<p>The second factor invoked by <em>Kroger,</em> the text of the jurisdictional statute at issue, likewise fails to establish petitioner\'s case.  The FTCA, \xc2\xa7 1346(b), confers jurisdiction over "civil actions on claims against the United States."  It does not say "civil actions on claims that include requested relief against the United States," nor "civil actions in which there is a claim against the United States" -- formulations one might expect if the presence of a claim against the United States constituted merely a minimum jurisdictional requirement, rather than a definition of the permissible scope of FTCA actions.  Just as the statutory provision "between . . . citizens of different States" has been held to mean citizens of different States and no one else, <em>see Kroger, supra,</em> so also here we conclude that "against the United States" means against the United States and no one else.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends, however, that an affirmative grant of pendent party jurisdiction is suggested by changes made to the jurisdictional grant of the FTCA as part of the comprehensive 1948 revision of the Judicial Code.  <em>See</em> Pub.L. 773, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="554">Page 490 U.

(emphasis added).  In the 1948 revision, this provision was changed to "exclusive jurisdiction of <em>civil actions on claims</em> against the United States."  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1346(b) (1952 ed.)

We have found no suggestion, much less a clear expression, that the minor rewording at issue here imported a substantive change.</p>\n<p>The change from "claim against the United States" to "civil actions on claims against the United States" would be a strange way to express the substantive revision asserted by petitioner -- but a perfectly understandable way to achieve another objective.  The 1948 recodification came relatively soon after the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provide that "[t]here shall be one form of action to be known as <em>civil action.\'"  Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 2.  Consistent with this new terminology, the 1948 revision inserted the expression "civil action" throughout the provisions governing </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="555">Page 490 U. S. 555</a></em></p><p><em> district court jurisdiction.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., App. A114-A125 (1947) (Reviser\'s Notes).\n</em></p>\n<p>Reliance upon the 1948 recodification also ignores the fact that the concept of pendent party jurisdiction was not considered remotely viable until <em>Gibbs</em> liberalized the concept of pendent claim jurisdiction -- nearly 20 years later.  <em>See</em> 13B C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 3567.2, pp. 146-148 (2d ed.1984); Miller, Ancillary and Pendent Jurisdiction, 26 S.Tex.L.J. 1, 11 (1985).  Indeed, in 1948, even a relatively limited substantive expansion of pendent <em>claim</em> jurisdiction with respect to unfair competition actions provoked considerable discussion, <em>see</em> Wechsler, Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 216, 232 (1948); Note, The Proposed Revision of the Federal Judicial Code, 60 Harv.L.Rev. 424, 430-431 (1947), and was described by the chief reviser as one of a dozen "major changes of law" effected by his handiwork, W. Barron, The Judicial Code 1948 Revision, 8 F.R.D. 439, 441-445 (1949).  That change, in the already accepted realm of pendent <em>claim</em> jurisdiction, was accomplished by wording that could not be mistaken, referring to</p>\n<p>"any civil action asserting a claim of unfair competition when joined with a substantial and related claim under the copyright, patent, or trademark laws."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1338(b), 62 Stat. 931.  It is inconceivable that the much more radical change of adopting pendent party jurisdiction would have been effected by the minor and obscure change of wording at issue here -- especially when that revision is more naturally understood as stylistic.</p>\n<p>Because the FTCA permits the Government to be sued only in federal court, our holding that parties to related claims cannot necessarily be sued there means that the efficiency and convenience of a consolidated action will sometimes have to be forgone in favor of separate actions in state and federal courts.  We acknowledged this potential consideration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 490 U.

The <em>Gibbs</em> line of cases was a departure from prior practice, and a departure that we have no intent to limit or impair.  But <em>Aldinger</em> indicated that the <em>Gibbs</em> approach would not be extended to the pendent party field, and we decide today to retain that line.  Whatever we say regarding the scope of jurisdiction conferred by a particular statute can, of course, be changed by Congress.  What is of paramount importance is that Congress be able to legislate against a background of clear interpretive rules, so that it may know the effect of the language it adopts.  All our cases -- <em>Zahn, Aldinger,</em> and <em>Kroger</em> -- have held that a grant of jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties does not itself confer jurisdiction over additional claims by or against different parties.  Our decision today reaffirms that interpretive rule; the opposite would sow confusion.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS apparently does not acknowledge the divergence in these lines of authority.

More precisely, it is not that the "statutory power to decide this case" is <em>defeated</em> by the joinder of a private party for purposes of a claim over which the District Court has no independent jurisdiction, but that the statutory power to decide a case including such a claim simply does not exist, since the FTCA provides jurisdiction only for claims against the United States.

Howard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html">427 U. S. 1</a></span> (1976), required us to ask whether the Federal Tort Claims Act embraced "an affirmative grant of pendent party jurisdiction," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/case.html#553">490 U. S. 553</a></span>, I would agree with the majority that no such specific grant of jurisdiction is present.  But, in my view, that is not the appropriate question under <em>Aldinger.</em>  I read the Court\'s opinion in that case, rather, as requiring us to consider whether Congress has demonstrated an intent to exempt "the party as to whom jurisdiction pendent to the principal claim" is asserted from being haled into federal court.  427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#16">427 U.

And, as those of us in dissent in <em>Aldinger</em> observed, the <em>Aldinger</em> test would be rendered meaningless </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 490 U. S. 557</a></p><p> if the required intent could be found in the failure of the relevant jurisdictional statute to mention the type of party in question,</p>\n<p>"because all instances of asserted pendent party jurisdiction will by definition involve a party as to whom Congress has impliedly \'addressed itself\' by not expressly conferring subject matter jurisdiction on the federal courts."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#23">427 U. S. 23</a></span> (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>In <em>Aldinger,</em> the Court found the requisite intent to exclude municipalities from the relevant jurisdictional statute, because (the Court then thought) municipalities had been affirmatively excluded by Congress from the scope of 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983.  In such a case, the Court barred the use of the pendent party doctrine, for otherwise the doctrine would permit an end run around an express congressional limitation of federal power.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#16">427 U. S. 16</a></span>-17.</p>\n<p>In the present case, I find no such substantive limitation.  Nor, in my view, is there any other expression of congressional intent to exclude private defendants from federal tort claims litigation.  <em>United States v. Sherwood,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/584/case.html">312 U. S. 584</a></span> (1941), is not to the contrary.  There, this Court held that Congress did not intend under the Tucker Act to permit the district courts to adjudicate any cause of action that could not have been brought in the Court of Claims, an Article I court in which no private party could be a defendant.  <em>Sherwood</em> did not turn solely on a canon of "conservatism which is appropriate in the case of a waiver of sovereign immunity."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/584/case.html#590">312 U.

S. 590</a></span>-591.  There is no equivalent history of adjudication of tort claims against the United States in a tribunal without power to litigate the liability of private tortfeasors; thus, <em>Sherwood</em> does not require the result the Court reaches today.</p>\n<p>In a case not controlled by any express intent to limit the scope of a constitutional "case," <em>Aldinger</em> suggests that the appropriateness of pendent party jurisdiction might turn on the "alignmen[t] of parties and claims," and that one significant factor is whether "the grant of jurisdiction to [the] federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 490 U.

Where, as here, Congress\' preference for a federal forum for a certain category of claims makes the federal forum the <em>only</em> possible one in which the constitutional case may be heard as a whole, the sensible result is to permit the exercise of pendent party jurisdiction.  <em>Aldinger</em> imposes no obstacle to that result, and I would not reach out to create one.  I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s holding is not faithful to our precedents and casually dismisses the accumulated wisdom of our best judges.  As we observed more than 16 years ago,</p>\n<p>"numerous decisions throughout the courts of appeals since [<em>Mine Workers v.

I shall first explain why the position taken by the overwhelming consensus of federal judges is correct, and then comment on major flaws in the opinion the Court announces today.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Article III of the Constitution identifies the categories of "Cases" and "Controversies" that federal courts may have jurisdiction to decide. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  If a case is not within one of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 490 U. S. 559</a></p><p> specified categories, neither Congress nor the parties may authorize a federal court to decide it. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Objections to a federal court\'s jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case cannot be waived. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Although Article III strictly confines the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts, it does not limit the extent of the courts\' personal jurisdiction over individual parties [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] or their power to decide individual claims in cases within any of the specified categories. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  A party beyond the reach of a federal court\'s process may voluntarily submit to its jurisdiction over his person, but he cannot create subject matter jurisdiction -- by waiver, estoppel, or the filing of a lawsuit -- over a non-Article III case. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="560">Page 490 U. S. 560</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The case before us today is one in which the United States is a party.  Given the plain language of Article III, there is not even an arguable basis for questioning the federal court\'s constitutional power to decide it. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Moreover, by enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in 1946, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1346(b), Congress unquestionably authorized the District Court to accept jurisdiction of "civil actions on claims against the United States."  Thus, it is perfectly clear that the District Court has both constitutional and statutory power to decide this case.</p>\n<p>It is also undisputed that this power will not be defeated by the joinder of two private defendants.  Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly authorizes the defendant to implead joint tortfeasors, [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] and this Rule is applicable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="561">Page 490 U. S. 561</a></p><p> to FTCA cases. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Moreover, if the claim against nonfederal defendants had been properly brought in a federal court, those defendants could require the United States to defend their claim for contribution in that action. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  The dispute between all the parties derives from a common nucleus of operative fact.  There is accordingly ample basis for regarding this entire three-cornered controversy as a single "case," and for allowing petitioners to assert additional claims against the nonfederal defendants as they are authorized to do by Rule 20(a) of the Federal Rules. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>Prior to the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938, the federal courts routinely decided state law claims in cases in which they had subject matter jurisdiction, <em>see, e.g., Hurn v.

At issue was the exercise of pendent jurisdiction over a state law claim in an action brought under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.

Under the Rules, the impulse is toward entertaining the broadest possible scope of action consistent with fairness to the parties; joinder of claims, parties and remedies is strongly encouraged.  Yet because the <em>Hurn</em> question involves issues of jurisdiction as well as convenience, there has been some tendency to limit its application to cases in which the state and federal claims are, as in <em>Hurn,</em> \'little more than the equivalent of different epithets to characterize the same group of circumstances.\'  289 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/289/238/case.html#246">289 U.

[<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>Immediately after <em>Gibbs</em> was decided, [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>] federal judges throughout the Nation recognized that its reasoning applied to cases in which it was necessary to add an additional party on a pendent, nonfederal claim in order to grant complete relief.  For example, Judge Henry Friendly considered this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 490 U. S. 565</a></p><p> precise question in three separate opinions. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  Because he is universally recognized not only as one of our wisest judges, [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] but also as one with special learning and expertise in matters of federal jurisdiction, [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>] a reference to each of those opinions is appropriate.</p>\n<p>In <em>Leather\'s Best, Inc. v. S. S. Mormaclynx,</em> 451 F.2d 800 (CA2 1971), Judge Friendly summarized the understanding of the <em>Gibbs</em> doctrine that prevailed in 1971, as follows:</p>\n<p>"To be sure, the <em>Gibbs</em> Court was not confronted with the question whether pendent jurisdiction extended to a state claim against a party not named in the federal claim.  But as we have recently observed in <em>Astor-Honor, Inc. v. Grosset &amp; Dunlap, Inc.,</em> 441 F.2d 627, 629 (2 Cir.1971),"</p>\n<p>"Mr. Justice Brennan\'s language and the common sense considerations underlying it seem broad enough to cover that problem also.  <em>See</em> Note, UMW v.

S. 566</a></p><p> that decision, involving federal claims under the copyright laws and state claims of unfair trade practice and unfair competition, including a defendant not named in the copyright claims, we held that a federal court had power to hear a state claim against a party not named in the federal claim, provided the <em>Gibbs</em> test was met, noting that this conclusion was buttressed by our decisions concerning ancillary jurisdiction to entertain compulsory counterclaims under F.R.Civ.P. 13(a), <em>United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions, Inc.,</em> 221 F.2d 213 (2 Cir.1955), and third-party claims under F.R.Civ.P. 14(a), <em>Dery v.

Indeed, in another paragraph of his opinion, Judge Friendly concluded that the 1966 amendments to the Rules made it appropriate to extend the ancillary jurisdiction doctrine to the admiralty context, as well as to ordinary civil cases. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  In another opinion in 1971, he unequivocally concluded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="567">Page 490 U. S. 567</a></p><p> that</p>\n<p>"the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction is sufficiently broad to support a claim within the limits of <em>Gibbs</em> against a person not a party to the primary, jurisdiction-granting claim."</p>\n<p><em>Almenares v. Wyman,</em> 453 F.2d 1075, 1083 (CA2 1971), <em>cert. denied,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/944/case.html">405 U. S. 944</a></span> (1972). [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]</p>\n<p>Before Judge Friendly addressed this issue for the third time, we decided <em>Aldinger v. Howard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html">427 U. S. 1</a></span> (1976).  In that case, after declining to announce any general rule governing pendent party jurisdiction, we held that such jurisdiction should not be exercised if Congress has "expressly or by implication negated its existence" in the statute granting subject matter jurisdiction over the particular claim before the Court.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#18">427 U.

Specifically, we concluded that the Civil Rights Acts, as then interpreted, precluded the joinder of a municipal corporation as a defendant to a claim asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 or to a state law claim pendent to such a federal claim.  Although a reasonable argument can be made that the Court misconstrued the intent of Congress in that case, <em>see</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#23">427 U. S. 23</a></span>-37 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), there surely can be no quarrel with the proposition that Congress may withdraw or deny pendent jurisdiction over particular claims or parties.</p>\n<p>In his third "pendent party" opinion, Judge Friendly correctly described the limited scope of our holding in <em>Aldinger.</em>  He wrote:</p>\n<p>"Although the <em>Aldinger</em> Court disapproved of the joinder of a pendent party defendant in the case before it, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 490 U.

The exclusivity of federal jurisdiction over claims for violation of the Securities Exchange Act makes a federal court the only one where a complete disposition of federal and related state claims can be rendered.  <em>Cf.</em> the Court\'s comment in <em>Aldinger</em> that"</p>\n<p>"[w]hen the grant of jurisdiction to a federal court is exclusive, for example, as in the prosecution of tort claims against the United States under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1346, the argument of judicial economy and convenience can be coupled with the additional argument that only in federal court may all of the claims be tried together,"</p>\n<p>"427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/427/1/case.html#18">427 U.

In the <em>Weinberger</em> case, the circumstances were "about as powerful for the exercise of pendent party jurisdiction as can be imagined" because Congress had vested the federal courts with exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act.  The federal district court was therefore the only forum in which the entire constitutional case could be tried at one time.  That powerful circumstance is also present in cases arising under the FTCA.  In fact, in dicta, the <em>Aldinger</em> Court suggested that pendent party jurisdiction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="569">Page 490 U. S. 569</a></p><p> might be available under the FTCA for precisely this reason.  427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#18">427 U. S. 18</a></span>.</p>\n<p>I would thus hold that the grant of jurisdiction to hear "civil actions on claims against the United States" authorizes the federal courts to hear state law claims against a pendent party.  As many other judges have recognized, [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>] the fact that such claims are within the exclusive federal jurisdiction, together with the absence of any evidence of congressional disapproval of the exercise of pendent party jurisdiction in FTCA cases, [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>] provides a fully sufficient </p><p><a class="page-number" name="570">Page 490 U.

[<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="572">Page 490 U. S. 572</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court treats the absence of an affirmative grant of jurisdiction by Congress as though it constituted the kind of implicit rejection of pendent jurisdiction that we found in <em>Aldinger v. Howard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html">427 U. S. 1</a></span> (1976).  Its opinion laboriously demonstrates that the FTCA "defines jurisdiction in a manner that does not reach defendants other than the United States," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/case.html#553">490 U.

S. 555</a></span>.  That, of course, is always the predicate for the question whether a federal court may rely on the doctrine of ancillary or pendent jurisdiction to fill a gap in the relevant jurisdictional statute.  If the Court\'s demonstration were controlling, <em>Gibbs, Hurn</em>, and <em>Moore,</em> as well as a good many other cases, were incorrectly decided. [<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="573">Page 490 U. S. 573</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Aldinger,</em> we adopted a rule of construction that assumed the existence of pendent jurisdiction unless "Congress in the statutes conferring jurisdiction has . . . expressly or by implication negated its existence," 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#18">427 U. S. 18</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]  We rejected the assertion of pendent party jurisdiction there because it arose "not in the context of congressional silence or tacit encouragement, but in quite the opposite context."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#15">427 U. S. 15</a></span>-16. [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]  Congress\' exclusion of municipal corporations from the definition of persons under \xc2\xa7 1983, we concluded, evinced an intent to preclude the exercise of federal court jurisdiction over them.  If congressional silence were sufficient to defeat pendent jurisdiction, the careful reasoning in our <em>Aldinger</em> opinion was wholly unnecessary, for obviously the civil rights statutes do not affirmatively authorize the joinder of any state law claims.</p>\n<p>A similar approach, focusing on a legislative intent to bar a party from federal court, guided our analysis in <em>Zahn v. International Paper Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/291/case.html">414 U. S. 291</a></span> (1973), and <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/case.html">437 U. S. 365</a></span> (1978).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="574">Page 490 U. S. 574</a></p><p> In <em>Zahn,</em> we surveyed the "firmly rooted" law that</p>\n<p>"multiple plaintiffs with separate and distinct claims must each satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirement for suit in federal courts,"</p>\n<p>414 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/291/case.html#294">414 U. S. 294</a></span>, and refused to adopt a rule that would allow putative plaintiffs who could not meet the jurisdictional amount to assert claims pendent to jurisdictionally sufficient claims.  We noted that adoption of such a rule</p>\n<p>"would undermine the purpose and intent of Congress in providing that plaintiffs in diversity cases must present claims in excess of the specified jurisdictional amount"</p>\n<p>and would depart from "the historic construction of the jurisdictional statutes, left undisturbed by Congress over these many years."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/291/case.html#301">414 U. S. 301</a></span>.  In <em>Kroger,</em> the rule at issue was the requirement that a plaintiff invoking diversity jurisdiction plead complete diversity.  After noting the historical evidence demonstrating</p>\n<p>"a congressional mandate that diversity jurisdiction is not to be available when any plaintiff is a citizen of the same State as any defendant,"</p>\n<p>437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/case.html#374">437 U. S. 374</a></span>, we held that that jurisdictional requirement could not be circumvented through the exercise of pendent jurisdiction. [<a href="#F2/29" name="T2/29">Footnote 2/29</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court today adopts a sharply different approach.  Without even so much as acknowledging our statement in <em>Aldinger</em> that, before a federal court may exercise pendent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="575">Page 490 U. S. 575</a></p><p> party jurisdiction, it must satisfy itself that Congress "has not expressly or by implication negated its existence," 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#18">427 U. S. 18</a></span>, it now instructs that</p>\n<p>"a grant of jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties does not itself confer jurisdiction over additional claims by or against different parties."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/case.html#556">490 U. S. 556</a></span>.  This rule, the Court asserts, is necessary to provide Congress "a background of clear interpretative rules" and to avoid sowing confusion.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But as a method of statutory interpretation, the Court\'s approach is neither clear nor faithful to our judicial obligation to discern congressional intent.  While with respect to the joinder of additional defendants on pendent state claims, the Court\'s mandate is now clear, its approach offers little guidance with respect to the many other claims that a court must address in the course of deciding a constitutional case.  Because the Court provides no reason why the joinder of pendent defendants over whom there is no other basis of federal jurisdiction should differ from the joinder of pendent claims and other pendent parties, [<a href="#F2/30" name="T2/30">Footnote 2/30</a>] I fear that its approach will confuse more than it clarifies.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="576">Page 490 U. S. 576</a></p><p> How much more clear to assume -- especially when the courts have long so held -- that, with respect to all of these situations, Congress intended the Federal Rules to govern unless Congress has indicated otherwise.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s focus on diversity cases may explain why it loses sight of the purpose behind the principle of pendent jurisdiction. [<a href="#F2/31" name="T2/31">Footnote 2/31</a>]  The doctrine of pendent jurisdiction rests in part on a recognition that forcing a federal plaintiff to litigate his or her case in both federal and state courts impairs the ability of the federal court to grant full relief, <em>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/255/356/case.html">255 U. S. 356</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/255/367/case.html">255 U.

In such circumstances, in which Congress has unequivocally indicated its intent that the federal right be litigated in a federal forum, there is reason to believe that Congress did not intend that the substance of the federal right be diminished by the increased costs in efficiency and convenience of litigation in two forums.  <em>Cf.

The Court is quite incorrect to presume that, because Congress did not sanction the exercise of pendent party jurisdiction in the diversity context, it has not permitted its exercise with respect to claims within the exclusive federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court seeks to draw support from <em>United States v.

[<a href="#F2/36" name="T2/36">Footnote 2/36</a>]  The Court\'s holding was based partly on the special history of the Court of Claims, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/581/case.html#587">490 U.

At an earlier date, this difference might have affected our decision here.  But the rules of procedure in the admiralty and civil jurisdictions were merged in 1966, and we are of the opinion that, at least since that merger, the constitutional rationale which underlies the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction in the context of Rule 13(a) and Rule 14 may be applied to support the conclusion that a federal court has the power to hear a related state claim against a defendant not named in the federal claim regardless of whether the federal claim arises in the civil or admiralty jurisdiction.  Thus, we conclude that, in a case such as this, where the facts underlying the state and federal claims are identical, a federal court vested with admiralty jurisdiction over a shipper\'s claim against the carrier for breach of contract of carriage does have the \'power\' also to entertain its state tort claim against a pier operator."</p>\n<p><em>Leather\'s Best, Inc. v.

It notes that an FTCA claim against the Government must be tried without a jury, whereas pendent state law claims would generally be subject to trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment; that the Government cannot be held liable for punitive damages or on a strict liability theory, whereas both may be available against a private party; that the Government has numerous defenses and immunities not available to a private party; and that a claimant against the Government under the FTCA must comply with the Act\'s administrative claim procedures.  <em>Id.</em> at 29-30.

While the presence of any of these factors in a particular case may weigh against the exercise of pendent jurisdiction, they certainly do not deprive the court of the power to hear the pendent claim.  The <em>Yellow Cab</em> Court provided sufficient answer in response to a similar complaint regarding the impleader of the United States in an action between private parties:</p>\n<p>"Such difficulties are not insurmountable.  If, for example, a jury had been demanded in the <em>Yellow Cab</em> case, the decision of jury and nonjury issues could have been handled in a manner comparable to that used when issues of law are tried to a jury and issues of an equitable nature in the same case are tried by the court alone.  If special circumstances had demonstrated the inadvisability, in the first instance, of impleading the United States as a third-party defendant, the leave of court required by Rule 14 could have been denied.  If, at a later stage, the situation had called for a separation of the claims, the court could have ordered their separate trial.  Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 42(b).  The availability of third-party procedure is intended to facilitate, not to preclude, the trial of multiple claims which otherwise would be triable only in separate proceedings.  The possibility of such procedural difficulties is not sufficient ground for so limiting the scope of the Act as to preclude its application to all cases of contribution or even to all cases of contribution arising under third-party practice."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

The Court, however, rejects reliance on the plain meaning of the words "civil action" -- which after all might explain the assertion of pendent claim, as well as pendent party, jurisdiction, <em>see</em> Freer, A Principled Statutory Approach to Supplemental Jurisdiction, 1987 Duke L.J. 34, 56-58 -- on the basis of dubious legislative history that the revisers did not intend to effect such a radical change through "the minor and obscure change of wording at issue here."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/case.html#555">490 U.

The legislative history of the FTCA indicates that Congress may have originally intended that the United States not be joined as a defendant in an action with private parties.  The House Report on an earlier version of what eventually became the FTCA thus stated:</p>\n<p>"The bill therefore does not permit any person to be joined as a defendant with the United States, and does not lift the immunity of the United States from tort actions except as jurisdiction is specifically conferred upon the district courts by this bill.

That statement came in the context of the discussion of the "purely factual" differences in efficiency between the two situations -- concerns which the Court accurately notes do not go to the power to exercise pendent jurisdiction.  The only legal difference the <em>Aldinger</em> Court identified was one of statutory construction.  In \xc2\xa7 1343 and \xc2\xa7 1983, as opposed to the statutes under which the Court had exercised pendent claim jurisdiction, "Congress ha[d] addressed itself to the party as to whom jurisdiction pendent to the principal claim [was] sought" and expressly excluded it from federal jurisdiction.  427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html#16">427 U.
