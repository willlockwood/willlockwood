A trial was had, resulting in a verdict for defendants, and judgment was entered on the verdict, to review which this writ of error was sued out.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This record does not show that the circuit court had jurisdiction of the suit, which depends alone on the citizenship of the parties.  In the declaration it is stated that Halsted, the plaintiff, is a citizen of New York, but nothing is said of the citizenship of the defendants.  Neither is there anything in the rest of the record to show what their citizenship actually was.  For this reason the judgment is reversed, but, as the fault rests alone on the plaintiff, whose duty it was, in bringing the suit, to make the jurisdiction appear, the reversal will be at his cost in this Court.  <em>Hancock v. Holbrook,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/112/229/case.html">112 U. S. 229</a></span>.  If the citizenship of the defendants was in fact such at the commencement of the suit as to give the circuit court jurisdiction, it will be in the power of that court when the case gets back to allow the necessary amendment to be made and then proceed to trial.
