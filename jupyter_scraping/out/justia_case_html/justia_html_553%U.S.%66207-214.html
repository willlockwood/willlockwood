The shipyards subcontracted with petitioner Allison Engine Company, Inc. (Allison Engine), to build Gen-Sets, Allison Engine subcontracted with petitioner General Tool Company (GTC) to assemble them, and GTC subcontracted with petitioner Southern Ohio Fabricators, Inc. (SOFCO), to manufacture Gen-Set bases and enclosures.  The subcontracts required that each Gen-Set be accompanied by a certificate of conformance (COC) certifying that the unit was manufactured according to Navy specifications.

At trial, respondents introduced evidence that petitioners had issued COCs falsely stating that their work was completed in compliance with Navy specifications and that they had presented invoices for payment to the shipyards.  They did not, however, introduce the invoices the shipyards submitted to the Navy.  The District Court granted petitioners judgment as a matter of law, concluding that, absent proof that false claims were presented to the Government, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 evidence was legally insufficient under the FCA.  The Sixth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding, among other things, that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73729(a)(2) and (3) claims did not require proof of an intent to cause a false claim to be paid by the Government; proof of an intent to cause such a claim to be paid by a private entity using Government funds was sufficient.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0It is insufficient for a plaintiff asserting a \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) claim to show merely that the false statement\xe2\x80\x99s use resulted in payment or approval of the claim or that Government money was used to pay the false or fraudulent claim.

Moreover, getting such a claim \xe2\x80\x9cpaid \xe2\x80\xa6 by the Government\xe2\x80\x9d is not the same as getting it paid using \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under \xc2\xa73729(a)(2), a defendant must intend for the Government itself to pay the claim.  Eliminating this element of intent would expand the FCA well beyond its intended role of combating \xe2\x80\x9cfraud against the Government</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rainwater</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/356/590/index.html">356 U.

The assertion that it is customary to say that the Government pays a bill when a recipient of Government funds uses those funds to pay involves a colloquial usage of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpaid by\xe2\x80\x9d that is not customarily employed in statutory drafting, where precision is important and expected.  Section 3729(c)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d does not support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  The definition allows a request to be a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d even if it is not made directly to the Government, but, under \xc2\xa73729(a)(2), it is necessary that the defendant intend that a claim be \xe2\x80\x9cpaid by the Government,\xe2\x80\x9d not by another entity.

Because the section requires only that the defendant make the false statement for the purpose of getting \xe2\x80\x9ca false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\xe2\x80\x9d a subcontractor violates \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) if it submits a false statement to the prime contractor intending that contractor to use the statement to get the Government to pay its claim.  However, if a subcontractor makes a false statement to a private entity but does not intend for the Government to rely on the statement as a condition of payment, the direct link between the statement and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pay or approve a false claim is too attenuated to establish liability.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading gives effect to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to protect the Government from loss due to fraud but also ensures that \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant is not answerable for anything beyond the natural, ordinary, and reasonable consequences of his conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anza</em> v. <em>Ideal Steel Supply Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/451/index.html">547 U.

Instead, it must be shown that they intended \xe2\x80\x9cto defraud the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Where their alleged conduct involved the making of a false statement, it need not be shown that they intended the statement to be presented directly to the Government, but it must be established that they agreed that the statement would have a material effect on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pay the false or fraudulent claim.

We granted review in this case to decide what a plaintiff asserting a claim under these provisions must show regarding the relationship between the making of a \xe2\x80\x9cfalse record or statement\xe2\x80\x9d and the payment or approval of \xe2\x80\x9ca false or fraudulent claim . . . by the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the decision of the Court of Appeals below, we hold that it is insufficient for a plaintiff asserting a \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) claim to show merely that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he false statement\xe2\x80\x99s use . . . result[ed] in obtaining or getting payment or approval of the claim,\xe2\x80\x9d 471 F.\xc2\xa03d 610, 621  (CA6 2006) or that \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment money was used to pay the false or fraudulent claim,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>id</em>., at 622.  Instead, a plaintiff asserting a \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) claim must prove that the defendant intended that the false record or statement be material to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pay or approve the false claim.  Similarly, a plaintiff asserting a claim under \xc2\xa73729(a)(3) must show that the conspirators agreed to make use of the false record or statement to achieve this end.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1985, the United States Navy entered into contracts with two shipbuilders, Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipbuilding (together the shipyards), to build a new fleet of <em>Arleigh</em> <em>Burke</em> class guided missile destroyers.  Each destroyer required three generator sets (Gen-Sets) to supply all of the electrical power for the ship.  The shipyards subcontracted with petitioner Allison Engine Company, Inc. (Allison Engine), formerly a division of General Motors, to build 90 Gen-Sets to be used in over 50 destroyers.  Allison Engine in turn subcontracted with petitioner General Tool Company (GTC) to assemble the Gen-Sets, and GTC subcontracted with petitioner Southern Ohio Fabricators, Inc. (SOFCO), to manufacture bases and enclosures for the Gen-Sets.  The Navy paid the shipyards an aggregate total of $1 billion for each new destroyer.  Of that, Allison Engine was paid approximately $3 million per Gen-Set; GTC was paid approximately $800,000 per Gen-Set; and SOFCO was paid over $100,000 per Gen-Set.  All of the funds used to pay petitioners ultimately came from the Federal Treasury.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Navy\xe2\x80\x99s contract with the shipyards specified that every part of each destroyer be built in accordance with the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s baseline drawings and military standards.  These requirements were incorporated into each of\npetitioners\xe2\x80\x99 subcontracts.  In addition, the contracts required that each delivered Gen-Set be accompanied\nby a certificate of conformance  (COC) certifying that the unit was manufactured in accordance with the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1995, Roger L. Sanders and Roger L. Thacker (hereinafter respondents), former employees of GTC, brought suit in the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio as <em>qui</em> <em>tam</em> relators seeking to recover damages pursuant to \xc2\xa73729, which renders liable any person who \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government . . . a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73729(a)(1); any person who \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73729(a)(2); and any person who \xe2\x80\x9cconspires to defraud the Government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73729(a)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents alleged that the invoices submitted to the shipyards by Allison Engine, GTC, and SOFCO fraudulently sought payment for work that had not been done in accordance with contract specifications.  Specifically, respondents claimed that the gearboxes installed by Allison Engine in the first 52 Gen-Sets were defective and leaked oil; that GTC never conducted a required final quality inspection for approximately half of the first 67 Gen-Sets; and that the SOFCO welders who worked on the first 67 Gen-Sets did not meet military standards.  Respondents also claimed that petitioners issued COCs claiming falsely that the Gen-Sets had been built to the contractually required specifications even though petitioners knew that those specifications had not been met.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case was tried to a jury.  At trial, respondents introduced evidence that petitioners had issued COCs that falsely stated that their work was completed in compliance with the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s requirements and that they had presented invoices for payment to the shipyards.  Respondents did not, however, introduce the invoices submitted by the shipyards to the Navy.  At the close of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 case, petitioners moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a).  Petitioners asserted that no reasonable jury could find a violation under \xc2\xa73729 because respondents had failed to adduce any evidence that a false or fraudulent claim had ever been presented to the Navy.  The District Court granted petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion.  No. 1\xe2\x80\x93:95\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93970, 2005 WL 713569 (SD Ohio, Mar. 11, 2005).  The court rejected respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that they did not have to present evidence that a claim had been submitted to the Navy because they showed that Government funds had been used to pay the invoices that were presented to the shipyards.  The District Court concluded that, absent proof that false claims were presented to the Government, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 evidence was legally insufficient under the FCA.  <em>Id.</em>, at *10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court in relevant part.  471 F.\xc2\xa03d 610 (2006).  The majority agreed with the District Court that liability under \xc2\xa73729(a)(1) requires proof that a false claim was presented to the Government.  However, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court erred in granting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73729(a)(2) and (3) claims.  The Court of Appeals held that such claims do not require proof of an intent to cause a false claim to be paid by the Government.  Rather, it determined that proof of an intent to cause a false claim to be paid by a private entity using Government funds was sufficient.  In so holding, the Court of Appeals recognized that its decision conflicted with <em>United States ex rel. Totten </em>v.<em> Bombardier Corp.</em>, 380 F.\xc2\xa03d 488 (CADC 2004) <em>(Totten),</em> cert denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/1032/index.html">544 U.

S. 420</a>, 431 (2000).  Section 3729(a)(2) imposes civil liability on any person who \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interpretation of \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) that was adopted by the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x94and that is endorsed by the respondents and the Government\xe2\x80\x94impermissibly deviates from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language.  In the view of the Court of Appeals, it is sufficient for a \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) plaintiff to show that a false statement resulted in the use of Government funds to pay a false or fraudulent claim.  471 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 621\xe2\x80\x93622.  Under subsection (a)(2), however, the defendant must make the false record or statement \xe2\x80\x9cto get\xe2\x80\x9d a false or fraudulent claim \xe2\x80\x9cpaid or approved by the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cTo get\xe2\x80\x9d denotes purpose, and thus a person must have the purpose of getting a false or fraudulent claim \xe2\x80\x9cpaid or approved by the Government\xe2\x80\x9d in order to be liable under \xc2\xa73729(a)(2).  Additionally, getting a false or fraudulent claim \xe2\x80\x9cpaid . . . by the Government\xe2\x80\x9d is not the same as getting a false or fraudulent claim paid using \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 622.  Under \xc2\xa73729(a)(2), a defendant must intend that the Government itself pay the claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Eliminating this element of intent, as the Court of Appeals did, would expand the FCA well beyond its intended role of combating \xe2\x80\x9cfraud against the <em>Government</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Rainwater</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/356/590/index.html">356 U. S. 590</a>, 592 (1958) (emphasis added).  As the District of Columbia Circuit pointed out, the reach of \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) would then be \xe2\x80\x9calmost boundless: for example, liability could attach for any false claim made to any college or university, so long as the institution has received some federal grants\xe2\x80\x94as most of them do.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Totten</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 496.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Defending the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xc2\xa73729(a)(2), the Government contends that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpaid \xe2\x80\xa6 by the Government\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean that the Government must literally pay the bill.  The Govern-\nment maintains that it is customary to say that the Government pays a bill when a person who has received\nGovernment funds uses those funds to pay a bill.  The Government provides this example: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[W]hen a student says his college living expenses are \xe2\x80\x9cpaid by\xe2\x80\x9d his parents, he typically does not mean that his parents send checks directly to his creditors.  Rather, he means that his\nparents are the ultimate source of the funds he uses to\npay those expenses.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Ami-\ncus</em> <em>Curiae</em> 9 (quoting <em>Totten</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 506 (Garland, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This example is unpersuasive because it involves a colloquial usage of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpaid by\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a usage that is not customarily employed in more formal contexts.  For example, if a federal employee who receives all of his income from the Government were asked in a formal inquiry to reveal who paid for, say, his new car or a vacation, the employee would not say that the Federal Government had footed the bill.  In statutory drafting, where precision is both important and expected, the sort of col-\nloquial usage on which the Government relies is not\ncustomary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government is also wrong in arguing that the definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73729(c) means that \xc2\xa73729(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpaid by the government\xe2\x80\x9d should not be read literally.  Under this definition, a request for money or property need not be made directly to the Government in order to constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d may include a request or demand that is made to \xe2\x80\x9ca contractor, grantee, or other recipient if the United States Government provides any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded, or if the Government will reimburse such contractor, grantee, or other recipient for any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73729(c).  This definition of the word \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d does not support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument because it does not alter the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cby the Government\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73729(a)(2).  Under \xc2\xa73729(c)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cclaim,\xe2\x80\x9d a request or demand may constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d even if the request is not made directly to the Government, but under \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) it is still necessary for the defendant to intend that a claim be \xe2\x80\x9cpaid \xe2\x80\xa6 by the Government\xe2\x80\x9d and not by another entity.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This does not mean, however, as petitioners suggest, see Reply Brief 1, that \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) requires proof that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s false record or statement was submitted to the Government.  While \xc2\xa73729(a)(1) requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cpresent[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d a false or fraudulent claim to the Government, the concept of presentment is not mentioned in \xc2\xa73729(a)(2).  The inclusion of an express presentment requirement in subsection (a)(1), combined with the absence of anything similar in subsection (a)(2), suggests that Congress did not intend to include a presentment requirement in subsection (a)(2).  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Sigmon Coal Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/438/index.html">534 U. S. 438</a>, 452 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) demands is not proof that the defendant caused a false record or statement to be presented or submitted to the Government but that the defendant made a false record or statement for the purpose of getting \xe2\x80\x9ca false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Therefore, a subcontractor violates \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) if the subcontractor submits a false statement to the prime contractor intending for the statement to be used by the prime contractor to get the Government to pay its claim.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  If a subcontractor or another defendant makes a false statement to a private entity and does not intend the Government to rely on that false statement as a condition of payment, the statement is not made with the purpose of inducing payment of a false claim \xe2\x80\x9cby the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  In such a situation, the direct link between the false statement and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pay or approve a false claim is too attenuated to establish liability.  Recognizing a cause of action under the FCA for fraud directed at private entities would threaten to transform the FCA into an all-purpose antifraud statute.  Our reading of \xc2\xa73729(a)(2), based on the language of the statute, gives effect to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to protect the Government from loss due to fraud but also ensures that \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant is not answerable for anything beyond the natural, ordinary and reasonable consequences of his conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anza</em> v. <em>Ideal Steel Supply Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/451/index.html">547 U.

Under \xc2\xa73729(a)(3), it is not enough for a plaintiff to show that the alleged conspirators agreed upon a fraud scheme that had the effect of causing a private entity to make payments using money obtained from the Government.  Instead, it must be shown that the conspirators intended \xe2\x80\x9cto defraud the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Where the conduct that the conspirators are alleged to have agreed upon involved the making of a false record or statement, it must be shown that the conspirators had the purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cgetting\xe2\x80\x9d the false record or statement to bring about the Government\xe2\x80\x99s payment of a false or fraudulent claim.  It is not necessary to show that the conspirators intended the false record or statement to be presented directly to the Government, but it must be established that they agreed that the false record or statement would have a material effect on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pay the false or fraudulent claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading of subsection (a)(3) is in accord with our decision in <em>Tanner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/107/index.html">483 U. S. 107</a> (1987), where we held that a conspiracy to defraud a federally funded private entity does not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracy to defraud the United States\xe2\x80\x9d under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7371.  <em>Id.</em>, at 129.  In <em>Tanner</em>, the Government argued that a recipient of federal financial assistance and the subject of federal supervision may itself be treated as \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  We rejected this reading of \xc2\xa7371 as having \xe2\x80\x9cnot even an arguable basis in the plain language of \xc2\xa7371.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 131.  Indeed, we concluded that such an interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cwould have, in effect, substituted \xe2\x80\x98anyone receiving federal financial assistance and supervision\xe2\x80\x99 for the phrase \xe2\x80\x98the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 132.  Likewise, the interpretation urged on us by respondents would in effect substitute \xe2\x80\x9cpaid or approved by the Government\xe2\x80\x9d for the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpaid by Government funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Had Congress intended subsection (a)(3) to apply to anyone who conspired to defraud a recipient of Government funds, it would have so provided.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the decision of the Court of Appeals was based on an incorrect interpretation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73729(a)(2) and (3), we vacate its judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This interpretation of \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) does not render superfluous the portion of \xc2\xa73729(c) providing that a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d may be made to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient of Government funding.  This language makes it clear that there can be liability under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73729(a)(1) and (2) where the request or demand for money or property that a defendant presents to a federal officer for payment or approval, \xc2\xa73729(a)(1), or that a defendant intends \xe2\x80\x9cto get \xe2\x80\xa6 paid or approved by the Government\xe2\x80\x9d, \xc2\xa73729(a)(2), may be a request or demand that was originally \xe2\x80\x9cmade to\xe2\x80\x9d a contractor, grantee, or other recipient of federal funds and then forwarded to the Government.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Section 3729(b) provides that the terms \xe2\x80\x9cknowing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmean that a person, with respect to information\xe2\x80\x94(1) has actual knowledge of the information; (2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or (3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information, and no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statutory definition of these terms is easily reconcilable with our holding in this case for two reasons.  First, the intent requirement we discern in \xc2\xa73729(a)(2) derives not from the term \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather from the infinitive phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto get.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, \xc2\xa73729(b) refers to specific intent with regard to the truth or falsity of the \xe2\x80\x9cinformation,\xe2\x80\x9d while our holding refers to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in making or using a false record or statement.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
