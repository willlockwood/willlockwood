See also Roberts v.

Because the statute is likely to mislead sentencing juries into believing that only mitigating factors they can label and "weigh" against aggravating ones can properly be considered, I would grant certiorari to review the statute\'s constitutionality. I therefore dissent. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] See White v. Maryland, 470 U.S. 1062 (1985) (dissenting from denial of certiorari); Maxwell v.
