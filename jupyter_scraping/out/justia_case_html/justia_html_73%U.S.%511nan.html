The covenant not being kept and the property having been sold on a foreclosure of the mortgage, Pickersgill sued Prentice on the covenant.  Prentice pleaded that as "he claimed, supposed, and understood" the covenant was satisfied and discharged, he having paid Pickersgill $1,500 back, but that a dispute arising between the parties as to whether anything more ought to be paid, the matter was agreed to be left to one Henry, who said and decided that $1,500 more ought to be paid.</p>\n<p>Replication that there was no such reference, that Henry did not make any award or decision, and that the said defendant did not pay to the plaintiff the sum of $1,500 or any sum of money for or on account of any award or determination, concluding to the country.</p>\n<p>To this replication, after issue joined and when the cause was on the trial list and ready for trial, Prentice demurred, assigning for cause that the replication did not properly traverse the plea, that it introduced new matter in the allegation that the defendant did not pay to the plaintiff $1,500 or any sum of money for or on account of the award, which allegation ought to have concluded with a verification, and not to the country, and that it was colorable, uncertain &amp;c.</p>\n<p>The demurrer being overruled, the case went to trial before Grier, J., when the defendant wholly failing to prove any reference or submission or award by Henry, the jury found for the plaintiff $2,618, the plaintiff having been credited by them with the $1,500 paid back.  Judgment having gone accordingly, a writ of error was taken by the defendant to this Court, no counsel appearing for him in this Court, nor any brief being filed. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 73 U.
