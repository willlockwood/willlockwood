While the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects the right of citizens to \xe2\x80\x9cply their trade, practice their occupation, or pursue a common calling,\xe2\x80\x9d Hicklin v. Orbeck, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 518\n, the Court has struck down laws as violating this privilege only when they were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burdening out-of-state citizens.  See, e.g., Toomer v. Witsell, \n\n334 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385\n.  The Virginia FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s citizen/noncitizen distinction has a nonprotectionist aim.  Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA exists to provide a mechanism for Virginia citizens to obtain an accounting from their public officials; noncitizens have no comparable need.  Moreover, the distinction between citizens and noncitizens recognizes that citizens alone foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the Commonwealth.  Any effect the Act has of preventing citizens of other States from making a profit by trading on information contained in state records is incidental.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Hurlbert also alleges that Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA abridges the right to own and transfer property in the Commonwealth.  The right to take, hold, and dispose of property has long been seen as one of the privileges of citizenship.  See, e.g., Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180.  However, Virginia law does not prevent noncitizens from obtaining documents necessary to the transfer of property.  Records\xe2\x80\x94like title and mortgage documents\xe2\x80\x94maintained by the clerk of each circuit court are available to inspection by any person.  Real estate tax assessment records are considered nonconfidential and are often posted online, a practice followed by the county from which Hurlbert sought records.  Requiring a noncitizen to obtain records through the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office or on the Internet, instead of through a burdensome FOIA process, cannot be said to impose a significant burden on the ability to own or transfer property in Virginia.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0McBurney alleges that Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA impermissibly burdens his access to public proceedings.  The Privileges and Immunities Clause \xe2\x80\x9csecures citizens of one state the right to resort to the courts of another, equally with the citizens of the latter state,\xe2\x80\x9d Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., \n\n257 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533\n, but that \xe2\x80\x9crequirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. upon terms which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have, even though they may not be .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the same in extent as those accorded to resident citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d Canadian Northern R. Co. v. Eggen, \n\n252 U.\xc2\xa0S. 553\n.  Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA clearly does not deprive noncitizens of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable and adequate\xe2\x80\x9d access to Commonwealth courts.  Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s court rules provide noncitizens access to nonpriviledged documents needed in litigation, and Virginia law gives citizens and noncitizens alike access to judicial records and to records pertaining directly to them.  For example, McBurney utilized Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to receive much of the information he had sought in his FOIA request.

The Court has repeatedly stated that the Constitution does not guarantee the existence of FOIA laws.  See, e.g., Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., \n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 32\n.  Moreover, no such right was recognized at common law or in the early Republic.  Nor is such a sweeping right \xe2\x80\x9cbasic to the maintenance or well-being of the Union.\xe2\x80\x9d  Baldwin, supra, at 388.

The \xe2\x80\x9ccommon thread\xe2\x80\x9d among this Court\xe2\x80\x99s dormant Commerce Clause cases is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State interfered with the natural functioning of the interstate market either through prohibition or thorough burdensome regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., \n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 794\n.  Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits access to an interstate market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.  Accordingly, this is not properly viewed as a dormant Commerce Clause case.  Even shoehorned into the Court\xe2\x80\x99s dormant Commerce Clause framework, however, Hurlbert\xe2\x80\x99s claim would fail.  Insofar as there is a \xe2\x80\x9cmarket\xe2\x80\x9d for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for a product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manufacturer.  A State does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a state program, it \xe2\x80\x9climits benefits generated by [that] state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to serve.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reeves, Inc. v.

Code Ann. \xc2\xa72.2\xe2\x80\x933700 et\xc2\xa0seq., violates either the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the Constitution or the dormant Commerce Clause.  The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), provides that \xe2\x80\x9call public records shall be open to inspection and copying by any citizens of the Commonwealth,\xe2\x80\x9d but it grants no such right to non-Virginians.  \xc2\xa72.2\xe2\x80\x933704(A) (Lexis 2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners, who are citizens of other States, unsuccessfully sought information under the Act and then brought this constitutional challenge.  We hold, however, that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights were not violated.  By means other than the state FOIA, Virginia made available to petitioners most of the information that they sought, and the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to furnish the additional information did not abridge any constitutionally protected privilege or immunity.  Nor did Virginia violate the dor- mant Commerce Clause.  The state Freedom of Informa- tion Act does not regulate commerce in any meaningful sense, but instead provides a service that is related to state citizenship.  For these reasons, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals rejecting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners Mark J.

After his ex-wife defaulted on her child support obligations, McBurney asked the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s Division of Child Support Enforcement to file a petition for child support on his behalf.  The agency complied, but only after a 9-month delay.  McBurney attributes that delay to agency error and says that it cost him nine months of child support.  To ascertain the reason for the agency\xe2\x80\x99s delay, McBurney filed a Virginia FOIA request seeking \xe2\x80\x9call emails, notes, files, memos, reports, letters, policies, [and] opinions\xe2\x80\x9d pertaining to his family, along with all documents \xe2\x80\x9cregarding [his] application for child support\xe2\x80\x9d and all documents pertaining to the handling of child support claims like his.  App. in No. 11\xe2\x80\x931099 (CA4), p. 39A.  The agency denied McBurney\xe2\x80\x99s request on the ground that he was not a Virginia citizen.  McBurney later requested the same documents under Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Gov- ernment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act, Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72.2\xe2\x80\x933800 et\xc2\xa0seq., and through that re- quest he received most of the information he had sought that pertained specifically to his own case.

But the Virginia FOIA does not abridge Hulbert\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in a common calling in the sense prohibited by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

By its own terms, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA was enacted to \xe2\x80\x9censur[e] the people of the Commonwealth ready access to public records in the custody of a public body or its officers and employees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is being conducted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72.2\xe2\x80\x933700(B) (Lexis 2011).  Hurlbert does not allege\xe2\x80\x94and has offered no proof\xe2\x80\x94that the challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA was enacted in order to provide a competitive economic advantage for Virginia citizens.  Cf. Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 59, \n67 (2003)\n (piercing a professedly nondiscriminatory statute to find economic protectionism).  Rather, it seems clear that the distinction that the statute makes between citizens and noncitizens has a distinctly nonprotectionist aim.  The state FOIA essentially represents a mechanism by which those who ultimately hold sovereign power (i.e., the citizens of the Commonwealth) may obtain an accounting from the public officials to whom they delegate the exercise of that power.  See Va. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa72; Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72.2\xe2\x80\x933700(B).  In addition, the provision limiting the use of the state FOIA to Virginia citizens recognizes that Virginia taxpayers foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the Commonwealth.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  The challenged provision of the state FOIA does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause simply because it has the incidental effect of preventing citizens of other States from making a profit by trading on in- formation contained in state records.  While the Clause forbids a State from intentionally giving its own citizens a competitive advantage in business or employment, the Clause does not require that a State tailor its every action to avoid any incidental effect on out-of-state tradesmen.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHurlbert next alleges that the challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA abridges the right to own and transfer property in the Commonwealth.  Like the right to pursue a common calling, the right to \xe2\x80\x9ctake, hold and dispose of property, either real or personal,\xe2\x80\x9d has long been seen as one of the privileges of citizenship.  See Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 546, 552 (No. 3, 230) (CCED Pa. 1825); see also Paul, supra, at 180 (listing \xe2\x80\x9cthe acquisition and enjoyment of property\xe2\x80\x9d among the privileges of citizenship).  Thus, if a State prevented out-of-state citizens from accessing records\xe2\x80\x94like title documents and mortgage records\xe2\x80\x94that are necessary to the transfer of property, the State might well run afoul of the Privileges and Immunities Clause.  Cf. State v. Grimes, 29 Nev. 50, 85, 84 P.\xc2\xa01061, 1073 (1906) (\xe2\x80\x9cCaveat emptor being the rule with us in the absence of a special agreement, it is just and essential to the protection of persons intending to purchase or take incumbrances that they be allowed the right of inspection\xe2\x80\x9d); Jackson ex dem.

Under Virginia law, \xe2\x80\x9cany records and papers of every circuit court that are maintained by the clerk of the circuit court shall be open to inspection by any person and the clerk shall, when requested, furnish copies thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa717.1\xe2\x80\x93208 (Lexis 2010).  Such records and papers include records of property transfers, like title documents, \xc2\xa755\xe2\x80\x93106 (Lexis 2012); notices of federal tax liens and other federal liens against property, \xc2\xa755\xe2\x80\x93142.1; notices of state tax liens against property, \xc2\xa758.1\xe2\x80\x93314 (Lexis 2009) (state taxes generally), \xc2\xa758.1\xe2\x80\x93908 (estate tax liens), \xc2\xa758.1\xe2\x80\x931805 (state taxes generally), \xc2\xa758.1\xe2\x80\x932021(A) (liens filed by agencies other than the Tax Commission); and notice of mortgages and other encumbrances, \xc2\xa78.01\xe2\x80\x93241 (Lexis Supp. 2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA similar flaw undermines Hurlbert\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Vir- ginia violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause by pre- venting citizens of other States from accessing real estate tax assessment records.  It is true that those records, while available to Virginia citizens under the state FOIA, are not required by statute to be made available to noncitizens.  See Associated Tax Service, Inc. v. Fitzpatrick, 236 Va. 181, 183, 187, 372 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 625, 627, 629 (1988).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But in fact Virginia and its subdivisions generally make even these less essential records readily available to all.  These records are considered nonconfidential under Virginia law and, accordingly, they may be posted online.  \xc2\xa758.1\xe2\x80\x933122.2 (Lexis 2009).  Henrico County, from which Hurlbert sought real estate tax assessments, follows this practice,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t as does almost every other county in the Commonwealth.  Requiring noncitizens to conduct a few minutes of Internet research in lieu of using a relatively cumbersome state FOIA process cannot be said to impose any significant burden on noncitizens\xe2\x80\x99 ability to own or transfer property in Virginia.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMcBurney alleges that Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s citizens-only FOIA provision impermissibly burdens his \xe2\x80\x9caccess to public proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 42.  McBurney is correct that the Privileges and Immunities Clause \xe2\x80\x9csecures citizens of one State the right to resort to the courts of another, equally with the citizens of the latter State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Missouri Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., \n\n257 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533, \n535 (1922)\n.  But petitioners do not suggest that the Virginia FOIA slams the courthouse door on noncitizens; rather, the most they claim is that the law creates \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n information asymmetry between adversaries based solely on state citizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 42.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Privileges and Immunities Clause does not require States to erase any distinction between citizens and non-citizens that might conceivably give state citizens some detectable litigation advantage.  Rather, the Court has made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional requirement is sat- isfied if the non-resident is given access to the courts of the State upon terms which in themselves are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have, even though they may not be technically and precisely the same in extent as those accorded to resident citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  Canadian Northern R.\xc2\xa0Co. v.

Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s rules of civil procedure provide for both discovery, Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 4:1 (2012), and subpoenas duces tecum, Rule 4:9.  There is no reason to think that those mechanisms are insufficient to provide noncitizens with any relevant, nonprivileged documents needed in litigation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, Virginia law gives citizens and noncitizens alike access to judicial records.

And if Virginia has in its possession information about any person, whether a citizen of the Commonwealth or of another State, that person has the right under the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to inspect that information.  \xc2\xa72.2\xe2\x80\x933806(A)(3) (Lexis 2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMcBurney\xe2\x80\x99s own case is illustrative.  When his FOIA request was denied, McBurney was told that he should request the materials he sought pursuant to the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act.  Upon placing a request under that Act, he ultimately received much of what he sought.  Accordingly, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s citizens-only FOIA provision does not impermissibly burden noncitizens\xe2\x80\x99 ability to access the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s courts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, we reject petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 sweeping claim that the challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them the right to access public information on equal terms with citizens of the Commonwealth.

Most founding-era English cases provided that only those persons who had a personal interest in non-judicial records were permitted to access them.  See, e.g., King v. Shelley, 3 T.

Acts ch. 479, p. 690.  There is no contention that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s unity foundered in their absence, or that it is suffering now because of the citizens-only FOIA provisions that several States have enacted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition to his Privileges and Immunities Clause claim, Hurlbert contends that Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s citizens-only FOIA provision violates the dormant Commerce Clause.

The Commerce Clause does not expressly impose any constraints on \xe2\x80\x9cthe several States,\xe2\x80\x9d and several Members of the Court have expressed the view that it does not do so.  See General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, \n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 278, \n312 (1997)\n (Scalia, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he so-called \xe2\x80\x98negative\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause is an unjustified judicial intervention, not to be expanded beyond its existing domain\xe2\x80\x9d); United Haulers Assn.

The \xe2\x80\x9ccommon thread\xe2\x80\x9d among those cases in which the Court has found a dormant Commerce Clause violation is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State interfered with the natural functioning of the interstate market either through prohibition or through burdensome regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., \n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 794, \n806 (1976)\n.   Here, by contrast, Virginia neither prohibits access to an interstate market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.  Rather, it merely creates and provides to its own citizens copies\xe2\x80\x94which would not otherwise exist\xe2\x80\x94of state records.  As discussed above, the express purpose of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA law is to \xe2\x80\x9censur[e] the people of the Commonwealth ready access to public records in the custody of a public body or its officers and employees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is being conducted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72.2\xe2\x80\x933700(B).  This case is thus most properly brought under the Privileges and Immunities Clause: It quite literally poses the question whether Virginia can deny out-of-state citizens a benefit that it has conferred on its own citizens.  Cf. Missouri Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co., 257 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 535 (analyzing whether the privilege of access to a State\xe2\x80\x99s courts must be made available to out-of-state citizens equally with the citizens of the relevant State).  Because it does not pose the question of the constitutionality of a state law that interferes with an interstate market through prohibition or burdensome regulations, this case is not governed by the dormant Commerce Clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven shoehorned into our dormant Commerce Clause framework, however, Hurlbert\xe2\x80\x99s claim would fail.  Insofar as there is a \xe2\x80\x9cmarket\xe2\x80\x9d for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for a product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manufacturer.  We have held that a State does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a state program, it \xe2\x80\x9climits benefits generated by [that] state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to serve.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reeves, Inc. v.
