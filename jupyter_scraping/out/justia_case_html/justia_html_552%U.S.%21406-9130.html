S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1), but, as relevant here, exempts from that waiver \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any \xe2\x80\xa6 property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72680(c).  Upon his transfer from an Atlanta federal prison to one in Kentucky, petitioner noticed that several items were missing from his personal property, which had been shipped to the new facility by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  Alleging that BOP officers had lost his property, petitioner filed this suit under, <em>inter alia</em>, the FTCA, but the District Court dismissed that claim as barred by \xc2\xa72680(c).  Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d applies only to officers enforcing customs or excise laws.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Section 2680(c)\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure demonstrate that the broad phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d covers all law enforcement officers.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa72680(c) is focused on preserving sovereign immunity only for officers enforcing customs and excise laws is inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language.  \xe2\x80\x9cRead naturally, the word \xe2\x80\x98any\xe2\x80\x99 has an expansive meaning, that is, \xe2\x80\x98one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(1), the <em>Gonzales </em>Court held that, notwithstanding the subsection\xe2\x80\x99s initial reference to federal drug trafficking crimes, the expansive word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d and the absence of restrictive language left \xe2\x80\x9cno basis in the text for limiting\xe2\x80\x9d the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d to federal sentences.  520 U. S.<em>,</em> at 5.  To similar effect, see <em>Harrison</em> v. <em>PPG Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/578/index.html">446 U. S. 578</a>, 588\xe2\x80\x93589, in which the Court held that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno indication whatever that Congress intended\xe2\x80\x9d to limit the \xe2\x80\x9cexpansive language\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any other final action\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to particular kinds of agency action.  The reasoning of <em>Gonzales</em> and <em>Harrison</em> applies equally to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c): Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d to modify \xe2\x80\x9cother law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d is most naturally read to mean law enforcement officers of whatever kind.  To be sure, the text\xe2\x80\x99s references to \xe2\x80\x9ctax or customs duty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s] of customs or excise\xe2\x80\x9d indicate an intent to preserve immunity for claims arising from an officer\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of tax and customs laws.  The text also indicates, however, that Congress intended to preserve immunity for claims arising from the detention of property, and there is no indication of any intent that immunity for those claims turns on the type of law being enforced.  Recent amendments to \xc2\xa72680(c) restoring the sovereign immunity waiver for officers enforcing <em>any</em> federal forfeiture law, see \xc2\xa72680(c)(1), support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion by demonstrating Congress\xe2\x80\x99 view that, prior to the amendments, \xc2\xa72680(c) covered <em>all</em> law enforcement officers.  Against this textual and structural evidence, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the canons of statutory construction <em>ejusdem generis</em> and <em>noscitur a sociis </em>and on the rule against superfluities is unconvincing.  The Court is unpersuaded by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to create ambiguity where the statute\xe2\x80\x99s structure and text suggest none.  Had Congress intended to limit \xc2\xa72680(c)\xe2\x80\x99s reach as petitioner contends, it easily could have written \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer <em>acting in a customs or excise capacity</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, it used the unmodified, all-encompassing phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court must give effect to the text Congress enacted.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680, which carves out certain exceptions to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 waiver of sovereign immunity for torts committed by federal employees.  Section 2680(c) provides that the waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to claims arising from the detention of property by \xe2\x80\x9cany officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner contends that this clause applies only to law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws, and thus does not affect the waiver of sovereign immunity for his property claim against officers of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  We conclude that the broad phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d covers all law enforcement officers.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the dismissal of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Abdus-Shahid M. S. Ali was a federal prisoner at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2001 to 2003.  In December 2003, petitioner was scheduled to be transferred to the United States Penitentiary Big Sandy (USP Big Sandy) in Inez, Kentucky.  Before being transferred, he left two duffle bags containing his personal property in the Atlanta prison\xe2\x80\x99s Receiving and Discharge Unit to be inventoried, packaged, and shipped to USP Big Sandy.  Petitioner was transferred, and his bags arrived some days later.  Upon inspecting his property, he noticed that several items were missing.  The staff at USP Big Sandy\xe2\x80\x99s Receiving and Discharge Unit told him that he had been given everything that was sent, and that if things were missing he could file a claim.  Many of the purportedly missing items were of religious and nostalgic significance, including two copies of the Qur\xe2\x80\x99an, a prayer rug, and religious magazines.  Petitioner estimated that the items were worth $177.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner filed an administrative tort claim.  In denying relief, the agency noted that, by his signature on the receipt form, petitioner had certified the accuracy of the inventory listed thereon and had thereby relinquished any future claims relating to missing or damaged property.  Petitioner then filed a complaint alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, violations of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71346, 2671 <em>et seq.</em>  The BOP maintained that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim was barred by the exception in \xc2\xa72680(c) for property claims against law enforcement officers.  The District Court agreed and dismissed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s FTCA claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72680(c).  204 Fed.

In rejecting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, the Court of Appeals relied on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s broad interpretation of \xc2\xa72680(c)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdetention\xe2\x80\x9d clause in <em>Kosak</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/848/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/848/index.html">465 U.

See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  As relevant here, the FTCA authorizes \xe2\x80\x9cclaims against the United States, for money damages . . . for injury or loss of property . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> The FTCA exempts from this waiver certain categories of claims.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72680(a)\xe2\x80\x93(n).  Relevant here is the exception in subsection (c), which provides that \xc2\xa71346(b) shall not apply to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72680(c).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case turns on whether the BOP officers who allegedly lost petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s property qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cother law enforcement officer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72680(c).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Petitioner argues that they do not because \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d includes only law enforcement officers acting in a customs or excise capacity.  Noting that Congress referenced customs and excise activities in both the language at issue and the preceding clause in \xc2\xa72680(c), petitioner argues that the entire subsection is focused on preserving the United States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity only as to officers enforcing those laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d suggests a broad meaning.  <em>Ibid.</em>  (emphasis added).  We have previously noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ead naturally, the word \xe2\x80\x98any\xe2\x80\x99 has an expansive meaning, that is, \xe2\x80\x98one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 97 (1976)).  In <em>Gonzales</em>, we considered a provision that imposed an additional sentence for firearms used in federal drug trafficking crimes and provided that such additional sentence shall not be concurrent with \xe2\x80\x9cany other term of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  520 U. S., at 4 (quoting 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(1) (1994 ed.) (emphasis deleted)).  Notwithstanding the subsection\xe2\x80\x99s initial reference to federal drug trafficking crimes, we held that the expansive word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d and the absence of restrictive language left \xe2\x80\x9cno basis in the text for limiting\xe2\x80\x9d the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d to federal sentences.  520 U. S., at 5.  Similarly, in <em>Harrison</em> v. <em>PPG Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/578/index.html">446 U. S. 578</a> (1980), the Court considered the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other final action\xe2\x80\x9d in amendments to the Clean Air Act.  The Court explained that the amendments expanded a list of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator actions by adding two categories of actions: actions under a specifically enumerated statutory provision, and \xe2\x80\x9cany other final action\xe2\x80\x9d under the Clean Air Act.  <em>Id.,</em> at 584 (emphasis deleted).  Focusing on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of the word \xe2\x80\x9cany,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court \xe2\x80\x9cdiscern[ed] no uncertainty in the meaning of the phrase, \xe2\x80\x98any other final action,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and emphasized that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexpansive language offer[ed] no indication whatever that Congress intended\xe2\x80\x9d to limit the phrase to final actions similar to those in the specifically enumerated sections.  <em>Id.,</em> at 588\xe2\x80\x93589.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think the reasoning of <em>Gonzales</em> and <em>Harrison</em> applies equally to the expansive language Congress employed in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d to modify \xe2\x80\x9cother law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d is most naturally read to mean law enforcement officers of whatever kind.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d is repeated four times in the relevant portion of \xc2\xa72680(c), and two of those instances appear in the particular phrase at issue: \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> officer of customs or excise or <em>any</em> other law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Congress inserted the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d immediately before \xe2\x80\x9cother law enforcement officer,\xe2\x80\x9d leaving no doubt that it modifies that phrase.  To be sure, the text\xe2\x80\x99s references to \xe2\x80\x9ctax or customs duty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s] of customs or excise\xe2\x80\x9d indicate that Congress intended to preserve immunity for claims arising from an officer\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of tax and customs laws.  The text also indicates, however, that Congress intended to preserve immunity for claims arising from the detention of property, and there is no indication that Congress intended immunity for those claims to turn on the type of law being enforced.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner would require Congress to clarify its intent to cover all law enforcement officers by adding phrases such as \xe2\x80\x9cperforming any official law enforcement function,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwithout limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Congress could not have chosen a more all-encompassing phrase than \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d to express that intent.  We have no reason to demand that Congress write less economically and more repetitiously.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recent amendments to \xc2\xa72680(c) support the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d is not limited to officers acting in a customs or excise capacity.  In the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, Congress added subsections (c)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(c)(4) to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680.  \xc2\xa73(a), 114 Stat. 211.  As amended, \xc2\xa72680(c) provides that the \xc2\xa71346(b) waiver of sovereign immunity, notwithstanding the exception at issue in this case, applies to:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny claim based on injury or loss of goods, merchandise, or other property, while in the possession of any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer, if\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) the interest of the claimant was not forfeited;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(3) the interest of the claimant was not remitted or mitigated (if the property was subject to forfeiture); and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(4) the claimant was not convicted of a crime for which the interest of the claimant in the property was subject to forfeiture under a Federal criminal forfeiture law.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The amendment does not govern petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim because his property was not \xe2\x80\x9cseized for the purpose of forfeiture,\xe2\x80\x9d as required by paragraph (1).  Nonetheless, the amendment is relevant because our construction of \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d must, to the extent possible, ensure that the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.  See <em>Robinson </em>v.<em> Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a>, 340 (1997) (citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/235/index.html">489 U. S. 235</a>, 240 (1989)).  The amendment canceled the exception\xe2\x80\x94and thus restored the waiver of sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x94for certain seizures of property based on <em>any</em> federal forfeiture law.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c)(1) (excepting property claims if \xe2\x80\x9cthe property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under <em>any provision of Federal law</em> providing for the forfeiture of property\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, only law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws were immune under the prior version of \xc2\xa72680(c).  Thus, on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s only effect was to restore the waiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, enforce forfeiture laws.  This strikes us as an implausible interpretation of the statute.  If that were Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent, it is not apparent why Congress would have restored the waiver with respect to the enforcement of <em>all</em> civil forfeiture laws instead of simply those related to customs or excise.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation makes sense only if we assume that Congress went out of its way to restore the waiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, enforce forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise.  But petitioner fails to demonstrate that customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, ever enforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise, much less that they do so with such frequency that Congress is likely to have singled them out in the amendment.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  It seems far more likely that Congress restored the waiver for officers enforcing <em>any</em> civil forfeiture law because, in its view, <em>all</em> such officers were covered by the exception to the waiver prior to the amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against this textual and structural evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d does in fact mean any other law enforcement officer, petitioner invokes numerous canons of statutory construction.  He relies primarily on <em>ejusdem generis</em>, or the principle that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co.</em> v. <em>Train Dispatchers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/117/index.html">499 U. S. 117</a>, 129 (1991).  In petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cany officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d should be read as a three-item list, and the final, catchall phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d should be limited to officers of the same nature as the preceding specific phrases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner likens his case to two recent cases in which we found the canon useful.  In <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. </em>v. <em>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/371/index.html">537 U. S. 371</a>, 375 (2003), we considered the clause \xe2\x80\x9cexecution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process\xe2\x80\x9d in 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7407(a).  Applying <em>ejusdem generis</em>, we concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cother legal process\xe2\x80\x9d was limited to legal processes of the same nature as the specific items listed.  537 U. S.,<em> </em>at 384\xe2\x80\x93385.  The department\xe2\x80\x99s scheme for serving as a representative payee of the benefits due to children under its care, while a \xe2\x80\x9clegal process,\xe2\x80\x9d did not share the common attribute of the listed items, viz., \xe2\x80\x9cutilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism . . . by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge\xe2\x80\x9d a debt.  537 U.

S. 481</a> (2006), the Court considered whether an exception to the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity for claims arising out of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d barred a claim that mail negligently left on the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s porch caused her to slip and fall.  <em>Id.,</em> at  485 (quoting 28 U.

Noting that \xe2\x80\x9closs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarriage\xe2\x80\x9d both addressed \xe2\x80\x9cfailings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address,\xe2\x80\x9d 546 U.

We disagree.  The structure of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d does not lend itself to application of the canon.  The phrase is disjunctive, with one specific and one general category, not\xe2\x80\x94like the clauses at issue in <em>Keffeler</em> and <em>Dolan</em>\xe2\x80\x94a list of specific items separated by commas and followed by a general or collective term.  The absence of a list of specific items undercuts the inference embodied in <em>ejusdem generis</em> that Congress remained focused on the common attribute when it used the catchall phrase.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Aguilar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/593/index.html">515 U. S. 593</a>, 615 (1995) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (rejecting the canon\xe2\x80\x99s applicability to an omnibus clause that was \xe2\x80\x9cone of \xe2\x80\xa6 several distinct and independent prohibitions\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9ca general or collective term following a list of specific items to which a particular statutory command is applicable\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, it is not apparent what common attribute connects the specific items in \xc2\xa72680(c).  Were we to use the canon to limit the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer,\xe2\x80\x9d we would be required to determine the relevant limiting characteristic of \xe2\x80\x9cofficer of customs or excise.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>Jarecki </em>v.<em> G. D. Searle Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/303/index.html">367 U. S. 303</a> (1961), for example, the Court invoked <em>noscitur a sociis</em> in limiting the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discovery\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the common characteristic it shared with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exploration\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prospecting.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 307.  The Court noted that all three words in conjunction \xe2\x80\x9cdescribe[d] income-producing activity in the oil and gas and mining industries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Here, by contrast, no relevant common attribute immediately appears from the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cofficer of customs or excise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner suggests that the common attribute is that both types of officers are charged with enforcing the customs and excise laws.  But we see no reason why that should be the relevant characteristic as opposed to, for example, that officers of that type are commonly involved in the activities enumerated in the statute: the assessment and collection of taxes and customs duties and the detention of property.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s appeals to other interpretive principles are also unconvincing.  Petitioner contends that his reading is supported by the canon <em>noscitur a sociis</em>, according to which \xe2\x80\x9ca word is known by the company it keeps.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>S.\xc2\xa0D. Warren Co.</em> v. <em>Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/370/index.html">547 U. S. 370</a>, 378 (2006).  But the cases petitioner cites in support of applying <em>noscitur a sociis </em>involved statutes with stronger contextual cues.  See <em>Gutierrez</em> v. <em>Ada</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/250/index.html">528 U. S. 250</a>, 254\xe2\x80\x93258 (2000) (applying the canon to narrow the relevant phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cany election,\xe2\x80\x9d where it was closely surrounded by six specific references to gubernatorial elections); <em>Jarecki</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 306\xe2\x80\x93309 (applying the canon to narrow the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscoveries\xe2\x80\x9d to discoveries of mineral resources where it was contained in a list of three words, all of which applied to the oil, gas, and mining industries and could not conceivably all apply to any other industry).  Here, although customs and excise are mentioned twice in \xc2\xa72680(c), nothing in the overall statutory context suggests that customs and excise officers were the exclusive focus of the provision.  The emphasis in subsection (c) on customs and excise is not inconsistent with the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d sweeps as broadly as its language suggests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, the rule against superfluities lends petitioner sparse support.  The construction we adopt today does not necessarily render \xe2\x80\x9cany officer of customs or excise\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous; Congress may have simply intended to remove any doubt that officers of customs or excise were included in \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Fort Stewart Schools</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/641/index.html">495 U.

Moreover, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s construction threatens to render \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous because it is not clear when, if ever, \xe2\x80\x9cother law enforcement officer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d act in a customs or excise capacity.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In any event, we do not woodenly apply limiting principles every time Congress includes a specific example along with a general phrase.  See <em>Harrison</em>, 446 U. S., at 589, n.\xc2\xa06 (rejecting an argument that <em>ejusdem generis</em> must apply when a broad interpretation of the clause could render the specific enumerations unnecessary).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, we are unpersuaded by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to create ambiguity where the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure suggest none.  Had Congress intended to limit \xc2\xa72680(c)\xe2\x80\x99s reach as petitioner contends, it easily could have written \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer <em>acting in a customs or excise capacity</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, it used the unmodified, all-encompassing phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nothing in the statutory context requires a narrowing construction\xe2\x80\x94indeed, as we have explained, the statute is most consistent and coherent when \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d is read to mean what it literally says.  See <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co.</em>, 499 U. S., at 129 (noting that interpretive canons must yield \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the whole context dictates a different conclusion\xe2\x80\x9d).  It bears emphasis, moreover, that \xc2\xa72680(c), far from maintaining sovereign immunity for the entire universe of claims against law enforcement officers, does so only for claims \xe2\x80\x9carising in respect of\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cdetention\xe2\x80\x9d of property.  We are not at liberty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem more desirable.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Instead, we must give effect to the text Congress enacted: Section 2680(c) forecloses lawsuits against the United States for the unlawful detention of property by \xe2\x80\x9cany,\xe2\x80\x9d not just \xe2\x80\x9csome,\xe2\x80\x9d law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is</p>\n<p align="left">Affirmed.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit joined five other Courts of Appeals in construing \xc2\xa72680(c) to encompass all law enforcement officers.

For example, we have construed an \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d phrase narrowly when it included a term of art that compelled that result.  See <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v.<em> Adams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/105/index.html">532 U.

But the examples the dissent provides do not support that assertion.  The dissent maintains that a customs officer who seizes material defined as contraband under 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780302 <em>et seq.</em>, is one such example.  <em>Post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But a customs officer\xe2\x80\x99s authority to effect a forfeiture of such contraband derives from a specific customs law.  See 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71595a(c)(1)(C).  Similarly, the dissent suggests that a DEA agent \xe2\x80\x9cassisting a customs official\xe2\x80\x9d in a border search who seizes drug-related contraband under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7881 is acting in a \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional revenue capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But that argument is based on the assumption that an officer who assists in conducting a border search acts in a customs capacity even if he is not a customs officer and is not enforcing a customs law.  That assumption, far from self-evident, only underscores the difficulty that would attend any attempt to define the contours of the implied limitation on \xc2\xa72680(c)\xe2\x80\x99s reach proposed by petitioner and embraced by the dissent.  \xe2\x80\x9cActing in a customs or excise capacity\xe2\x80\x9d is not a self-defining concept, and not having included such a limitation in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, Congress of course did not provide a definition.  Finally, the dissent points out that a customs or excise officer might effect a forfeiture of currency or monetary instruments under 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75317(c).  <em>Post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.<em> </em>But \xc2\xa75317(c) is hardly a civil forfeiture law unrelated to customs or excise.  See \xc2\xa75317(c)(2) (authorizing forfeiture of property involved in a violation of, <em>inter alia</em>, \xc2\xa75316, which sets forth reporting requirements for exporting and importing monetary instruments).</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As an example of \xe2\x80\x9cother law enforcement officer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d acting in an excise or customs capacity, petitioner cites <em>Formula One Motors, Ltd.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 777 F. 2d 822, 823\xe2\x80\x93824 (CA2 1985) (holding that the seizure of a vehicle still in transit from overseas by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents who searched it for drugs was \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently akin to the functions carried out by Customs officials to place the agents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct within the scope of section 2680(c)\xe2\x80\x9d).  But it is not clear that the agents in that case were acting in an excise or customs capacity rather than in their ordinary capacity as law enforcement agents.  It seems to us that DEA agents searching a car for drugs are acting in their capacity as officers charged with enforcing the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s drug laws, not the customs or excise laws.</p>\n<p>\n\nSimilarly, the dissent notes that 14 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa789(a) authorizes Coast Guard officers to enforce customs laws.  <em>Post</em>, at 5-6.\xc2\xa0  But the very next subsection of \xc2\xa789 provides that Coast Guard officers effectively <em>are</em> customs officers when they enforce customs laws.

The respect is not enhanced, however, by decisions that foreclose consideration of the text within the whole context of the statute as a guide to determining a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  To prevent textual analysis from becoming so rarefied that it departs from how a legislator most likely understood the words when he or she voted for the law, courts use certain interpretative rules to consider text within the statutory design.  These canons do not demand wooden reliance and are not by themselves dispositive, but they do function as helpful guides in construing ambiguous statutory provisions.  Two of these accepted rules are <em>ejusdem generis</em> and <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>which together instruct that words in a series should be interpreted in relation to one another. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today the Court holds, if my understanding of its opinion is correct, that there is only one possible way to read the statute.  Placing implicit reliance upon a comma at the beginning of a clause, the Court says that the two maxims noted, and indeed other helpful and recognized principles of statutory analysis, are not useful as interpretative aids in this case because the clause cannot be understood by what went before.  In my respectful submission the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach is incorrect as a general rule and as applied to the statute now before us.  Both the analytic framework and the specific interpretation the Court now employs become binding on the federal courts, which will confront other cases in which a series of words operate in a clause similar to the one we consider today.  So this case is troubling not only for the result the Court reaches but also for the analysis it employs.  My disagreements with the Court lead to this dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows those who allege injury from governmental actions over a vast sphere to seek damages for tortious conduct.  The enacting Congress enumerated 13 exceptions to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s broad waiver of sovereign immunity, all of which shield the Government from suit in specific instances.  These exceptions must be given careful consideration in order to prevent interference with the governmental operations described.  As noted in <em>Kosak</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/848/index.html">465 U. S. 848</a>, 853, n.\xc2\xa09 (1984), however, \xe2\x80\x9cunduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court states, at issue here is the extent of the exception for suits arising from the detention of goods in defined circumstances.  The relevant provision excepts from the general waiver</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cclaim[s] arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both on first reading and upon further, close consideration, the plain words of the statute indicate that the exception is concerned only with customs and taxes.  The provision begins with a clause dealing exclusively with customs and tax duties.  And the provision as a whole contains four express references to customs and tax, making revenue duties and customs and excise officers its most salient features.  Cf. <em>Gutierrez</em> v. <em>Ada</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/250/index.html">528 U. S. 250</a>, 254\xe2\x80\x93255 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to suggest that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading is wholly impermissible or without some grammatical support.  After all, detention of goods is not stated until the outset of the second clause and at the end of the same clause the words \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d appear; so it can be argued that the first and second clauses of the provision are so separate that all detentions by all law enforcement officers in whatever capacity they might act are covered.  Still, this ought not be the preferred reading; for between the beginning of the second clause and its closing reference to \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d appears another reference to \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s] of customs or excise,\xe2\x80\x9d this time in the context of property detention.  This is quite sufficient, in my view, to continue the limited scope of the exception.  At the very least, the Court errs by adopting a rule which simply bars all consideration of the canons of <em>ejusdem generis </em>and <em>noscitur a sociis.  </em>And when those canons are consulted, together with other common principles of interpretation, the case for limiting the exception to customs and tax more than overcomes the position maintained by the Government and adopted by the Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>ejusdem generis </em>canon provides that, where a seemingly broad clause constitutes a residual phrase, it must be controlled by, and defined with reference to, the \xe2\x80\x9cenumerated categories \xe2\x80\xa6 which are recited just before it,\xe2\x80\x9d so that the clause encompasses only objects similar in nature.  <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc.</em> v. <em>Adams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/105/index.html">532 U. S. 105</a>, 115 (2001).  The words \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d immediately follow the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s] of customs or excise,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as the first clause\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the assessment of tax and customs duties.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court counters that \xc2\xa72680(c) \xe2\x80\x9cis disjunctive, with one specific and one general category,\xe2\x80\x9d rendering <em>ejusdem generis </em>inapplicable.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  The canon\xe2\x80\x99s applicability, however, is not limited to those statutes that include a laundry list of items.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co.</em> v. <em>Train Dispatchers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/117/index.html">499 U. S. 117</a>, 129 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, <em>ejusdem generis</em> is often invoked in conjunction with the interpretative canon <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>which provides that words are to be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98known by their companions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</em> v. <em>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/371/index.html">537 U. S. 371</a>, 384 (2003) (quoting <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>at 255).  The general rule is that the \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning of a word, and, consequently, the intention of the legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d should be \xe2\x80\x9cascertained by reference to the context, and by considering whether the word in question and the surrounding words are, in fact, <em>ejusdem generis</em>, and referable to the same subject-matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Neal</em> v. <em>Clark</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/95/704/index.html">95 U. S. 704</a>, 709 (1878) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A proper reading of \xc2\xa72680(c) thus attributes to the last phrase (\xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d) the discrete characteristic shared by the preceding phrases (\xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s] of customs or excise\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cassessment or collection of any tax or customs duty\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>Norton</em> v. <em>Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/55/index.html">542 U. S. 55</a>, 62\xe2\x80\x9363 (2004) (applying <em>ejusdem generis</em> to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98failure to act\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to take an <em>agency action</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)); <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 384\xe2\x80\x93385 (holding that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother legal process\xe2\x80\x9d in 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7407(a) refers only to the utilization of a judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism, the common attribute shared by the phrase and the statutory enumeration preceding it).  Had Congress intended otherwise, in all likelihood it would have drafted the section to apply to \xe2\x80\x9cany law enforcement officer, including officers of customs and excise,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than tacking \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d on the end of the enumerated categories as it did here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common attribute of officers of customs and excise and other law enforcement officers is the performance of functions most often assigned to revenue officers, including, <em>inter alia,</em> the enforcement of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 revenue laws and the conduct of border searches.  Although officers of customs and officers of excise are in most instances the only full-time staff charged with this duty, officers of other federal agencies and general law enforcement officers often will be called upon to act in the traditional capacity of a revenue officer.  For example, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents frequently assist customs officials in the execution of border searches.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gurr</em>, 471 F.\xc2\xa03d 144, 147\xe2\x80\x93149 (CADC 2006) (FBI involved in search of financial documents at border); <em>United</em> <em>States</em> v. <em>Boumelhem</em>, 339 F.\xc2\xa03d 414, 424 (CA6 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cFBI had been cooperating with Customs as a part of a joint task force\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Formula One Motors</em>, <em>Ltd.</em> v. <em>United</em> <em>States</em>, 777 F.\xc2\xa02d 822, 824 (CA2 1985) (DEA agents were performing functions traditionally carried out by Customs officials where they seized and searched an automobile that had been shipped from abroad and was still in its shipping container).  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Schoor</em>, 597 F.\xc2\xa02d 1303, 1305\xe2\x80\x931306 (CA9 1979) (upholding constitutionality of cooperation amongst federal agencies in border searches).  Similarly, 14 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa789(a) grants the Coast Guard plenary authority to stop and board American vessels to inspect for obvious customs violations.  See, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Gil-Carmona</em>, 497 F.\xc2\xa03d 52 (CA1 2007) (Coast Guard assisted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement patrol aircraft in interdicting a vessel off the coast of Puerto Rico).  To the extent they detain goods whose possession violates customs laws, the Coast Guard officers\xe2\x80\x94while not \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s] of customs or excise,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c)\xe2\x80\x94are without doubt engaging in the enforcement of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 revenue laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same is true in the tax context.  Under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76321, a delinquent taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s property is subject to forfeiture, see <em>Glass City Bank</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/265/index.html">326 U. S. 265</a> (1945), and may be seized by any federal agent assisting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in executing the forfeiture, cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>$515,060.42 in United States Currency</em>, 152 F.\xc2\xa03d 491, 495 (CA6 1998) (IRS and FBI jointly seized currency).  Thus, the final phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d has work to do and makes considerable sense when the statute is limited in this way.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaches its contrary conclusion by concentrating on the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d before the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c).  It takes this single last phrase to extend the statute so that it covers all<em> </em>detentions of property by any law enforcement officer in whatever capacity he or she acts.  There are fundamental problems with this approach, in addition to the ones already mentioned.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis cannot be squared with the longstanding recognition that a single word must not be read in isolation but instead defined by reference to its statutory context.  See <em>King</em> v. <em>St. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/215/index.html">502 U. S. 215</a>, 221 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U. S. 481</a>, 486 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cA word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities.  Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is true even of facially broad modifiers.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d can mean \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent things depending upon the setting,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Missouri Municipal League</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/125/index.html">541 U.

S., at 254\xe2\x80\x93255, for example, we held that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin any election\xe2\x80\x9d in the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71422, does not refer broadly to all<em> </em>elections but only to the election of Guam\xe2\x80\x99s Governor and Lieutenant Governor.  The Court explained that the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cany election\xe2\x80\x9d is preceded by two references to gubernatorial elections and followed by four more references.  In the context of such \xe2\x80\x9crelentless repetition,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded that the phrase must be \xe2\x80\x9cknown by [its] companions.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 U. S., at 255.  Likewise, in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alvarez-Sanchez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/350/index.html">511 U. S. 350</a>, 357 (1994), the Court addressed a phrase similar to the statutory provision we interpret today.  The Court noted that the respondent erred in \xe2\x80\x9cplacing dispositive weight on the broad statutory reference to \xe2\x80\x98any\xe2\x80\x99 law enforcement officer or agency without considering the rest of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d and consulted instead \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the context in which [the phrase] is used.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 358 (quoting <em>Deal</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/129/index.html">508 U. S. 129</a>, 132 (1993); alteration in original).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As already mentioned, the context of \xc2\xa72680(c) suggests that, in accordance with these precedents, the statutory provision should be interpreted narrowly to apply only to customs and revenue duties.  Its first clause deals exclusively with customs and tax duties and, between the first and second clauses, it refers two more times to customs and tax.  See <em>Gutierrez</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 254\xe2\x80\x93255; <em>A-Mark, Inc</em>. v. <em>United States Secret Serv. Dept. of Treasury</em>, 593 F.\xc2\xa02d 849, 851 (CA9 1978) (Tang, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe clauses both dwell exclusively on customs and taxes, except for the final reference to other law-enforcement officers\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, \xc2\xa72680(c) provides that there will be immunity only where there has been a \xe2\x80\x9cdetention\xe2\x80\x9d of goods, merchandise, or property.  \xe2\x80\x9c[D]etention\xe2\x80\x9d is defined by legal and nonlegal dictionaries alike as a \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cforced,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpunitive\xe2\x80\x9d containment.  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed. 1999) (compulsory); American Heritage Dictionary 494 (4th ed. 2000) (forced or punitive).  The issue whether petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s property was \xe2\x80\x9cdetained\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the statute was not raised in this case; and so the Court leaves for another day the exception\xe2\x80\x99s applicability to these facts.  See <em>ante, </em>at 4, n.\xc2\xa02.  It is important, however, to bear in mind that, in the context of detention of goods by customs and tax agents, it will be the rare case when property is voluntarily turned over, rather than forcibly appropriated; indeed, customs and tax agents are in the regular business of seizing and forfeiting property, as are law enforcement agents acting in the capacity of revenue enforcement.

On the other hand, the majority of the nine federal statutes other than \xc2\xa72680(c) containing a reference to the detention of goods, merchandise, or other property are specific to customs and excise.  Compare 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71499(a) (authorizing customs agents to examine and detain imported merchandise); \xc2\xa71595a(c)(3) (authorizing customs officials to detain merchandise introduced contrary to law); 26 U.

At the very least, it demonstrates that \xe2\x80\x9cdetention\xe2\x80\x9d will be a difficult concept to apply case-by-case under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute\xe2\x80\x94a problem alleviated by limiting the statute to customs and tax.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d runs contrary to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98our duty \xe2\x80\x9cto give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading renders \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s] of customs or excise\xe2\x80\x9d mere surplusage, as there would have been no need for Congress to have specified that officers of customs and officers of excise were immune if they indeed were subsumed within the allegedly all-encompassing \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d officer clause.  See <em>Circuit City Stores, </em>532 U. S., at 114.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, though the final reference to \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d does result in some ambiguity, the legislative history, by virtue of its exclusive reference to customs and excise, confirms that Congress did not shift its attention from the context of revenue enforcement when it used these words at the end of the statute.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946) (in discussing 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c) referring only to \xe2\x80\x9cthe detention of goods by customs officers\xe2\x80\x9d); A. Holtzoff, Report on Proposed Federal Tort Claims Bill 16 (1931) (noting that the property-detention exception was added to the legislation to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude immunity from liability in respect of loss in connection with the detention of goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction reads the exception to defeat the central purpose of the statute, an interpretative danger the Court has warned against in explicit terms.  See <em>Kosak</em>, 465 U. S., at 854, n.\xc2\xa09 (the Court must identify only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98those circumstances which are within the words and reason of the exception\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94no less and no more\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Dalehite</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/15/index.html">346 U. S. 15</a>, 31 (1953)).  It is difficult to conceive that the FTCA, which was enacted by Congress to make the tort liability of the United States \xe2\x80\x9cthe same as that of a private person under like circumstance[s],\xe2\x80\x9d S. Rep. No. 1400, at 32, would allow any officer under any circumstance to detain property without being accountable under the Act to those injured by his or her tortious conduct.  If Congress wanted to say that all law enforcement officers may detain property without liability in tort, including when they perform general law enforcement tasks, it would have done so in more express terms; one would expect at least a reference to law enforcement officers outside the customs or excise context either in the text of the statute or in the legislative history.  In the absence of that reference, the Court ought not presume that the liberties of the person who owns the property would be so lightly dismissed and disregarded.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 2000 amendments do not require a contrary conclusion.  The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA), as applicable here, limits the operation of \xc2\xa72680(c)\xe2\x80\x99s exception.  See \xc2\xa73(a), 114 Stat. 211.  The limitation (<em>i.e.</em> the exception to the exception) applies where there has been an injury or loss of goods and \xe2\x80\x9cthe property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c)(1).  In my view the amendment establishes that officers of customs and excise, and law enforcement officials performing functions traditionally reserved for revenue officers, shall be liable in tort for damage to the property when the owner\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the goods in the end is not forfeited (and when other conditions apply).  And this is so regardless of whether the officer acted under the revenue laws of the United States or, alternatively, another civil or criminal forfeiture provision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of CAFRA for a contrary proposition is premised on the assumption that there is no circumstance in which a customs or excise officer, or a officer acting in such a capacity, would \xe2\x80\x9cenforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 9.  But customs and tax officials, along with law enforcement officers performing customs and tax duties, routinely do just that.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Customs and Border Protection, Seizures and Penalties Links, http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/\ntoolbox/legal/authority_enforce/seizures_penalties.xml  (CBP has \xe2\x80\x9cfull authority to \xe2\x80\xa6 seize merchandise for violation of CBP laws or those of other federal agencies that are enforced by CBP\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the customs laws expressly contemplate forfeitures and seizures of property under nonrevenue provisions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71600 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe procedures [governing seizures of property] set forth in [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71602\xe2\x80\x931619] shall apply to seizures of any property effected by customs officers under any law enforced or administered by the Customs Service unless such law specifies different procedures\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By way of example, a customs or excise official might effect a civil forfeiture of currency or monetary instruments under the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75317(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V); or of counterfeit instruments, illegal music recordings, or firearms under the Contraband Act, 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780302 <em>et seq</em>.  Similarly, a DEA agent assisting a customs official in a border search (and thus acting in a customs capacity) might effect a civil forfeiture of vehicles or goods associated with the drug trade under federal drug laws.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7881; see also, <em>e.g., Formula One Motors, </em>777 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 822\xe2\x80\x93823.  Though acting pursuant to a civil forfeiture law that is not specific to customs and taxes, the DEA agent would be covered by \xc2\xa72680(c)\xe2\x80\x99s exception to the exception because he or she would be acting in a traditional revenue capacity\xe2\x80\x94that of conducting a routine search of persons and effects of persons crossing an international boundary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court counters that the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75317(c), is not \xe2\x80\x9cunrelated to customs or excise\xe2\x80\x9d because it cross-references a requirement for exporting and importing monetary instruments, \xc2\xa75316.  See <em>ante, </em>at 8, n.\xc2\xa05.  But \xc2\xa75316, despite being \xe2\x80\x9c[r]elated\xe2\x80\x9d to customs duties, is part of the federal Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, see \xc2\xa75311 <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), not the United States\xe2\x80\x99 customs laws.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also notes that customs agents have the authority to seize contraband under the customs laws, particularly 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71595a(c)(1).  I do not dispute that customs agents often act under customs laws when seizing property.  My point, which goes unrefuted by the Court, is that it was reasonable for Congress to have specified that customs and excise officers would be covered by the exception to the exception even when acting pursuant to federal laws more generally.  For instance, \xc2\xa71595a(c)(1) applies only where \xe2\x80\x9c[m]erchandise \xe2\x80\xa6 is introduced . . . into the United States contrary to law,\xe2\x80\x9d which appears to target the importation of property subject to duty or entry restrictions.  Title 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c), by contrast, was amended in 2000 to encompass not only the detention of \xe2\x80\x9cgoods or merchandise\xe2\x80\x9d but the detention of all \xe2\x80\x9cproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73(a), 114 Stat. 211.  In circumstances not involving imported \xe2\x80\x9cmerchandise,\xe2\x80\x9d then, the customs official would be acting pursuant to law enforcement authority derived not from the customs laws but, <em>inter alia,</em> the Contraband and Bank Secrecy Acts.  The same is true of noncustoms officers acting in a customs capacity.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the very least this renders the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the views of a subsequent Congress suspect.  We have said \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent acts can shape or focus\xe2\x80\x9d the meaning of a statute.  <em>FDA</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/120/index.html">529 U. S. 120</a>, 143 (2000).  There is no indication, however, that by adding a forfeiture exception to the exception, Congress intended to broaden the scope of the original immunity.  Cf. <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/180/index.html">375 U. S. 180</a>, 199\xe2\x80\x93200 (1963).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the Court does not much rely on the point, perhaps it has concerns respecting suits like the one now before us.  Petitioner sues for lost property valued at about $177.  Law enforcement officers in the federal prison system must take inventory of the property they store,\nand with just under 200,000 persons in the federal\nprison population, see Federal Bureau of Prisons, Weekly Population Report, online at http://www.bop.gov/news/ weekly_report.jsp (reporting 199,342 federal inmates as of January 7, 2008), the burden on the Government to account for missing items of little value could be a substantial one.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are sound reasons, though, for rejecting this concern in interpreting the statute.  To begin with, as already discussed, if it were a congressional objective to give a comprehensive exception to all officers who detain property, Congress most likely would have written a specific provision to address the point, quite apart from the special concerns it had with customs and revenue.  The exception as the Court now interprets it extends not only to trivial detentions, not only to prison officials, not only to those in custody, but to all<em> </em>detentions of property of whatever value held by all law enforcement officials, a reading that simply does not comport with the plain text and context of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, as the Court observed when interpreting another exception that raised the concern of numerous frivolous claims, liability for negligent transmission \xe2\x80\x9cis a risk shared by any business [involved in management of detention facilities],\xe2\x80\x9d including the Government.  <em>Dolan</em>, 546 U. S., at 491.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, there are already in place administrative procedures that must be exhausted before the suit is allowed, diminishing the number of frivolous suits that would be heard in federal court.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under 28 CFR \xc2\xa7543.31(a) (2007), the \xe2\x80\x9cowner of the damaged or lost property\xe2\x80\x9d first must file an FTCA claim with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) regional office; the BOP, in turn, is authorized by statute to settle administrative claims for not more than $1,000, see 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73723(a), which likely encompasses most claims brought by federal prisoners.  Only if the prisoner is \xe2\x80\x9cdissatisfied with the final agency action\xe2\x80\x9d may he or she file suit in an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate U. S. District Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 CFR \xc2\xa7543.32(g).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Congress had intended to give sweeping immunity to all federal law enforcement officials from liability for the detention of property, it would not have dropped this phrase onto the end of the statutory clause so as to appear there as something of an afterthought.  The seizure of property by an officer raises serious concerns for the liberty of our people and the Act should not be read to permit appropriation of property without a remedy in tort by language so obscure and indirect. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, in my view, the judgment of the Court of Appeals ought to be reversed.</p>\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></div><font super="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962584">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nALI V.

See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(c).  But I write separately to emphasize, as Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s dissent itself makes clear, that the relevant context extends well beyond Latin canons and other such purely textual devices.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As with many questions of statutory interpretation, the issue here is not the <em>meaning </em>of the words.  The dictionary meaning of each word is well known.  Rather, the issue is the statute\xe2\x80\x99s <em>scope</em>.  What boundaries did Congress intend to set?  To what circumstances did Congress intend the phrase, as used in <em>this </em>statutory provision, to apply?  The majority answers this question by referring to an amendment that creates an exception for certain forfeitures and by emphasizing the statutory word \xe2\x80\x9cany.\xe2\x80\x9d  As to the amendment, I find Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s counterargument convincing.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  And, in my view, the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d provides no help whatsoever.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d is of no help because all speakers (including writers and legislators) who use general words such as \xe2\x80\x9call,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cany,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnever,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnone\xe2\x80\x9d normally rely upon context to indicate the limits of time and place within which they intend those words to do their linguistic work.  And with the possible exception of the assertion of a universal truth, say by a mathematician, scientist, philosopher, or theologian, such limits almost always exist.  When I call out to my wife, \xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t any butter,\xe2\x80\x9d I do not mean, \xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t any butter in town.\xe2\x80\x9d  The context makes clear to her that I am talking about the contents of our refrigerator.  That is to say, it is context, not a dictionary, that sets the boundaries of time, place, and circumstance within which words such as \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d will apply.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Palmer</em>, 3 Wheat. 610, 631 (1818) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.)

And canons such as <em>ejusdem generis</em> and <em>noscitur a sociis</em> offer help in evaluating the significance of those surrounding words.  Yet that help is limited.  That is because other contextual features can show that Congress intended a phrase to apply more broadly than the immediately surrounding words by themselves suggest.  See <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc.</em> v. <em>Adams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/105/index.html">532 U. S. 105</a>, 138\xe2\x80\x93140 (2001) (Souter, J., dissenting) (finding \xe2\x80\x9cgood reasons\xe2\x80\x9d not to apply <em>ejusdem generis</em> because the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history and purposes make clear that the words \xe2\x80\x9cany other class of workers\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cseamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers\xe2\x80\x9d refer, not just to other transportation<em> </em>workers, but to workers of all kinds including retail store clerks).  It is because canons of construction are not \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9care often countered \xe2\x80\xa6 by some maxim pointing in a different direction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 115 (majority opinion).  And it is because these particular canons simply crystallize what English speakers already know, namely, that lists often (but not always) group together items with similar characteristics. (That is why we cannot, without comic effect, yoke radically different nouns to a single verb, <em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cHe caught three salmon, two trout, and a cold.\xe2\x80\x9d)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, not only the immediately surrounding words but also every other contextual feature supports Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  The textual context includes the location of the phrase within a provision that otherwise exclusively concerns customs and revenue duties.  And the nontextual context includes several features that, taken together, indicate that Congress intended a narrow tort-liability exception related to customs and excise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, drafting history shows that the relevant portion of the bill that became the Federal Tort Claims Act concerned only customs and excise.  Initially, the relevant provision of the bill exempted only claims \xe2\x80\x9carising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, S. 4377, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., p.\xc2\xa04 (1930).  In 1931, a Special Assistant to the Attorney General, Alexander Holtzoff, wrote additional draft language, namely, \xe2\x80\x9cor the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise or <em>any other law enforcement officer</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report on Proposed Federal Tort Claims Bill 2 (1931) (emphasis added).  Holtzoff, in a report to a congressional agency, said that the expanded language sought \xe2\x80\x9cto include immunity from liability in respect of loss in connection with the detention of goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id.,</em> at 16.  Holtzoff explained that the language was suggested by a similar British bill that mentioned only customs and excise officials.  <em>Ibid.</em> (referring to the bill proposed in the Crown Proceedings Committee Report \xc2\xa711(5)(<em>c</em>), pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9318 (Apr. 1927) (Cmd. 2842) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo proceedings shall lie under this section \xe2\x80\xa6 for or in respect of the loss of or any deterioration or damage occasioned to, or any delay in the release of, any goods or merchandise by reason of anything done or omitted to be done by any officer of customs and excise acting as such\xe2\x80\x9d)); see <em>Kosak</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/848/index.html">465 U. S. 848</a>, 857, n.\xc2\xa013 (1984) (While \xe2\x80\x9cthe ideas expressed [in Holtzoff\xe2\x80\x99s report] should not be given great weight in determining the intent of the Legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d at least in some circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to us senseless to ignore entirely the views of [the provision\xe2\x80\x99s] draftsman\xe2\x80\x9d).  And Members of Congress repeatedly referred to the exception as encompassing claims involving customs and excise functions.  See, <em>e.g</em>., H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 2428, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., p.\xc2\xa05 (1940); S. Rep. No. 1196, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p.\xc2\xa07 (1942); H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 2245, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p.\xc2\xa010 (1942); H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1287, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., p.\xc2\xa06 (1945); S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., p.\xc2\xa033 (1946).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, insofar as Congress sought, through the Act\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions, to preclude tort suits against the Government where \xe2\x80\x9cadequate remedies were already available,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kosak</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 858; see S. Rep. No. 1400, <em>supra, </em>at 33; H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1287, <em>supra, </em>at 6 (setting forth that purpose), a limited exception makes sense; a broad exception does not.  Other statutes already provided recovery for plaintiffs harmed by federal officers enforcing customs and tax laws but not for plaintiffs harmed by all other federal officers enforcing most other laws.  See <em>Bazuaye</em> v.<em> United States</em>, 83 F.\xc2\xa03d 482, 485\xe2\x80\x93486 (CADC 1996) (detailing history).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the practical difference between a limited and a broad interpretation is considerable, magnifying the importance of the congressional silence to which Justice Kennedy points, see <em>ante</em>, at 11.  A limited interpretation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d would likely encompass only those law enforcement officers working, say, at borders and helping to enforce customs and excise laws.  The majority instead interprets this provision to include the tens of thousands of officers performing unrelated tasks.  The Justice Department estimates that there are more than 100,000 law enforcement officers, not including members of the armed services.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Federal Law Enforcement Officers, 2004, p.\xc2\xa01 (July 2006).  And although the law\xe2\x80\x99s history contains much that indicates the provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope is limited to customs and excise, it contains <em>nothing at all </em>suggesting an intent to apply the provision more broadly, indeed, to multiply the number of officers to whom it applies by what is likely one or more orders of magnitude.  It is thus not the Latin canons, <em>ejusdem generis</em> and <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>that shed light on the application of the statutory phrase but Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s more pertinent and easily remembered English-language observation that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not \xe2\x80\xa6 hide elephants in mouseholes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a>, 468 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I dissent and I join Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
