Without disputing the validity of his convictions or the INS\' conclusion that he is deportable and therefore subject to mandatory detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c), respondent filed a habeas corpus action challenging \xc2\xa7 1226(c) on the ground that his detention thereunder violated due process because the INS had made no determination that he posed either a danger to society or a flight risk.

In affirming, the Ninth Circuit held that \xc2\xa7 1226(c) violates substantive due process as applied to respondent because he is a lawful permanent resident, the most favored category of aliens. The court rejected the Government\'s two principal justifications for mandatory detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c), discounting the firstensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedingsupon finding that not all aliens detained pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1226(c) would ultimately be deported, and discounting the second-protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens-on the grounds that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondent\'s detention included crimes (such as respondent\'s) that the court did not consider "egregious" or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory detention.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 1226(c), provides that "[t]he Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who" is removable from this country because he has been convicted of one of a specified set of crimes. Respondent is a citizen of the Republic of South Korea. He entered the United States in 1984, at the age of six, and became a lawful permanent resident of the United States two years later. In July 1996, he was convicted of first-degree burglary in state court in California and, in April 1997, he was convicted of a second crime, "petty theft with priors." The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged respondent with being deportable from the United States in light of these convictions, and detained him pending his removal hearing.1 We hold that Congress, justifiably concerned that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers, may require that persons such as respondent be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings.</p><p>Respondent does not dispute the validity of his prior convictions, which were obtained following the full procedural protections our criminal justice system offers. Respondent also did not dispute the INS\' conclusion that he is subject to</p><p>1 App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a; see 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1l01(a)(43)(G), 1227(a)(2) (A)(iii). Section 1226(c) authorizes detention of aliens who have committed certain crimes including, <i>inter alia, </i>any "aggravated felony," \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and any two "crimes involving moral turpitude," \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). Although the INS initially included only respondent\'s 1997 conviction in the charging document, it subsequently amended the immigration charges against him to include his 1996 conviction for first-degree burglary as another basis for mandatory detention and deportation. Brief for Petitioners 3, n. 2 (alleging that respondent\'s convictions reflected two" \'crimes involving moral turpitude\' ").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="514">514</a></p><p>mandatory detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c). See Brief in Opposition 1-2; App. 8-9.2 In conceding that he was deportable, respondent forwent a hearing at which he would have been entitled to raise any nonfrivolous argument available to demonstrate that he was not properly included in a mandatory detention category. See 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 3.19(h)(2)(ii) (2002); <i>Matter </i>of Joseph, 22 1. &amp; N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999).3 Respondent instead filed a habeas corpus action pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California challenging the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 1226(c) itself. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a. He argued that his detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c) violated due process because the INS had made no determination that he posed either a danger to society or a flight risk. <i>Id., </i>at 31a, 33a.</p><p>The District Court agreed with respondent that \xc2\xa7 1226(c)\'s requirement of mandatory detention for certain criminal aliens was unconstitutional. <i>Kim </i>v. <i>Schiltgen, </i>No. C 99-</p><p>2 As respondent explained: "The statute requires the [INS] to take into custody any alien who \'is deportable\' from the United States based on having been convicted of any of a wide range of crimes .... [Respondent] does not challenge INS\'s authority to take him into custody after he finished serving his criminal sentence. His challenge is solely to Section 1226(c)\'s absolute prohibition on his release from detention, even where, as here, the INS never asserted that he posed a danger or significant flight risk." Brief in Opposition 1-2.</p><p>3This <i>"Joseph </i>hearing" is immediately provided to a detainee who claims that he is not covered by \xc2\xa7 1226(c). Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. At the hearing, the detainee may avoid mandatory detention by demonstrating that he is not an alien, was not convicted of the predicate crime, or that the INS is otherwise substantially unlikely to establish that he is in fact subject to mandatory detention. See 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 3. 19(h)(2)(ii) (2002); <i>Matter of Joseph, </i>22 1. &amp; N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999). Because respondent conceded that he was deportable because of a conviction that triggers \xc2\xa7 1226(c) and thus sought no <i>Joseph </i>hearing, we have no occasion to review the adequacy of <i>Joseph </i>hearings generally in screening out those who are improperly detained pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1226(c). Such individualized review is available, however, and JUSTICE SOUTER is mistaken if he means to suggest otherwise.

The District Court therefore granted respondent\'s petition subject to the INS\' prompt undertaking of an individualized bond hearing to determine whether respondent posed either a flight risk or a danger to the community. <i>Id., </i>at 50a. Following that decision, the District Director of the INS released respondent on $5,000 bond.</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p><p><i>Kim </i>v. <i>Ziglar, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/276/523/">276 F.3d 523</a> (2002). That court held that \xc2\xa7 1226(c) violates substantive due process as applied to respondent because he is a permanent resident alien. <i>Id., </i>at 528. It noted that permanent resident aliens constitute the most favored category of aliens and that they have the right to reside permanently in the United States, to work here, and to apply for citizenship. <i>Ibid. </i>The court recognized and rejected the Government\'s two principal justifications for mandatory detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c): (1) ensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedings; and (2) protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens. The Court of Appeals discounted the first justification because it found that not all aliens detained pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1226(c) would ultimately be deported. <i>Id., </i>at 531-532. And it discounted the second justification on the grounds that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondent\'s detention included crimes that the court did not consider "egregious" or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory detention. <i>Id., </i>at 532-533. Respondent\'s crimes of first-degree burglary (burglary of an inhabited dwelling) and petty theft, for instance, the Ninth Circuit dismissed as "rather ordinary crimes." <i>Id., </i>at 538. Relying upon our recent decision in <i>Zadvydas </i>v. <i>Davis, 533 </i>U. S. 678 (2001), the Court of Appeals concluded that the INS had not provided a justification "for no-bail civil detention sufficient to overcome a lawful permanent resident alien\'s liberty interest." 276 F. 3d, at 535.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="516">516</a></p><p>Three other Courts of Appeals have reached the same conclusion.

Congress adopted this provision against a backdrop of wholesale failure by the INS to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens.

Criminal aliens were the fastest growing segment of the federal prison population, already constituting roughly 25% of all federal prisoners, and they formed a rapidly rising share of state prison populations as well. <i>Id., </i>at 6-9. Congress\' investigations showed, however, that the INS could not even <i>identify </i>most deportable aliens, much less locate them and remove them from the country. <i>Id., </i>at 1. One study showed that, at the then-current rate of deportation, it would take 23 years to remove every criminal alien already subject to deportation. <i>Id., </i>at 5. Making matters worse, criminal aliens who were deported swiftly reentered the country illegally in great numbers. <i>Id., </i>at 3.</p><p>The INS\' near-total inability to remove deportable criminal aliens imposed more than a monetary cost on the Nation. First, as Congress explained, "[a]liens who enter or remain in the United States in violation of our law are effectively taking immigration opportunities that might otherwise be extended to others." S. Rep. No. 104-249, p. 7 (1996). Second, deportable criminal aliens who remained in the United States often committed more crimes before being removed. One 1986 study showed that, after criminal aliens were identified as deportable, 77% were arrested at least once more and 45%-nearly half-were arrested multiple times before their deportation proceedings even began.

The Attorney General at the time had broad discretion to conduct individualized bond hearings and to release criminal aliens from custody during their removal proceedings when those aliens were determined not to present an excessive flight risk or threat to society. See 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1252(a) (1982 ed.). Despite this discretion to conduct bond hearings, however, in practice the INS faced severe limitations on funding and detention space, which considerations affected its release determinations. S.

As the dissent explains, the Vera study found that "77% of those [deportable criminal aliens] released on bond" showed up for their removal proceedings. <i>Post, </i>at 565. This finding-that one out of four criminal aliens released on bond absconded prior to the completion of his removal proceedings-is even more striking than the one-in-five flight rate reflected in the evidence before Congress when it adopted \xc2\xa7 1226(c).5 The Vera Institute study strongly supports Congress\' concern that, even with individualized screening, releasing deportable criminal aliens on bond would lead to an unacceptable rate of flight.</p><p>Congress amended the immigration laws several times toward the end of the 1980\'s.

The study did manage to raise the appearance rate for criminal aliens through a supervision program known as the Appearance Assistance Program (AAP). But the AAP study is of limited value. First, the study included only 16 aliens who, like respondent, were released from prison and charged with being deportable on the basis of an aggravated felony. 1 Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program, pp. 33-34, 36 (Aug. 1, 2000). In addition, all 127 aliens in the AAP study were admitted into the study group only after being screened for "strength of family and community ties, appearance rates in prior legal proceedings, and eligibility to apply for a legal remedy." <i>Id., </i>at 13; see also <i>id., </i>at 37. Following this selection process, "supervision staff were in frequent, ongoing communication with participants," <i>id., </i>at 14, through, among other things, required reporting sessions, periodic home visits, and assistance in retaining legal representation, <i>id., </i>at 41-42. And, in any event, respondent seeks an individualized bond hearing, not "community supervision." The dissent\'s claim that criminal aliens released under supervisory conditions are likely to attend their hearings, <i>post, </i>at 565, therefore, is totally beside the point.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="521">521</a></p><p>the Attorney General\'s discretion over custody determinations with respect to deportable aliens who had been convicted of aggravated felonies. See Pub. L. 100-690, Tit. VII, \xc2\xa7 7343(a), 102 Stat. 4470. Then, in 1990, Congress broadened the definition of "aggravated felony," subjecting more criminal aliens to mandatory detention. See Pub. L. 101-649, Tit. V, \xc2\xa7 501(a), 104 Stat. 5048. At the same time, however, Congress added a new provision, 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1252(a)(2)(B) (1988 ed., Supp. II), authorizing the Attorney General to release permanent resident aliens during their deportation proceedings where such aliens were found not to constitute a flight risk or threat to the community. See Pub. L. 101-649, Tit. V, \xc2\xa7 504(a)(5), 104 Stat. 5049.</p><p>During the same period in which Congress was making incremental changes to the immigration laws, it was also considering wholesale reform of those laws. Some studies presented to Congress suggested that detention of criminal aliens during their removal proceedings might be the best way to ensure their successful removal from this country. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>1989 House Hearing 75; Inspection Report, App. 46; S. Rep. 104-48, at 32 ("Congress should consider requiring that all aggravated felons be detained pending deportation. Such a step may be necessary because of the high rate of no-shows for those criminal aliens released on bond"). It was following those Reports that Congress enacted 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1226, requiring the Attorney General to detain a subset of deportable criminal aliens pending a determination of their removability.</p><p>"In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens." <i>Mathews </i>v. <i>Diaz, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/67/case.html">426 U.

Specifically, in his brief on the merits, respondent suggests that he might not be subject to detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c) after all because his 1997 conviction for petty theft with priors might not qualify as an aggravated felony under recent Ninth Circuit precedent. Respondent now states that he intends to argue at his next removal hearing that "his 1997 conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony ... and his 1996 conviction [for first-degree burglary] does not constitute either an aggravated felony or a crime involving moral turpitude."

The detained aliens did not deny that they were members of the Communist Party or that they were therefore deportable. <i>Id., </i>at 530.

T. 1951, No. 35, p. 12 (arguing that legislative determinations could not justify "depriving [an alien] of his liberty without facts personal to the individual"). Although the Attorney General ostensibly had discretion to release detained Communist aliens on bond, the INS had adopted a policy of refusing to grant bail to those aliens in light of what Justice Frankfurter viewed as the mistaken "conception that Congress had made [alien Communists] in effect unbailable." 342 U. S., at 559, 568 (dissenting opinion).</p><p>The Court rejected the aliens\' claims that they were entitled to be released from detention if they did not pose a flight risk, explaining "[d]etention is necessarily a part of this deportation procedure." <i>Id., </i>at 538; see also <i>id., </i>at 535. The Court noted that Congress had chosen to make such aliens deportable based on its "understanding of [Communists\'] attitude toward the use of force and violence ... to accomplish their political aims." <i>Id., </i>at 541. And it concluded that the INS could deny bail to the detainees "by reference to the legislative scheme" even without any finding of flight risk. <i>Id., </i>at 543; see also <i>id., </i>at 550 (Black, J., dissenting) ("Denial [of bail] was not on the ground that if released [the aliens] might try to evade obedience to possible deportation orders"); <i>id., </i>at 551, and n. 6.</p><p>The dissent argues that, even though the aliens in <i>Carlson </i>were not flight risks, "individualized findings of dangerousness were made" as to each of the aliens. <i>Post, </i>at 573 (opinion of SOUTER, J.).

In suggesting that this is a distinction, the dissent ignores the "personal activity" that aliens like respondent have undertaken in committing the crimes that subject them to detention in the first instance-personal activity that has been determined with far greater procedural protections than any finding of "active membership" in the Communist Party involved in <i>Carlson. </i>See 342 U. S., at 530 ("[T]he Director made allegation[s], supported by affidavits, that the Service\'s dossier of each petitioner contained evidence indicating to him that each was at the time of arrest a member of the Communist Party of the United States and had since 1930 participated ... in the Party\'s indoctrination of others"). In the present case, respondent became "deportable" under \xc2\xa7 1226(c) only following criminal convictions that were secured following full procedural protections. These convictions, moreover, reflect "personal activity" that Congress considered relevant to future dangerousness.

S. 292</a> (1993), the Court considered another due process challenge to detention during deportation proceedings. The due process challenge there was brought by a class of alien juveniles. The INS had arrested them and was holding them in custody pending their deportation hearings. The aliens challenged the INS\' policy of releasing detained alien juveniles only into the care of their parents, legal guardians, or certain other adult relatives. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>id., at 297 (citing Detention and Release of Juveniles, 53 Fed. Reg. 17449 (1988) (codified as to deportation at 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 242.24 (1992))). The aliens argued that the policy improperly relied "upon a \'blanket\' presumption of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents, close relatives, and guardians" to care for the detained juvenile aliens. 507 U. S., at 313. In rejecting this argument, the Court emphasized that "reasonable presumptions and generic rules," even when made by the INS rather than Congress, are not necessarily impermissible exercises of Congress\' traditional power to legislate with respect to aliens. <i>Ibid.; </i>see also <i>id., </i>at 313-314 ("In the case of each detained alien juvenile, the INS makes those determinations that are specific to the individual and necessary to accurate application of the regulation .... The particularization and individuation need go no further than this"). Thus, as with the prior challenges to detention during deportation proceedings, the Court in <i>Flores </i>rejected the due process challenge and upheld the constitutionality of the detention.</p><p>Despite this Court\'s longstanding view that the Government may constitutionally detain deportable aliens during the limited period necessary for their removal proceedings, respondent argues that the narrow detention policy reflected in 8 U.

S. 678</a> (2001).</p><p>In <i>Zadvydas, </i>the Court considered a due process challenge to detention of aliens under 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1231 (1994 ed., Supp. V), which governs detention following a final order of removal. Section 1231(a)(6) provides, among other things, that when an alien who has been ordered removed is not in fact removed during the 90-day statutory "removal period," that alien "may be detained beyond the removal period" in the discretion of the Attorney General. The Court in <i>Zadvydas </i>read \xc2\xa7 1231 to authorize continued detention of an alien following the 90-day removal period for only such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the alien\'s removal. 533 U.

The Court thus held that the detention there did not serve its purported immigration purpose. <i>Ibid. </i>In so holding, the Court rejected the Government\'s claim that, by detaining the aliens involved, it could prevent them from fleeing prior to their removal. The Court observed that where, as there, "detention\'s goal is no longer practically attainable, detention no longer bears a reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual was committed." <i>Ibid. </i>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).lO</p><p>In the present case, the statutory provision at issue governs detention of deportable criminal aliens <i>pending their</i></p><p>10 The dissent denies this point, insisting that the detention at issue in <i>Zadvydas </i>actually did bear a reasonable relation to its immigration purpose. <i>Post, </i>at 561 (opinion of SOUTER, J.)

Respondent disagrees, arguing that there is no evidence that mandatory detention is necessary because the Government has never shown that individualized bond hearings would be ineffective. See Brief for Respondent 14. But as discussed above, see <i>supra, </i>at 519-520, in adopting \xc2\xa7 1226(c), Congress had before it evidence suggesting that permitting discretionary release of aliens pending their removal hearings would lead to large numbers of deportable criminal aliens skipping their hearings and remaining at large in the United States unlawfully.</p><p>Respondent argues that these statistics are irrelevant and do not demonstrate that individualized bond hearings "are ineffective or burdensome." Brief for Respondent 33-40. It is of course true that when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 1226, individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions, or tested in all their possible permutations. But when the Government deals with deportable aliens, the Due Process Clause does not require it to employ the least burdensome means to accomplish its goal. The evidence Congress had before it certainly supports the approach it selected even if other, hypothetical studies might have suggested different courses of action.

The INS therefore established the Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) (subsequently subsumed under the "Institutional Removal Program"). By 1997, the General Accounting Office found that nearly half of all deportable criminal aliens\' cases were completed through the IHP prior to the aliens\' release from prison. See General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims of the House Committee on the Judiciary, INS\' Efforts to Remove Imprisoned Aliens Continue to Need Improvement 10, Fig. 1 (Oct. 1998). The report urged, however, that the INS needed to improve its operations in order to complete removal proceedings against all deportable criminal aliens before their release. <i>Id., </i>at 13.

I cannot join Part I because I believe that 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1226(e) unequivocally deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to set aside "any action or decision" by the Attorney General in detaining criminal aliens under \xc2\xa7 1226(c) while removal proceedings are ongoing. That is precisely the nature of the action before us.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>I begin with the text of the statute:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The Attorney General\'s discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be subject to review. No court may set aside <i>any action or decision </i>by the Attorney General under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole." \xc2\xa7 1226(e) (emphasis added).</p></blockquote><p>There is no dispute that after respondent\'s release from prison in 1999, the Attorney General detained him "under this section," i. <i>e., </i>under \xc2\xa7 1226. And, the action of which respondent complains is one "regarding the detention or release of a[n] alien or the grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole." \xc2\xa7 1226(e). In my view, the only plausible reading of \xc2\xa7 1226(e) is that Congress intended to prohibit federal courts from "set[ting] aside" the Attorney General\'s decision</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="534">534</a></p><p>Opinion of O\'CONNOR, J.</p><p>to deem a criminal alien such as respondent ineligible for release during the limited duration of his or her removal proceedings.</p><p>I recognize both the "strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action" and our "longstanding rule requiring a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction." <i>INS </i>v. <i>St. Cyr, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/case.html">533 U. S. 289</a>, 298 (2001). I also acknowledge that Congress will not be deemed to have repealed habeas jurisdiction in the absence of a specific and unambiguous statutory directive to that effect. See <i>id., </i>at 312-313; <i>Ex parte Yerger, </i>8 Wall. 85, 105 (1869). Here, however, the signal sent by Congress in enacting \xc2\xa7 1226(e) could not be clearer: <i>"No court </i>may set aside <i>any action or decision ... </i>regarding the detention or release of any alien." (Emphasis added.) There is simply no reasonable way to read this language other than as precluding all review, including habeas review, of the Attorney General\'s actions or decisions to detain criminal aliens pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1226(c).</p><p>In <i>St. Cyr, </i>the Court held that certain provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) do not strip federal courts of their jurisdiction to review an alien\'s habeas claim that he or she is eligible for a waiver of deportation. 533 U. S., at 312. I dissented in that case, and continue to believe it was wrongly decided. Nothing in <i>St. Cyr, </i>however, requires that we ignore the plain language and clear meaning of \xc2\xa7 1226(e).</p><p>In <i>St. Cyr, </i>the Court stressed the significance of Congress\' use of the term "judicial review" in each of the jurisdictionallimiting provisions at issue. In concluding that Congress had not intended to limit habeas jurisdiction by limiting "judicial review," the Court reasoned as follows:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The term \'judicial review\' or \'jurisdiction to review\' is the focus of each of these three provisions. In the im-</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="535">535</a></p><blockquote><p>\nmigration context, \'judicial review\' and \'habeas corpus\' have historically distinct meanings. See <i>Heikkila </i>v. <i>Barber, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/229/case.html">345 U. S. 229</a> (1953). In <i>Heikkila, </i>the Court concluded that the finality provisions at issue \'preclud[ed] judicial review\' to the maximum extent possible under the Constitution, and thus concluded that the [Administrative Procedure Act] was inapplicable. <i>Id., </i>at 235. Nevertheless, the Court reaffirmed the right to habeas corpus. <i>Ibid. </i>Noting that the limited role played by the courts in habeas corpus proceedings was far narrower than the judicial review authorized by the AP A, the Court concluded that \'it is the scope of inquiry on habeas corpus that differentiates\' habeas review from \'judicial review.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 311-312.</p></blockquote><p>In this case, however, \xc2\xa7 1226(e) does not mention any limitations on "judicial review." To be sure, the first sentence of \xc2\xa7 1226(e) precludes "review" of the Attorney General\'s "discretionary judgment[s]" to detain aliens under \xc2\xa7 1226(c). But the second sentence is not so limited, and states unequivocally that "[n]o court may set aside any action or decision" to detain an alien under \xc2\xa7 1226(c). It cannot seriously be maintained that the second sentence employs a term of art such that "no court" does not really mean "no court," or that a decision of the Attorney General may not be "set aside" in actions filed under the Immigration and Naturalization Act but may be set aside on habeas review.</p><p>Congress\' use of the term "Judicial review" as the title of \xc2\xa7 1226(e) does not compel a different conclusion. As the Court stated in <i>St. Cyr, </i>"a title alone is not controlling," <i>id., </i>at 308, because the title of a statute has no power to give what the text of the statute takes away. Where as here the statutory text is clear, "\'the title of a statute ... cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.\'" <i>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections </i>v. <i>Yeskey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/524/206/case.html">524 U.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 2241. See 533 U. S., at 313, n. 36. This statutory silence spoke volumes, the Court reasoned, in light of the "historic use of \xc2\xa7 2241 jurisdiction as a means of reviewing deportation and exclusion orders," <i>ibid. </i>In contrast, there is no analogous history of routine reliance on habeas jurisdiction to challenge the detention of aliens without bail pending the conclusion of removal proceedings. We have entertained such challenges only twice, and neither was successful on the merits. See <i>Reno </i>v. <i>Flores, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/292/case.html">507 U.

See also Neuman, Habeas Corpus, Executive Detention, and the Removal of Aliens, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 961, 1067, n. 120 (1998) (distinguishing detention pursuant to a final order of removal from the interlocutory detention at issue here). Congress\' failure to mention \xc2\xa7 2241 in this context therefore lacks the significance that the Court accorded Congress\' silence on the issue in <i>St. Cyr. </i>In sum, nothing in <i>St. Cyr </i>requires us to interpret 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1226(e) to mean anything other than what its plain language says.</p><p>I recognize that the two Courts of Appeals that have considered the issue have held that \xc2\xa7 1226(e) does not preclude habeas claims such as respondent\'s. See <i>Patel </i>v. <i>Zemski, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/275/299/">275 F.3d 299</a> <i>(CA3 </i>2001); <i>Parra </i>v. <i>Perryman, </i>172 F. 3d <i>954 </i><i>(CA7 </i>1999). In <i>Parra, </i>the Seventh Circuit held that \xc2\xa7 1226(e) does not bar "challenges to \xc2\xa7 1226(c) itself, as opposed to decisions implementing that subsection." <i>Id., </i>at 957. Though the Court\'s opinion today relies heavily on this distinction, I see no basis for importing it into the plain language of the statute.</p><p>The Seventh Circuit sought support from our decision in <i>Reno </i>v. <i>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 </i>U. S. 471 (1999) <i>(AADC), </i>but our holding there supports my reading of \xc2\xa7 1226(e). In <i>AADC, </i>the Court construed a statute that sharply limits review of claims "arising from the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="537">537</a></p><p>decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this [Act]." 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1252(g) (1994 ed., Supp. III). The Court concluded that this provision imposes jurisdictional limits only on claims addressing one of the three "\'decision[s] or action[s]\'\'\' specifically enumerated in the statute. <i>AADC, supra, </i>at 482. Nowhere in <i>AADC </i>did the Court suggest, however, that the statute\'s jurisdictional limits might not apply depending on the particular grounds raised by an alien for challenging the Attorney General\'s decisions or actions in these three areas. <i>AADC </i>therefore provides no support for imposing artificial limitations on the broad scope of 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1226(e).</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Because \xc2\xa7 1226(e) plainly deprives courts of federal habeas jurisdiction over claims that mandatory detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c) is unconstitutional, one could conceivably argue that such a repeal violates the Suspension Clause, which provides as follows: "The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 2. The clarity of \xc2\xa7 1226(e)\'s text makes such a question unavoidable, unlike in <i>St. Cyr, </i>where the Court invoked the doctrine of constitutional doubt and interpreted the relevant provisions of AEDPA and IIRIRA not to repeal habeas jurisdiction. <i>St. Cyr, supra, </i>at 314; see also <i>Seminole Tribe of Fla. </i>v. <i>Florida, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/517/44/case.html">517 U. S. 44</a>, 57, n. 9 (1996) (where the text of a statute is clear, the "preference for avoiding a constitutional question" cannot be invoked to defeat the plainly expressed intent of Congress).</p><p>In my view, any argument that \xc2\xa7 1226(e) violates the Suspension Clause is likely unavailing. <i>St. Cyr </i>held that "at the absolute minimum, the Suspension Clause protects the writ \'as it existed in 1789.\'" 533 U. S., at 301 (quoting <i>Felker </i>v. <i>Turpin, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/518/651/case.html">518 U. S. 651</a>, 663-664 (1996)).

Nonetheless, historical evidence suggests that respondent would not have been permitted to challenge his temporary detention pending removal until very recently. Because colonial America imposed few restrictions on immigration, there is little case law prior to that time about the availability of habeas review to challenge temporary detention pending exclusion or deportation. See <i>St. Cyr, supra, </i>at 305. The English experience, however, suggests that such review was not available:</p><blockquote><p>\n"In England, the only question that has ever been made in regard to the power to expel aliens has been whether it could be exercised by the King without the consent of Parliament. It was formerly exercised by the King, but in later times by Parliament, which passed several acts on the subject between 1793 and 1848. Eminent English judges, sitting in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, have gone very far in supporting the exclusion or expulsion, by the executive authority of a colony, of aliens having no absolute right to enter its territory or to remain therein." <i>Fong Yue Ting </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/149/698/case.html">149 U. S. 698</a>, 709 (1893) (citations omitted).</p></blockquote><p>In this country, Congress did not pass the first law regulating immigration until 1875. See 18 Stat. (pt. 3) 477. In the late 19th century, as statutory controls on immigration tightened, the number of challenges brought by aliens to Government deportation or exclusion decisions also increased. See <i>St. Cyr, supra, </i>at 305-306. Because federal immigration laws from 1891 until 1952 made no express provision for judicial review, what limited review existed took the form of pe-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="539">539</a></p><p>titions for writs of habeas corpus. See, <i>e. g., Ekiu </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/142/651/case.html">142 U. S. 651</a> (1892); <i>Fong Yue Ting </i>v. <i>United States, supra; The Japanese Immigrant Case, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/189/86/case.html">189 U.

Though the Court was willing to entertain these habeas challenges to Government exclusion and deportation decisions, in no case did the Court question the right of immigration officials to temporarily detain aliens while exclusion or deportation proceedings were ongoing.</p><p>By the mid-20th century, the number of aliens in deportation proceedings being released on parole rose considerably. See, <i>e. g., Carlson </i>v. <i>Landon, </i>342 U. S., at 538, n. 31. Nonetheless, until 1952 habeas corpus petitions remained the only means by which deportation orders could be challenged. <i>Heikkila </i>v. <i>Barber, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/229/case.html">345 U. S. 229</a>, 236-237 (1953). Under this regime, an alien who had been paroled but wished to challenge a final deportation order had to place himself in Government custody before filing a habeas petition challenging the order. <i>Bridges </i>v. <i>Wixon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/135/case.html">326 U. S. 135</a>, 140 (1945). Given this, it is not surprising that the Court was not faced with numerous habeas claims brought by aliens seeking release from detention pending deportation.</p><p>So far as I am aware, not until 1952 did we entertain such a challenge. See <i>Carlson </i>v. <i>Landon, supra. </i>And there, we reaffirmed the power of Congress to order the temporary detention of aliens during removal proceedings. <i>Id., </i>at 538. In <i>Reno </i>v. <i>Flores, </i>we likewise rejected a similar challenge to such detention. And, <i>Flores </i>was a wide-ranging class action in which 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2241 was but one of several statutes invoked as the basis for federal jurisdiction. 507 U. S., at 296. All in all, it appears that in 1789, and thereafter until very recently, the writ was not generally available to aliens to challenge their detention while removal proceedings were ongoing.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="540">540</a></p><p>Opinion of SOUTER, J.</p><p>Because a majority of the Court has determined that jurisdiction exists over respondent\'s claims, I need not conclusively decide the thorny question whether 8 U.

The Court\'s holding that the Constitution permits the Government to lock up a lawful permanent resident of this country when there is concededly no reason to do so forgets over a century of precedent acknowledging the rights of permanent residents, including the basic liberty from physical confinement lying at the heart of due process. The INS has never argued that detaining Kim is necessary to guarantee his appearance for removal2 proceedings or to protect anyone from danger in the meantime. Instead, shortly after the District Court issued its order in this case, the INS, <i>sua sponte </i>and without even holding a custody hearing, concluded that Kim "would not be considered a threat" and that any risk of flight could be met by a bond of $5,000. App. 11-13. He was released soon thereafter, and there is no indication that he is not complying with the terms of his release.</p><p>The Court\'s approval of lengthy mandatory detention can therefore claim no justification in national emergency or any risk posed by Kim particularly.

Challenges to removability itself, and applications for relief from removal, are usually submitted in the first instance to an immigration judge. See 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1229a(a)(3). The Immigration Judge had not yet held an initial hearing on the substantive issue of removability when Kim filed his habeas petition in the District Court, even though Kim had been detained for over three months under \xc2\xa7 1226(c). If Kim\'s habeas corpus petition had claimed "that he himself was not \'deportable,\'" as the Court suggests it should have, <i>ante, </i>at 522, the District Court would probably have dismissed the claim as unexhausted. <i>E. g., Espinal </i>v. <i>Filion, </i>No. 00-CIV-2647-HB-JCF, 2001 WL 395196 (SDNY, Apr. 17, 2001).

To suggest, as the Court seems to do, that an alien has conceded removability simply because he does not dispute that he has been charged with facts that will render him removable if those facts are later proven is like saying that a civil defendant has conceded liability by failing to move to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or that a criminal defendant has conceded guilt by failing to dispute the validity of the indictment. But even if the Court\'s reasoning were sound, it would not cover Kim\'s situation, for he has stated (and the Court acknowledges) his intent to contest the sufficiency of his criminal convictions as a basis for removal. <i>Ante, </i>at 522-523, n. 6.

The immigration laws give LPRs the opportunity to establish a life permanently in this country by developing economic, familial, and social ties indistinguishable from those of a citizen.

S. 715</a>, 738 (1972) ("At the least, due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed").</p><p>The substantive demands of due process necessarily go hand in hand with the procedural, and the cases insist at the least on an opportunity for a detainee to challenge the reason claimed for committing him. <i>E. g., Hendricks, supra, </i>at 357 (stating that civil commitment was permitted where "the confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards"); <i>Foucha, supra, </i>at 81-82 (invalidating a statute under which "the State need prove nothing to justify continued detention"); <i>Salerno, supra, </i>at 751 ("[T]he procedures by which a judicial officer evaluates the likelihood of future dangerousness are specifically designed to further the accuracy of that determination"); <i>Addington, supra, </i>at 427 (requiring a heightened burden of proof "to impress the factfinder with the importance of the decision and thereby perhaps to reduce the chances that inappropriate commitments will be ordered").</p><p>These cases yield a simple distillate that should govern the result here. Due process calls for an individual determination before someone is locked away. In none of the cases cited did we ever suggest that the government could avoid the Due Process Clause by doing what \xc2\xa7 1226(c) does, by selecting a class of people for confinement on a categorical basis and denying members of that class any chance to dispute the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="552">552</a></p><p>Opinion of SOUTER, J.</p><p>necessity of putting them away. The cases, of course, would mean nothing if citizens and comparable residents could be shorn of due process by this sort of categorical sleight of hand. Without any "full-blown adversary hearing" before detention, <i>Salerno, supra, </i>at 750, or heightened burden of proof, <i>Addington, supra, </i>or other procedures to show the government\'s interest in committing an individual, <i>Foucha, supra; Jackson, supra, </i>procedural rights would amount to nothing but mechanisms for testing group membership. Cf. <i>Foucha, supra, </i>at 88 (opinion of O\'CONNOR, J.) ("Nor would it be permissible to treat all acquittees alike, without regard for their particular crimes"). And if procedure could be dispensed with so expediently, so presumably could the substantive requirements that the class of detainees be narrow and the detention period strictly limited. <i>Salerno, supra; Hendricks, supra.</i></p><p align="center">\nC</p><p>We held as much just two Terms ago in <i>Zadvydas </i>v. <i>Davis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/678/case.html">533 U. S. 678</a> (2001), which stands for the proposition that detaining an alien requires more than the rationality of a general detention statute; any justification must go to the alien himself. <i>Zadvydas </i>considered detention of two aliens, Zadvydas and Ma, who had already been ordered removed and therefore enjoyed no lawful immigration status. Their cases arose because actual removal appeared unlikely owing to the refusal of their native countries to accept them, with the result that they had been detained not only for the standard 90-day removal period, during which time most removal orders are executed, but beyond that period because the INS considered them to be a "\'risk to the community\'\'\' and "\'unlikely to comply with the order of removal.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 682 (quoting 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V)). Zadvydas and Ma challenged their continued and potentially indefinite detention under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="553">553</a></p><p>The <i>Zadvydas </i>opinion opened by noting the clear applicability of general due process standards: physical detention requires both a "special justification" that "outweighs the \'individual\'s constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint\'" and "adequate procedural protections." 533 U. S., at 690 (quoting <i>Hendricks, </i>521 U. S., at 356). Nowhere did we suggest that the "constitutionally protected liberty interest" in avoiding physical confinement, even for aliens already ordered removed, was conceptually different from the liberty interest of citizens considered in <i>Jackson, Salerno, Foucha, </i>and <i>Hendricks. </i>On the contrary, we cited those cases and expressly adopted their reasoning, even as applied to aliens whose right to remain in the United States had already been declared forfeited. <i>Zadvydas, </i>533 U. S., at 690.</p><p>Thus, we began by positing commonly accepted substantive standards and proceeded to enquire into any "special justification" that might outweigh the aliens\' powerful interest in avoiding physical confinement "under [individually ordered] release conditions that may not be violated." <i>Id., </i>at 696. We found nothing to justify the Government\'s position. The statute was not narrowed to a particularly dangerous class of aliens, but rather affected "aliens ordered removed for many and various reasons, including tourist visa violations." <i>Id., </i>at 691. The detention itself was not subject to "stringent time limitations," <i>Salerno, supra, </i>at 747, but was potentially indefinite or even permanent, <i>Zadvydas, 533 </i>U. S., at 691. Finally, although both Zadvydas and Ma appeared to be dangerous, this conclusion was undermined by defects in the procedures resulting in the finding of dangerousness. <i>Id., </i>at 692. The upshot was such serious doubt about the constitutionality of the detention statute that we construed it as authorizing continuing detention only when an alien\'s removal was "reasonably foreseeable." <i>Id., </i>at 699. In the cases of Zadvydas and Ma, the fact that their countries of citizenship were not willing to accept their return weighed</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="554">554</a></p><p>Opinion of SOUTER, J.</p><p>against the Government\'s interest in keeping them at hand for instant removal, even though both were serious flight risks, <i>id., </i>at 684-686,690, and we remanded the cases to the Courts of Appeals for a determination of the sufficiency of the Government\'s interests in Zadvydas\'s and Ma\'s individual detention, <i>id., </i>at 702.</p><p>Our individualized analysis and disposition in <i>Zadvydas </i>support Kim\'s claim for an individualized review of his challenge to the reasons that are supposed to justify confining him prior to any determination of removability. In fact, aliens in removal proceedings have an additional interest in avoiding confinement, beyond anything considered in <i>Zadvydas: </i>detention prior to entry of a removal order may well impede the alien\'s ability to develop and present his case on the very issue of removability. See Brief for Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice et al. as <i>Amici Curiae 20-23. </i>After all, our recognition that the serious penalty of removal must be justified on a heightened standard of proof, <i>Woodby </i>v. <i>INS, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/276/case.html">385 U. S. 276</a> (1966), will not mean all that much when the INS can detain, transfer, and isolate aliens away from their lawyers, witnesses, and evidence. Cf. <i>Stack </i>v. <i>Boyle, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html">342 U. S. 1</a>, 4 (1951). Kim\'s right to defend against removal gives him an even stronger claim than the aliens in <i>Zadvydas </i>could raise.</p><p>In fact, the principal dissenters in <i>Zadvydas, </i>as well as the majority, accepted a theory that would compel success for Kim in this case. The dissent relied on the fact that Zadvydas and Ma were subject to a "final order of removal" and had "no right under the basic immigration laws to remain in this country," 533 U. S., at 720 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), in distinguishing them "from aliens with a lawful right to remain here," <i>ibid., </i>which is Kim\'s position. The dissent recognized the right of all aliens, even "removable and inadmissible" ones, to be "free from detention that is arbitrary or capricious," <i>id., </i>at 721, and the opinion explained that detention would pass the "arbitrary or capricious" test "when</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="555">555</a></p><p>necessary to avoid the risk of flight or danger to the community," <i>ibid.</i>10</p><p>Hence the <i>Zadvydas </i>dissent\'s focus on "whether there are adequate procedures" allowing "persons once subject to detention to show that through rehabilitation, new appreciation of their responsibilities, or under other standards, they no longer present special risks or danger if put at large." <i>Ibid.; </i>see also <i>id., </i>at 722-723. Indeed, there is further support for Kim\'s claim in the dissent\'s view that the process afforded to removable aliens like Zadvydas and Ma "[went] far toward thee] objective" of satisfying procedural due process, <i>id., </i>at 722; 11 that process stands in stark contrast to the total ab-</p><p>10 In support of its standard, the dissent relied on a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which likewise countenanced detention only "in cases of <i>necessity" </i>and stated, under a heading entitled "Guideline 3: Exceptional Grounds for Detention":</p><p>"There should be a presumption against detention. Where there are monitoring mechanisms which can be employed as viable alternatives to detention, (such as reporting obligations or guarantor requirements ... ), these should be applied <i>first </i>unless there is evidence to suggest that such an alternative will not be effective in the individual case. Detention should therefore only take place after a full consideration of all possible alternatives, or when monitoring mechanisms have been demonstrated not to have achieved the lawful and legitimate purpose." United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Revised Guidelines on Applicable Criteria and Standards Relating to the Detention of Asylum Seekers (Feb. 1999) (hereinafter Detention Guidelines) (emphasis in original), cited in <i>Zadvydas, </i>533 U. S., at 721 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p><p>The High Commissioner also referred to the "minimum procedural guarante[e]" for a detainee "either personally or through a representative, to challenge the necessity of the deprivation of liberty at the review hearing, and to rebut any findings made." Detention Guidelines, Guideline 5: Procedural Safeguards.</p><p>11 The scheme considered in <i>Zadvydas </i>did not provide review immediately after the removability determination; the dissent noted that custody review hearings usually occurred within three months of a transfer to a postorder detention unit, with further reviews annually or more frequently if the alien requested them. 533 U. S., at 722-723. But the lag was fitted to the circumstances. In the usual case, removal in fact would</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="556">556</a></p><p>Opinion of SOUTER, J.</p><p>sence of custody review available in response to Kim\'s claim that he is neither dangerous nor a flight risk.12 The removable aliens in <i>Zadvydas </i>had the right to a hearing, to representation, and to consideration of facts bearing on risk of flight, including criminal history, evidence of rehabilitation, and ties to the United States. <i>Ibid. </i>The references to the "necessity" of an individual\'s detention and the discussion of the procedural requirements show that the principal <i>Zadvydas </i>dissenters envisioned due process as individualized review, and the Court of Appeals in this case correctly held that Kim\'s mandatory detention without benefit of individualized enquiry violated due process as understood by both the <i>Zadvydas </i>majority and JUSTICE KENNEDY in dissent. <i>Kim </i>v. <i>Ziglar, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/276/523/">276 F.3d 523</a>, 535-537 (CA9 2002).

Dec. 799 (BIA 1999), is no response to this deficiency. As the Court notes, the" <i>\'Joseph </i>hearing\'" only permits an alien to show that he does not meet the statutory criteria for mandatory detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c). <i>Ante, </i>at 514, and n. 3. Kim argues that, even assuming that he fits under the statute, the statute\'s application to LPRs like him does not fit under the Due Process Clause.</p><p>JUSTICE KENNEDY recognizes that the Due Process Clause requires "an individualized determination as to [an LPR\'s] risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention [becomes] unreasonable or unjustified." <i>Ante, </i>at 532 (concurring opinion). It is difficult to see how Kim\'s detention in this case is anything but unreasonable and unjustified, since the Government concedes that detention is not necessary to completion of his removal proceedings or to the community\'s protection. Certainly the fact that "there is at least some merit to the [INS\'s] charge" that Kim should be held to be removable, <i>ante, </i>at 531, does not establish a compelling reason for detention. The INS releases many noncriminal aliens on bond or on conditional parole under \xc2\xa7 1226(a)(2) pending removal proceedings, and the fact that Kim has been convicted of criminal offenses does not on its own justify his detention, see <i>supra, </i>at 550-553.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="557">557</a></p><p>an LPR under \xc2\xa7 1226(c) after <i>Zadvydas </i>reached the same conclusion. 13</p><p align="center">\nD</p><p>In sum, due process requires a "special justification" for physical detention that "outweighs the individual\'s constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint" as well as "adequate procedural protections." <i>Zadvydas, </i>533 U. S., at 690-691 (internal quotation marks omitted). "There must be a \'sufficiently compelling\' governmental interest to justify such [an] action, usually a punitive interest in imprisoning the convicted criminal or a regulatory interest in forestalling danger to the community." <i>Flores, 507 </i>U. S., at 316 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring) (quoting <i>Salerno, 481 </i>U. S., at 748). The class of persons subject to confinement must be commensurately narrow and the duration of confinement limited accordingly. <i>Zadvydas, supra, </i>at 691; <i>Hendricks, </i>521 U. S., at 368; <i>Foucha, </i>504 U. S., at 81-82; <i>Salerno, supra, </i>at 747, 750. JUSTICE KENNEDY\'S dissenting view in <i>Zadvydas, </i>like that of the majority, disapproved detention that is not "necessary" to counter a risk of flight or danger; it is "arbitrary or capricious" and violates the substantive component of the Due Process Clause. 533 U. S., at 721. Finally, procedural due process requires, at a minimum, that a detainee have the benefit of an impartial decisionmaker able to consider particular circumstances on the issue of necessity. <i>Id., </i>at 691-692; <i>id., </i>at 722 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); <i>Foucha, supra, </i>at 81; <i>Salerno, supra, </i>at 750.

"[H]eightened, substantive due process scrutiny," <i>Flores, supra, </i>at 316 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring), uncovers serious infirmities in \xc2\xa7 1226(c). Detention is not limited to dangerous criminal aliens or those found likely to flee, but applies to all aliens claimed to be deportable for criminal convictions, even where the underlying offenses are minor. <i>E. g., Michel </i>v. <i>INS, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/206/253/">206 F.3d 253</a>, 256 <i>(CA2 </i>2000) (possession of stolen bus transfers); <i>Matter of Bart, </i>20 1. &amp; N. Dec. 436 (BIA 1992) (issuance of a bad check). Detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c) is not limited by the kind of time limit imposed by the Speedy Trial Act, and while it lasts only as long as the removal proceedings, those proceedings have no deadline and may last over a year. See Brief for Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>23-26; see also <i>id., </i>at 10-20 (citing examples). Section 1226(c) neither requires nor permits an official to determine whether Kim\'s detention was necessary to prevent flight or danger.</p><p>Kim\'s detention without particular justification in these respects, or the opportunity to enquire into it, violates both components of due process, and I would accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals requiring the INS to hold a bail hearing to see whether detention is needed to avoid a risk of flight or a danger to the community.14 This is surely little enough, given the fact that 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1536 gives an LPR charged with being a foreign terrorist the right to a release hearing pending a determination that he be removed.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>The Court proceeds to the contrary conclusion on the premise that "the Government may constitutionally detain</p><p>14 Although Kim is a convicted criminal, we are not concerned here with a State\'s interest in punishing those who violate its criminal laws.

Sometimes, maybe often, it may, but that is not the point in contention. Kim has never challenged the INS\'s general power to detain aliens in removal proceedings or even its power to detain him in particular, if it affords him a chance to participate in an enquiry whether he poses a flight risk or a danger to society.</p><p>The question, rather, is whether Congress has chosen "\'a constitutionally permissible means of implementing\' [its immigration] power." <i>Zadvydas, supra, </i>at 695 (quoting <i>INS </i>v. <i>Chadha, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html">462 U. S. 919</a>, 941-942 (1983)); see also <i>Carlson </i>v. <i>Landon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/524/case.html">342 U. S. 524</a>, 537 (1952) (stating that the deportation power "is, of course, subject to judicial intervention under the \'paramount law of the Constitution\' "). As in <i>Zadvydas, </i>we are here concerned not with the power to remove aliens but with the "important constitutionallimitations" on that power\'s exercise. <i>Zadvydas, supra, </i>at 695.15</p><p>15 The Court\'s citations to <i>Wong Wing </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/163/228/case.html">163 U. S. 228</a> (1896), are therefore inapposite. <i>Ante, </i>at 523, 531. In <i>Wong Wing, </i>we hypothesized that detention "necessary to give effect" to the removal of an alien "would be valid"; the use of the subjunctive mood makes plain that the issue was not before the Court. 163 U. S., at 235. <i>Wong Wing </i>certainly did not hold that detention in aid of removal was exempt from the Due Process Clause.</p><p>Moreover, the <i>Wong Wing </i>dictum must be understood in light of the common contemporary practice in the federal courts of releasing aliens on bail pending deportation proceedings. While the Court is correct that the first statutory provision permitting Executive officials to release aliens on bond was enacted in 1907, <i>ante, </i>at 523, n. 7, the Court ignores the numerous judicial grants of bail prior to that year. See, <i>e. g., United States ex rel. Turner </i>v. <i>Williams, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/194/279/case.html">194 U.

While there are differences between detention pending removal proceedings (this case) and detention after entry of a removal order <i>(Zadvydas), </i>the differences merely point up</p><p>bail pending an investigation into the lawfulness of their residence within the United States, and before any order for deportation has been made"); <i>In re Ah Tai, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F7/125/5/">125 F.7d 5</a>, 796-797 (Mass. 1903) (identifying a practice in several federal districts admitting aliens to bail, both before an initial finding of deportability and during the appeal therefrom); <i>In re Chow Goo Pooi, </i>25 F. 77, 78 <i>(CC </i>Cal. 1884). The breadth of this practice is evident from one court\'s statement that "[tJo hold bail altogether inadmissible ... would invalidate hundreds of existing recognizances." <i>Ah Tai, supra, </i>at 797.</p><p>As Judge Augustus Hand later noted, the only change in 1907 was that bail decisions were committed to the discretion of Executive officials, rather than judges:</p><p>"Prior to the passage by Congress in 1907 of the act empowering the administrative official to fix bail, various courts made it a practice to grant bail to aliens during deportation hearings .... In our opinion that act was intended to place the general determination of granting bail in the hands of the authorities charged with the enforcement of the deportation laws as persons ordinarily best qualified to perform such a function .... " <i>United States ex rel. Potash </i>v. <i>District Director of Immigration and Naturalization, </i>169 F.2d 747, 751 <i>(CA2 </i>1948) (citations omitted).</p><p>Thus, while <i>Wong Wing </i>stated in passing that detention may be used where it was "part of the means necessary" to the removal of aliens, 163 U. S., at 235, that statement was written against the background of the general availability of judicial relief from detention pending deportation proceedings.</p><p>The judicial grants of bail prior to 1907 arose in federal habeas proceedings. Contrary to JUSTICE O\'CONNOR\'S objection to federal jurisdiction in this matter, there is indeed a "history of routine reliance on habeas jurisdiction to challenge the detention of aliens without bail pending the conclusion of removal proceedings." <i>Ante, </i>at 536 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="561">561</a></p><p>that Kim\'s is the stronger claim, see <i>supra, </i>at 554-556. In any case, the analytical framework set forth in <i>Salerno, Foucha, Hendricks, Jackson, </i>and other physical confinement cases applies to both, and the two differences the Court relies upon fail to remove Kim\'s challenge from the ambit of either the earlier cases or <i>Zadvydas </i>itself.16</p><p>First, the Court says that \xc2\xa7 1226(c) "serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings." <i>Ante, </i>at 528. Yes it does, and the statute in <i>Zadvydas, </i>viewed outside the context of any individual alien\'s detention, served the purpose of preventing aliens ordered to be deported from fleeing prior to actual deportation. In each case, the fact that a statute serves its purpose in general fails to justify the detention of an individual in particular. Some individual aliens covered by \xc2\xa7 1226(c) have meritorious challenges to removability or claims for relief from removal. See Brief for Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>10-20. As to such aliens, as with Zadvydas and Ma, the Government has only a weak reason under the immigration laws for detaining them.</p><p>The Court appears to respond that Congress may require detention of removable aliens based on a general conclusion that detention is needed for effective removal of criminal aliens on a class-wide basis. But on that logic <i>Zadvydas </i>should have come out the other way, for detention of the entire class of aliens who have actually been ordered removed will in general "serv[e] the purpose" of their effective removal, <i>ante, </i>at 528. Yet neither the Court nor JUSTICE KENNEDY in dissent suggested that scrutiny under the Due Process Clause could be satisfied at such a general level. Rather, we remanded the individual cases of Zadvydas and Ma for determinations of the strength of the Government\'s</p><p>16 The Court tellingly does not even mention <i>Salerno, Foucha, Hendricks, </i>or <i>Jackson.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="562">562</a></p><p>Opinion of SOUTER, J.</p><p>reasons for detaining them in particular. 533 U. S., at 702.17 We can insist on nothing less here, since the Government\'s justification for detaining individuals like Zadvydas and Ma, who had no right to remain in this country and were proven flight risks and dangers to society, <i>id., </i>at 684-686, is certainly stronger (and at least no weaker) than its interest in detaining a lawful permanent resident who has not been shown (or even claimed) to be either a flight risk or a threat to the community.18</p><p>The Court\'s closest approach to a reason justifying classwide detention without exception here is a Senate Report stating that over 20% of nondetained criminal aliens failed</p><p>17The Court is therefore mistaken in suggesting that I view the detention of the individual aliens in <i>Zadvydas </i>as serving a governmental purpose. <i>Ante, </i>at 527, n. 10. The Court confuses the "statute in <i>Zadvydas, </i>viewed outside the context of any individual alien\'s detention," <i>supra, </i>at 561, with the "detention at issue in <i>Zadvydas," ante, </i>at 527, n. 10, namely, the detention of Zadvydas and Ma as individuals. The due process analysis in <i>Zadvydas </i>concentrated on the latter, holding that the detention of Zadvydas and Ma would not serve a legitimate immigration purpose if there were no "significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future." 533 U. S., at 701. Thus, the Court\'s suggestion in this case that "the statutory provision" authorizes "detention" that prevents deportable aliens from fleeing as a general matter, <i>ante, </i>at 527-528, is no sufficient basis for claiming <i>Zadvydas </i>as support for the Court\'s methodology or result. Rather, the Court should consider whether the detention of Kim as an individual is necessary to a compelling Government interest, just as it did for the detention of Zadvydas and Ma as individuals. As the Government concedes, Kim\'s individual detention serves no Government purpose at all.</p><p>18 Nor can the general risk of recidivism, <i>ante, </i>at 518-519, justify this measure. The interest in preventing recidivism may be vindicated "by the ordinary criminal processes involving charge and conviction, the use of enhanced sentences for recidivists, and other permissible ways of dealing with patterns of criminal conduct." <i>Foucha </i>v. <i>Louisiana, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/71/case.html">504 U. S. 71</a>, 82 (1992). The ability to detain aliens in removal proceedings who pose threats to the community also satisfies this interest. Cf. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Salerno, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/739/case.html">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987). The alternative to detention, of course, is not unrestricted liberty, but supervised release, which also addresses the risk of recidivism. <i>Zadvydas, </i>533 U.

No. 104-48 (1995) (hereinafter Senate Report)). To begin with, the Senate Report\'s statistic treats all criminal aliens alike and does not distinguish between LPRs like Kim, who are likely to have developed strong ties within the United States, see <i>supra, </i>at 544-547, and temporary visitors or illegal entrants. Even more importantly, the statistic tells us nothing about flight risk at all because, as both the Court and the Senate Report recognize, the INS was making its custody determinations not on the ground of likelihood of flight or dangerousness, but "in large part, according to the number of beds available in a particular region." Senate Report 23, cited <i>ante, </i>at 519; see also H. R. Rep. No. 104-469, p. 124 (1995) (hereinafter House Report) ("[I]n deciding to release a deportable alien, the INS is making a decision that the alien cannot be detained given its limited resources"); App. 26-27. This meant that the INS often could not detain even the aliens who posed serious flight risks. Senate Report 23 (noting that the INS had only 3,500 detention beds for criminal aliens in the entire country and the INS district comprising Pennsylvania, Delaware, and West Virginia had only 15). The desperate lack of detention space likewise had led the INS to set bonds too low, because "if the alien is not able to pay, the alien cannot be released, and a needed bed space is lost." House Report 124. The Senate Report also recognized that, even when the INS identifies a criminal alien, the INS "often refuses to take action because of insufficient agents to transport prisoners, or because of limited detention space." Senate Report 2. Four former high-ranking INS officials explained the Court\'s statistics as follows: "Flight rates were so high in the early 1990s not as a result of chronic discretionary judgment failures by [the] INS in assessing which aliens might pose a flight risk. Rather, the rates were alarmingly high because decisions to release aliens in proceedings were driven over-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="564">564</a></p><p>Opinion of SOUTER, J.</p><p>whelmingly by a lack of detention facilities." Brief for T. Alexander Aleinikoff et al. as <i>Amici Curiae 19.</i></p><p>The Court\'s recognition that, at the time of the enactment of \xc2\xa7 1226(c), "individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions" is thus rather an understatement. <i>Ante, </i>at 528. The Court does not explain how the INS\'s resource-driven decisions to release individuals who pose serious flight risks, and their predictable failure to attend removal hearings, could justify a systemwide denial of any opportunity for release to individuals like Kim who are neither flight risks nor threats to the public.</p><p>The Court also cites a report by the Department of Justice relied upon by the Government. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Immigration and N aturalization Service, Deportation of Aliens After Final Orders Have Been Issued, Rep. No. 1-96-03 (Mar. 1996), App. 14 (hereinafter Post-Order Report), cited <i>ante, </i>at 519, 521. But that report does not even address the issue of detention before a determination has been made that an alien is removable. As its title indicates, the Post-Order Report analyzed removal rates only for aliens who had already received final orders of removability. 19 See also Post-Order Report, App. 25 ("This current review was limited to actions taken by INS to remove aliens after [immigration judges or the Board of Immigration Appeals] had issued final orders").2o</p><p>19 Detention of such aliens is governed by the statute at issue in <i>Zadvydas, </i>\xc2\xa7 1231(a), not by \xc2\xa7 1226(c).</p><p>20 A prior study by the same body noted that nonappearance rates by aliens in deportation proceedings before issuance of orders to deport (aliens, that is, like Kim) were approximately 23% for the first half of 1993 and 21% for all of 1992. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Case Hearing Process in the Executive Office for Immigration Review, Rep. No. 1-93-03, p. 5 (May 1994) (hereinafter Case Hearing Report). Congress appears to have considered these relevant figures, Senate Report 2 ("Over 20 percent of nondetained criminal aliens fail to appear for deportation proceedings"), without referring to irrelevant postorder numbers. The Government relied on the Post-Order Report</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="565">565</a></p><p>More relevant to this case, and largely ignored by the Court, is a recent study conducted at the INS\'s request concluding that 92% of criminal aliens (most of whom were LPRs) who were released under supervisory conditions attended all of their hearings. 1 Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program, pp. ii, 33, 36 (Aug. 1, 2000) (hereinafter Vera Institute Study). Even without supervision, 82% of criminal aliens released on recognizance showed up, as did 77% of those released on bond, leading the reporters to conclude that "supervision was especially effective for criminal aliens" and that "mandatory detention of virtually all criminal aliens is not necessary." <i>Id., </i>at ii, <i>36,42.21</i></p><p>in its brief and at oral argument. Brief for Petitioners 7, 19-20, and n. 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. The Government did not cite the Case Hearing Report.</p><p>21 The Court throws in minor criticisms of the Vera Institute Study that have no bearing on its relevance here. The institute\'s supervised release program included 127 criminal aliens who would be subject to mandatory detention under \xc2\xa7 1226(c) because of their criminal histories. Vera Institute Study 33. Since the INS seeks Kim\'s removal on the grounds of either crimes of moral turpitude or an aggravated felony, see <i>ante, </i>at 513, n. 1, the fact that most of the Vera Institute Study\'s subjects were convicted of crimes of moral turpitude but not an aggravated felony, <i>ante, </i>at 520, n. 5, is of no moment. Nor were all of the aliens studied subject to intensive supervision, <i>ibid.; </i>most were subject to "regular supervision," which involved no mandatory reporting sessions beyond an initial orientation session with supervision staff and required only that the alien keep the staff apprised of a current mailing address, appear in court, and comply with the orders of the immigration judge, Vera Institute Study 17-18. That the institute considered various screening criteria before authorizing supervised release, <i>ante, </i>at 520, n. 5, does not undermine the value of the study, since any program adopted by the INS in lieu of mandatory detention could do the same. Cf. <i>Zadvydas, </i>533 U. S., at 696. Finally, the fact that Kim sought and was granted release on bond rather than supervised release, <i>ante, </i>at 520, n. 5, does not detract from the relevance of the Vera Institute Study. Regardless of what methods the INS decides to employ to prevent flight, the study supports the conclusion that mandatory deten-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="566">566</a></p><p>Opinion of SOUTER, J.</p><p>The Court nowhere addresses the Vera Institute\'s conclusion that criminal aliens released under supervisory conditions are overwhelmingly likely to attend their hearings. Instead, the Court fixes on the fact that 23% of the comparison group of aliens released on bond failed to attend all of their hearings. <i>Ante, </i>at 519-520. Since the bond determinations were made by the INS, the fact remains that resource-driven concerns may well have led the INS to release individuals who were evident flight risks on bonds too low to ensure their attendance. See <i>supra, </i>at 563-564. The Court\'s assumption that the INS\'s bond determinations involved "individualized screening" for flight risk, <i>ante, </i>at 520, finds no support in the Vera Institute Study. Thus the Court\'s reliance on the failure rate of aliens released by the INS on bond, whether it comes from the Senate Report or the Vera Institute Study, <i>ante, </i>at 519-520, does not support its conclusion.</p><p>In sum, the Court\'s inapposite statistics do not show that detention of criminal LPRs pending removal proceedings, even on a general level, is necessary to ensure attendance at removal hearings, and the Vera Institute Study reinforces the point by establishing the effectiveness of release under supervisory conditions, just as we did in <i>Zadvydas. 533 </i>U. S., at 696 (noting that imprisonment was constitutionally suspect given the possibility of "supervision under release conditions that may not be violated").22 The Court\'s first attempt to distinguish <i>Zadvydas </i>accordingly fails.</p><p>tion under \xc2\xa7 1226(c) is "not necessary" to prevent flight, Vera Institute Study 42, and therefore violates the Due Process Clause.</p><p>22 This case accordingly presents no issue of "\'court ordered release,\'" <i>ante, </i>at 530, n. 14 (quoting <i>Zadvydas, supra, </i>at 713 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)); in this case, for example, the INS reached its own determination to release Kim on bond. This case concerns only the uncontroversial requirement that detention serve a compelling governmental interest and that detainees be afforded adequate procedures ensuring against erroneous confinement. <i>E. g., Salerno, </i>481 U.

Ante, </i>at 528. While it is true that removal proceedings are unlikely to prove "indefinite and potentially permanent," 533 U. S., at 696, they are not formally limited to any period, and often extend beyond the time suggested by the Court, that is, "an average time of 47 days" or, for aliens who exercise their right of appeal, "an average of four months," <i>ante, </i>at 529; see also Case Hearing Report 12 (finding that the average time from receipt of charging documents by a detained alien to a final decision by the immigration judge was 54 days). Even taking these averages on their face, however, they are no legitimate answer to the due process claim to individualized treatment and hearing.</p><p>In the first place, the average time from receipt of charging documents to decision obscures the fact that the alien may receive charging documents only after being detained for a substantial period. Kim, for example, was not charged until five weeks after the INS detained him. Brief for Respondent 9.</p><p>Even more revealing is an explanation of the raw numbers that are averaged out. As the Solicitor General conceded, the length of the average detention period in great part reflects the fact that the vast majority of cases involve aliens who raise no challenge to removability at all.

Successful challenges often require several months of proceedings, see Brief for Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice et al. as <i>Amici </i>Curiae 10-20; detention for an open-ended period like this falls far short of the "stringent time limitations" held to be significant in <i>Salerno, </i>481 U.

The potential for several months of confinement requires an individualized finding of necessity under <i>Zadvydas.</i>24</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>The Court has failed to distinguish <i>Zadvydas </i>in any way that matters. It does no better in its effort to portray its result in this case as controlled by <i>Carlson </i>v. <i>Landon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/524/case.html">342 U. S. 524</a> (1952), and <i>Reno </i>v. <i>Flores, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/292/case.html">507 U. S. 292</a> (1993).</p><p>23 Criminal aliens whose "removal proceedings are completed while [they are] still serving time for the underlying conviction," <i>ante, </i>at 529, are irrelevant to this case, since they are never detained pending removal proceedings under \xc2\xa7 1226(c).</p><p>24 The Court calls several months of unnecessary imprisonment a "very limited time," <i>ante, </i>at 529, n. 12. But the due process requirement of an individualized finding of necessity applies to detention periods shorter than Kim\'s. <i>Schall </i>v. <i>Martin, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/253/case.html">467 U. S. 253</a> (1984), involved a maximum detention period of 17 days, <i>id., </i>at 270, yet our due process analysis noted that the detainee was entitled to a hearing in which he could challenge the necessity of his confinement before an impartial decisionmaker required to state the facts and reasons underlying any decision to detain, <i>id., </i>at 276277. The 90-day removal period in \xc2\xa7 1231(a)(1) not only has a fixed endpoint, but also applies only after the alien has been adjudged removable, \xc2\xa7 1231(a)(1)(B). The discussion of that provision in <i>Zadvydas </i>cannot be read to indicate any standard of permissible treatment of an LPR who has not yet been found removable.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="569">569</a></p><p><i>Carlson </i>did not involve mandatory detention. It involved a system similar to the one Kim contends for here. The aliens\' detention pending deportation proceedings in <i>Carlson </i>followed a decision on behalf of the Attorney General that custody was preferable to release on bond or on conditional parole. 342 U. S., at 528, n. 5 (citing Internal Security Act of 1950, \xc2\xa7 23, 64 Stat. 1011). We sustained that decision because we found that the District Director of the INS, to whom the Attorney General had delegated the authority, did not abuse his discretion in concluding that "evidence of membership [in the Communist Party] plus personal activity in supporting and extending the Party\'s philosophy concerning violence" made the aliens "a menace to the public interest." 342 U. S., at 541. The significance of looking to "personal activity" in our analysis was complemented by our express recognition that there was "no evidence or contention that all persons arrested as deportable ... for Communist membership are denied bail," <i>id., </i>at 541-542, and by a Government report showing that in fact "the large majority" of aliens arrested on charges comparable to the <i>Carlson </i>petitioners\' were allowed bail. <i>Id., </i>at 542; see also <i>id., </i>at 538, n. 31 (noting that it was "quite clear" that "detention without bond has been the exception").</p><p>Indeed, the <i>Carlson </i>Court\'s constitutional analysis relying on the opportunity for individualized bond determinations simply followed the argument in the brief for the United States in that case. In response to the aliens\' argument that the statute made it "mandatory on the Attorney General to deny bail to alien communists," the Government stated, "[w]e need not consider the constitutionality of such a law for that is not what the present law provides."

Walter) (emphasis added in Brief for Respondent in <i>Carlson </i>v. <i>Landon, supra)).</i></p></blockquote><p>In short, <i>Carlson </i>addressed a very different scheme from the one here.</p><p>It is also beside the point for the Court to suggest that "like respondent in the present case," the <i>Carlson </i>petitioners challenged their detention because "there had been no finding that they were unlikely to appear for their deportation proceedings." <i>Ante, </i>at 524. Each of them was detained after being found to be "a menace to the public interest," 342 U. S., at 541, and their challenge, unlike Kim\'s, was that the INS had locked them up for an impermissible reason (danger to society) whereas only a finding of risk of flight would have justified detention. <i>Id., </i>at 533-534 ("It is urged ... that where there is no evidence to justify a fear of unavailability for the hearings or for the carrying out of a possible judgment of deportation, denial of bail under the circumstances of these cases is an abuse of discretion"); see also <i>id., </i>at 551 (Black, J., dissenting) ("A power to put in jail because dangerous cannot be derived from a power to deport").25</p><p>25 Similarly, the question presented in <i>Butterfield </i>v. <i>Zydok, </i>argued and decided together with <i>Carlson, </i>was "[w]hether, in exercising his discretion to grant or withhold bail pending final determination of the deportability</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="571">571</a></p><p>We rejected that contention, leaving the petitioners in detention because they were dangerous to the public interest, and on that issue, an official had determined that the <i>Carlson </i>petitioners ought to be detained. Here, however, no impartial decisionmaker has determined that detaining Kim is required for any purpose at all, and neither the Government nor the Court even claims such a need.</p><p>For the same reason it is beside the point to note that the unsuccessful <i>Carlson </i>petitioners\' brief raised a claim that detention without reference to facts personal to their individual cases would violate the Due Process Clause. <i>Ante, </i>at 524. As the United States pointed out in its own <i>Carlson </i>brief, that issue was never presented, since the District Director\'s exercise of discretion was based on individualized determinations that the petitioners were dangerous to society. See <i>supra, </i>at 570.26 Nor is the Court entitled to invoke <i>Carlson </i>by saying that the INS "had adopted a policy of refusing to grant bail" to alien Communists, which made the Attorney General\'s discretion to release aliens on bond merely "ostensibl[e]." <i>Ante, </i>at 524. The <i>Carlson </i>Court found that "[t]here is no evidence or contention that all per-</p><p>of an alien, the Attorney General is justified in denying bail on the ground that the alien is an active participant in Communist Party affairs, or whether he is bound also to consider other circumstances, particularly the likelihood that the alien will report as ordered." Pet. for Cert. in <i>Butter</i><i>field </i>v. <i>Zydok, </i>O. T. 1951, No. 136, p. 2.</p><p>26 While a prior conviction may sometimes evidence a risk of future danger, it is not conclusive in all cases, and Kim is a good example, given that the Government found that he "would not be considered a threat." App. 13. Indeed, the Court acknowledges that convictions are only "relevant to" dangerousness, <i>ante, </i>at 525, n. 9; it does not state that they compel a finding of danger in all cases. As even the <i>Zadvydas </i>dissent recognized, due process requires that detained criminal aliens be given an opportunity to rebut the necessity of detention by showing "that through rehabilitation, new appreciation of their responsibilities, or under other standards, they no longer present special risks or danger if put at large." 533 U. S., at 721 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="572">572</a></p><p>Opinion of SOUTER, J.</p><p>sons arrested as deportable ... for Communist membership are denied bail." 342 U. S., at 541-542.</p><p>The Court refuses to accept the opinion of the <i>Carlson </i>Court and the representations made in the successful brief for the Government in that case. The Court not only fails to acknowledge the actual holding of <i>Carlson; </i>it improperly adopts as authority statements made in dissent. The Court\'s emphatic assertion that "[t]here was no \'individualized findin[gJ\' of likely future dangerousness as to any of the aliens," <i>ante, </i>at 525, rests entirely on opinions voiced in dissent, although the Court only mentions this fact in a footnote, <i>ante, </i>at 525, n. 8 (citing 342 U. S., at 549, 550, n. 5, 552 (Black, J., dissenting), and <i>id., </i>at 567 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting)). Statements made in dissent do not override the <i>Carlson </i>Court\'s express finding that the petitioners in that case were found to be not only members of the Communist Party, but "active in Communist work" and to "a degree, minor perhaps in [one] case, [participants] in Communist activities." <i>Id., </i>at 541.27</p><p>Moreover, the <i>Carlson </i>dissenters did not suggest that no individualized determinations had occurred; rather, they contended that the District Director\'s individual findings of dangerousness were unsupported by sufficient reliable evidence. See <i>id., </i>at 549-550 (Black, J., dissenting) (arguing that the aliens were not in fact "\'dangerous\'" at all); <i>id., </i>at 552 (arguing that danger findings were based on "the rankest hearsay evidence" instead of the INS being "required to prove" that the detainee was dangerous); <i>id., </i>at 555-556 (arguing that activity within the Communist movement did not make the aliens "dangerous"); <i>id., </i>at 566-567 (Frankfurter, J.,</p><p>27 In the footnote immediately following its citation of dissenting opinions, the Court cites a passage from the <i>Carlson </i>majority opinion confirming that the <i>Carlson </i>petitioners\' detention rested on the "allegation, supported by affidavits, that the [INS\'s] dossier of each petitioner contained evidence" of Communist Party membership and activities "to the prejudice of the public interest." 342 U. S., at 530 (quoted <i>ante, </i>at 525, n. 9).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="573">573</a></p><p>dissenting) (arguing that evidence of Communist party membership was "insufficient to show danger"; that evidence of some aliens\' activities was stale; and that the history of treatment of the aliens involved forced him to conclude that the Attorney General was not actually exercising discretion on an individual basis).28 And even if the <i>Carlson </i>dissenters were factually correct, all that would show is that the <i>Carlson </i>Court was misled (by the Government, no less) into deciding the case on the basis that individualized findings of dangerousness were made. Given that the <i>Carlson </i>Court clearly believed that it was deciding a case in which individualized determinations occurred, it is serious error for this Court to treat <i>Carlson </i>as deciding a case in which they did not.</p><p>Finally, the Court gets no help from the isolated passages of the <i>Carlson </i>opinion that it quotes. Although the <i>Carlson </i>Court stated that detention was "\'a part\'" of deportation procedure, <i>ante, </i>at 524 (quoting <i>Carlson, </i>342 U. S., at 538), it nowhere said that detention was part of every deportation proceeding. Instead, it acknowledged that "the far larger part" of aliens deportable on "subversive charges" were re-</p><p>28 Justice Black\'s dissenting statement that one of the aliens was" \'not likely to engage in any subversive activities,\'" 342 U. S., at 549, does not amount to a "specific finding of nondangerousness," <i>ante, </i>at 525. On the contrary, the Court expressly stated that the Government could prove dangerousness based on "personal activity" in the Communist Party; it simply was not required to go so far as to show "specific acts of sabotage or incitement to subversive action." <i>Carlson, supra, </i>at 541. Thus while there was no finding of "subversive action," there certainly was a finding of "danger," albeit one that Justice Black found unconvincing.</p><p>Likewise, Justice Frankfurter\'s statement in dissent that the Solicitor General of the United States had "advised" that "it has been the Government\'s policy ... to terminate bail" for aliens awaiting deportation who were "present active Communists," 342 U. S., at 568, is difficult to reconcile with the contrary statements in both the majority opinion and the United States\'s brief in <i>Carlson, </i>see <i>supra, </i>at 569-572. Whatever its basis, Justice Frankfurter\'s reference to a "policy" of bail denials does not bear the weight that the Court places upon it today.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="574">574</a></p><p>Opinion of SOUTER, J.</p><p>leased on "modest bonds or personal recognizances" pending their deportation proceedings. <i>Id., </i>at 538, n. 31. Contrary to the Court\'s holding today, the <i>Carlson </i>Court understood that discretion to admit to bail was necessary, since "[o]f course [a] purpose to injure [the United States] could not be imputed generally to all aliens subject to deportation." <i>Id., </i>at 538. It was only in this light that the Court said that the INS could "justify [its] refusal of bail by reference to the legislative scheme to eradicate the evils of Communist activity"; the Court was referring to the INS\'s power to detain on a finding that a given alien was engaged in Communist activity that threatened society. <i>Id., </i>at 543. The Court nowhere addressed, much less approved, the notion that the INS could justify, or that Congress could compel, an individual\'s detention without any determination at all that his detention was necessary to some Government purpose. And if there was ever any doubt on this point, it failed to survive our subsequent, unanimous recognition that the detention scheme in <i>Carlson </i>required "some level of individualized determination" as a precondition to detention. <i>INS </i>v. <i>National Center for Immigrants\' Rights, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/183/case.html">502 U. S. 183</a>, 194-195 (1991); see also <i>Flores, </i>507 U. S., at 313. <i>Carlson </i>stands at odds with the Court\'s outcome in this case.</p><p align="center">\n2</p><p>The Court\'s paragraph on <i>Flores, supra, </i>is no more help to it. Like <i>Carlson, Flores </i>did not involve mandatory detention, and the INS regulation at issue in <i>Flores </i>actually required that alien juveniles be released pending removal proceedings unless the INS determined that detention was required" \'to secure [the juvenile\'s] timely appearance before the [INS] or the immigration court or to ensure the juvenile\'s safety or that of others.\'\'\' 507 U. S., at 297 (quoting 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 242.24(b)(1) (1992)). Again, Kim agrees that such a system is constitutional and contends for it here. <i>Flores </i>turned not on the necessity of detention, but on the regulation\'s restric-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="575">575</a></p><p>tion that alien juveniles could only be released to the custody of the juvenile\'s parent, legal guardian, or another specified adult relative. Even this limitation, however, was subject to exception for releasing a juvenile to another person in " \'unusual and compelling circumstances and in the discretion of the [INS] district director or chief patrol agent.\'" 507 U.

Since" \'[l]egal custody\' rather than \'detention\' more accurately describes the reality of the arrangement" in <i>Flores, </i>507 U.

The issue is whether that power may be exercised by detaining a still lawful permanent resident alien when there is no reason for it and no way to challenge it. The Court\'s holding that the Due Process Clause allows this under a blanket rule is devoid of even ostensible justification in fact and at odds with the settled standard of liberty. I respectfully dissent.</p><p>JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p><p>I agree with the majority that the courts have jurisdiction, and I join Part I of its opinion. If I believed (as the majority apparently believes, see <i>ante, </i>at 513-514, and n. 3) that Kim had conceded that he is deportable, then I would conclude that the Government could detain him without bail for the few weeks ordinarily necessary for formal entry of a removal order. Brief for Petitioners 39-40; see <i>ante, </i>at 528-531. Time limits of the kind set forth in <i>Zadvydas </i>v. <i>Davis, 533 </i>U.

See <i>id., </i>at 300; see also <i>id., </i>at 318-319 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring) (pointing out the substantive due process analysis at <i>id., </i>at 301-306, and the procedural due process analysis at <i>id., </i>at 306-309).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="577">577</a></p><p>seems to me the rough equivalent of the entry of an order of removal. See <i>id., </i>at 699-701 (reading the statute, under constitutional compulsion, as commonly imposing a presumption of a 6-month "reasonable" time limit for post-removalorder detention).</p><p>This case, however, is not one in which an alien concedes deportability. As JUSTICE SOUTER points out, Kim argues to the contrary. See <i>ante, </i>at 541-542 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Kim claims that his earlier convictions were neither for an "\'aggravated felony\'\'\' nor for two crimes of "\'moral turpitude.\'\'\' Brief for Respondent 3, 11-12, 31-32, and n. 29. And given shifting lower court views on such matters, I cannot say that his arguments are insubstantial or interposed solely for purposes of delay. See, <i>e. g., United States </i>v. <i>Corona-Sanchez, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/291/1201/">291 F.3d 1201</a>, 1213 <i>(CA9 </i>2002) (petty theft with a prior not an "aggravated felony"). Compare <i>Omagah </i>v. <i>Ashcroft, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/288/254/">288 F.3d 254</a>, 259 <i>(CA5 </i>2002) (" \'Moral turpitude refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base, vile, or depraved\' "), with <i>Guarneri </i>v. <i>Kessler, </i>98 F.2d 580, <i>580-581 (CA5 </i>1938) ("Moral turpitude" involves" \'[a]nything done contrary to justice, honesty, principle or good morals\' "), and <i>Quilodran-Brau </i>v. <i>Holland, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/232/183/">232 F.2d 183</a>, 184 <i>(CA3 </i>1956) ("The borderline of \'moral turpitude\' is not an easy one to locate").</p><p>That being so-as long as Kim\'s legal arguments are neither insubstantial nor interposed solely for purposes of delay-then the immigration statutes, interpreted in light of the Constitution, permit Kim (if neither dangerous nor a flight risk) to obtain bail. For one thing, Kim\'s constitutional claims to bail in these circumstances are strong. See <i>ante, </i>at 548-552, 557-558 (SOUTER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Indeed, they are strong enough to require us to "ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the [constitutional] question may</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="578">578</a></p><p>Opinion of BREYER, J.</p><p>be avoided." <i>Crowell </i>v. <i>Benson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html">285 U. S. 22</a>, 62 (1932); accord, <i>Zadvydas, supra, </i>at 689.</p><p>For another, the relevant statutes literally say nothing about an individual who, armed with a strong argument against deportability, might, or might not, fall within their terms. Title 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1226(c) tells the Attorney General to "take into custody any alien who ... <i>is </i>deportable" (emphasis added), not one who may, or may not, fall into that category. Indeed, the Government now permits such an alien to obtain bail if his argument against deportability is significantly <i>stronger </i>than substantial, i. <i>e., </i>strong enough to make it "substantially unlikely" that the Government will win. <i>Matter of Joseph, </i>22 1. &amp; N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999). Cf. 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 3.19(h)(2)(ii) (2002).</p><p>Finally, bail standards drawn from the criminal justice system are available to fill this statutory gap. Federallaw makes bail available to a criminal defendant after conviction and pending appeal provided (1) the appeal is "not for the purpose of delay," (2) the appeal "raises a substantial question of law or fact," and (3) the defendant shows by "clear and convincing evidence" that, if released, he "is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety" of the community. 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3143(b). These standards give considerable weight to any special governmental interest in detention <i>(e. g., </i>process-related concerns or class-related flight risks, see <i>ante, </i>at 528). The standards are more protective of a detained alien\'s liberty interest than those currently administered in the Immigration and Naturalization Service\'s <i>Joseph </i>hearings. And they have proved workable in practice in the criminal justice system. Nothing in the statute forbids their use when \xc2\xa7 1226(c) deportability is in doubt.</p><p>I would interpret the (silent) statute as imposing these bail standards. Cf. <i>Zadvydas, supra, </i>at 698; <i>United States </i>v. <i>Witkovich, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/194/case.html">353 U. S. 194</a>, 201-202 (1957); <i>Kent </i>v. <i>Dulles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/116/case.html">357 U. S. 116</a>, 129 (1958). So interpreted, the statute would require the Government to permit a detained alien to seek</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="579">579</a></p><p>an individualized assessment of flight risk and dangerousness as long as the alien\'s claim that he is not deportable is (1) not interposed solely for purposes of delay and (2) raises a question of "law or fact" that is not insubstantial. And that interpretation, in my view, is consistent with what the Constitution demands. I would remand this case to the Ninth Circuit to determine whether Kim has raised such a claim.</p><p>With respect, I dissent from the Court\'s contrary disposition.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
