S. ___, this Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and struck down a District of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the home.  Chicago (hereinafter City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, have laws effectively banning handgun possession by almost all private citizens.  After <em>Heller</em>, petitioners filed this federal suit against the City, which was consolidated with two related actions, alleging that the City\xe2\x80\x99s handgun ban has left them vulnerable to criminals.  They sought a declaration that the ban and several related City ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments.  Rejecting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the ordinances are unconstitutional, the court noted that the Seventh Circuit previously had upheld the constitutionality of a handgun ban, that <em>Heller</em> had explicitly refrained from opining on whether the Second Amendment applied to the States, and that the court had a duty to follow established Circuit precedent.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th-century cases\xe2\x80\x94<em>United States</em> v. <em>Cruikshank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/542/index.html"></a><a href="/us/92/542/index.html">92 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939, 11\xe2\x80\x9319, 19\xe2\x80\x9333.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0 Petitioners base their case on two submissions.  Primarily, they argue that the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the <em>Slaughter-House Cases\xe2\x80\x99</em> narrow interpretation of the Clause should now be rejected.  As a secondary argument, they contend that the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right.  Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the States only when it is an indispensable attribute of <em>any</em> \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98civilized\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d legal system.  If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that does not recognize the right, municipal respondents assert, that right is not protected by due process.  And since there are civilized countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of handguns, they maintain that due process does not preclude such measures.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally applied only to the Federal Government, not to the States, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan</em> v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore</em>, 7 Pet. 243, 247, but the constitutional Amendments adopted in the Civil War\xe2\x80\x99s aftermath fundamentally altered the federal system.  Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court held in the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only those rights \xe2\x80\x9cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws,\xe2\x80\x9d 16 Wall.,<em> </em>at 79, and that the fundamental rights predating the creation of the Federal Government were not protected by the Clause, <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 76.  Under this narrow reading, the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only very limited rights.  <em>Id.,</em> at 79\xe2\x80\x9380.  Subsequently, the Court held that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government in <em>Cruikshank,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/542/index.html"></a><a href="/us/92/542/index.html">92 U. S. 542</a>, <em>Presser,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/252/index.html"></a><a href="/us/116/252/index.html">116 U. S. 252</a>, and <em>Miller,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/153/535/index.html"></a><a href="/us/153/535/index.html">153 U. S. 535</a>,<em> </em>the decisions on which the Seventh Circuit relied in this case.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applies to the States is considered in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents applying the Bill of Rights\xe2\x80\x99 protections to the States.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0In the late 19th century, the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing Bill of Rights protections.  See, <em>e.g., Hurtado </em>v.<em> California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/110/516/index.html">110 U. S. 516</a>.  Five features of the approach taken during the ensuing era are noted.  First, the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.  See <em>Twining </em>v.<em> New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/211/78/index.html">211 U. S. 78</a>, 99.  Second, the Court explained that the only rights due process protected against state infringement were those \xe2\x80\x9cof such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Third, some cases during this era \xe2\x80\x9ccan be seen as having asked \xe2\x80\xa6 if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection\xe2\x80\x9d asserted therein.  <em>Duncan </em>v.<em> Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/145/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/145/index.html">391 U. S. 145</a>, 149, n.\xc2\xa014.  Fourth, the Court did not hesitate to hold that a Bill of Rights guarantee failed to meet the test for Due Process Clause protection, finding, <em>e.g.,</em> that freedom of speech and press qualified, <em>Gitlow</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/268/652/index.html">268 U. S. 652</a>, 666; <em>Near</em> v. <em>Minnesota ex rel. Olson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/697/index.html">283 U. S. 697</a>, but the grand jury indictment requirement did not, <em>Hurtado, supra.  </em>Finally, even when such a right was held to fall within the conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded against state infringement sometimes differed from those provided against abridgment by the Federal Government.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Justice Black championed the alternative theory that \xc2\xa71 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the Bill of Rights\xe2\x80\x99 provisions, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Adamson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/46/index.html">332 U. S. 46</a>, 71\xe2\x80\x9372 (Black, J., dissenting), but the Court never has embraced that theory.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0 The Court eventually moved in the direction advocated by Justice Black, by adopting a theory of selective incorporation by which the Due Process Clause incorporates particular rights contained in the first eight Amendments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html">372 U. S. 335</a>, 341.  These decisions abandoned three of the characteristics of the earlier period.  The Court clarified that the governing standard is whether a particular Bill of Rights protection is fundamental to our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s particular scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice.  <em>Duncan, supra</em>, at 149, n.\xc2\xa014.  The Court eventually held that almost all of the Bill of Rights\xe2\x80\x99 guarantees met the requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause.  The Court also held that Bill of Rights protections must \xe2\x80\x9call \xe2\x80\xa6 be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Malloy</em> v. <em>Hogan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/1/index.html">378 U. S. 1</a>, 10.  Under this approach, the Court overruled earlier decisions holding that particular Bill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gideon, supra, </em>which overruled <em>Betts</em> v. <em>Brady</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/455/index.html">316 U. S. 455</a>.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9333.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s scheme of ordered liberty, <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/145/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/145/index.html">391 U. S. 145</a>, 149, or, as the Court has said in a related context, whether it is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington </em>v.<em> Glucksberg,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 721.  <em>Heller</em> points unmistakably to the answer.  Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present, and the <em>Heller</em> Court held that individual self-defense is \xe2\x80\x9cthe central component\xe2\x80\x9d of the Second Amendment right.  554 U. S., at ___, ___.  Explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\xe2\x80\x9d in the home, <em>ibid</em>., the Court found that this right applies to handguns because they are \xe2\x80\x9cthe most preferred firearm in the nation to \xe2\x80\x98keep\xe2\x80\x99 and use for protection of one\xe2\x80\x99s home and family,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  It thus concluded that citizens must be permitted \xe2\x80\x9cto use [handguns] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at ___.  <em>Heller</em> also clarifies that this right is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and traditions,<em>\xe2\x80\x9d Glucksberg,</em> <em>supra, </em>at<em> </em>721.  <em>Heller</em> explored the right\xe2\x80\x99s origins in English law and noted the esteem with which the right was regarded during the colonial era and at the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights.  This is powerful evidence that the right was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.  That understanding persisted in the years immediately following the Bill of Rights\xe2\x80\x99 ratification and is confirmed by the state constitutions of that era, which  protected the  right to keep and bear arms.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9322. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0A survey of the contemporaneous history also demonstrates clearly that the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Framers and ratifiers counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s system of ordered liberty.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9333. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0By the 1850\xe2\x80\x99s, the fear that the National Government would disarm the universal militia had largely faded, but the right to keep and bear arms was highly valued for self-defense.  Abolitionist authors wrote in support of the right, and attempts to disarm \xe2\x80\x9cFree-Soilers\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cBloody Kansas,\xe2\x80\x9d met with outrage that the constitutional right to keep and bear arms had been taken from the people.  After the Civil War, the Southern States engaged in systematic efforts to disarm and injure African Americans, see <em>Heller</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___.  These injustices prompted the 39th Congress to pass the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protect the right to keep and bear arms.  Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative remedies insufficient, and approved the Fourteenth Amendment.  Today, it is generally accepted that that Amendment was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil Rights Act.  See <em>General Building Contractors Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/375/index.html">458 U. S. 375</a>, 389.  In Congressional debates on the proposed Amendment, its legislative proponents in the 39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right deserving of protection.  Evidence from the period immediately following the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ratification confirms that that right was considered fundamental.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9331. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents argue that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed \xc2\xa71 of the Fourteenth Amendment as purely an antidiscrimination rule.  But while \xc2\xa71 does contain an antidiscrimination rule, <em>i.e., </em>the Equal Protection Clause, it can hardly be said that the section does no more than prohibit discrimination.  If what municipal respondents mean is that the Second Amendment should be singled out for special\xe2\x80\x94and specially unfavorable\xe2\x80\x94treatment, the Court rejects the suggestion.  The right to keep and bear arms must be regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.  Pp.\xc2\xa030\xe2\x80\x9333. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy, concluded, in Parts II\xe2\x80\x93C, IV, and V, that the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in <em>Heller</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311, 33\xe2\x80\x9344.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that that the Second Amendment right is one of the \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is no need to reconsider the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause in the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>  because, for many decades, the Court has analyzed the question whether particular rights are protected against state infringement under the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause.    Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 remaining arguments are rejected because they are at war with <em>Heller</em>\xe2\x80\x99s central holding.  In effect, they ask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to a different body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.  Pp.\xc2\xa033\xe2\x80\x9340.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The dissents\xe2\x80\x99 objections are addressed and rejected.  Pp.\xc2\xa041\xe2\x80\x9344.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms that was recognized in <em>District of Columbia</em> v. <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S. ___, fully applicable to the States.  However, he asserted, there is a path to this conclusion that is more straightforward and more faithful to the Second Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text and history.  The Court is correct in describing the Second Amendment right as \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d to the American scheme of ordered liberty, <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/145/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/145/index.html">391 U. S. 145</a>, 149, and \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and traditions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 721.  But the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause, which speaks only to \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>cannot impose the type of substantive restraint on state legislation that the Court asserts.  Rather, the right to keep and bear arms is enforceable against the States because it is a privilege of American citizenship recognized by \xc2\xa71 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides, <em>inter alia: </em>\xe2\x80\x9cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  In interpreting this language, it is important to recall that constitutional provisions are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98written to be understood by the voters.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___.  The objective of this inquiry is to discern what \xe2\x80\x9cordinary citizens\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ratification would have understood that Amendment\'s Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean.  <em>Ibid.</em>  A survey of contemporary legal authorities plainly shows that, at that time, the ratifying public understood the Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the right to keep and bear arms.

The city of Chicago (City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, have laws that are similar to the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s, but Chicago and Oak Park argue that their laws are constitutional because the Second Amendment has no application to the States.  We have previously held that most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply with full force to both the Federal Government and the States.  Applying the standard that is well established in our case law, we hold that the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Otis McDonald, Adam Orlov, Colleen Lawson, and David Lawson (Chicago petitioners) are Chicago residents who would like to keep handguns in their homes for self-defense but are prohibited from doing so by Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s firearms laws.  A City ordinance provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person shall \xe2\x80\xa6 possess \xe2\x80\xa6 any firearm unless such person is the holder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\x93040(a) (2009).  The Code then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus effectively banning handgun possession by almost all private citizens who reside in the City.  \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\x93050(c).  Like Chicago, Oak Park makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for any person to possess \xe2\x80\xa6 any firearm,\xe2\x80\x9d a term that includes \xe2\x80\x9cpistols, revolvers, guns and small arms \xe2\x80\xa6 commonly known as handguns.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x931 (2007), 27\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x931 (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the loss of property and injury or death from firearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the City Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982).  The Chicago petitioners and their <em>amici</em>, however, argue that the handgun ban has left them vulnerable to criminals.  Chicago Police Department statistics, we are told, reveal that the City\xe2\x80\x99s handgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban was enacted[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and that Chicago residents now face one of the highest murder rates in the country and rates of other violent crimes that exceed the average in comparable cities.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several of the Chicago petitioners have been the targets of threats and violence.  For instance, Otis McDonald, who is in his late seventies, lives in a high-crime neighborhood.  He is a community activist involved with alternative policing strategies, and his efforts to improve his neighborhood have subjected him to violent threats from drug dealers.  App. 16\xe2\x80\x9317; Brief for State Firearm Associations as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 20\xe2\x80\x9321; Brief for State of Texas et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resident whose home has been targeted by burglars.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn Mrs. Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, possessing a handgun in Chicago would decrease her chances of suffering serious injury or death should she ever be threatened again in her home.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  McDonald, Lawson, and the other Chicago petitioners own handguns that they store outside of the city limits, but they would like to keep their handguns in their homes for protection.  See App. 16\xe2\x80\x9319, 43\xe2\x80\x9344 (McDonald), 20\xe2\x80\x9324 (C. Lawson), 19, 36 (Orlov), 20\xe2\x80\x9321, 40 (D. Lawson).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After our decision in <em>Heller</em>, the Chicago petitioners and two groups[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] filed suit against the City in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  They sought a declaration that the handgun ban and several related Chicago ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Another action challenging the Oak Park law was filed in the same District Court by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and two Oak Park residents.  In addition, the NRA and others filed a third action challenging the Chicago ordinances.  All three cases were assigned to the same District Judge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court rejected plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the Chicago and Oak Park laws are unconstitutional.  See App. 83\xe2\x80\x9384; <em>NRA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Oak Park</em>, 617 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 752, 754 (ND Ill. 2008).  The court noted that the Seventh Circuit had \xe2\x80\x9csquarely upheld the constitutionality of a ban on handguns a quarter century ago,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 753 (citing <em>Quilici </em>v.<em> Morton Grove</em>, 695 F.\xc2\xa02d 261 (CA7 1982)), and that <em>Heller</em> had explicitly refrained from \xe2\x80\x9copin[ing] on the subject of incorporation vel non of the Second Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>NRA</em>, 617 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 754.  The court observed that a district judge has a \xe2\x80\x9cduty to follow established precedent in the Court of Appeals to which he or she is beholden, even though the logic of more recent caselaw may point in a different direction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 753.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th-century cases\xe2\x80\x94<em>United States</em> v. <em>Cruikshank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/542/index.html"></a><a href="/us/92/542/index.html"></a><a href="/us/92/542/index.html">92 U.

Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit observed that it was obligated to follow Supreme Court precedents that have \xe2\x80\x9cdirect application,\xe2\x80\x9d and it declined to predict how the Second Amendment would fare under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s modern \xe2\x80\x9cselective incorporation\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  <em>Id., </em>at 857\xe2\x80\x93858 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  557 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that the Chicago and Oak Park laws violate the right to keep and bear arms for two reasons.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 primary submission is that this right is among the \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and that the narrow interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause adopted in the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, <em>supra</em>, should now be rejected.  As a secondary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause \xe2\x80\x9cincorporates\xe2\x80\x9d the Second Amendment right.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the States only if that right is an indispensable attribute of <em>any</em> \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98civilized\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d legal system.  Brief for Municipal Respondents 9.  If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that does not recognize the right, the municipal respondents tell us, then that right is not protected by due process.  <em>Ibid.  </em>And since there are civilized countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of handguns, the municipal respondents maintain that due process does not preclude such measures.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 21\xe2\x80\x9323.  In light of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting this Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis over the years of the relationship between the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally applied only to the Federal Government.  In <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan</em> v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore</em>, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), the Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall, explained that this question was \xe2\x80\x9cof great importance\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cnot of much difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 247.  In less than four pages, the Court firmly rejected the proposition that the first eight Amendments operate as limitations on the States, holding that they apply only to the Federal Government.  See also <em>Lessee of Livingston </em>v. <em>Moore</em>, 7 Pet. 469, 551\xe2\x80\x93552 (1833) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is now settled that those amendments [in the Bill of Rights] do not extend to the states\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The constitutional Amendments adopted in the aftermath of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country\xe2\x80\x99s federal system.  The provision at issue in this case, \xc2\xa71 of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other things, that a State may not abridge \xe2\x80\x9cthe privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d or deprive \xe2\x80\x9cany person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court was asked to interpret the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthe privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>involved challenges to a Louisiana law permitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the butchering of animals within the city of New Orleans.  Justice Samuel Miller\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court concluded that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only those rights \xe2\x80\x9cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 79.  The Court held that other fundamental rights\xe2\x80\x94rights that predated the creation of the Federal Government and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State governments were created to establish and secure\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94were not protected by the Clause.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 76.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of federal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two principal arguments.  First, the Court emphasized that the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Privileges or Immunities Clause spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cthe privileges or immunities of <em>citizens of the United States</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court contrasted this phrasing with the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, both of which refer to <em>state</em> citizenship.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] (Emphasis added.)  Second, the Court stated that a contrary reading would \xe2\x80\x9cradically chang[e] the whole theory of the relations of the State and Federal governments to each other and of both these governments to the people,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court refused to conclude that such a change had been made \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of language which expresses such a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 78.  Finding the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d lacking by this high standard, the Court reasoned that the phrase must mean something more limited.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s narrow reading, the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects such things as the right</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cto come to the seat of government to assert any claim [a citizen] may have upon that government, to transact any business he may have with it, to seek its protection, to share its offices, to engage in administering its functions\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 [and to] become a citizen of any State of the Union by a <em>bon<f f="Times New Roman">\xc3\xa2<f f="Century Schoolbook"> fide</f></f></em> residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 79\xe2\x80\x9380 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finding no constitutional protection against state intrusion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the Court upheld the statute.  Four Justices dissented.  Justice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices Swayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Privileges or Immunities Clause to \xe2\x80\x9ca vain and idle enactment, which accomplished nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the people on its passage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 96; see also<em> id.</em>, at 104.  Justice Field opined that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects rights that are \xe2\x80\x9cin their nature \xe2\x80\xa6 fundamental,\xe2\x80\x9d including the right of every man to pursue his profession without the imposition of unequal or discriminatory restrictions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 96\xe2\x80\x9397.  Justice Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s dissent observed that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not bound to resort to implication \xe2\x80\xa6 to find an authoritative declaration of some of the most important privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.  It is in the Constitution itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 118.  Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges or Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated in the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 119.  Justice Swayne described the majority\xe2\x80\x99s narrow reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as \xe2\x80\x9cturn[ing] \xe2\x80\xa6 what was meant for bread into a stone.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 129 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of the narrow <em>Slaughter-House</em> interpretation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Saenz</em> v. <em>Roe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/489/index.html">526 U. S. 489</a>, 522, n.\xc2\xa01, 527 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment agree \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Clause does not mean what the Court said it meant in 1873\xe2\x80\x9d); Amar, Substance and Method in the Year 2000,<em> </em>28 Pepperdine L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 601, 631, n.\xc2\xa0178 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cVirtually no serious modern scholar\xe2\x80\x94left, right, and center\xe2\x80\x94thinks that this [interpretation] is a plausible reading of the Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 33 (claiming an \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming consensus among leading constitutional scholars\xe2\x80\x9d that the opinion is \xe2\x80\x9cegregiously wrong\xe2\x80\x9d); C.

S. 542</a>.  In that case, the Court reviewed convictions stemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisiana on Easter Sunday 1873.  Dozens of blacks, many unarmed, were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white men.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed African-American prisoners through the streets and then had them summarily executed.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Ninety-seven men were indicted for participating in the massacre, but only nine went to trial.  Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges; the remaining three were acquitted of murder but convicted under the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, for banding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of various constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reversed all of the convictions, including those relating to the deprivation of the victims\xe2\x80\x99 right to bear arms.  <em>Cruikshank</em>, 92 U. S., at 553, 559.  The Court wrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose \xe2\x80\x9cis not a right granted by the Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d and is not \xe2\x80\x9cin any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 553.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe second amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court continued, \xe2\x80\x9cdeclares that it shall not be infringed; but this \xe2\x80\xa6 means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>\xe2\x80\x9cOur later decisions in <em>Presser </em>v.<em> Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/252/index.html"></a><a href="/us/116/252/index.html">116 U. S. 252</a>, 265 (1886), and <em>Miller </em>v.<em> Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/153/535/index.html"></a><a href="/us/153/535/index.html">153 U. S. 535</a>, 538 (1894), reaffirmed that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa023 (slip op., at 48, n.\xc2\xa023).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that <em>Cruikshank</em>, <em>Presser</em>, and <em>Miller </em>doomed petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims at the Court of Appeals level.  Petitioners argue, however, that we should overrule those decisions and hold that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  In petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as well as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15\xe2\x80\x9321, but petitioners are unable to identify the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s full scope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\xe2\x80\x936, 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  Nor is there any consensus on that question among the scholars who agree that the <em>Slaughter-House Cases\xe2\x80\x99</em> interpretation is flawed.  See <em>Saenz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 522, n.\xc2\xa01 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here.  For many decades, the question of the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  We therefore decline to disturb the <em>Slaughter-House</em> holding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, however, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Cruikshank</em>, <em>Presser</em>, and <em>Miller</em> do not preclude us from considering whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right binding on the States.  See <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa023 (slip op., at 48, n.\xc2\xa023).  None of those cases \xe2\x80\x9cengage[d] in the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by our later cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  As explained more fully below, <em>Cruikshank</em>, <em>Presser</em>, and <em>Miller</em> all preceded the era in which the Court began the process of \xe2\x80\x9cselective incorporation\xe2\x80\x9d under the Due Process Clause, and we have never previously addressed the question whether the right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under that theory.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, <em>Cruikshank</em> has not prevented us from holding that other rights that were at issue in that case are binding on the States through the Due Process Clause.  In <em>Cruikshank</em>, the Court held that the general \xe2\x80\x9cright of the people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d which is protected by the First Amendment, applied only against the Federal Government and not against the States.  See 92 U. S., at 551\xe2\x80\x93552.  Nonetheless, over 60 years later the Court held that the right of peaceful assembly was a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental righ[t] \xe2\x80\xa6 safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>De Jonge</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/353/index.html"></a><a href="/us/299/353/index.html">299 U. S. 353</a>, 364 (1937).  We follow the same path here and thus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider whether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights.  See <em>Hurtado </em>v.<em> California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/110/516/index.html"></a><a href="/us/110/516/index.html">110 U. S. 516</a> (1884) (due process does not require grand jury indictment); <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q.

S. 226</a> (1897) (due process prohibits States from taking of private property for public use without just compensation).  Five features of the approach taken during the ensuing era should be noted.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court viewed the due process question as entirely  separate from the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.  See <em>Twining </em>v.<em> New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/211/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/211/78/index.html">211 U. S. 78</a>, 99 (1908).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court explained that the only rights protected against state infringement by the Due Process Clause were those rights \xe2\x80\x9cof such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  See also, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Adamson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/46/index.html"></a><a href="/us/332/46/index.html"></a><a href="/us/332/46/index.html">332 U. S. 46</a> (1947); <em>Betts</em> v. <em>Brady</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/455/index.html"></a><a href="/us/316/455/index.html">316 U. S. 455</a> (1942);<em> Palko </em>v.<em> Connecticut, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/index.html"></a><a href="/us/302/319/index.html">302 U. S. 319</a> (1937);<em> Grosjean</em> v. <em>American Press Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/233/index.html">297 U. S. 233</a> (1936); <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/index.html">287 U. S. 45</a> (1932).  While it was \xe2\x80\x9cpossible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against National action [might] also be safeguarded against state action,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court stated, this was \xe2\x80\x9cnot because those rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Twining, supra, </em>at 99.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court used different formulations in describing the boundaries of due process.  For example, in <em>Twining</em>, the Court referred to \xe2\x80\x9cimmutable principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government which no member of the Union may disregard.\xe2\x80\x9d  211 U. S., at 102 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In <em>Snyder </em>v.<em> Massachusetts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/291/97/index.html">291 U. S. 97</a>, 105 (1934), the Court spoke of rights that are \xe2\x80\x9cso rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\xe2\x80\x9d  And in <em>Palko</em>, the Court famously said that due process protects those rights that are \xe2\x80\x9cthe very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty\xe2\x80\x9d and essential to \xe2\x80\x9ca fair and enlightened system of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  302 U. S., at 325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court \xe2\x80\x9ccan be seen as having asked, when inquiring into whether some particular procedural safeguard was required of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan </em>v.<em> Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/145/index.html">391 U. S. 145</a>, 149, n.\xc2\xa014 (1968).  Thus, in holding that due process prohibits a State from taking private property without just compensation, the Court described the right as \xe2\x80\x9ca principle of natural equity, recognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and universal sense of its justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R.\xc2\xa0Co., supra, </em>at 238.  Similarly, the Court found that due process did not provide a right against compelled incrimination in part because this right \xe2\x80\x9chas no place in the jurisprudence of civilized and free countries outside the domain of the common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Twining, supra</em>, at 113.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to hold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to meet the test for inclusion within the protection of the Due Process Clause.  The Court found that some such rights qualified.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gitlow</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/268/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/268/652/index.html">268 U. S. 652</a>, 666 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); <em>Near</em> v. <em>Minnesota ex rel. Olson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/697/index.html"></a><a href="/us/283/697/index.html">283 U. S. 697</a> (1931) (same); <em>Powell</em>, <em>supra</em> (assistance of counsel in capital cases); <em>De Jonge</em>, <em>supra</em> (freedom of assembly); <em>Cantwell</em> v. <em>Connecticut</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/index.html"></a><a href="/us/310/296/index.html">310 U. S. 296</a> (1940) (free exercise of religion).  But others did not.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hurtado, supra </em>(grand jury indictment requirement); <em>Twining</em>, <em>supra</em> (privilege against self-incrimination).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights was held to fall within the conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded against state infringement sometimes differed from the protection or remedies provided against abridgment by the Federal Government.  To give one example, in <em>Betts</em> the Court held that, although the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant was unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause required appointment of counsel in state criminal proceedings only where \xe2\x80\x9cwant of counsel in [the] particular case \xe2\x80\xa6 result[ed] in a conviction lacking in \xe2\x80\xa6 fundamental fairness.\xe2\x80\x9d  316 U. S., at 473.  Similarly, in <em>Wolf</em> v. <em>Colorado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/index.html"></a><a href="/us/338/25/index.html"></a><a href="/us/338/25/index.html">338 U. S. 25</a> (1949), the Court held that the \xe2\x80\x9ccore of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d was implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and thus \xe2\x80\x9cenforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x9d but that the exclusionary rule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the States.  <em>Id</em>., at 27\xe2\x80\x9328, 33.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An alternative theory regarding the relationship between the Bill of Rights and \xc2\xa71 of the Fourteenth Amendment was championed by Justice Black.  This theory held that \xc2\xa71 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Adamson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 71\xe2\x80\x9372 (Black, J., dissenting); <em>Duncan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 166 (Black, J., concurring).  As Justice Black noted, the chief congressional proponents of the Fourteenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amendment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and, in so doing, overruled this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Barron</em>.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  <em>Adamson</em>, 332 U. S., at 72 (dissenting opinion).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Nonetheless, the Court never has embraced Justice Black\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctotal incorporation\xe2\x80\x9d theory.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Justice Black\xe2\x80\x99s theory was never adopted, the Court eventually moved in that direction by initiating what has been called a process of \xe2\x80\x9cselective incorporation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e</em>., the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause fully incorporates particular rights contained in the first eight Amendments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html"></a><a href="/us/372/335/index.html"></a><a href="/us/372/335/index.html">372 U.

S., at 149, n.\xc2\xa014.  Instead, the Court inquired whether a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental to <em>our </em>scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice.  <em>Id</em>., at 149, and n.\xc2\xa014; see also <em>id., </em>at 148 (referring to those \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all <em>our</em> civil and political institutions\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause.  The Court eventually incorporated almost all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Only a handful of the Bill of Rights protections remain unincorporated.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court abandoned \xe2\x80\x9cthe notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights,\xe2\x80\x9d stating that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cincongruous\xe2\x80\x9d to apply different standards \xe2\x80\x9cdepending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Malloy</em>, 378 U. S., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, the Court decisively held that incorporated Bill of Rights protections \xe2\x80\x9care all to be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 10; see also <em>Mapp</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/index.html"></a><a href="/us/367/643/index.html">367 U.

In answering that question, as just explained, we must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to <em>our</em> scheme of ordered liberty, <em>Duncan, </em>391 U. S., at 149, or as we have said in a related context, whether this right is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington </em>v.<em> Glucksberg,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/702/index.html">521 U.

Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] and in <em>Heller,</em> we held that individual self-defense is \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>central component</em>\xe2\x80\x9d of the Second Amendment right.  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see also <em>id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 56) (stating that the \xe2\x80\x9cinherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\xe2\x80\x9d).  Explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\xe2\x80\x9d in the home, <em>ibid</em>., we found that this right applies to handguns because they are \xe2\x80\x9cthe most preferred firearm in the nation to \xe2\x80\x98keep\xe2\x80\x99 and use for protection of one\xe2\x80\x99s home and family,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 57) (some internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 56) (noting that handguns are \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmingly chosen by American society for [the] lawful purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of self-defense); <em>id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 57) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, we concluded, citizens must be permitted \xe2\x80\x9cto use [handguns] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 58).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Heller </em>makes it clear that this right is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition.<em>\xe2\x80\x9d  Glucksberg,</em> <em>supra, </em>at<em> </em>721 (internal quotation marks omitted).  <em>Heller</em> explored the right\xe2\x80\x99s origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of Rights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self-defense, 554 U. S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320), and that by 1765, Blackstone was able to assert that the right to keep and bear arms was \xe2\x80\x9cone of the fundamental rights of Englishmen,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 20).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s assessment was shared by the American colonists.  As we noted in <em>Heller</em>, King George III\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to disarm the colonists in the 1760\xe2\x80\x99s and 1770\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprovoked polemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as Englishmen to keep arms.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 21); see also L. Levy, Origins of the Bill of Rights 137\xe2\x80\x93143 (1999) (hereinafter Levy).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The right to keep and bear arms was considered no less fundamental by those who drafted and ratified the Bill of Rights.  \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive in Antifederalist rhetoric.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heller</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 25) (citing Letters from the Federal Farmer III (Oct. 10, 1787), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 234, 242 (H.

Federalists responded, not by arguing that the right was insufficiently important to warrant protection but by contending that the right was adequately protected by the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s assignment of only limited powers to the Federal Government.  <em>Heller</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 25\xe2\x80\x9326); cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).  Thus, Antifederalists and Federalists alike agreed that the right to bear arms was fundamental to the newly formed system of government.  See Levy 143\xe2\x80\x93149; J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right 155\xe2\x80\x93164 (1994).  But those who were fearful that the new Federal Government would infringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and bear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a condition for ratification of the Constitution.  See 1 J. Elliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327\xe2\x80\x93331 (2d ed. 1854); 3 <em>id.</em>, at 657\xe2\x80\x93661; 4 <em>id.</em>, at 242\xe2\x80\x93246, 248\xe2\x80\x93249; see also Levy 26\xe2\x80\x9334; A. Kelly &amp; W. Harbison, The American Constitution: Its Origins and Development 110, 118 (7th ed. 1991).  This is surely powerful evidence that the right was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This understanding persisted in the years immediately following the ratification of the Bill of Rights.  In addition to the four States that had adopted Second Amendment analogues before ratification, nine more States adopted state constitutional provisions protecting an individual right to keep and bear arms between 1789 and 1820.  <em>Heller</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 27\xe2\x80\x9330).  Founding-era legal commentators confirmed the importance of the right to early Americans.  St. George Tucker, for example, described the right to keep and bear arms as \xe2\x80\x9cthe true palladium of liberty\xe2\x80\x9d and explained that prohibitions on the right would place liberty \xe2\x80\x9con the brink of destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s Commentaries, Editor\xe2\x80\x99s App. 300 (S.

See M. Doubler, Civilian in Peace, Soldier in War 87\xe2\x80\x9390 (2003); Amar, Bill of Rights 258\xe2\x80\x93259.  Abolitionist authors wrote in support of the right.  See L.

Its efforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms demonstrate that the right was still recognized to be fundamental.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most explicit evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim appears in \xc2\xa714 of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau Act of 1866, which provided that \xe2\x80\x9cthe right \xe2\x80\xa6 to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal, <em>including the constitutional right to bear arms</em>, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens \xe2\x80\xa6 without respect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.\xe2\x80\x9d  14 Stat. 176\xe2\x80\x93177 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Section 14 thus explicitly guaranteed that \xe2\x80\x9call the citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d black and white, would have \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional right to bear arms.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which was considered at the same time as the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau Act, similarly sought to protect the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act guaranteed the \xe2\x80\x9cfull and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  This language was virtually identical to language in \xc2\xa714 of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau Act, 14 Stat. 176\xe2\x80\x93177 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe right \xe2\x80\xa6 to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal\xe2\x80\x9d).  And as noted, the latter provision went on to explain that one of the \xe2\x80\x9claws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional right to bear arms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Representative Bingham believed that the Civil Rights Act protected the same rights as enumerated in the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau bill, which of course explicitly mentioned the right to keep and bear arms.  39th Cong. Globe 1292.  The unavoidable conclusion is that the Civil Rights Act, like the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau Act, aimed to protect \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional right to bear arms\xe2\x80\x9d and not simply to prohibit discrimination.  See also Amar, Bill of Rights 264\xe2\x80\x93265 (noting that one of the \xe2\x80\x9ccore purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of the Fourteenth Amendment was to redress the grievances\xe2\x80\x9d of freedmen who had been stripped of their arms and to \xe2\x80\x9caffirm the full and equal right of every citizen to self-defense\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative remedies insufficient.  Southern resistance, Presidential vetoes, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Civil-War precedent persuaded Congress that a constitutional amendment was necessary to provide full protection for the rights of blacks.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Today, it is generally accepted that the Fourteenth Amendment was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

In an 1868 speech addressing the disarmament of freedmen, Representative Stevens emphasized the necessity of the right: \xe2\x80\x9cDisarm a community and you rob them of the means of defending life.  Take away their weapons of defense and you take away the inalienable right of defending liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThe fourteenth amendment, now so happily adopted, settles the whole question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967.  And in debating the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress routinely referred to the right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued disarmament of blacks in the South.  See Halbrook, Freedmen 120\xe2\x80\x93131.  Finally, legal commentators from the period emphasized the fundamental nature of the right.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, T. Farrar, Manual of the Constitution of the United States of America \xc2\xa7118, p.\xc2\xa0145 (1867) (reprint 1993); J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to the Constitutional Law of the United States \xc2\xa7239, pp.\xc2\xa0152\xe2\x80\x93153 (3d ed. 1875).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The right to keep and bear arms was also widely protected by state constitutions at the time when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.  In 1868, 22 of the 37 States in the Union had state constitutional provisions explicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms.  See Calabresi &amp; Agudo, Individual Rights Under State Constitutions when the Fourteenth Amendment was Ratified in 1868: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition? 87 Texas L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 7, 50 (2008).[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Quite a few of these state constitutional guarantees, moreover, explicitly protected the right to keep and bear arms as an individual right to self-defense.  See Ala. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa728 (1868); Conn. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa717 (1818); Ky. Const., Art. XIII, \xc2\xa725 (1850); Mich. Const., Art. XVIII, \xc2\xa77 (1850); Miss. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa715 (1868); Mo. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78 (1865); Tex. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa713 (1869); see also Mont. Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa713 (1889); Wash. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa724 (1889); Wyo. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa724 (1889); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McAdams</em>, 714 P.\xc2\xa02d 1236, 1238 (Wyo. 1986).  What is more, state constitutions adopted during the Reconstruction era by former Confederate States included a right to keep and bear arms.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ark. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa75 (1868); Miss. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa715 (1868); Tex. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa713 (1869).  A clear majority of the States in 1868, therefore, recognized the right to keep and bear arms as being among the foundational rights necessary to our system of Government.[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, it is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents contend that Congress, in the years immediately following the Civil War, merely sought to outlaw \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory measures taken against freedmen, which it addressed by adopting a non-discrimination principle\xe2\x80\x9d and that even an outright ban on the possession of firearms was regarded as acceptable, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as it was not done in a discriminatory manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Municipal Respondents 7.  They argue that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed \xc2\xa71 of the Fourteenth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cas an antidiscrimination rule,\xe2\x80\x9d and they cite statements to the effect that the section would outlaw discriminatory measures.  <em>Id</em>., at 64.  This argument is implausible.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, while \xc2\xa71 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains \xe2\x80\x9can antidiscrimination rule,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, the Equal Protection Clause, municipal respondents can hardly mean that \xc2\xa71 does no more than prohibit discrimination.  If that were so, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States, would not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the rights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not prohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only discriminatory searches and seizures\xe2\x80\x94and so on.  We assume that this is not municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view, so what they must mean is that the Second Amendment should be singled out for special\xe2\x80\x94and specially unfavorable\xe2\x80\x94treatment.  We reject that suggestion. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument ignores the clear terms of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau Act of 1866, which acknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms.  If that law had used language such as \xe2\x80\x9cthe equal benefit of laws concerning the bearing of arms,\xe2\x80\x9d it would be possible to interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimination.  But \xc2\xa714 speaks of and protects \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional right to bear arms,\xe2\x80\x9d an unmistakable reference to the right protected by the Second Amendment.  And it protects the \xe2\x80\x9cfull and equal benefit\xe2\x80\x9d of this right in the States.  14 Stat. 176\xe2\x80\x93177.  It would have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a constitutional right that does not exist.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those laws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude, African Americans in the South would likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace officers.  In the years immediately following the Civil War, a law banning the possession of guns by all private citizens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the formal sense.  Any such law\xe2\x80\x94like the Chicago and Oak Park ordinances challenged here\xe2\x80\x94presumably would have permitted the possession of guns by those acting under the authority of the State and would thus have left firearms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers.  And as the Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction revealed, see <em>supra</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325, those groups were widely involved in harassing blacks in the South.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 purely antidiscrimination theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the plight of whites in the South who opposed the Black Codes.  If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had simply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the bearing of arms, opponents of the Black Codes would have been left without the means of self-defense\xe2\x80\x94as had abolitionists in Kansas in the 1850\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, the 39th Congress\xe2\x80\x99 response to proposals to disband and disarm the Southern militias is instructive.  Despite recognizing and deploring the abuses of these militias, the 39th Congress balked at a proposal to disarm them.  See 39th Cong. Globe 914; Halbrook, Freedmen, <em>supra</em>, 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Disarmament, it was argued, would violate the members\xe2\x80\x99 right to bear arms, and it was ultimately decided to disband the militias but not to disarm their members.  See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, \xc2\xa76, 14 Stat. 485, 487; Halbrook, Freedmen 68\xe2\x80\x9369; Cramer 858\xe2\x80\x93861.  It cannot be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 remaining arguments are at war with our central holding in <em>Heller</em>: that the Second Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense within the home.  Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us to treat the right recognized in <em>Heller</em> as a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be incorporated into the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 main argument is nothing less than a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation precedent and return (presumably for this case only) to a bygone era.  Municipal respondents submit that the Due Process Clause protects only those rights \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98recognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and universal sense of [their] justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Municipal Respondents 9 (quoting <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 166 U. S., at 238).  According to municipal respondents, if it is possible to imagine <em>any</em> civilized legal system that does not recognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause does not make that right binding on the States.  Brief for Municipal Respondents 9.  Therefore, the municipal respondents continue, because such countries as England, Canada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand either ban or severely limit handgun ownership, it must follow that no right to possess such weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Id</em>., at 21\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the long-established standard we apply in incorporation cases.  See <em>Duncan</em>, 391 U. S., at 149, and n.\xc2\xa014.  And the present-day implications of municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument are stunning.  For example, many of the rights that our Bill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal offenses are virtually unique to this country.[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  If <em>our</em> understanding of the right to a jury trial, the right against self-incrimination, and the right to counsel were necessary attributes of <em>any</em> civilized country, it would follow that the United States is the only civilized Nation in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Municipal respondents attempt to salvage their position by suggesting that their argument applies only to substantive as opposed to procedural rights.  Brief for Municipal Respondents 10, n.\xc2\xa03.  But even in this trimmed form,  municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument flies in the face of more than a half-century of precedent.  For example, in <em>Everson</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/330/1/index.html">330 U. S. 1</a>, 8 (1947), the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Yet several of the countries that municipal respondents recognize as civilized have established state churches.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  If we were to adopt municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory, all of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Establishment Clause precedents involving actions taken by state and local governments would go by the boards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Municipal respondents maintain that the Second Amendment differs from all of the other provisions of the Bill of Rights because it concerns the right to possess a deadly implement and thus has implications for public safety.  Brief for Municipal Respondents 11.  And they note that there is intense disagreement on the question whether the private possession of guns in the home increases or decreases gun deaths and injuries.  <em>Id</em>., at 11, 13\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The right to keep and bear arms, however, is not the only constitutional right that has controversial public safety implications.  All of the constitutional provisions that impose restrictions on law enforcement and on the prosecution of crimes fall into the same category.

Municipal respondents cite no case in which we have refrained from holding that a provision of the Bill of Rights is binding on the States on the ground that the right at issue has disputed public safety implications.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We likewise reject municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that we should depart from our established incorporation methodology on the ground that making the Second Amendment binding on the States and their subdivisions is inconsistent with principles of federalism and will stifle experimentation.  Municipal respondents point out\xe2\x80\x94quite correctly\xe2\x80\x94that conditions and problems differ from locality to locality and that citizens in different jurisdictions have divergent views on the issue of gun control.  Municipal respondents therefore urge us to allow state and local governments to enact any gun control law that they deem to be reasonable, including a complete ban on the possession of handguns in the home for self-defense.

This argument was made repeatedly and eloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the concept of incorporation and urged retention of the two-track approach to incorporation.  Throughout the era of \xe2\x80\x9cselective incorporation,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Harlan in particular, invoking the values of federalism and state experimentation, fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the two-track approach.

Unless we turn back the clock or adopt a special incorporation test applicable only to the Second Amendment, municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument must be rejected.  Under our precedents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an American perspective, then, unless <em>stare decisis</em> counsels otherwise,[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] that guarantee is fully binding on the States and thus <em>limits</em> (but by no means eliminates) their ability to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values.

But what is most striking about their research is the paucity of precedent sustaining bans comparable to those at issue here and in <em>Heller</em>.  Municipal respondents cite precisely one case (from the late 20th century) in which such a ban was sustained.  See Brief for Municipal Respondents 26\xe2\x80\x9327 (citing <em>Kalodimos </em>v. <em>Morton Grove</em>, 103 Ill. 2d 483, 470 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 266 (1984)); see also Reply Brief for Respondents NRA et\xc2\xa0al. 23, n. 7  (asserting that no other court has ever upheld a complete ban on the possession of handguns).  It is important to keep in mind that <em>Heller</em>, while striking down a law that prohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recognized that the right to keep and bear arms is not \xe2\x80\x9ca right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 54).  We made it clear in <em>Heller</em> that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9claws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 54\xe2\x80\x9355).  We repeat those assurances here.  Despite municipal respondents\xe2\x80\x99 doomsday proclamations, incorporation does not imperil every law regulating\nfirearms.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Municipal respondents argue, finally, that the right to keep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in the first eight Amendments \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the reason for codifying the Second Amendment (to protect the militia) differs from the purpose (primarily, to use firearms to engage in self-defense) that is claimed to make the right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Municipal Respondents 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  Municipal respondents suggest that the Second Amendment right differs from the rights heretofore incorporated because the latter were \xe2\x80\x9cvalued for [their] own sake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 33.  But we have never previously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on whether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value, and quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorporated\xe2\x80\x94for example the right to counsel and the right to confront and subpoena witnesses\xe2\x80\x94are clearly instrumental by any measure.  Moreover, this contention repackages one of the chief arguments that we rejected in <em>Heller</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, that the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined by the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that right in the Bill of Rights.  In <em>Heller</em>, we recognized that the codification of this right was prompted by fear that the Federal Government would disarm and thus disable the militias, but we rejected the suggestion that the right was valued only as a means of preserving the militias.  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26).  On the contrary, we stressed that the right was also valued because the possession of firearms was thought to be essential for self-defense.  As we put it, self-defense was \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>central component</em> of the right itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn, finally, to the two dissenting opinions.  Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 eloquent opinion covers ground already addressed, and therefore little need be added in response.  Justice Stevens would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ground the prohibitions against state action squarely on due process, without intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amendments.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post, </em>at 8 (quoting <em>Malloy</em>, 378 U. S., at 24 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).  The question presented in this case, in his view, \xe2\x80\x9cis whether the particular right asserted by petitioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment itself, standing on its own bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 27.  He would hold that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he rights protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause need not be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected against Federal Government infringement by the various provisions of the Bill of Rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 9.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have explained, the Court, for the past half-century, has moved away from the two-track approach.  If we were now to accept Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 theory across the board, decades of decisions would be undermined.  We assume that this is not what is proposed.  What is urged instead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for the individual right that <em>Heller</em> recognized, over vigorous dissents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relationship between the Bill of Rights\xe2\x80\x99 guarantees and the States must be governed by a single, neutral principle.  It is far too late to exhume what Justice Brennan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as \xe2\x80\x9cthe notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Malloy</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissent makes several points to which we briefly respond.  To begin, while there is certainly room for disagreement about <em>Heller</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the history of the right to keep and bear arms, nothing written since <em>Heller</em> persuades us to reopen the question there decided.  Few other questions of original meaning have been as thoroughly explored.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate the right to keep and bear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors: First, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no popular consensus\xe2\x80\x9d that the right is fundamental, <em>post</em>, at 9; second, the right does not protect minorities or persons neglected by those holding political power, <em>post</em>, at 10; third, incorporation of the Second Amendment right would \xe2\x80\x9camount to a significant incursion on a traditional and important area of state concern, altering the constitutional relationship between the States and the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x9d and preventing local variations, <em>post</em>, at 11; and fourth, determining the scope of the Second Amendment right in cases involving state and local laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical questions regarding matters that are outside their area of expertise, <em>post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9316.  Even if we believed that these factors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry, none of these factors undermines the case for incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, we have never held that a provision of the Bill of Rights applies to the States only if there is a \xe2\x80\x9cpopular consensus\xe2\x80\x9d that the right is fundamental, and we see no basis for such a rule.  But in this case, as it turns out, there is evidence of such a consensus.  An <em>amicus</em> brief submitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members of the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental.  See Brief for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison et al<em>.</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4.  Another brief submitted by 38 States takes the same position.  Brief for State of Texas et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 6.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, petitioners and many others who live in high-crime areas dispute the proposition that the Second Amendment right does not protect minorities and those lacking political clout.  The plight of Chicagoans living in high-crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illinois legislators representing Chicago districts called on the Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to patrol the City\xe2\x80\x99s streets.[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  The legislators noted that the number of Chicago homicide victims during the current year equaled the number of American soldiers killed during that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that 80% of the Chicago victims were black.[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  <em>Amici</em> supporting  incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend that the right is especially important for women and members of other groups that may be especially vulnerable to violent crime.[<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  If, as petitioners believe, their safety and the safety of other law-abiding members of the community would be enhanced by the possession of handguns in the home for self-defense, then the Second Amendment right protects the rights of minorities and other residents of high-crime areas whose needs are not being met by elected public officials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, Justice Breyer is correct that incorporation of the Second Amendment right will to some extent limit the legislative freedom of the States, but this is always true when a Bill of Rights provision is incorporated.  Incorporation always restricts experimentation and local variations, but that has not stopped the Court from incorporating virtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 64).  This conclusion is no more remarkable with respect to the Second Amendment than it is with respect to all the other limitations on state power found in the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Justice Breyer is incorrect that incorporation will require judges to assess the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical judgments in an area in which they lack expertise.  As we have noted, while his opinion in <em>Heller</em> recommended an interest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that suggestion.  See <em>supr</em>a, at 38\xe2\x80\x9339.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government\xe2\x80\x94even the Third Branch of Government\xe2\x80\x94the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is <em>really worth</em> insisting upon.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heller</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 62\xe2\x80\x9363).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Heller</em>, we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense.  Unless considerations of <em>stare decisis</em> counsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights that protects a right that is fundamental from an American perspective applies equally to the Federal Government and the States.  See <em>Duncan</em>, 391 U. S., at 149, and n.\xc2\xa014.  We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in <em>Heller</em>.

Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader of the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation on the States.

The Court has held that although the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury requires a unanimous jury verdict in federal criminal trials, it does not require a unanimous jury verdict in state criminal trials.  See <em>Apodaca</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/404/index.html">406 U.

S. 356</a> (1972) (holding that the Due Process Clause does not require unanimous jury verdicts in state criminal trials).  But that ruling was the result of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement of the two-track approach to incorporation.  In <em>Apodaca</em>, eight Justices agreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the Federal Government and the States.  See <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 395 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  Nonetheless, among those eight, four Justices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, <em>Apodaca</em>, 406 U. S., at 406 (plurality opinion), and four other Justices took the view that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in federal and state criminal trials, <em>id</em>., at 414\xe2\x80\x93415 (Stewart, J., dissenting); <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 381\xe2\x80\x93382 (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded that the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not state, cases.  <em>Apodaca</em>, therefore, does not undermine the well-established rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply identically to the States and the Federal Government.  See <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 395\xe2\x80\x93396 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn any event, the affirmance must not obscure that the majority of the Court remains of the view that, as in the case of every specific of the Bill of Rights that extends to the States, the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury trial guarantee, however it is to be construed, has identical application against both State and Federal Governments\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Citing Jewish, Greek, and Roman law, Blackstone wrote that if a person killed an attacker, \xe2\x80\x9cthe slayer is in no kind of fault whatsoever, not even in the minutest degree; and is therefore to be totally acquitted and discharged, with commendation rather than blame.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 W.

This case does not require me to reconsider that view, since straightforward application of settled doctrine suffices to decide it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I write separately only to respond to some aspects of Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 dissent.  Not that aspect which disagrees with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s application of our precedents to this case, which is fully covered by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  But much of what Justice Stevens writes is a broad condemnation of the theory of interpretation which underlies the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, a theory that makes the traditions of our people paramount.  He proposes a different theory, which he claims is more \xe2\x80\x9ccautiou[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and respectful of proper limits on the judicial role.  <em>Post</em>, at 57.  It is that claim I wish to address. </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After stressing the substantive dimension of what he has renamed the \xe2\x80\x9cliberty clause,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x937,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] Justice Stevens proceeds to urge readoption of the theory of incorporation articulated in <em>Palko</em> v. <em>Connecticut</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/index.html">302 U. S. 319</a>, 325 (1937), see <em>post</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9320.<em> </em>But in fact he does not favor application of that theory at all.  For whether <em>Palko</em> requires only that \xe2\x80\x9ca fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without\xe2\x80\x9d the right sought to be incorporated, 302 U.

S. 643</a>, 650, 655\xe2\x80\x93657 (1961)); and the right to teach one\xe2\x80\x99s children foreign languages, <em>post</em>, at 7 (citing <em>Meyer</em> v. <em>Nebraska</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/390/index.html">262 U. S. 390</a>, 399\xe2\x80\x93403 (1923)), among others.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That Justice Stevens is not applying any version of <em>Palko </em>is clear from comparing, on the one hand, the rights he believes <em>are</em> covered, with, on the other hand, his conclusion that the right to keep and bear arms is <em>not </em>covered.  Rights that pass his test include not just those \xe2\x80\x9crelating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education,\xe2\x80\x9d but also rights against \xe2\x80\x9c[g]overnment action that shocks the conscience, pointlessly infringes settled expectations, trespasses into sensitive private realms or life choices without adequate justification, [or] perpetrates gross injustice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Not <em>all</em> such rights are in, however, since only \xe2\x80\x9c<em>some</em> fundamental aspects of personhood, dignity, and the like\xe2\x80\x9d are protected, <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 24 (emphasis added).  Exactly what is covered is not clear.  But whatever else is in, he <em>knows </em>that the right to keep and bear arms is out, despite its being as \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), as a right can be, see <em>District of Columbia</em> v. <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2008) (slip op., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, 26\xe2\x80\x9330, 41\xe2\x80\x9344).  I can find no other explanation for such certitude except that Justice Stevens, despite his forswearing of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal and private notions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 21 (internal quotation marks omitted), deeply believes it should be out.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The subjective nature of Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 standard is also apparent from his claim that it is the courts\xe2\x80\x99 prerogative\xe2\x80\x94indeed their <em>duty</em>\xe2\x80\x94to update the Due Process Clause so that it encompasses new freedoms the Framers were too narrow-minded to imagine, <em>post</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, and n. 21.  Courts, he proclaims, must \xe2\x80\x9cdo justice to [the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s] urgent call and its open texture\xe2\x80\x9d by exercising the \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretive discretion the latter embodies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 21.  (Why the <em>people</em> are not up to the task of deciding what new rights to protect, even though it is <em>they </em>who are authorized to make changes, see U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0V, is never explained.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>])  And it would be \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial abdication\xe2\x80\x9d for a judge to \xe2\x80\x9ctur[n] his back\xe2\x80\x9d on <em>his</em> task of determining what the Fourteenth Amendment covers by \xe2\x80\x9coutsourc[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the job to \xe2\x80\x9chistorical sentiment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x94that is, by being guided by what the American people throughout our history have thought.  It is only we judges, exercising our \xe2\x80\x9cown reasoned judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 15, who can be entrusted with deciding the Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope\xe2\x80\x94which rights serve the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccentral values,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x94which basically means picking the rights we want to protect and discarding those we do not.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens resists this description, insisting that his approach provides plenty of \xe2\x80\x9cguideposts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconstraints\xe2\x80\x9d to keep courts from \xe2\x80\x9cinjecting excessive subjectivity\xe2\x80\x9d into the process.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Post</em>, at 21.  Plenty indeed\xe2\x80\x94and that alone is a problem.  The ability of omnidirectional guideposts to constrain is inversely proportional to their number.  But even individually, each lodestar or limitation he lists either is incapable of restraining judicial whimsy or cannot be squared with the precedents he seeks to preserve.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He begins with a brief nod to history, <em>post</em>, at 21, but as he has just made clear, he thinks historical inquiry unavailing, <em>post</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  Moreover, trusting the meaning of the Due Process Clause to what has historically been protected is circular, see <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 19, since that would mean no <em>new</em> rights could get in.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens moves on to the \xe2\x80\x9cmost basic\xe2\x80\x9d constraint on subjectivity his theory offers: that he would \xe2\x80\x9cesche[w] attempts to provide any all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of \xe2\x80\x98liberty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 22.  The notion that the absence of a coherent theory of the Due Process Clause will somehow <em>curtail</em> judicial caprice is at war with reason.  Indeterminacy means opportunity for courts to impose whatever rule they like; it is the problem, not the solution.  The idea that interpretive pluralism would <em>reduce </em>courts\xe2\x80\x99 ability to impose their will on the ignorant masses is not merely na\xc3\xafve, but absurd.  If there are no right answers, there are no wrong answers either.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens also argues that requiring courts to show \xe2\x80\x9crespect for the democratic process\xe2\x80\x9d should serve as a constraint.  <em>Post</em>, at 23.  That is true, but Justice Stevens would have them show respect in an extraordinary manner.  In his view, if a right \xe2\x80\x9cis already being given careful consideration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the States, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In other words, a right, such as the right to keep and bear arms, that has long been recognized but on which the States are considering restrictions, apparently deserves <em>less</em> protection, while a privilege the political branches (instruments of the democratic process) have withheld entirely and continue to withhold, deserves <em>more</em>.  That topsy-turvy approach conveniently accomplishes the objective of ensuring that the rights this Court held protected in <em>Casey</em>, <em>Lawrence</em>, and other such cases fit the theory\xe2\x80\x94but at the cost of insulting rather than respecting the democratic process. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next constraint Justice Stevens suggests is harder to evaluate.  He describes as \xe2\x80\x9can important tool for guiding judicial discretion\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csensitivity to the interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and the practical realities of contemporary society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 24.  I cannot say whether that sensitivity will really guide judges because I have no idea what it is.  Is it some sixth sense instilled in judges when they ascend to the bench?  Or does it mean judges are more constrained when they agonize about the cosmic conflict between liberty and its potentially harmful consequences?  Attempting to give the concept more precision, Justice Stevens explains that \xe2\x80\x9csensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the need to approach our work with humility and caution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Both traits are undeniably admirable, though what relation they bear to sensitivity is a mystery.  But it makes no difference, for the first case Justice Stevens cites in support, see <em>ibid.</em>,<em> Casey</em>, 505 U. S., at 849, dispels any illusion that he has a meaningful form of judicial modesty in mind.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens offers no examples to illustrate the next constraint: <em>stare decisis</em>, <em>post</em>, at 25.  But his view of it is surely not very confining, since he holds out as a \xe2\x80\x9ccanonical\xe2\x80\x9d exemplar of the proper approach, see <em>post</em>, at 16, 54, <em>Lawrence</em>, which overruled a case decided a mere 17 years earlier, <em>Bowers</em> v. <em>Hardwick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/index.html">478 U. S. 186</a> (1986), see 539 U. S., at 578 (it \xe2\x80\x9cwas not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, Justice Stevens would apply that constraint unevenly: He apparently approves those Warren Court cases that adopted jot-for-jot incorporation of procedural protections for criminal defendants, <em>post</em>, at 11, but would abandon those Warren Court rulings that undercut his approach to substantive rights, on the basis that we have \xe2\x80\x9ccut back\xe2\x80\x9d on cases from that era before, <em>post</em>, at 12.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens also relies on the requirement of a \xe2\x80\x9ccareful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest\xe2\x80\x9d to limit judicial discretion.  <em>Post</em>, at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted).  I certainly agree with that requirement, see <em>Reno</em> v. <em>Flores</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/292/index.html">507 U. S. 292</a>, 302 (1993), though some cases Justice Stevens approves have not applied it seriously, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lawrence</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 562 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions\xe2\x80\x9d).  But if the \xe2\x80\x9ccareful description\xe2\x80\x9d requirement is used in the manner we have hitherto employed, then the enterprise of determining the Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconceptual core,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 23, is a waste of time.  In the cases he cites we sought a careful, specific description of the right at issue in order to determine <em>whether that right, thus narrowly defined, was fundamental</em>.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U. S., at 722\xe2\x80\x93728; <em>Reno</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 302\xe2\x80\x93306; <em>Collins</em> v. <em>Harker Heights</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/115/index.html">503 U. S. 115</a>, 125\xe2\x80\x93129 (1992); <em>Cruzan</em> v. <em>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/261/index.html">497 U. S. 261</a>, 269\xe2\x80\x93279 (1990); see also <em>Vacco</em> v. <em>Quill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/793/index.html">521 U. S. 793</a>, 801\xe2\x80\x93808 (1997).  The threshold step of defining the asserted right with precision is entirely unnecessary, however, if (as Justice Stevens maintains) the \xe2\x80\x9cconceptual core\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cliberty clause,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 23, includes a number of capacious, hazily defined categories.  There is no need to define the right with much precision in order to conclude that it pertains to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cability independently to define [his] identity,\xe2\x80\x9d his \xe2\x80\x9cright to make certain unusually important decisions that will affect his own, or his family\xe2\x80\x99s, destiny,\xe2\x80\x9d or some aspect of his \xe2\x80\x9c[s]elf-determination, bodily integrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political equality, dignity [or] respect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Justice Stevens\xc2\xa0must therefore have in mind some other use for the careful-description requirement\xe2\x80\x94perhaps just as a means of ensuring that courts \xe2\x80\x9cprocee[d] slowly and incrementally,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 25.  But that could be achieved just as well by having them draft their opinions in longhand.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 account of the constraints of his approach did not demonstrate that they do not exist, his application of that approach to the case before us leaves no doubt.  He offers several reasons for concluding that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not fundamental enough to be applied against the States.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] None is persuasive, but more pertinent to my purpose, each is either intrinsically indeterminate, would preclude incorporation of rights we have already held incorporated, or both.  His approach therefore does nothing to stop a judge from arriving at any conclusion he sets out to reach.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens begins with the odd assertion that \xe2\x80\x9cfirearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship to liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d since sometimes they are used to cause (or sometimes accidentally produce) injury to others.  <em>Post</em>, at 35.  The source of the rule that only nonambivalent liberties deserve Due Process protection is never explained\xe2\x80\x94proof that judges applying Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 approach can add new elements to the test as they see fit.  The criterion, moreover, is inherently manipulable.  Surely Justice Stevens does not mean that the Clause covers only rights that have <em>zero </em>harmful effect on <em>anyone</em>.  Otherwise even the First Amendment is out.  Maybe what he means is that the right to keep and bear arms imposes <em>too great</em> a risk to others\xe2\x80\x99 physical well-being.  But as the plurality explains, <em>ante</em>, at 35\xe2\x80\x9336, other rights we have already held incorporated pose similarly substantial risks to public safety.  In all events, Justice Stevens supplies neither a standard for how severe the impairment on others\xe2\x80\x99 liberty must be for a right to be disqualified, nor (of course) any method of measuring the severity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens next suggests that the Second Amendment right is not fundamental because it is \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent in kind\xe2\x80\x9d from other<em> </em>rights we have recognized.  <em>Post</em>, at 37.  In one respect, of course, the right to keep and bear arms <em>is</em> different from some other rights we have held the Clause protects and he would recognize: It is deeply grounded in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition.  But Justice Stevens has a different distinction in mind:  Even though he does \xe2\x80\x9cnot doubt for a moment that many Americans . . . see [firearms] as critical to their way of life as well as to their security,\xe2\x80\x9d he pronounces that owning a handgun is not \xe2\x80\x9ccritical to leading a life of autonomy, dignity, or political equality.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Post</em>, at 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  Who says?  Deciding what is essential to an enlightened, liberty-filled life is an inherently political, moral judgment\xe2\x80\x94the antithesis of an objective approach that reaches conclusions by applying neutral rules to verifiable evidence.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No determination of what rights the Constitution of the United States covers would be complete, of course, without a survey of what <em>other </em>countries do.  <em>Post</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  When it comes to guns, Justice Stevens explains, our Nation is <em>already</em> an outlier among \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced democracies\xe2\x80\x9d; not even our \xe2\x80\x9coldest allies\xe2\x80\x9d protect as robust a right as we do, and we should not widen the gap.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Never mind that he explains neither which countries qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced democracies\xe2\x80\x9d nor why others are irrelevant.  For there is an even clearer indication that this criterion lets judges pick which rights States must respect and those they can ignore: As the plurality shows, <em>ante</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335, and nn. 28\xe2\x80\x9329, this follow-the-foreign-crowd requirement would foreclose rights that we have held (and Justice Stevens accepts) are incorporated, but that other \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced\xe2\x80\x9d nations do not recognize\xe2\x80\x94from the exclusionary rule to the Establishment Clause.  A judge applying Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 approach must either throw all of those rights overboard or, as cases Justice Stevens approves have done in considering unenumerated rights, simply ignore foreign law when it undermines the desired conclusion, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Casey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/505/833/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/833/index.html">505 U. S. 833</a> (making no mention of foreign law).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens also argues that since the right to keep and bear arms was <em>codified</em> for the purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[ing] elimination of the militia,\xe2\x80\x9d it should be viewed as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a federalism provision\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d logically incapable of incorporation.  <em>Post</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9342 (quoting <em>Elk Grove Unified School Dist.</em> v. <em>Newdow</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/1/index.html">542 U. S. 1</a>, 45 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); some internal quotation marks omitted).   This criterion, too, evidently applies only when judges want it to.  The opinion Justice Stevens quotes for the \xe2\x80\x9cfederalism provision\xe2\x80\x9d principle, Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in <em>Newdow</em>, argued that incorporation of the Establishment Clause \xe2\x80\x9cmakes little sense\xe2\x80\x9d because that Clause was originally understood as a limit on congressional interference with state establishments of religion.  <em>Id.</em>, at 49\xe2\x80\x9351.  Justice Stevens, of course, has no problem with applying the Establishment Clause to the States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa04 (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.) (acknowledging that the Establishment Clause \xe2\x80\x9cappl[ies] to the States by incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  While he insists <em>that </em>Clause is not a \xe2\x80\x9cfederalism provision,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 42, n. 40, he does not explain why <em>it</em> is not, but the right to keep and bear arms <em>is</em> (even though only the latter refers to a \xe2\x80\x9cright of the people\xe2\x80\x9d).  The \xe2\x80\x9cfederalism\xe2\x80\x9d argument prevents the incorporation of only <em>certain </em>rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens next argues that even if the right to keep and bear arms is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in some important senses,\xe2\x80\x9d the roots of States\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to regulate guns run just as deep.  <em>Post</em>, at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But this too is true of other rights we have held incorporated.  No fundamental right\xe2\x80\x94not even the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x94is absolute.  The traditional restrictions go to show the scope of the right, not its lack of fundamental character.  At least that is what they show (Justice Stevens would agree) for <em>other </em>rights.  Once again, principles are applied selectively.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 final reason for rejecting incorporation of the Second Amendment reveals, more clearly than any of the others, the game that is afoot.  Assuming that there is a \xe2\x80\x9cplausible constitutional basis\xe2\x80\x9d for holding that the right to keep and bear arms is incorporated, he asserts that we ought not to do so <em>for</em> <em>prudential</em> <em>reasons</em>.  <em>Post</em>, at 47.  Even if we had the authority to withhold rights that are within the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s command (and we assuredly do not), two of the reasons Justice Stevens gives for abstention show just how much power he would hand to judges.  The States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cright to experiment\xe2\x80\x9d with solutions to the problem of gun violence, he says, is at its apex here because \xe2\x80\x9cthe best solution is far from clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 47\xe2\x80\x9348 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is true of most serious social problems\xe2\x80\x94whether, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best solution\xe2\x80\x9d for rampant crime is to admit confessions unless they are affirmatively shown to have been coerced, but see<em> Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>, 444\xe2\x80\x93445 (1966), or to permit jurors to impose the death penalty without a requirement that they be free to consider \xe2\x80\x9cany relevant mitigating factor,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 112 (1982), which in turn leads to the conclusion that defense counsel has provided inadequate defense if he has not conducted a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable investigation\xe2\x80\x9d into potentially mitigating factors, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U.

S. ___ (2009) <em>(per curiam)</em> (reversing grant of habeas relief for sentencing on a crime committed in 1981).  The obviousness of the optimal answer is in the eye of the beholder.  The implication of Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 call for abstention is that if We The Court conclude that They The People\xe2\x80\x99s answers to a problem are silly, we are free to \xe2\x80\x9cinterven[e],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 47, but if we too are uncertain of the right answer, or merely think the States may be on to something, we can loosen the leash.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A second reason Justice Stevens says we should abstain is that the States have shown they are \xe2\x80\x9ccapable\xe2\x80\x9d of protecting the right at issue, and if anything have protected it too much.  <em>Post</em>, at 49.  That reflects an assumption that judges can distinguish between a <em>proper</em> democratic decision to leave things alone (which we should honor), and a case of democratic market failure (which we should step in to correct).  I would not\xe2\x80\x94and no judge should\xe2\x80\x94presume to have that sort of omniscience, which seems to me far more \xe2\x80\x9carrogant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 41, than confining courts\xe2\x80\x99 focus to our own national heritage.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 response to this concurrence, <em>post</em>, at 51\xe2\x80\x9356, makes the usual rejoinder of \xe2\x80\x9cliving Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d advocates to the criticism that it empowers judges to eliminate or expand what the people have prescribed: The traditional, historically focused method, he says, reposes discretion in judges as well.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Historical analysis can be difficult; it sometimes requires resolving threshold questions, and making nuanced judgments about which evidence to consult and how to interpret it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I will stipulate to that.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  But the question to be decided is not whether the historically focused method is a <em>perfect</em> <em>means</em> of restraining aristocratic judicial Constitution-writing; but whether it is the <em>best means available</em> in an imperfect world.  Or indeed, even more narrowly than that: whether it is demonstrably much better than what Justice Stevens proposes.  I think it beyond all serious dispute that it is much less subjective, and intrudes much less upon the democratic process.  It is less subjective because it depends upon a body of evidence susceptible of reasoned analysis rather than a variety of vague ethico-political First Principles whose combined conclusion can be found to point in any direction the judges favor.  In the most controversial matters brought before this Court\xe2\x80\x94for example, the constitutionality of prohibiting abortion, assisted suicide, or homosexual sodomy, or the constitutionality of the death penalty\xe2\x80\x94<em>any </em>historical methodology, under <em>any </em>plausible standard of proof, would lead to the same conclusion.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Moreover, the methodological differences that divide historians, and the varying interpretive assumptions they bring to their work, <em>post</em>, at 52\xe2\x80\x9354,<em> </em>are nothing compared to the differences among the American people (though perhaps not among graduates of prestigious law schools) with regard to the moral judgments Justice Stevens would have courts pronounce.  And whether or not special expertise is needed to answer historical questions, judges most certainly have no \xe2\x80\x9ccomparative\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted), in resolving moral disputes.  What is more, his approach would not eliminate, but multiply, the hard questions courts must confront, since he would not <em>replace</em> history with moral philosophy, but would have courts consider <em>both</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach intrudes less upon the democratic process because the rights it acknowledges are those established by a constitutional history formed by democratic decisions; and the rights it fails to acknowledge are left to be democratically adopted or rejected by the people, with the assurance that their decision is not subject to judicial revision.  Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 approach, on the other hand, deprives the people of that power, since whatever the Constitution and laws may say, the list of protected rights will be whatever courts wish it to be.  After all, he notes, the people have been wrong before, <em>post</em>, at 55,<em> </em>and courts may conclude they are wrong in the future.  Justice Stevens abhors a system in which \xe2\x80\x9cmajorities or powerful interest groups always get their way,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 56, but replaces it with a system in which unelected and life-tenured judges always get their way.  <em> </em>That such usurpation is effected unabashedly, see <em>post</em>, at 53\xe2\x80\x94with \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge\xe2\x80\x99s cards\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0laid on the table,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>\xe2\x80\x94makes it even worse.

Justice Stevens, on the other hand, is free to scan the universe for rights that he thinks \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit in the concept, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d  The point Justice Stevens makes here is merely one example of his demand that an historical approach to the Constitution prove itself, not merely much better than his in restraining judicial invention, but utterly perfect in doing so.

The question in this case is whether the Constitution protects that right against abridgment by the States.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court explains, if this case were litigated before the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s adoption in 1868, the answer to that question would be simple.  In <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan</em> v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore</em>, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), this Court held that the Bill of Rights applied only to the Federal Government.  Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall recalled that the founding generation added the first eight Amendments to the Constitution in response to Antifederalist concerns regarding the extent of federal\xe2\x80\x94not state\xe2\x80\x94power, and held that if \xe2\x80\x9cthe framers of these amendments [had] intended them to be limitations on the powers of the state governments,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthey would have declared this purpose in plain and intelligible language.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 250.

As was evident to many throughout our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s early history, slavery, and the measures designed to protect it, were irreconcilable with the principles of equality, government by consent, and inalienable rights proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence and embedded in our constitutional structure.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 212 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (remarks of Luther Martin)<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9c[S]lavery is inconsistent with the genius of republicanism, and has a tendency to destroy those principles on which it is supported, as it lessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)); A. Lincoln, Speech at Peoria, Ill. (Oct. 16, 1854), reprinted in 2 The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln 266 (R. Basler ed. 1953) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o man is good enough to govern another man, <em>without that other\xe2\x80\x99s consent</em>.  I say this is the leading principle\xe2\x80\x94the sheet anchor of American republicanism. . . . Now the relation of masters and slaves is, <em>pro tanto</em>, a total violation of this principle\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the war, a series of constitutional amendments were adopted to repair the Nation from the damage slavery had caused.  The provision at issue here, \xc2\xa71 of the Fourteenth Amendment, significantly altered our system of government.  The first sentence of that section provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\xe2\x80\x9d  This unambiguously overruled this Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary holding in <em>Dred Scott</em> v. <em>Sandford</em>, 19 How. 393 (1857), that the Constitution did not recognize black Americans as citizens of the United States or their own State.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 405\xe2\x80\x93406.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The meaning of \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s next sentence has divided this Court for many years.  That sentence begins with the command that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  On its face, this appears to grant the persons just made United States citizens a certain collection of rights\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, privileges or immunities\xe2\x80\x94attributable to that status.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents accept that point, but define the relevant collection of rights quite narrowly.  In the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, 16 Wall. 36 (1873), decided just five years after the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s adoption, the Court interpreted this text, now known as the Privileges or Immunities Clause, for the first time.  In a closely divided decision, the Court drew a sharp distinction between the privileges and immunities of state citizenship and those of federal citizenship, and held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected only the latter category of rights from state abridgment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 78.<em> </em>The Court defined that category to include only those rights \xe2\x80\x9cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 79.  This arguably left open the possibility that certain individual rights enumerated in the Constitution could be considered privileges or immunities of federal citizenship.  See<em> ibid.</em> (listing \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right to peaceably assemble\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe privilege of the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>\xe2\x80\x9d as rights potentially protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause).  But the Court soon rejected that proposition, interpreting the Privileges or Immunities Clause even more narrowly in its later cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chief among those cases is <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cruikshank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/542/index.html"></a><a href="/us/92/542/index.html">92 U. S. 542</a> (1876).  There, the Court held that members of a white militia who had brutally murdered as many as 165 black Louisianians congregating outside a courthouse had not deprived the victims of their privileges as American citizens to peaceably assemble or to keep and bear arms.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see L. Keith, The Colfax Massacre 109 (2008).<em> </em>According to the Court, the right to peaceably assemble codified in the First Amendment was not a privilege of United States citizenship because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right  . . . existed long <em>before</em> the adoption of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  92 U. S., at 551 (emphasis added).  Similarly, the Court<em> </em>held that the right to keep and bear arms was not a privilege of United States citizenship because it was not \xe2\x80\x9cin any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 553.  In other words, the reason the Framers codified the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment\xe2\x80\x94its nature as an inalienable right that pre-existed the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s adoption\xe2\x80\x94was the very reason citizens could not enforce it against States through the Fourteenth.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That circular reasoning effectively has been the Court\xe2\x80\x99s last word on the Privileges or Immunities Clause.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In the intervening years, the Court has held that the Clause prevents state abridgment of only a handful of rights, such as the right to travel, see <em>Saenz</em> v. <em>Roe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/489/index.html">526 U. S. 489</a>, 503 (1999), that are not readily described as essential to\nliberty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a consequence of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s marginalization of the Clause, litigants seeking federal protection of fundamental rights turned to the remainder of \xc2\xa71 in search of an alternative fount of such rights.  They found one in a most curious place\xe2\x80\x94that section\xe2\x80\x99s command that every State guarantee \xe2\x80\x9cdue process\xe2\x80\x9d to any person before depriving him of \xe2\x80\x9clife, liberty, or property.\xe2\x80\x9d  At first, litigants argued that this Due Process Clause \xe2\x80\x9cincorporated\xe2\x80\x9d certain procedural rights codified in the Bill of Rights against the States.  The Court generally rejected those claims, however, on the theory that the rights in question were not sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d to warrant such treatment.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hurtado</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/110/516/index.html">110 U. S. 516</a> (1884) (grand jury indictment requirement); <em>Maxwell</em> v. <em>Dow</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/176/581/index.html">176 U. S. 581</a> (1900) (12-person jury requirement); <em>Twining</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/211/78/index.html">211 U. S. 78</a> (1908) (privilege against self-incrimination).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>That changed with time.  The Court came to conclude that certain Bill of Rights guarantees <em>were </em>sufficiently fundamental to fall within \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of \xe2\x80\x9cdue process.\xe2\x80\x9d  These included not only procedural protections listed in the first eight Amendments, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Benton</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/784/index.html">395 U. S. 784</a> (1969) (protection against double jeopardy), but substantive rights as well, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gitlow</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/268/652/index.html">268 U. S. 652</a>, 666 (1925) (right to free speech); <em>Near</em> v. <em>Minnesota ex rel. Olson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/697/index.html">283 U. S. 697</a>, 707 (1931) (same).  In the process of incorporating these rights against the States, the Court often applied them differently against the States than against the Federal Government on the theory that only those \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d aspects of the right required Due Process Clause protection.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Betts</em> v. <em>Brady</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/455/index.html">316 U. S. 455</a>, 473 (1942) (holding that the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant was unable to retain an attorney, but that the Due Process Clause required appointment of counsel in state criminal cases only where \xe2\x80\x9cwant of counsel . . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental fairness\xe2\x80\x9d).  In more recent years, this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cabandoned the notion\xe2\x80\x9d that the guarantees in the Bill of Rights apply differently when incorporated against the States than they do when applied to the Federal Government.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (opinion of the Court) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But our cases continue to adhere to the view that a right is incorporated through the Due Process Clause only if it is sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 37, 42\xe2\x80\x9344 (plurality opinion)\xe2\x80\x94a term the Court has long struggled to define.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While this Court has at times concluded that a right gains \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d status only if it is essential to the American \xe2\x80\x9cscheme of ordered liberty\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19 (plurality opinion) (quoting <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U. S., at 721), the Court has just as often held that a right warrants Due Process Clause protection if it satisfies a far less measurable range of criteria, see <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/558/index.html">539 U. S. 558</a>, 562 (2003) (concluding that the Due Process Clause protects \xe2\x80\x9cliberty of the person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions\xe2\x80\x9d).  Using the latter approach, the Court has determined that the Due Process Clause applies rights against the States that are not mentioned in the Constitution at all, even without seriously arguing that the Clause was originally understood to protect such rights.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lochner</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/index.html">198 U. S. 45</a> (1905); <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Wade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/index.html">410 U. S. 113</a> (1973); <em>Lawrence</em>, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All of this is a legal fiction.  The notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words.  Moreover, this fiction is a particularly dangerous one.  The one theme that links the Court\xe2\x80\x99s substantive due process precedents together is their lack of a guiding principle to distinguish \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental rights that do not.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision illustrates the point.  Replaying a debate that has endured from the inception of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s substantive due process jurisprudence, the dissents laud the \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s substantive due process doctrine, <em>post</em>, at 14 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938 (Breyer, J., dissenting), while the plurality makes yet another effort to impose principled restraints on its exercise, see <em>ante</em>, at 33\xe2\x80\x9341.  But neither side argues that the meaning they attribute to the Due Process Clause was consistent with public understanding at the time of its ratification.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s effort to cabin the exercise of judicial discretion under the Due Process Clause by focusing its inquiry on those rights deeply rooted in American history and tradition invites less opportunity for abuse than the alternatives.  See <em>post</em>, at 7 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (arguing that rights should be incorporated against the States through the Due Process Clause if they are \xe2\x80\x9cwell-suited to the carrying out of . . . constitutional promises\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>post</em>, at 22 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (warning that there is no \xe2\x80\x9call-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of \xe2\x80\x98liberty\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d protected by the Due Process Clause).  But any serious argument over the scope of the Due Process Clause must acknowledge that neither its text nor its history suggests that it protects the many substantive rights this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases now claim it does.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I cannot accept a theory of constitutional interpretation that rests on such tenuous footing.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s substantive due process framework fails to account for both the text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the history that led to its adoption, filling that gap with a jurisprudence devoid of a guiding principle.  I believe the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment offers a superior alternative, and that a return to that meaning would allow this Court to enforce the rights the Fourteenth Amendment is designed to protect with greater clarity and predictability than the substantive due process framework has so far managed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I acknowledge the volume of precedents that have been built upon the substantive due process framework, and I further acknowledge the importance of <em>stare decisis</em> to the stability of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s legal system.  But <em>stare decisis</em> is only an \xe2\x80\x9cadjunct\xe2\x80\x9d of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means.  <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/833/index.html">505 U. S. 833</a>, 963 (1992) (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  It is not \xe2\x80\x9can inexorable command.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lawrence</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 577.  Moreover, as judges, we interpret the Constitution one case or controversy at a time.  The question presented in this case is not whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised, but only whether, and to what extent, a particular clause in the Constitution protects the particular right at issue here.  With the inquiry appropriately narrowed, I believe this case presents an opportunity to reexamine, and begin the process of restoring, the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment agreed upon by those who ratified it.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137, 174 (1803) (Marshall, C.

Because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Privileges or Immunities Clause precedents have presumed just that, I set them aside for the moment and begin with the text.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment declares that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o State . . . shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  In interpreting this language, it is important to recall that constitutional provisions are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98written to be understood by the voters.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heller</em>, 554 U.

Thus, the objective of this inquiry is to discern what \xe2\x80\x9cordinary citizens\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of ratification would have understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean.  554 U.

See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *129 (describing the \xe2\x80\x9crights and liberties\xe2\x80\x9d of Englishmen as \xe2\x80\x9cprivate immunities\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccivil privileges\xe2\x80\x9d).  A number of antebellum judicial decisions used the terms in this manner.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Magill</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, 16 F. Cas. 408, 428 (No. 8,952) (CC ED Pa. 1833) (Baldwin, J.)

In addition, dictionary definitions confirm that the public shared this understanding.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> </em>N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 1039 (C.

Blackstone, for example, used the terms \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimmunities\xe2\x80\x9d to describe both the inalienable rights of individuals and the positive-law rights of corporations.  See 1 Commentaries, at *129 (describing \xe2\x80\x9cprivate immunities\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>residuum</em> of natural liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccivil privileges\xe2\x80\x9d as those \xe2\x80\x9cwhich society has engaged to provide, in lieu of the natural liberties so given up by individuals\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)); <em>id.</em>, at *468 (stating that a corporate charter enables a corporation to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish rules and orders\xe2\x80\x9d that serve as \xe2\x80\x9cthe privileges and immunities . . . of the corporation\xe2\x80\x9d).

These fundamental rights, according to the English tradition, belonged to all people but became legally enforceable only when recognized in legal texts, including acts of Parliament and the decisions of common-law judges.  See B. Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution 77\xe2\x80\x9379 (1967).  These rights included many that later would be set forth in our Federal Bill of Rights, such as the right to petition for redress of grievances, the right to a jury trial, and the right of \xe2\x80\x9cProtestants\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9chave arms for their defence.\xe2\x80\x9d  English Bill of Rights (1689), reprinted in 1 Schwartz 41, 43.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As English subjects, the colonists considered themselves to be vested with the same fundamental rights as other Englishmen.

See 7 Pet., at 247.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even though the Bill of Rights did not apply to the States, other provisions of the Constitution did limit state interference with individual rights.  Article IV, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01 provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The text of this provision resembles the Privileges or Immunities Clause, and it can be assumed that the public\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the latter was informed by its understanding of the former.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Article IV, \xc2\xa72 was derived from a similar clause in the Articles of Confederation, and reflects the dual citizenship the Constitution provided to all Americans after replacing that \xe2\x80\x9cleague\xe2\x80\x9d of separate sovereign States.  <em>Gibbons</em> v. <em>Ogden</em>, 9 Wheat. 1, 187 (1824); see 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \xc2\xa71800, p. 675 (1833).  By virtue of a person\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship in a particular State, he was guaranteed whatever rights and liberties that State\xe2\x80\x99s constitution and laws made available.  Article IV, \xc2\xa72 vested citizens of each State with an additional right: the assurance that they would be afforded the \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges and immunities\xe2\x80\x9d of citizenship in any of the several States in the Union to which they might travel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What were the \xe2\x80\x9cPrivileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States\xe2\x80\x9d?  That question was answered perhaps most famously by Justice Bushrod Washington sitting as Circuit Justice in <em>Corfield </em>v.<em> Coryell</em>, 6 F. Cas. 546, 551\xe2\x80\x93552 (No. 3,230) (CC\xe2\x80\x82ED Pa. 1825).  In that case, a Pennsylvania citizen claimed that a New Jersey law prohibiting nonresidents from harvesting oysters from the State\xe2\x80\x99s waters violated Article IV, \xc2\xa72 because it deprived him, as an out-of-state citizen, of a right New Jersey availed to its own citizens.  <em>Id.</em>, at 550.<em> </em>Justice Washington rejected that argument, refusing to \xe2\x80\x9caccede to the proposition\xe2\x80\x9d that Article IV, \xc2\xa72 entitled \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of the several states . . . to participate in <em>all</em> the rights which belong exclusively to the citizens of any other particular state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 552 (emphasis added).  In his view, Article IV, \xc2\xa72 did not guarantee equal access to all public benefits a State might choose to make available to its citizens.  See <em>id.,</em> at 552.  Instead, it applied only to those rights \xe2\x80\x9cwhich are, in their nature, <em>fundamental</em>; which belong, of right, to the citizens of all free governments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 551 (emphasis added).  Other courts generally agreed with this principle.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Bayley</em>, 23 Mass. 89, 92\xe2\x80\x9393 (1827) (noting that the \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges and immunities\xe2\x80\x9d of citizens in the several States protected by Article IV, \xc2\xa72 are \xe2\x80\x9cqualified and not absolute\xe2\x80\x9d because they do not grant a traveling citizen the right of \xe2\x80\x9csuffrage or of eligibility to office\xe2\x80\x9d in the State to which he travels).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When describing those \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d rights, Justice Washington thought it \xe2\x80\x9cwould perhaps be more tedious than difficult to enumerate\xe2\x80\x9d them all, but suggested that they could \xe2\x80\x9cbe all comprehended under\xe2\x80\x9d a broad list of \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral heads,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rotection by the government,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefit of the writ of habeas corpus,\xe2\x80\x9d and the right of access to \xe2\x80\x9cthe courts of the state,\xe2\x80\x9d among others.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Corfield</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 551\xe2\x80\x93552.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notably, Justice Washington did not indicate whether Article IV, \xc2\xa72 <em>required </em>States to recognize these fundamental rights in their own citizens and thus in sojourning citizens alike, or whether the Clause simply prohibited the States from discriminating against sojourning citizens with respect to whatever fundamental rights state law happened to recognize.  On this question, the weight of legal authorities at the time of Reconstruction indicated that Article IV, \xc2\xa72 prohibited States from discriminating against sojourning citizens when recognizing fundamental rights, but did not require States to recognize those rights and did not prescribe their content.  The highest courts of several States adopted this view, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Van Ingen</em>, 9 Johns. 507, 561 (N.\xc2\xa0Y. Sup. Ct. 1812) (Yates, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 577 (Kent, J.); <em>Campbell</em> v. <em>Morris</em>, 3 H. &amp; McH. 535, 553\xe2\x80\x93554 (Md. Gen. Ct. 1797) (Chase, J.), as did several influential treatise-writers, see T. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations Which Rest Upon the Legislative Power of the State of the American Union 15\xe2\x80\x9316, and n.\xe2\x80\x823 (1868) (reprint 1972) (describing Article IV, \xc2\xa72 as designed \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent discrimination by the several States against the citizens and public proceedings of other States\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 35 (11th ed. 1867) (stating that Article IV, \xc2\xa72 entitles sojourning citizens \xe2\x80\x9cto the privileges that persons of the same description are entitled to in the state to which the removal is made, and to none other\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court adopted the same conclusion in a unanimous opinion just one year after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.  See <em>Paul</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, 8 Wall. 168, 180 (1869).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text examined so far demonstrates three points about the meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause in \xc2\xa71.  First, \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimmunities\xe2\x80\x9d were synonyms for \xe2\x80\x9crights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, both the States and the Federal Government had long recognized the inalienable rights of their citizens.  Third, Article IV, \xc2\xa72 of the Constitution protected traveling citizens against state discrimination with respect to the fundamental rights of state citizenship.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two questions still remain, both provoked by the textual similarity between \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s Privileges or Immunities Clause and Article IV, \xc2\xa72.  The first involves the nature of the rights at stake: Are the privileges or immunities of \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d recognized by \xc2\xa71 the same as the privileges and immunities of \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens in the several States\xe2\x80\x9d to which Article IV, \xc2\xa72 refers?  The second involves the restriction imposed on the States: Does \xc2\xa71, like Article IV, \xc2\xa72, prohibit only discrimination with respect to certain rights <em>if</em> the State chooses to recognize them, or does it require States to recognize those rights?  I address each question in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I start with the nature of the rights that \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s Privileges or Immunities Clause protects.  Section 1 overruled <em>Dred Scott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that blacks were not citizens of either the United States or their own State and, thus, did not enjoy \xe2\x80\x9cthe privileges and immunities of citizens\xe2\x80\x9d embodied in the Constitution.  19 How., at 417.  The Court in <em>Dred Scott </em>did not distinguish between privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States and citizens in the several States, instead referring to the rights of citizens generally.  It did, however, give examples of what the rights of citizens were\xe2\x80\x94the constitutionally enumerated rights of \xe2\x80\x9cthe full liberty of speech\xe2\x80\x9d and the right \xe2\x80\x9cto keep and carry arms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1 protects the rights of citizens \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States\xe2\x80\x9d specifically.  The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the privileges and immunities of such citizens included individual rights enumerated in the Constitution, including the right to keep and bear arms.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nineteenth-century treaties through which the United States acquired territory from other sovereigns routinely promised inhabitants of the newly acquired territories that they would enjoy all of the \xe2\x80\x9crights,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimmunities\xe2\x80\x9d of United States citizens.

In 1820, when the Missouri Territory (which the United States acquired through the Cession Act) sought to enter the Union as a new State, a debate ensued over whether to prohibit slavery within Missouri as a condition of its admission.  Some congressmen argued that prohibiting slavery in Missouri would deprive its inhabitants of the \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges and immunities\xe2\x80\x9d they had been promised by the Cession Act.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 35 Annals of Cong. 1083 (1855) (remarks of Kentucky Rep. Hardin).  But those who opposed slavery in Missouri argued that the right to hold slaves was merely a matter of state property law, not one of the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship guaranteed by the Act.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Daniel Webster was among the leading proponents of the antislavery position.  In his \xe2\x80\x9cMemorial to Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster argued that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he rights, advantages and immunities here spoken of [in the Cession Act] must . . . be such as are recognized or communicated by the Constitution of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d not the \xe2\x80\x9crights, advantages and immunities, derived exclusively from the <em>State</em> governments .\xc2\xa0. . .\xe2\x80\x9d  D. Webster, A Memorial to the Congress of the United States on the Subject of Restraining the Increase of Slavery in New States to be Admitted into the Union 15 (Dec. 15, 1819) (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe obvious meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act, in Webster\xe2\x80\x99s view, was that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the rights derived under the federal Constitution</em> shall be enjoyed by the inhabitants of [the territory].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (emphasis added).  In other words, Webster articulated a distinction between the rights of United States citizenship and the rights of state citizenship, and argued that the former included those rights \xe2\x80\x9crecognized or communicated by the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Since the right to hold slaves was not mentioned in the Constitution, it was not a right of federal citizenship.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Webster and his allies ultimately lost the debate over slavery in Missouri and the territory was admitted as a slave State as part of the now-famous Missouri Compromise.  Missouri Enabling Act of March 6, 1820, ch. 22, \xc2\xa78, 3 Stat. 548.  But their arguments continued to inform public understanding of the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship.  In 1854, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial was republished in a pamphlet discussing the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s next major debate on slavery\xe2\x80\x94the proposed repeal of the Missouri Compromise through the Kansas-Nebraska Act, see The Nebraska Question: Comprising Speeches in the United States Senate: Together with the History of the Missouri Compromise 9\xe2\x80\x9312 (1854).  It was published again in 1857 in a collection of famous American speeches.

In 1868, President Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation granting amnesty to former Confederates, guaranteeing \xe2\x80\x9cto all and to every person who directly or indirectly participated in the late insurrection or rebellion, a full pardon and amnesty for the offence of treason . . . with restoration of <em>all rights, privileges, and immunities under the Constitution </em>and the laws which have been made in pursuance thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 Stat. 712.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Records from the 39th Congress further support this understanding.</p>\n<p align="left">a</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the Civil War, Congress established the Joint Committee on Reconstruction to investigate circumstances in the Southern States and to determine whether, and on what conditions, those States should be readmitted to the Union.  See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 6, 30 (1865) (hereinafter 39th Cong. Globe); M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights 57 (1986) (hereinafter Curtis).  That Committee would ultimately recommend the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, justifying its recommendation by submitting a report to Congress that extensively catalogued the abuses of civil rights in the former slave States and argued that \xe2\x80\x9cadequate security for future peace and safety . . . can only be found in such changes of the organic law as shall determine the civil rights and privileges of all citizens in all parts of the republic.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, S.

In addition, newspaper coverage suggests that the wider public was aware of the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s work even before the Report was issued.  For example, the Fort Wayne Daily Democrat (which appears to have been unsupportive of the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s work) paraphrased a motion instructing the Committee to</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cenquire into [the] expediency of amending the Constitution of the United States so as to declare with greater certainty the power of Congress to enforce and determine by appropriate legislation all the guarantees contained in <em>that instrument</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Nigger Congress!, Fort Wayne Daily Democrat, Feb. 1, 1866, p. 4 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">b</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Statements made by Members of Congress leading up to, and during, the debates on the Fourteenth Amendment point in the same direction.  The record of these debates has been combed before.  See <em>Adamson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/46/index.html">332 U.

Before considering that record here, it is important to clarify its relevance.  When interpreting constitutional text, the goal is to discern the most likely public understanding of a particular provision at the time it was adopted.  Statements by legislators can assist in this process to the extent they demonstrate the manner in which the public used or understood a particular word or phrase.  They can further assist to the extent there is evidence that these statements were disseminated to the public.  In other words, this evidence is useful not because it demonstrates what the draftsmen of the text may have been thinking, but only insofar as it illuminates what the public understood the words chosen by the draftsmen to mean.</p>\n<p align="left">(1)</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three speeches stand out as particularly significant.  Representative John Bingham, the principal draftsman of \xc2\xa71, delivered a speech on the floor of the House in February 1866 introducing his first draft of the provision.  Bingham began by discussing <em>Barron</em> and its holding that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the States.  He then argued that a constitutional amendment was necessary to provide \xe2\x80\x9can express grant of power in Congress to enforce by penal enactment these great canons of the supreme law, securing to all the citizens in every State all the privileges and immunities of citizens, and to all the people all the sacred rights of person.\xe2\x80\x9d  39th Cong. Globe 1089\xe2\x80\x931090 (1866).  Bingham emphasized that \xc2\xa71 was designed \xe2\x80\x9cto arm the Congress of the United States, by the consent of the people of the United States, with the power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today.  It \xe2\x80\x98hath that extent\xe2\x80\x94no more.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1088.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Bingham\xe2\x80\x99s speech was printed in pamphlet form and broadly distributed in 1866 under the title, \xe2\x80\x9cOne Country, One Constitution, and One People,\xe2\x80\x9d and the subtitle, \xe2\x80\x9cIn Support of the Proposed Amendment to Enforce the Bill of Rights.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Newspapers<em> </em>also<em> </em>reported his proposal, with the New York Times providing particularly extensive coverage, including a full reproduction of Bingham\xe2\x80\x99s first draft of \xc2\xa71 and his remarks that a constitutional amendment to \xe2\x80\x9cenforc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cimmortal bill of rights\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely essential to American nationality.\xe2\x80\x9d  N.

Globe 1088.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That draft was met with objections, which the Times<em> </em>covered extensively.  A front-page article hailed the \xe2\x80\x9cClear and Forcible Speech\xe2\x80\x9d by Representative Robert Hale against the draft, explaining\xe2\x80\x94and endorsing\xe2\x80\x94Hale\xe2\x80\x99s view that Bingham\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would \xe2\x80\x9cconfer upon Congress all the rights and power of legislation now reserved to the States\xe2\x80\x9d and would \xe2\x80\x9cin effect utterly obliterate State rights and State authority over their own internal affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  N.\xc2\xa0Y.

Indeed, Hale stated that he believed (incorrectly in light of <em>Barron</em>) that individual rights enumerated in the Constitution were already enforceable against the States.  See 39th Cong. Globe 1064 (\xe2\x80\x9cI have, somehow or other, gone along with the impression that there is that sort of protection thrown over us in some way, whether with or without the sanction of a judicial decision that we are so protected\xe2\x80\x9d); see N.\xc2\xa0Y.

But that is secondary to the point that the Times\xe2\x80\x99<em> </em>coverage of this debate over \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s meaning suggests public awareness of its main contours\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that \xc2\xa71 would, at a minimum, enforce constitutionally enumerated rights of United States citizens against the States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bingham\xe2\x80\x99s draft was tabled for several months.  In the interim, he delivered a second well-publicized speech, again arguing that a constitutional amendment was required to give Congress the power to enforce the Bill of Rights against the States.  That speech was printed in pamphlet form, see Speech of Hon. John A. Bingham, of Ohio, on the Civil Rights Bill, Mar. 9, 1866 (Cong. Globe); see 39th Cong. Globe 1837 (remarks of Rep.

Senator Jacob Howard introduced the new draft on the floor of the Senate in the third speech relevant here.  Howard explained that the Constitution recognized \xe2\x80\x9ca mass of privileges, immunities, and rights, some of them secured by the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution, . . . some by the first eight amendments of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no power given in the Constitution to enforce and to carry out any of these guarantees\xe2\x80\x9d against the States.  39th Cong. Globe 2765.  Howard then stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe great object\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71 was to \xe2\x80\x9crestrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2766.  Section 1, he indicated, imposed \xe2\x80\x9ca general prohibition upon all the States, as such, from abridging the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2765.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In describing these rights, Howard explained that they included \xe2\x80\x9cthe privileges and immunities spoken of\xe2\x80\x9d in Article IV, \xc2\xa72.  <em>Id., </em>at 2765.  Although he did not catalogue the precise \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cextent\xe2\x80\x9d of those rights, he thought \xe2\x80\x9cCorfield <em>v.</em> Coryell\xe2\x80\x9d provided a useful description.  Howard then submitted that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[t]o these privileges and immunities, whatever they may be\xe2\x80\x94 . . . should be added <em>the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution</em>; such as the freedom of speech and of the press; the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances, [and] . . . <em>the right to keep and to bear arms</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0News of Howard\xe2\x80\x99s speech was carried in major newspapers across the country, including the New York Herald, see N.

Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 187 (1998) (hereinafter Amar).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The New York Times carried the speech as well, reprinting a lengthy excerpt of Howard\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, including the statements quoted above.

Between passing the Thirteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94which outlawed slavery alone\xe2\x80\x94and the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress passed two significant pieces of legislation.  The first was the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which provided that \xe2\x80\x9call persons born in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9csuch citizens, of every race and color, . . . shall have the same right\xe2\x80\x9d to, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cfull and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ch. 31, \xc2\xa71, 14 Stat. 27.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both proponents and opponents of this Act described it as providing the \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges\xe2\x80\x9d of citizenship to freedmen, and defined those privileges to include constitutional rights, such as the right to keep and bear arms.  See 39th Cong. Globe 474 (remarks of Sen. Trumbull) (stating that the \xe2\x80\x9cthe late slaveholding States\xe2\x80\x9d had enacted laws \xe2\x80\x9cdepriving persons of African descent of privileges which are essential to freemen,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[ing] any negro or mulatto from having fire-arms\xe2\x80\x9d and stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he purpose of the bill under consideration is to destroy all these discriminations\xe2\x80\x9d); id.</em>, at 1266\xe2\x80\x931267 (remarks of Rep.

Many statements by Members of Congress corroborate the view that the Privileges or Immunities Clause enforced constitutionally enumerated rights against the States.  See Curtis 112 (collecting examples).  I am not aware of any statement that directly refutes that proposition.  That said, the record of the debates\xe2\x80\x94like most legislative history\xe2\x80\x94is less than crystal clear.  In particular, much ambiguity derives from the fact that at least several Members described \xc2\xa71 as protecting the privileges and immunities of citizens \xe2\x80\x9cin the several States,\xe2\x80\x9d harkening back to Article IV, \xc2\xa72.  See supra</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (describing Sen. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s speech).<em> </em>These statements can be read to support the view that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects some or all the fundamental rights of \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens\xe2\x80\x9d described in <em>Corfield</em>.  They can also be read to support the view that the Privileges or Immunities Clause, like Article IV, \xc2\xa72, prohibits only state discrimination with respect to those rights it covers, but does not deprive States of the power to deny those rights to all citizens equally.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I examine the rest of the historical record with this understanding.  But for purposes of discerning what the public most likely thought the Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean, it is significant that the most widely publicized statements by the legislators who voted on \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x94Bingham, Howard, and even Hale\xe2\x80\x94point unambiguously toward the conclusion that the Privileges or Immunities Clause enforces at least those fundamental rights enumerated in the Constitution against the States, including the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.  </p>\n<p align="left"> 3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment in the period immediately following its ratification help to establish the public understanding of the text at the time of its adoption. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some of these interpretations come from Members of Congress.  During an 1871 debate on a bill to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, Representative Henry Dawes listed the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s first eight Amendments, including \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to keep and bear arms,\xe2\x80\x9d before explaining that after the Civil War, the country \xe2\x80\x9cgave the most grand of all these rights, privileges, and immunities, by one single amendment to the Constitution, to four millions of American citizens\xe2\x80\x9d who formerly were slaves.  Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 475\xe2\x80\x93476 (1871).  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all these,\xe2\x80\x9d Dawes explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich are comprehended in the words \xe2\x80\x98American citizen.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid</em>.<em>; </em>see also <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 334 (remarks of Rep. Hoar) (stating that the Privileges or Immunities Clause referred to those rights \xe2\x80\x9cdeclared to belong to the citizen by the Constitution itself\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even opponents of Fourteenth Amendment enforcement legislation acknowledged that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected constitutionally enumerated individual rights.  See 2 Cong. Rec. 384\xe2\x80\x93385 (1874) (remarks of Rep. Mills) (opposing enforcement law, but acknowledging, in referring to the Bill of Rights, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hese first amendments and some provisions of the Constitution of like import embrace the \xe2\x80\x98privileges and immunities\xe2\x80\x99 of citizenship as set forth in article 4, section 2 of the Constitution <em>and in the fourteenth amendment</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); see Curtis 166\xe2\x80\x93170 (collecting examples).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Legislation passed in furtherance of the Fourteenth Amendment demonstrates even more clearly this understanding.  For example, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, which was titled in pertinent part \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and which is codified in the still-existing 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  That statute prohibits state officials from depriving citizens of \xe2\x80\x9cany rights, privileges, or immunities <em>secured by the Constitution</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 (emphasis added).  Although the Judiciary ignored this provision for decades after its enactment, this Court has come to interpret the statute, unremarkably in light of its text, as protecting constitutionally enumerated rights.  <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/index.html">365 U. S. 167</a>, 171 (1961).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A Federal Court of Appeals decision written by a future Justice of this Court adopted the same understanding of the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United</em> <em>States</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, 26 F. Cas. 79, 82 (No. 15,282) (CC SD Ala. 1871) (Woods, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe think, therefore, that the . . . rights enumerated in the first eight articles of amendment to the constitution of the United States, are the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, two of the era\xe2\x80\x99s major constitutional treatises reflected the understanding that \xc2\xa71 would protect constitutionally enumerated rights from state abridgment.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  A third such treatise unambiguously indicates that the Privileges or Immunities Clause accomplished this task.  G. Paschal, The Constitution of the United States 290 (1868) (explaining that the rights listed in \xc2\xa71 had \xe2\x80\x9calready been guarantied\xe2\x80\x9d by Article IV and the Bill of Rights, but that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he new feature declared\xe2\x80\x9d by \xc2\xa71 was that these rights, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich had been construed to apply only to the national government, are thus imposed upon the States\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another example of public understanding comes from United States Attorney Daniel Corbin\xe2\x80\x99s statement in an 1871 Ku Klux Klan prosecution.  Corbin cited <em>Barron</em> and declared:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he fourteenth amendment changes all that theory, and lays the same restriction upon the States that before lay upon the Congress of the United States\xe2\x80\x94that, as Congress heretofore could not interfere with the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms, now, after the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, the State cannot interfere with the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms.  The right to keep and bear arms is included in the fourteenth amendment, under \xe2\x80\x98privileges and immunities.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Proceedings in the Ku Klux Trials at Columbia, S.\xc2\xa0C., in the United States Circuit Court, November Term, 1871, p.\xc2\xa0147 (1872).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This evidence plainly shows that the ratifying public understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the right to keep and bear arms.  As the Court demonstrates, there can be no doubt that \xc2\xa71 was understood to enforce the Second Amendment against the States.  See <em>ante</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9333.  In my view, this is because the right to keep and bear arms was understood to be a privilege of American citizenship guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next question is whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause merely prohibits States from discriminating among citizens if they recognize the Second Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s right to keep and bear arms, or whether the Clause requires States to recognize the right.  The municipal respondents, Chicago and Oak Park, argue for the former interpretation.  They contend that the Second Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth, authorizes a State to impose an outright ban on handgun possession such as the ones at issue here so long as a State applies it to all citizens equally.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The Court explains why this antidiscrimination-only reading of \xc2\xa71 as a whole is \xe2\x80\x9cimplausible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 31 (citing Brief for Municipal Respondents 64).  I agree, but because I think it is the Privileges or Immunities Clause that applies this right to the States, I must explain why this Clause in particular protects against more than just state discrimination, and in fact establishes a minimum baseline of rights for all American citizens.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I begin, again, with the text.  The Privileges or Immunities Clause opens with the command that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>No State shall</em>\xe2\x80\x9d abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.  Amdt. 14, \xc2\xa71 (emphasis added).  The very same phrase opens Article I, \xc2\xa710 of the Constitution, which prohibits the States from \xe2\x80\x9cpass[ing] any Bill of Attainder\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cex post facto Law,\xe2\x80\x9d among other things.  Article I, \xc2\xa710 is one of the few constitutional provisions that limits state authority.  In <em>Barron</em>, when Chief Justice Marshall interpreted the Bill of Rights as lacking \xe2\x80\x9cplain and intelligible language\xe2\x80\x9d restricting state power to infringe upon individual liberties, he pointed to Article I, \xc2\xa710 as an example of text that would have accomplished that task.  7 Pet., at 250.  Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall would later describe Article I, \xc2\xa710 as \xe2\x80\x9ca bill of rights for the people of each state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fletcher</em> v. <em>Peck</em>, 6 Cranch 87, 138 (1810).  Thus, the fact that the Privileges or Immunities Clause uses the command \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o State shall\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which Article IV, \xc2\xa72 does not\xe2\x80\x94strongly suggests that the former imposes a greater restriction on state power than the latter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation is strengthened when one considers that the Privileges or Immunities Clause uses the verb \xe2\x80\x9cabridge,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate,\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the limit it imposes on state authority.  The Webster\xe2\x80\x99s dictionary in use at the time of Reconstruction defines the word \xe2\x80\x9cabridge\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o deprive; to cut off; . . . as, to <em>abridge</em> one of his rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language, at 6.  The Clause is thus best understood to impose a limitation on state power to infringe upon pre-existing substantive rights.  It raises no indication that the Framers of the Clause used the word \xe2\x80\x9cabridge\xe2\x80\x9d to prohibit only discrimination.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This most natural textual reading is underscored by a well-publicized revision to the Fourteenth Amendment that the Reconstruction Congress rejected.  After several Southern States refused to ratify the Amendment, President Johnson met with their Governors to draft a compromise.  N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Feb. 5, 1867, p.\xc2\xa05.  Their proposal eliminated Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to enforce the Amendment (granted in \xc2\xa75), and replaced the Privileges or Immunities Clause in \xc2\xa71 with the following: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States, and of the States in which they reside, and the Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all <em>the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Draft reprinted in 1 Documentary History of Reconstruction 240 (W. Fleming ed. 1950) (hereinafter Fleming).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Significantly, this proposal removed the \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o State shall\xe2\x80\x9d directive and the verb \xe2\x80\x9cabridge\xe2\x80\x9d from \xc2\xa71, and<em> </em>also changed the class of rights to be protected from those belonging to \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to those of the \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens in the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  This phrasing is materially indistinguishable from Article IV, \xc2\xa72, which generally was understood as an antidiscrimination provision alone.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9318.  The proposal thus strongly indicates that at least the President of the United States and several southern Governors thought that the Privileges or Immunities Clause, which they unsuccessfully tried to revise, prohibited more than just state-sponsored discrimination.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits no more than discrimination often is followed by a claim that public discussion of the Clause, and of \xc2\xa71 generally, was not extensive.  Because of this, the argument goes, \xc2\xa71 must not have been understood to accomplish such a significant task as subjecting States to federal enforcement of a minimum baseline of rights.  That argument overlooks critical aspects of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history that underscored the need for, and wide agreement upon, federal enforcement of constitutionally enumerated rights against the States, including the right to keep and bear arms. </p>\n<p align="left">a</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I turn first to public debate at the time of ratification.  It is true that the congressional debates over \xc2\xa71 were relatively brief.  It is also true that there is little evidence of extensive debate in the States.  Many state legislatures did not keep records of their debates, and the few records that do exist reveal only modest discussion.  See Curtis 145.  These facts are not surprising.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, however consequential we consider the question today, the nationalization of constitutional rights was not the most controversial aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment at the time of its ratification.  The Nation had just endured a tumultuous civil war, and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72, 3, and 4\xe2\x80\x94which reduced the representation of States that denied voting rights to blacks, deprived most former Confederate officers of the power to hold elective office, and required States to disavow Confederate war debts\xe2\x80\x94were far more polarizing and consumed far more political attention.  See Wildenthal 1600; Hardy, Original Popular Understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of 1866\xe2\x80\x931868, 30 Whittier L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 695, 699 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the congressional debates on the Fourteenth Amendment reveal that many representatives, and probably many citizens, believed that the Thirteenth Amendment, the 1866 Civil Rights legislation, or some combination of the two, had already enforced constitutional rights against the States.  Justice Black\xe2\x80\x99s dissent in <em>Adamson </em>chronicles this point in detail.  332 U. S., at 107\xe2\x80\x93108 (Appendix to dissenting opinion).  Regardless of whether that understanding was accurate as a matter of constitutional law, it helps to explain why Congressmen had little to say during the debates about \xc2\xa71.  See <em>ibid.</em></font></p><font b="1"><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, while <em>Barron</em> made plain that the Bill of Rights was not legally enforceable against the States, see <em>supra</em>, at 2, the significance of that holding should not be overstated.  Like the Framers, see <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, many 19th-century Americans understood the Bill of Rights to declare inalienable rights that pre-existed all government.  Thus, even though the Bill of Rights technically applied only to the Federal Government, many believed that it declared rights that no legitimate government could abridge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chief Justice Henry Lumpkin\xe2\x80\x99s decision for the Georgia Supreme Court in <em>Nunn </em>v. <em>State</em>, 1 Ga. 243 (1846), illustrates this view.  In assessing state power to regulate firearm possession, Lumpkin wrote that he was \xe2\x80\x9caware that it has been decided, that [the Second Amendment], like other amendments adopted at the same time, is a restriction upon the government of the United States, and does not extend to the individual States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 250.  But he still considered the right to keep and bear arms as \xe2\x80\x9can unalienable right, which lies at the bottom of every free government,<em>\xe2\x80\x9d</em> and thus found the States bound to honor it.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Other state courts adopted similar positions with respect to the right to keep and bear arms and other enumerated rights.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] Some courts even suggested that the protections in the Bill of Rights were legally enforceable against the States, <em>Barron</em> notwithstanding.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  A prominent treatise of the era took the same position.  W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America 124\xe2\x80\x93125 (2d ed. 1829) (reprint 2009) (arguing that certain of the first eight Amendments \xe2\x80\x9cappl[y] to the state legislatures\xe2\x80\x9d because those Amendments \xe2\x80\x9cform parts of the declared rights of the people, of which neither the state powers nor those of the Union can ever deprive them\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 125\xe2\x80\x93126 (describing the Second Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cright of the people to keep and bear arms\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca restraint on both\xe2\x80\x9d Congress and the States); see also <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 34) (describing Rawle\xe2\x80\x99s treatise as \xe2\x80\x9cinfluential\xe2\x80\x9d).  Certain abolitionist leaders adhered to this view as well.  Lysander Spooner championed the popular abolitionist argument that slavery was inconsistent with constitutional principles, citing as evidence the fact that it deprived black Americans of the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural right of all men \xe2\x80\x98to keep and bear arms\xe2\x80\x99 for their personal defence,\xe2\x80\x9d which he believed the Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[ed] both Congress and the State governments from infringing.\xe2\x80\x9d  L. Spooner, The Unconstitutionality of Slavery 98 (1860).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, some appear to have believed that the Bill of Rights <em>did </em>apply to the States, even though this Court had squarely rejected that theory.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (recounting Rep. Hale\xe2\x80\x99s argument to this effect). Many others believed that the liberties codified in the Bill of Rights were ones that no State <em>should </em>abridge, even though they understood that the Bill technically did not apply to States.  These beliefs, combined with the fact that most state constitutions recognized many, if not all, of the individual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, made the need for federal enforcement of constitutional liberties against the States an afterthought.  See <em>ante</em>, at 29 (opinion of the Court) (noting that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n 1868, 22 of the 37 States in the Union had state constitutional provisions explicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms\xe2\x80\x9d).  That changed with the national conflict over slavery. </p>\n<p align="left">b</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the contentious years leading up to the Civil War, those who sought to retain the institution of slavery found that to do so, it was necessary to eliminate more and more of the basic liberties of slaves, free blacks, and white abolitionists.  Congressman Tobias Plants explained that slaveholders \xe2\x80\x9ccould not hold [slaves] safely where dissent was permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d so they decided that \xe2\x80\x9call dissent must be suppressed by the strong hand of power.\xe2\x80\x9d  39th Cong. Globe 1013.  The measures they used were ruthless, repressed virtually every right recognized in the Constitution, and demonstrated that preventing only discriminatory state firearms restrictions would have been a hollow assurance for liberty.  Public reaction indicates that the American people understood this point.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The overarching goal of pro-slavery forces was to repress the spread of abolitionist thought and the concomitant risk of a slave rebellion.  Indeed, it is difficult to overstate the extent to which fear of a slave uprising gripped slaveholders and dictated the acts of Southern legislatures.  Slaves and free blacks represented a substantial percentage of the population and posed a severe threat to Southern order if they were not kept in their place.  According to the 1860 Census, slaves represented one quarter or more of the population in 11 of the 15 slave States, nearly half the population in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana, and <em>more</em> than 50% of the population in Mississippi and South Carolina.  Statistics of the United States (Including Mortality, Property, &amp;c.,) in 1860, The Eighth Census 336\xe2\x80\x93350 (1866).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Southern fear of slave rebellion was not unfounded.  Although there were others, two particularly notable slave uprisings heavily influenced slaveholders in the South.  In 1822, a group of free blacks and slaves led by Denmark Vesey planned a rebellion in which they would slay their masters and flee to Haiti.  H. Aptheker, American Negro Slave Revolts 268\xe2\x80\x93270 (1983).  The plan was foiled, leading to the swift arrest of 130 blacks, and the execution of 37, including Vesey.  <em>Id.</em>, at 271.  Still, slaveowners took notice\xe2\x80\x94it was reportedly feared that as many as 6,600 to 9,000 slaves and free blacks were involved in the plot.  <em>Id.</em>, at 272.  A few years later, the fear of rebellion was realized.  An uprising led by Nat Turner took the lives of at least 57 whites before it was suppressed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 300\xe2\x80\x93302.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fear generated by these and other rebellions led Southern legislatures to take particularly vicious aim at the rights of free blacks and slaves to speak or to keep and bear arms for their defense.  Teaching slaves to read (even the Bible) was a criminal offense punished severely in some States.  See K. Stampp, The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-bellum South 208, 211 (1956).  Virginia made it a crime for a member of an \xe2\x80\x9cabolition\xe2\x80\x9d society to enter the State and argue \xe2\x80\x9cthat the owners of slaves have no property in the same, or advocate or advise the abolition of slavery.\xe2\x80\x9d  1835\xe2\x80\x931836 Va. Acts ch. 66, p.\xc2\xa044.  Other States prohibited the circulation of literature denying a master\xe2\x80\x99s right to property in his slaves and passed laws requiring postmasters to inspect the mails in search of such material.  C. Eaton, The Freedom-of-Thought Struggle in the Old South 118\xe2\x80\x93143, 199\xe2\x80\x93200 (1964).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting slaves from carrying firearms[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] to apply the prohibition to free blacks as well.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Act of Dec. 23, 1833, \xc2\xa77, 1833 Ga. Acts pp.\xc2\xa0226, 228 (declaring that \xe2\x80\x9cit shall not be lawful for any free person of colour in this state, to own, use, or carry fire arms of any description whatever\xe2\x80\x9d); H.

Laws p.\xc2\xa0328 (repealing laws allowing free blacks to obtain firearms licenses); Act of Jan. 31, 1831, 1831 Fla. Acts p.\xc2\xa030 (same).  Florida made it the \xe2\x80\x9cduty\xe2\x80\x9d of white citizen \xe2\x80\x9cpatrol[s] to search negro houses or other suspected places, for fire arms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Feb. 17, 1833, ch. 671, 1833 Fla. Acts pp.\xc2\xa026, 30.  If they found any firearms, the patrols were to take the offending slave or free black \xe2\x80\x9cto the nearest justice of the peace,\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon he would be \xe2\x80\x9cseverely punished\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cwhipping on the bare back, not exceeding thirty-nine lashes,\xe2\x80\x9d unless he could give a \xe2\x80\x9cplain and satisfactory\xe2\x80\x9d explanation of how he came to possess the gun.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Southern blacks were not alone in facing threats to their personal liberty and security during the antebellum era.  Mob violence in many Northern cities presented dangers as well.  Cottrol &amp; Diamond, The Second Amendment: Toward an Afro-Americanist Reconsideration, 80 Geo. L. J. 309, 340 (1991) (hereinafter Cottrol) (recounting a July 1834 mob attack against \xe2\x80\x9cchurches, homes, and businesses of white abolitionists and blacks\xe2\x80\x9d in New York that involved \xe2\x80\x9cupwards of twenty thousand people and required the intervention of the militia to suppress\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (noting an uprising in Boston nine years later in which a confrontation between a group of white sailors and four blacks led \xe2\x80\x9ca mob of several hundred whites<em>\xe2\x80\x9d </em>to \xe2\x80\x9cattac[k] and severely beat every black they could find\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">c</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the Civil War, Southern anxiety about an uprising among the newly freed slaves peaked.  As Representative Thaddeus Stevens is reported to have said, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen it was first proposed to free the slaves, and arm the blacks, did not half the nation tremble?  The prim conservatives, the snobs, and the male waiting-maids in Congress, were in hysterics.\xe2\x80\x9d  K. Stampp, The Era of Reconstruction, 1865\xe2\x80\x931877, p.\xc2\xa0104 (1965) (hereinafter Era of Reconstruction).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court explains, this fear led to \xe2\x80\x9csystematic efforts\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9cold Confederacy\xe2\x80\x9d to disarm the more than 180,000 freedmen who had served in the Union Army, as well as other free blacks.  See <em>ante</em>, at 23.  Some States formally prohibited blacks from possessing firearms.  <em>Ante, </em>at 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (quoting 1865 Miss. Laws p.\xc2\xa0165, \xc2\xa71, reprinted in 1 Fleming 289).  Others enacted legislation prohibiting blacks from carrying firearms without a license, a restriction not imposed on whites.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, La. Statute of 1865, reprinted in <em>id., </em>at 280.  Additionally, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hroughout the South, armed parties, often consisting of ex-Confederate soldiers serving in the state militias, forcibly took firearms from newly freed slaves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court makes crystal clear, if the Fourteenth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9chad outlawed only those laws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude, African-Americans in the South would likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 32.  In the years following the Civil War, a law banning firearm possession outright \xe2\x80\x9cwould have been nondiscriminatory only in the formal sense,\xe2\x80\x9d for it would have \xe2\x80\x9cleft firearms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Evidence suggests that the public understood this at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.  The publicly circulated Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction extensively detailed these abuses, see <em>ante, </em>at 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (collecting examples), and statements by citizens indicate that they looked to the Committee to provide a federal solution to this problem, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 39th Cong. Globe 337 (remarks of Rep. Sumner) (introducing \xe2\x80\x9ca memorial from the colored citizens of the State of South Carolina\xe2\x80\x9d asking for, <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional protection in keeping arms, in holding public assemblies, and in complete liberty of speech and of the press\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One way in which the Federal Government responded was to issue military orders countermanding Southern arms legislation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> </em>Jan. 17, 1866, order from Major General D. E. Sickles, reprinted in E. McPherson, The Political History of the United States of America During the Period of Reconstruction 37 (1871) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe constitutional rights of all loyal and well-disposed inhabitants to bear arms will not be infringed\xe2\x80\x9d).  The significance of these steps was not lost on those they were designed to protect.  After one such order was issued, The Christian Recorder, published by the African Methodist Episcopal Church, published the following editorial:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We have several times alluded to the fact that the Constitution of the United States, guaranties to every citizen the right to keep and bear arms. . . .

See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> </em>J. Tiffany, Treatise on the Unconstitutionality of American Slavery 56 (1849) (reprint 1969) (\xe2\x80\x9cpledg[ing] . . . to see that all the rights, privileges, and immunities, granted by the constitution of the United States, are extended to all\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 99 (describing the \xe2\x80\x9cright to keep and bear arms\xe2\x80\x9d as one of those rights secured by \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitution of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  The problem abolitionists sought to remedy was that, under <em>Dred Scott</em>, blacks were not entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens under the Federal Constitution and that, in many States, whatever inalienable rights state law recognized did not apply to blacks.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cooper</em> v. <em>Savannah</em>, 4 Ga. 68, 72 (1848) (deciding, just two years after Chief Justice Lumpkin\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Nunn</em> recognizing the right to keep and bear arms, see <em>supra</em>, at 39, that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ree persons of color have never been recognized here as citizens; they are not entitled to bear arms\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1 guaranteed the rights of citizenship in the United States and in the several States without regard to race.  But it was understood that liberty would be assured little protection if \xc2\xa71 left each State to decide which privileges or immunities of United States citizenship it would protect.  As Frederick Douglass explained before \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s adoption, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislatures of the South can take from him the right to keep and bear arms, as they can\xe2\x80\x94they would not allow a negro to walk with a cane where I came from, they would not allow five of them to assemble together.\xe2\x80\x9d  In What New Skin Will the Old Snake Come Forth?

See <em>Cruikshank</em>, 92 U. S., at 548\xe2\x80\x93549, 551\xe2\x80\x93553.  I must, therefore, consider whether <em>stare</em> <em>decisis</em> requires retention of those precedents.  As mentioned at the outset, my inquiry is limited to the right at issue here.  Thus, I do not endeavor to decide in this case whether, or to what extent, the Privileges or Immunities Clause applies any other rights enumerated in the Constitution against the States.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Nor do I suggest that the <em>stare decisis</em> considerations surrounding the application of the right to keep and bear arms against the States would be the same as those surrounding another right protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  I consider <em>stare decisis</em> only as it applies to the question presented here.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This inquiry begins with the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>.  There, this Court upheld a Louisiana statute granting a monopoly on livestock butchering in and around the city of New Orleans to a newly incorporated company.  16 Wall. 36.  Butchers excluded by the monopoly sued, claiming that the statute violated the Privileges or Immunities Clause because it interfered with their right to pursue and \xe2\x80\x9cexercise their trade.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 60.  This Court rejected the butchers\xe2\x80\x99 claim, holding that their asserted right was not a privilege or immunity of American citizenship, but one governed by the States alone.  The Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected only rights of <em>federal </em>citizenship\xe2\x80\x94those \xe2\x80\x9cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 79\xe2\x80\x94and did not protect <em>any\n</em>of the rights of state<em> </em>citizenship, <em>id.</em>, at 74.<em> </em>In other\nwords, the Court defined the two sets of rights as mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After separating these two sets of rights, the Court defined the rights of state citizenship as \xe2\x80\x9cembrac[ing] nearly every civil right for the establishment and protection of which organized government is instituted\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, all those rights listed in <em>Corfield</em>.  16 Wall., at 76 (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthose rights\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cJudge Washington\xe2\x80\x9d described).  That left very few rights of federal citizenship for the Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect.  The Court suggested a handful of possibilities, such as the \xe2\x80\x9cright of free access to [federal] seaports,\xe2\x80\x9d protection of the Federal Government while traveling \xe2\x80\x9con the high seas,\xe2\x80\x9d and even two rights listed in the Constitution.  <em>Id.</em>, at 79 (noting \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right to peaceably assemble\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe privilege of the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>\xe2\x80\x9d); see <em>supra</em>, at 4.  But its decision to interpret the rights of state and federal citizenship as mutually exclusive led the Court in future cases to conclude that constitutionally enumerated rights were excluded from the Privileges or Immunities Clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  See <em>Cruikshank</em>, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I reject that understanding.  There was no<em> </em>reason to interpret the Privileges or Immunities Clause as putting the Court to the extreme choice of interpreting the \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges and immunities\xe2\x80\x9d of federal citizenship to mean either all those<em> </em>rights listed in <em>Corfield</em>, or almost no rights at all.  16 Wall., at 76.  The record is scant that the public understood the Clause to make the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9ca perpetual censor upon all legislation of the States\xe2\x80\x9d as the <em>Slaughter-House</em> majority feared.  <em>Id.</em>, at 78.  For one thing, <em>Corfield</em> listed the \xe2\x80\x9celective franchise\xe2\x80\x9d as one of the privileges and immunities of \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of the several states,\xe2\x80\x9d 6 F. Cas., at 552, yet Congress and the States still found it necessary to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94which protects \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94two years after the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  If the Privileges or Immunities Clause were understood to protect every conceivable civil right from state abridgment, the Fifteenth Amendment would have been redundant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The better view, in light of the States and Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s shared history of recognizing certain inalienable rights in their citizens, is that the privileges and immunities of state and federal citizenship overlap.  This is not to say that the privileges and immunities of state and federal citizenship are the same.  At the time of the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ratification, States performed many more functions than the Federal Government, and it is unlikely that, simply by referring to \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges or immunities,\xe2\x80\x9d the Framers of \xc2\xa71 meant to transfer every right mentioned in <em>Corfield</em> to congressional oversight.  As discussed, \xe2\x80\x9cprivileges\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimmunities\xe2\x80\x9d were understood only as synonyms for \xe2\x80\x9crights.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311.  It was their attachment to a particular group that gave them content, and the text and history recounted here indicate that the rights of United States citizens were not perfectly identical to the rights of citizens \xe2\x80\x9cin the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Justice Swayne, one of the dissenters in <em>Slaughter-House</em>, made the point clear:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe citizen of a State has the <em>same</em> fundamental rights as a citizen of the United States, <em>and also certain others</em>, local in their character, arising from his relation to the State, and in addition, those which belong to the citizen of the United States, he being in that relation also.  There may thus be a double citizenship, each having some rights peculiar to itself.  It is only over those which belong to the citizen of the United States that the category here in question throws the shield of its protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  16 Wall., at 126 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nBecause the privileges and immunities of American citizenship include rights enumerated in the Constitution, they overlap to at least some extent with the privileges and immunities traditionally recognized in citizens in the several States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A separate question is whether the privileges and immunities of American citizenship include any rights besides those enumerated in the Constitution.  The four dissenting Justices in <em>Slaughter-House </em>would have held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected the unenumerated right that the butchers in that case asserted.  See <em>id.</em>, at 83 (Field, J., dissenting); <em>id.</em>, at 111 (Bradley, J., dissenting); <em>id.</em>, at 124 (Swayne, J., dissenting).  Because this case does not involve an unenumerated right, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether the Clause protects such rights, or whether the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Slaughter-House </em>was correct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still, it is argued that the mere possibility that the Privileges or Immunities Clause may enforce unenumerated rights against the States creates \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special hazards\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that should prevent this Court from returning to the original meaning of the Clause.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  <em>Post</em>, at 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Ironically, the same objection applies to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s substantive due process jurisprudence, which illustrates the risks of granting judges broad discretion to recognize individual constitutional rights in the absence of textual or historical guideposts.  But I see no reason to assume that such hazards apply to the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  The mere fact that the Clause does not expressly list the rights it protects does not render it incapable of principled judicial application.  The Constitution contains many provisions that require an examination of more than just constitutional text to determine whether a particular act is within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power or is otherwise prohibited.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause); Amdt. 8 (Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause).  When the inquiry focuses on what the ratifying era understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean, interpreting it should be no more \xe2\x80\x9chazardous\xe2\x80\x9d than interpreting these other constitutional provisions by using the same approach.  To be sure, interpreting the Privileges or Immunities Clause may produce hard questions.  But they will have the advantage of being questions the Constitution asks us to answer.  I believe those questions are more worthy of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s attention\xe2\x80\x94and far more likely to yield discernable answers\xe2\x80\x94than the substantive due process questions the Court has for years created on its own, with neither textual nor historical support.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finding these impediments to returning to the original meaning overstated, I reject <em>Slaughter-House</em> insofar as it precludes any overlap between the privileges and immunities of state and federal citizenship.  I next proceed to the <em>stare decisis</em> considerations surrounding the precedent that expressly controls the question presented here.  </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three years after <em>Slaughter-House</em>, the Court in <em>Cruikshank </em>squarely held that the right to keep and bear arms was not a privilege of American citizenship, thereby overturning the convictions of militia members responsible for the brutal Colfax Massacre.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  <em>Cruikshank</em> is not a precedent entitled to any respect.  The flaws in its interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause are made evident by the preceding evidence of its original meaning, and I would reject the holding on that basis alone.  But, the consequences of <em>Cruikshank</em> warrant mention as well.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Cruikshank</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that blacks could look only to state governments for protection of their right to keep and bear arms enabled private forces, often with the assistance of local governments, to subjugate the newly freed slaves and their descendants through a wave of private violence designed to drive blacks from the voting booth and force them into peonage, an effective return to slavery.  Without federal enforcement of the inalienable right to keep and bear arms, these militias and mobs were tragically successful in waging a campaign of terror against the very people the Fourteenth Amendment had just made citizens. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Take, for example, the Hamburg Massacre of 1876.  There, a white citizen militia sought out and murdered a troop of black militiamen for no other reason than that they had dared to conduct a celebratory Fourth of July parade through their mostly black town.  The white militia commander, \xe2\x80\x9cPitchfork\xe2\x80\x9d Ben Tillman, later described this massacre with pride: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he leading white men of Edgefield\xe2\x80\x9d had decided \xe2\x80\x9cto seize the first opportunity that the negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach the negroes a lesson by having the whites demonstrate their superiority by killing as many of them as was justifiable.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Kantrowitz, Ben Tillman &amp; the Reconstruction of White Supremacy 67 (2000) (ellipsis, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted).  None of the perpetrators of the Hamburg murders was ever brought to justice.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Organized terrorism like that perpetuated by Tillman and his cohorts proliferated in the absence of federal enforcement of constitutional rights.  Militias such as the Ku Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, the White Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and the \xe2\x80\x9976 Association spread terror among blacks and white Republicans by breaking up Republican meetings, threatening political leaders, and whipping black militiamen.  Era of Reconstruction, 199\xe2\x80\x93200; Curtis 156.  These groups raped, murdered, lynched, and robbed as a means of intimidating, and instilling pervasive fear in, those whom they despised.  A. Trelease, White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction 28\xe2\x80\x9346 (1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although Congress enacted legislation to suppress these activities,[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] Klan tactics remained a constant presence in the lives of Southern blacks for decades.  Between 1882 and 1968, there were at least 3,446 reported lynchings of blacks in the South.  Cottrol 351\xe2\x80\x93352.  They were tortured and killed for a wide array of alleged crimes, without even the slightest hint of due process.  Emmit Till, for example, was killed in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman.  S. Whitfield, A Death in the Delta: The Story of Emmett Till 15\xe2\x80\x9331 (1988).  The fates of other targets of mob violence were equally depraved.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Lynched Negro and Wife Were First Mutilated, Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post, Feb. 8, 1904, reprinted in R. Ginzburg, 100 Years of Lynchings 63 (1988); Negro Shot Dead for Kissing His White Girlfriend, Chi. Defender, Feb. 31, 1915, in <em>id.</em>, at 95 (reporting incident in Florida); La.

As Eli Cooper, one target of such violence, is said to have explained, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he Negro has been run over for fifty years, but it must stop now, and pistols and shotguns are the only weapons to stop a mob.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Church Burnings Follow Negro Agitator\xe2\x80\x99s Lynching, Chicago Defender, Sept. 6, 1919, in <em>id.</em>, at 124.  Sometimes, as in Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s case, self-defense did not succeed.  He was dragged from his home by a mob and killed as his wife looked on.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But at other times, the use of firearms allowed targets of mob violence to survive.  One man recalled the night during his childhood when his father stood armed at a jail until morning to ward off lynchers.  See Cottrol, 354.  The experience left him with a sense, \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\x98of powerlessness, but of the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibilities of salvation\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that came from standing up to intimidation.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the record makes plain that the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the ratifying-era public understood\xe2\x80\x94just as the Framers of the Second Amendment did\xe2\x80\x94that the right to keep and bear arms was essential to the preservation of liberty.  The record makes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary to include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that the Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the wake of the War over slavery.

As he argues, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment with this objective in view.  See <em>ante, </em>at 41\xe2\x80\x9344 (dissenting opinion).  Unlike other forms of substantive liberty, the carrying of arms for that purpose often puts others\xe2\x80\x99 lives at risk.  See <em>ante, </em>at 35\xe2\x80\x9337.  And the use of arms for private self-defense does not warrant federal constitutional protection from state regulation.  See <em>ante, </em>at 44\xe2\x80\x9351.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, does not expressly rest its opinion upon \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive due process\xe2\x80\x9d concerns.  Rather, it directs its attention to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation\xe2\x80\x9d precedents and asks whether the Second Amendment right to private self-defense is \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d so that it applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  See <em>ante, </em>at 11\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I shall therefore separately consider the question of \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation.\xe2\x80\x9d  I can find nothing in the Second Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text, history, or underlying rationale that could warrant characterizing it as \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as it seeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for private self-defense purposes. <em> </em>Nor can I find any justification for interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate regulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from democratically elected legislatures to courts or from the States to the Federal Government.  I therefore conclude that the Fourteenth Amendment does not \xe2\x80\x9cincorporate\xe2\x80\x9d the Second Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x9cto keep and bear Arms.\xe2\x80\x9d  And I consequently dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Amendment says: \xe2\x80\x9cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Two years ago, in <em>District of Columbia</em> v. <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), the Court rejected the pre-existing judicial consensus that the Second Amendment was primarily concerned with the need to maintain a \xe2\x80\x9cwell regulated Militia.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id., </em>at ___ (Stevens, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933, and n.\xc2\xa02, 38\xe2\x80\x9345); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Miller</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/307/174/index.html">307 U.

Although the Court acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cthe threat that the new Federal Government would destroy the citizens\xe2\x80\x99 militia by taking away their arms <em>was the reason </em>that right \xe2\x80\xa6 was codified in a written Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court asserted that \xe2\x80\x9cindividual self defense \xe2\x80\xa6 was the <em>central component </em>of the right itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heller, supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 26) (first emphasis added).<em> </em>The Court went on to hold that the Second Amendment restricted Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate handguns used for self-defense, and the Court found unconstitutional the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s ban on the possession of handguns in the home.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 64).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court based its conclusions almost exclusively upon its reading of history.

They tell us that <em>Heller </em>misunderstood a key historical point.  See Brief for English/Early American Historians as <em>Amici Curiae</em> (hereinafter English Historians\xe2\x80\x99 Brief) (filed by 21 professors at leading universities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia).  <em>Heller</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cindividual self-defense\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>central component</em>\xe2\x80\x9d of the Second Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x9cto keep and bear Arms\xe2\x80\x9d rested upon its view that the Amendment \xe2\x80\x9ccodified a <em>pre-existing </em>right\xe2\x80\x9d that had \xe2\x80\x9cnothing whatever to do with service in a militia.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26, 19\xe2\x80\x9320).  That view in turn rested in significant part upon Blackstone having described the right as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which reflected the provision in the English Declaration of Right of 1689 that gave the King\xe2\x80\x99s Protestant \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98subjects\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the right to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98have Arms for their defence suitable to their Conditions, and as allowed by law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320) (quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 140 (1765) (hereinafter Blackstone) and 1 W. &amp; M., c. 2, \xc2\xa77, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689)).  The Framers, said the majority, understood that right \xe2\x80\x9cas permitting a citizen to \xe2\x80\x98repe[l] force by force\xe2\x80\x99 when \xe2\x80\x98the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U.

As properly understood at the time of the English Civil Wars, the historians claim, the right to bear arms \xe2\x80\x9censured that <em>Parliament</em> had the power\xe2\x80\x9d to arm the citizenry: \xe2\x80\x9cto defend the realm\xe2\x80\x9d in the case of a foreign enemy, and to \xe2\x80\x9csecure the right of \xe2\x80\x98self-preservation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cself-defense,\xe2\x80\x9d should \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the sovereign</em> usurp the English Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  English Historians\xe2\x80\x99 Brief 3, 8\xe2\x80\x9313, 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (emphasis added).  Thus, the Declaration of Right says that private persons can possess guns only \xe2\x80\x9cas allowed by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id., </em>at 20\xe2\x80\x9324.  Moreover, when Blackstone referred to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d he was referring to the right of the people \xe2\x80\x9c<em>to take part in the militia</em> to defend their political liberties<em>,\xe2\x80\x9d </em>and <em>to the right of Parliament</em> (which represented the people) to <em>raise a militia</em> even when the King sought to deny it that power.  <em>Id., </em>at 4, 24\xe2\x80\x9327 (emphasis added) (quoting 1 Blackstone 140).  Nor can the historians find any convincing reason to believe that the Framers had something different in mind than what Blackstone himself meant.  Compare <em>Heller, supra, </em>at ___ (slip op., at 21\xe2\x80\x9322) with English Historians\xe2\x80\x99 Brief 28\xe2\x80\x9340.  The historians concede that at least one historian takes a different position, see <em>id., </em>at 7, but the Court, they imply, would lose a poll taken among professional historians of this period, say, by a vote of 8 to 1.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If history, and history alone, is what matters, why would the Court not now reconsider <em>Heller </em>in light of these more recently published historical views?  See <em>Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc.</em> v. <em>PSKS, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/877/index.html">551 U. S. 877</a>, 923\xe2\x80\x93924 (2007) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting that <em>stare decisis </em>interests are at their lowest with respect to recent and erroneous constitutional decisions that create unworkable legal regimes); <em>Citizens United</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 558 U.

At the least, where <em>Heller</em>\xe2\x80\x99s historical foundations are so uncertain, why extend its applicability?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My aim in referring to this history is to illustrate the reefs and shoals that lie in wait for those nonexpert judges who place virtually determinative weight upon historical considerations.  In my own view, the Court should not look to history alone but to other factors as well\xe2\x80\x94above all, in cases where the history is so unclear that the experts themselves strongly disagree.  It should, for example, consider the basic values that underlie a constitutional provision and their contemporary significance.  And it should examine as well the relevant consequences and practical justifications that might, or might not, warrant removing an important question from the democratic decisionmaking process.  See <em>ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9320 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (discussing shortcomings of an exclusively historical approach).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, taking <em>Heller </em>as a given, the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self-defense.  Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, to incorporate the private self-defense right the majority must show that the right is, <em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental to the American scheme of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/145/index.html">391 U. S. 145</a>, 149 (1968); see <em>ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa014; see also <em>ante, </em>at 44 (plurality opinion) (finding that the right is \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore incorporated).  And this it fails to do.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority here, like that in <em>Heller,</em> relies almost exclusively upon history to make the necessary showing.  <em>Ante, </em>at 20\xe2\x80\x9333.  But to do so for incorporation purposes is both wrong and dangerous.  As Justice Stevens points out, our society has historically made mistakes\xe2\x80\x94for example, when considering certain 18th- and 19th-century property rights to be fundamental.  <em>Ante, </em>at 19 (dissenting opinion).  And in the incorporation context, as elsewhere, history often is unclear about the answers.  See Part I, <em>supra;</em> Part<em> </em>III, <em>infra.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Accordingly, this Court, in considering an incorporation question, has never stated that the historical status of a right is the only relevant consideration.  Rather, the Court has either explicitly or implicitly made clear in its opinions that the right in question has remained fundamental over time.  See, <em>e.g., Apodaca</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/404/index.html">406 U. S. 404</a>, 410 (1972) (plurality opinion) (stating that the incorporation \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry must focus upon the function served\xe2\x80\x9d by the right in question in \xe2\x80\x9c<em>contemporary society</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/145/index.html">391 U. S. 145</a>, 154 (1968) (noting that the right in question \xe2\x80\x9ccontinues to receive strong support\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Klopfer</em> v. <em>North Carolina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/213/index.html">386 U. S. 213</a>, 226 (1967) (same).  And, indeed, neither of the parties before us in this case has asked us to employ the majority\xe2\x80\x99s history-constrained approach.  See Brief for Petitioners 67\xe2\x80\x9369 (arguing for incorporation based on trends in contemporary support for the right); Brief for Respondents City of Chicago et\xc2\xa0al. 23\xe2\x80\x9331 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents) (looking to current state practices with respect to the right).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I thus think it proper, above all where history provides no clear answer, to look to other factors in considering whether a right is sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d to remove it from the political process in every State.  I would include among those factors the nature of the right; any contemporary disagreement about whether the right is fundamental; the extent to which incorporation will further other, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the extent to which incorporation will advance or hinder the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s structural aims, including its division of powers among different governmental institutions (and the people as well).  Is incorporation needed, for example, to further the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s effort to ensure that the government treats each individual with equal respect?  Will it help maintain the democratic form of government that the Constitution foresees?  In a word, will incorporation prove consistent, or inconsistent, with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to create governmental institutions well suited to the carrying out of its constitutional promises?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I would take account of the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 basic reason for believing the Court ought to have the power of judicial review.  Alexander Hamilton feared granting that power to Congress alone, for he feared that Congress, acting as judges, would not overturn as unconstitutional a popular statute that it had recently enacted, as legislators.  The Federalist No. 78, p. 405 (G. Carey &amp; J. McClellan eds. 2001) (A. Hamilton) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humours, which\xe2\x80\x9d can, at times, lead to \xe2\x80\x9cserious oppressions of the minor part in the community\xe2\x80\x9d).  Judges, he thought, may find it easier to resist popular pressure to suppress the basic rights of an unpopular minority.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Carolene Products Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/144/index.html">304 U. S. 144</a>, 152, n.\xc2\xa04 (1938).  That being so, it makes sense to ask whether that particular comparative judicial advantage is relevant to the case at hand.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>How do these considerations apply here?  For one thing, I would apply them only to the private self-defense right directly at issue.  After all, the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s militia-related purpose is primarily to protect <em>States</em> from <em>federal </em>regulation, not to protect individuals from militia-related regulation.  <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see also <em>Miller</em>, 307 U. S., at 178.  Moreover, the Civil War Amendments, the electoral process, the courts, and numerous other institutions today help to safeguard the States and the people from any serious threat of federal tyranny.  How are state militias additionally necessary?  It is difficult to see how a right that, as the majority concedes, has \xe2\x80\x9clargely faded as a popular concern\xe2\x80\x9d could possibly be so fundamental that it would warrant incorporation through the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  Hence, the incorporation of the Second Amendment cannot be based on the militia-related aspect of what <em>Heller </em>found to be more extensive Second Amendment rights.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, as <em>Heller </em>concedes, the private self-defense right that the Court would incorporate has nothing to do with \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>reason</em>\xe2\x80\x9d the Framers \xe2\x80\x9ccodified\xe2\x80\x9d the right to keep and bear arms \xe2\x80\x9cin a written Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26) (emphasis added).  <em>Heller </em>immediately adds that the self-defense right was nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>central component </em>of the right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In my view, this is the historical equivalent of a claim that water runs uphill.  See Part I, <em>supra</em>.  But, taking it as valid, the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 basic <em>reasons </em>for including language in the Constitution would nonetheless seem more pertinent (in deciding about the contemporary <em>importance </em>of a right) than the particular <em>scope </em>17th- or 18th-century listeners would have then assigned to the words they used.  And examination of the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 motivation tells us they did not think the private armed self-defense right was of paramount importance.  See Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitution, 100 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 1131, 1164 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o see the [Second] Amendment as primarily concerned with an individual right to hunt, or protect one\xe2\x80\x99s home,\xe2\x80\x9d would be \xe2\x80\x9clike viewing the heart of the speech and assembly clauses as the right of persons to meet to play bridge\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, <em>e.g.,</em> Rakove, The Second Amendment: The Highest Stage of Originalism, 76 Chi.-Kent L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 103, 127\xe2\x80\x93128 (2000); Brief for Historians on Early American Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 22\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, there is no popular consensus that the private self-defense right described in <em>Heller </em>is fundamental.  The plurality suggests that two <em>amici </em>briefs filed in the case show such a consensus, see <em>ante</em>, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343, but, of course, numerous <em>amici </em>briefs have been filed opposing incorporation as well.  Moreover, every State regulates firearms extensively, and public opinion is sharply divided on the appropriate level of regulation.  Much of this disagreement rests upon empirical considerations.  One side believes the right essential to protect the lives of those attacked in the home; the other side believes it essential to regulate the right in order to protect the lives of others attacked with guns.  It seems unlikely that definitive evidence will develop one way or the other.  And the appropriate level of firearm regulation has thus long been, and continues to be, a hotly contested matter of political debate.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Siegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitutionalism in <em>Heller</em>, 122 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 191, 201\xe2\x80\x93246 (2008).  (Numerous sources supporting arguments and data in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B can be found in the Appendix, <em>infra.</em>)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, there is no reason here to believe that incorporation of the private self-defense right will further any other or broader constitutional objective.  We are aware of no argument that gun-control regulations target or are passed with the purpose of targeting \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete and insular minorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carolene Products Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 153, n.\xc2\xa04; see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante,</em> at 49\xe2\x80\x9351 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Nor will incorporation help to assure equal respect for individuals.  Unlike the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s rights of free speech, free press, assembly, and petition, the private self-defense right does not comprise a necessary part of the democratic process that the Constitution seeks to establish.  See, <em>e.g., Whitney</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/274/357/index.html">274 U. S. 357</a>, 377 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  Unlike the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s religious protections, the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments\xe2\x80\x99 insistence upon fair criminal procedure, and the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection against cruel and unusual punishments, the private self-defense right does not significantly seek to protect individuals who might otherwise suffer unfair or inhumane treatment at the hands of a majority.  Unlike the protections offered by many of these same Amendments, it does not involve matters as to which judges possess a comparative expertise, by virtue of their close familiarity with the justice system and its operation.  And, unlike the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on just compensation, it does not involve a matter where a majority might unfairly seize for itself property belonging to a minority.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Finally, incorporation of the right <em>will </em>work a significant disruption in the constitutional allocation of decisionmaking authority, thereby interfering with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s ability to further its objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First, </em>on any reasonable accounting, the incorporation of the right recognized in <em>Heller </em>would amount to a significant incursion on a traditional and important area of state concern, altering the constitutional relationship between the States and the Federal Government.  Private gun regulation is the quintessential exercise of a State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpolice power\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the power to \xe2\x80\x9cprotec[t] \xe2\x80\xa6 the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protection of all property within the State,\xe2\x80\x9d by enacting \xe2\x80\x9call kinds of restraints and burdens\xe2\x80\x9d on both \xe2\x80\x9cpersons and property.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, 16 Wall. 36, 62 (1873) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court has long recognized that the Constitution grants the States special authority to enact laws pursuant to this power.  See, <em>e.g., Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 475 (1996) (noting that States have \xe2\x80\x9cgreat latitude\xe2\x80\x9d to use their police powers (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/index.html">471 U. S. 724</a>, 756 (1985).  A decade ago, we wrote that there is \xe2\x80\x9cno better example of the police power\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cthe suppression of violent crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U. S. 598</a>, 618 (2000).  And examples in which the Court has deferred to state legislative judgments in respect to the exercise of the police power are legion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/243/index.html">546 U. S. 243</a>, 270 (2006) (assisted suicide);<em> Washington </em>v.<em> Glucksberg,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 721 (1997) (same); <em>Berman</em> v. <em>Parker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/26/index.html">348 U. S. 26</a>, 32 (1954) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe deal, in other words, with what traditionally has been known as the police power.  An attempt to define its reach or trace its outer limits is fruitless \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second, </em>determining the constitutionality of a particular state gun law requires finding answers to complex empirically based questions of a kind that legislatures are better able than courts to make.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Alameda Books, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/425/index.html">535 U. S. 425</a>, 440 (2002) (plurality opinion); <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/180/index.html">520 U. S. 180</a>, 195\xe2\x80\x93196 (1997).  And it may require this kind of analysis in virtually every case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Government regulation of the right to bear arms normally embodies a judgment that the regulation will help save lives.  The determination whether a gun regulation is constitutional would thus almost always require the weighing of the constitutional right to bear arms against the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary concern of every government\xe2\x80\x94a concern for the safety and indeed the lives of its citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salerno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/739/index.html">481 U. S. 739</a>, 755 (1987).  With respect to other incorporated rights, this sort of inquiry is <em>sometimes </em>present.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/444/index.html">395 U. S. 444</a>, 447 (1969) <em>(per curiam) </em>(free speech); <em>Sherbert</em> v. <em>Verner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/index.html">374 U. S. 398</a>, 403 (1963) (religion); <em>Brigham City</em> v. <em>Stuart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/398/index.html">547 U. S. 398</a>, 403\xe2\x80\x93404 (2006) (Fourth Amendment); <em>New York</em> v. <em>Quarles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/index.html">467 U. S. 649</a>, 655 (1984) (Fifth Amendment); <em>Salerno, supra</em>, at 755 (bail).  But here, this inquiry\xe2\x80\x94calling for the fine tuning of protective rules\xe2\x80\x94is likely to be part of a daily judicial diet.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the competing interests, courts will have to try to answer empirical questions of a particularly difficult kind. Suppose, for example, that after a gun regulation\xe2\x80\x99s adoption the murder rate went up.  Without the gun regulation would the murder rate have risen even faster?  How is this conclusion affected by the local recession which has left numerous people unemployed?  What about budget cuts that led to a downsizing of the police force?  How effective was that police force to begin with?  And did the regulation simply take guns from those who use them for lawful purposes without affecting their possession by criminals?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider too that countless gun regulations of many shapes and sizes are in place in every State and in many local communities.  Does the right to possess weapons for self-defense extend outside the home?  To the car?  To work?  What sort of guns are necessary for self-defense?  Handguns?  Rifles?  Semiautomatic weapons?  When is a gun semi-automatic?  Where are different kinds of weapons likely needed?  Does time-of-day matter?  Does the presence of a child in the house matter?  Does the presence of a convicted felon in the house matter?  Do police need special rules permitting patdowns designed to find guns?  When do registration requirements become severe to the point that they amount to an unconstitutional ban?  Who can possess guns and of what kind?  Aliens?  Prior drug offenders?  Prior alcohol abusers?  How would the right interact with a state or local government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to take special measures during, say, national security emergencies?  As the questions suggest, state and local gun regulation can become highly complex, and these \xe2\x80\x9care only a few uncertainties that quickly come to mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Caperton</em> v. <em>A. T. Massey Coal Co.</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difficulty of finding answers to these questions is exceeded only by the importance of doing so.  Firearms cause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United States each year.  Those who live in urban areas, police officers, women, and children, all may be particularly at risk.  And gun regulation may save their lives.  Some experts have calculated, for example, that Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s handgun ban has saved several hundred lives, perhaps close to 1,000, since it was enacted in 1983.  Other experts argue that stringent gun regulations \xe2\x80\x9ccan help protect police officers operating on the front lines against gun violence,\xe2\x80\x9d have reduced homicide rates in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C., and Baltimore, and have helped to lower New York\xe2\x80\x99s crime and homicide rates.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the opponents of regulation cast doubt on these studies.  And who is right?  Finding out may require interpreting studies that are only indirectly related to a particular regulatory statute, say one banning handguns in the home.  Suppose studies find more accidents and suicides where there is a handgun in the home than where there is a long gun in the home or no gun at all?  To what extent do such studies justify a ban?  What if opponents of the ban put forth counter studies?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In answering such questions judges cannot simply refer to judicial homilies, such as Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s 18th-century perception that a man\xe2\x80\x99s home is his castle.  See 4 Blackstone 223.  Nor can the plurality so simply reject, by mere assertion, the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation will require judges to assess the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 44.  How can the Court assess the strength of the government\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory interests without addressing issues of empirical fact?  How can the Court determine if a regulation is appropriately tailored without considering its impact?  And how can the Court determine if there are less restrictive alternatives without considering what will happen if those alternatives are implemented?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps the Court could lessen the difficulty of the mission it has created for itself by adopting a jurisprudential approach similar to the many state courts that administer a state constitutional right to bear arms.  See <em>infra</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (describing state approaches).  But the Court has not yet done so.  Cf. <em>Heller,</em> 544 U. S.,<em> </em>at ___ (slip op., at 57\xe2\x80\x9364) (rejecting an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98interest-balancing\xe2\x80\x99 approach\xe2\x80\x9d similar to that employed by the States); <em>ante</em>, at 44 (plurality opinion).  Rather, the Court has haphazardly created a few simple rules, such as that it will not touch \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9claws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9claws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heller</em>, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 54\xe2\x80\x9355); <em>Ante, </em>at 39 (plurality opinion).  But why these rules and not others?  Does the Court know that these regulations are justified by some special gun-related risk of death?  In fact, the Court does not know.  It has simply invented rules that sound sensible without being able to explain why or how Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s handgun ban is different.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact is that judges do not know the answers to the kinds of empirically based questions that will often determine the need for particular forms of gun regulation.  Nor do they have readily available \xe2\x80\x9ctools\xe2\x80\x9d for finding and evaluating the technical material submitted by others. <em>District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Third Judicial Dist.</em> v. <em>Osborne</em>, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21); see also <em>Turner Broadcasting</em>, 520 U. S., at 195\xe2\x80\x93196<em>.</em>  Judges cannot easily make empirically based predictions; they have no way to gather and evaluate the data required to see if such predictions are accurate; and the nature of litigation and concerns about <em>stare decisis </em>further make it difficult for judges to change course if predictions prove inaccurate.  Nor can judges rely upon local community views and values when reaching judgments in circumstances where prediction is difficult because the basic facts are unclear or unknown.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, there is no institutional need to send judges off on this \xe2\x80\x9cmission-almost-impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Legislators are able to \xe2\x80\x9camass the stuff of actual experience and cull conclusions from it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gainey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/63/index.html">380 U. S. 63</a>, 67 (1965). They are far better suited than judges to uncover facts and to understand their relevance.  And legislators, unlike Article III judges, can be held democratically responsible for their empirically based and value-laden conclusions.  We have thus repeatedly affirmed our preference for \xe2\x80\x9clegislative not judicial solutions\xe2\x80\x9d to this kind of problem, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Patsy</em> v. <em>Board of Regents of Fla.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/496/index.html">457 U. S. 496</a>, 513 (1982), just as we have repeatedly affirmed the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s preference for democratic solutions legislated by those whom the people elect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>New State Ice Co.</em> v. <em>Liebmann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/262/index.html">285 U. S. 262</a>, 310\xe2\x80\x93311 (1932), Justice Brandeis stated in dissent:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cSome people assert that our present plight is due, in part, to the limitations set by courts upon experimentation in the fields of social and economic science; and to the discouragement to which proposals for betterment there have been subjected otherwise.  There must be power in the States and the Nation to remould, through experimentation, our economic practices and institutions to meet changing social and economic needs.  I cannot believe that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, or the States which ratified it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct [the social problems we face].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are 50 state legislatures.  The fact that this Court may already have refused to take this wise advice with respect to Congress<em> </em>in <em>Heller</em> is no reason to make matters worse here.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, </em>the ability of States to reflect local preferences and conditions\xe2\x80\x94both key virtues of federalism\xe2\x80\x94here has particular importance.  The incidence of gun ownership varies substantially as between crowded cities and uncongested rural communities, as well as among the different geographic regions of the country.  Thus, approximately 60% of adults who live in the relatively sparsely populated Western States of Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming report that their household keeps a gun, while fewer than 15% of adults in the densely populated Eastern States of Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Massachusetts say the same.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The nature of gun violence also varies as between rural communities and cities.  Urban centers face significantly greater levels of firearm crime and homicide, while rural communities have proportionately greater problems with nonhomicide gun deaths, such as suicides and accidents.  And idiosyncratic local factors can lead to two cities finding themselves in dramatically different circumstances: For example, in 2008, the murder rate was 40 times higher in New Orleans than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is thus unsurprising that States and local communities have historically differed about the need for gun regulation as well as about its proper level.  Nor is it surprising that \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily, and historically,\xe2\x80\x9d the law has treated the exercise of police powers, including gun control, as \xe2\x80\x9cmatter[s] of local concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Medtronic, </em>518 U. S., at 475 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fourth, </em>although incorporation of any right removes decisions from the democratic process, the incorporation of this particular right does so without strong offsetting justification\xe2\x80\x94as the example of Oak Park\xe2\x80\x99s handgun ban helps to show.  See Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, \xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x931 (1995).  Oak Park decided to ban handguns in 1983, after a local attorney was shot to death with a handgun that his assailant had smuggled into a courtroom in a blanket.  Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>1, 21 (hereinafter Oak Park Brief).  A citizens committee spent months gathering information about handguns.  <em>Id., </em>at 21.  It secured 6,000 signatures from community residents in support of a ban.  <em>Id., </em>at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  And the village board enacted a ban into law.  <em>Id., </em>at 22.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsequently, at the urging of ban opponents the Board held a community referendum on the matter.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The citizens committee argued strongly in favor of the ban.  <em>Id., </em>at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  It pointed out that most guns owned in Oak Park were handguns and that handguns were misused more often than citizens used them in self-defense.  <em>Id., </em>at 23.  The ban opponents argued just as strongly to the contrary.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The public decided to keep the ban by a vote of 8,031 to 6,368.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And since that time, Oak Park now tells us, crime has decreased and the community has seen no accidental handgun deaths.  <em>Id., </em>at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the empirical and local value-laden nature of the questions that lie at the heart of the issue, why, in a Nation whose Constitution foresees democratic decisionmaking, is it so <em>fundamental </em>a matter as to require taking that power from the people?  What is it here that the people did not know?  What is it that a judge knows better?</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the police power, the superiority of legislative decisionmaking, the need for local decisionmaking, the comparative desirability of democratic decisionmaking, the lack of a manageable judicial standard, and the life-threatening harm that may flow from striking down regulations all argue against incorporation.  Where the incorporation of other rights has been at issue, <em>some </em>of these problems have arisen.  But in this instance <em>all </em>these problems are present, <em>all </em>at the same time, and <em>all </em>are likely to be present in most, perhaps nearly all, of the cases in which the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue.  At the same time, the important factors that favor incorporation in other instances\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, the protection of broader constitutional objectives\xe2\x80\x94are not present here.  The upshot is that all factors militate against incorporation\xe2\x80\x94with the possible exception of historical factors.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I must, then, return to history.  The plurality, in seeking to justify incorporation, asks whether the interests the Second Amendment protects are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19 (quoting <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U. S., at 721; internal quotation marks omitted).  It looks to selected portions of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history for the answer.  And it finds an affirmative reply.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have made clear, I do not believe history is the only pertinent consideration.  Nor would I read history as broadly as the majority does.  In particular, since we here are evaluating a more particular right\xe2\x80\x94namely, the right to bear arms for purposes of private self-defense\xe2\x80\x94general historical references to the \xe2\x80\x9cright to keep and bear arms\xe2\x80\x9d are not always helpful.  Depending upon context, early historical sources may mean to refer to a militia-based right\xe2\x80\x94a matter of considerable importance 200 years ago\xe2\x80\x94which has, as the majority points out, \xe2\x80\x9clargely faded as a popular concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  There is no reason to believe that matters of such little contemporary importance should play a significant role in answering the incorporation question.  See <em>Apodaca</em>, 406 U. S., at 410 (incorporation \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry must focus upon the function served\xe2\x80\x9d by the right in question in \xe2\x80\x9ccontemporary society\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Wolf</em> v. <em>Colorado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/index.html">338 U. S. 25</a>, 27 (1949) (incorporation must take into account \xe2\x80\x9cthe movements of a free society\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe gradual and empiric process of inclusion and exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7910 (prohibiting federal officeholders from accepting a \xe2\x80\x9cTitle, of any kind whatever, from [a] foreign State\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94presumably a matter of considerable importance 200 years ago).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That said, I can find much in the historical record that shows that some Americans in some places at certain times thought it important to keep and bear arms for private self-defense.  For instance, the reader will see that many States have constitutional provisions protecting gun possession.  But, as far as I can tell, those provisions typically do no more than guarantee that a gun regulation will be a <em>reasonable</em> police power regulation.  See Winkler, Scrutinizing the Second Amendment, 105 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 683, 686, 716\xe2\x80\x93717 (2007) (the \xe2\x80\x9ccourts of every state to consider the question apply a deferential \xe2\x80\x98reasonable regulation\xe2\x80\x99 standard\xe2\x80\x9d) (hereinafter Winkler, Scrutinizing); see also <em>id.</em>, at 716\xe2\x80\x93717 (explaining the difference between that standard and ordinary rational-basis review).  It is thus altogether unclear whether such provisions would prohibit cities such as Chicago from enacting laws, such as the law before us, banning handguns.  See <em>id., </em>at 723.  The majority, however, would incorporate a right that is likely <em>inconsistent </em>with Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s law; and the majority would almost certainly <em>strike down </em>that law.  Cf. <em>Heller, </em>554 U. S.,<em> </em>at ___ (slip op., at 57\xe2\x80\x9364) (striking down the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s handgun ban).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the specific question before us is not whether there are references to the right to bear arms for self-defense throughout this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history\xe2\x80\x94of course there are\xe2\x80\x94or even whether the Court should incorporate a simple constitutional requirement that firearms regulations not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear arms, but rather whether there is a consensus that <em>so substantial </em>a private self-defense right as the one described in <em>Heller </em>applies to the States.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Glucksberg</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 721 (requiring \xe2\x80\x9ca careful description\xe2\x80\x9d of the right at issue when deciding whether it is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  On this question, the reader will have to make up his or her own mind about the historical record that I describe in part below.  In my view, that record is insufficient to say that the right to bear arms for private self-defense, as explicated by <em>Heller</em>, is fundamental in the sense relevant to the incorporation inquiry.  As the evidence below shows, States and localities have consistently enacted firearms regulations, including regulations similar to those at issue here, throughout our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.  Courts have repeatedly upheld such regulations.  And it is, at the very least, possible, and perhaps likely, that incorporation will impose on every, or nearly every, State a different right to bear arms than they currently recognize\xe2\x80\x94a right that threatens to destabilize settled state legal principles.  Cf. 554 U. S.,<em> </em>at ___ (slip op., at 57\xe2\x80\x9364) (rejecting an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98interest-balancing\xe2\x80\x99 approach\xe2\x80\x9d similar to that employed by the States).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I thus cannot find a historical consensus with respect to whether the right described by <em>Heller </em>is \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d as our incorporation cases use that term.  Nor can I find sufficient historical support for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that that right is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, I find no more than ambiguity and uncertainty that perhaps even expert historians would find difficult to penetrate.  And a historical record that is so ambiguous cannot itself provide an adequate basis for incorporating a private right of self-defense and applying it against the States.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Eighteenth Century</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The opinions in <em>Heller </em>collect much of the relevant 18th-century evidence.  See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x9332); <em>id.</em>, at ___ (Stevens, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x9331); <em>id., </em>at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x937).  In respect to the relevant question\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted nature\xe2\x80\x9d of a right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self-defense\xe2\x80\x94that evidence is inconclusive, particularly when augmented as follows:</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First</em>, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and Justice Stevens argued in dissent, the history discussed in <em>Heller</em> shows that the Second Amendment was enacted primarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related rights.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4; <em>Heller, supra, </em>at ___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x9331).  Many of the scholars and historians who have written on the subject apparently agree.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second</em>, historians now tell us that the right to which Blackstone referred, an important link in the <em>Heller </em>majority\xe2\x80\x99s historical argument, concerned the right of Parliament (representing the people) to form a militia to oppose a tyrant (the King) threatening to deprive the people of their traditional liberties (which did not include an unregulated right to possess guns).  Thus, 18th-century language referring to a \xe2\x80\x9cright to keep and bear arms\xe2\x80\x9d does not <em>ipso facto</em> refer to a private right of self-defense\xe2\x80\x94certainly not unambiguously so.  See English Historians\xe2\x80\x99 Brief 3\xe2\x80\x9327; see also <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third</em>, scholarly articles indicate that firearms were heavily regulated at the time of the framing\xe2\x80\x94perhaps more heavily regulated than the Court in <em>Heller </em>believed.  For example, one scholar writes that \xe2\x80\x9c[h]undreds of individual statutes regulated the possession and use of guns in colonial and early national America.\xe2\x80\x9d  Churchill, Gun Regulation, the Police Power, and the Right to Keep Arms, 25 Law &amp; Hist. Rev. 139, 143 (2007).  Among these statutes was a ban on the private firing of weapons in Boston, as well as comprehensive restrictions on similar conduct in Philadelphia and New York.  See Acts and Laws of Massachusetts, p. 208 (1746); 5 J. Mitchell, &amp; H. Flanders, Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania From 1682 to 1801, pp. 108\xe2\x80\x93109 (1898); 4 Colonial Laws of New York ch. 1233, p. 748 (1894); see also Churchill, <em>supra</em>, at 162\xe2\x80\x93163 (discussing bans on the shooting of guns in Pennsylvania and New York).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fourth</em>, after the Constitution was adopted, several States continued to regulate firearms possession by, for example, adopting rules that would have prevented the carrying of loaded firearms in the city, <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x937) (Breyer, J., dissenting); see also <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 59\xe2\x80\x9360).  Scholars have thus concluded that the primary Revolutionary era limitation on a State\xe2\x80\x99s police power to regulate guns appears to be only that regulations were \xe2\x80\x9caimed at a legitimate public purpose\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with reason.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cornell, Early American Gun Regulation and the Second Amendment, 25 Law &amp; Hist. Rev. 197, 198 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Pre-Civil War Nineteenth Century</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would also augment the majority\xe2\x80\x99s account of this period as follows:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First</em>, additional States began to regulate the discharge of firearms in public places.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Act of Feb. 17, 1831, \xc2\xa76, reprinted in 3 Statutes of Ohio and the Northwestern Territory 1740 (S. Chase ed. 1835); Act of Dec. 3, 1825, ch. CCXCII, \xc2\xa73, 1825 Tenn. Priv. Acts 306.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, States began to regulate the possession of concealed weapons, which were both popular and dangerous. See, <em>e.g.,</em> C. Cramer, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early Republic 143\xe2\x80\x93152 (1999) (collecting examples); see also 1837\xe2\x80\x931838 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 137, pp. 200\xe2\x80\x93201 (banning the wearing, sale, or giving of Bowie knives); 1847 Va. Acts ch. 7, \xc2\xa78, p. 110, (\xe2\x80\x9cAny free person who shall habitually carry about his person, hidden from common observation, any pistol, dirk, bowie knife, or weapon of the like kind, from the use of which the death of any person might probably ensue, shall for every offense be punished by [a] fine not exceed fifty dollars\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0State courts repeatedly upheld the validity of such laws, finding that, even when the state constitution granted a right to bear arms, the legislature was permitted to, <em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cabolish\xe2\x80\x9d these small, inexpensive, \xe2\x80\x9cmost dangerous weapons entirely from use,\xe2\x80\x9d even in self-defense.  <em>Day </em>v. <em>State</em>, 37 Tenn. 496, 500 (1857); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>State</em> v. <em>Jumel</em>, 13 La. Ann. 399, 400 (1858) (upholding concealed weapon ban because it \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited only a <em>particular mode</em> of bearing arms which is found dangerous to the peace of society\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>State</em> v. <em>Chandler</em>, 5 La. Ann. 489, 489\xe2\x80\x93490 (1850) (upholding concealed weapon ban and describing the law as \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely necessary to counteract a vicious state of society, growing out of the habit of carrying concealed weapons\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>State</em> v. <em>Reid</em>, 1 Ala. 612, 616\xe2\x80\x93617 (1840).</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Post-Civil War Nineteenth Century</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important to read the majority\xe2\x80\x99s account with the following considerations in mind:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First, </em>the Court today properly declines to revisit our interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s case for incorporation must thus rest on the conclusion that the right to bear arms is \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the very evidence that it advances in support of the conclusion that Reconstruction-era Americans strongly supported a private self-defense right shows with equal force that Americans wanted African-American citizens to have the <em>same </em>rights to possess guns as did white citizens.  <em>Ante, </em>at 22\xe2\x80\x9333.  Here, for example is what Congress said when it enacted a Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Second Freedman\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau Act.  It wrote that the statute, in order to secure \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional right to bear arms \xe2\x80\xa6 for all citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d would assure that each citizen:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cshall have \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>full and equal benefit </em>of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal, including the constitutional right to bear arms, [by securing] \xe2\x80\xa6 to \xe2\x80\xa6 all the citizens of [every] \xe2\x80\xa6 State or district without <em>respect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.\xe2\x80\x9d  </em>\xc2\xa714, 14 Stat. 176\xe2\x80\x93177 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis sounds like an <em>antidiscrimination </em>provision.  See Rosenthal, The New Originalism Meets the Fourteenth Amendment: Original Public Meaning and the Problem of Incorporation, 18 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 361, 383\xe2\x80\x93384 (2009) (discussing evidence that the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau was focused on discrimination).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, also took aim at <em>discrimination. </em>See \xc2\xa71, 14 Stat. 27 (citizens of \xe2\x80\x9cevery race and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude . . . shall have the same right [to engage in various activities] and to full and equal benefit of all laws \xe2\x80\xa6 as is enjoyed by white citizens\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, of course, the Fourteenth Amendment itself insists that all States guarantee their citizens the \xe2\x80\x9cequal protection of the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is thus every reason to believe that the <em>fundamental </em>concern of the Reconstruction Congress was the eradication of discrimination, not the provision of a new substantive right to bear arms free from reasonable state police power regulation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Municipal Respondents 62\xe2\x80\x9369 (discussing congressional record evidence that Reconstruction Congress was concerned about discrimination).  Indeed, why would those who wrote the Fourteenth Amendment have wanted to give such a right to Southerners who had so recently waged war against the North, and who continued to disarm and oppress recently freed African-American citizens?  Cf. Act of Mar. 2, 1867, \xc2\xa76, 14 Stat. 487 (disbanding Southern militias because they were, <em>inter alia</em>, disarming the freedmen).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second, </em>firearms regulation in the later part of the 19th century was common.  The majority is correct that the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau points to a right to bear arms, and it stands to reason, as the majority points out, that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee the \xe2\x80\xa6 equal benefit of a \xe2\x80\xa6 right that does not exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 32.  But the majority points to no evidence that there existed during this period a fundamental right to bear arms for private self-defense immune to the reasonable exercise of the state police power.  See Emberton, The Limits of Incorporation: Violence, Gun Rights, and Gun Regulation in the Reconstruction South, 17 Stan. L. &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y Rev. 615, 621\xe2\x80\x93622 (2006) (noting that history shows that \xe2\x80\x9cnineteenth-century Americans\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9cnot opposed to the idea that the state should be able to control the use of firearms\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the contrary, in the latter half of the 19th century, a number of state constitutions adopted or amended after the Civil War explicitly recognized the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s general ability to limit the right to bear arms.  See Tex. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa713 (1869) (protecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to keep and bear arms,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunder such regulations as the legislature may prescribe\xe2\x80\x9d); Idaho Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa711 (1889) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe people have the right to bear arms \xe2\x80\xa6; but the Legislature shall regulate the exercise of this right by law\xe2\x80\x9d); Utah Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa76 (1896) (same).  And numerous other state constitutional provisions adopted during this period explicitly granted the legislature various types of regulatory power over firearms.  See Brief for Thirty-Four Professional Historians et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (hereinafter Legal Historians\xe2\x80\x99 Brief).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, four States largely banned the possession of all nonmilitary handguns during this period.  See 1879 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 186, \xc2\xa71 (prohibiting citizens from carrying \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly or privately, any \xe2\x80\xa6 belt or pocket pistol, revolver, or any kind of pistol, except the army or navy pistol, usually used in warfare, which shall be carried openly in the hand\xe2\x80\x9d); 1876 Wyo. Comp. Laws ch. 52, \xc2\xa71 (forbidding \xe2\x80\x9cconcealed or ope[n]\xe2\x80\x9d bearing of \xe2\x80\x9cany fire arm or other deadly weapon, within the limits of any city, town or village\xe2\x80\x9d); Ark. Act of Apr. 1, 1881, ch. 96, \xc2\xa71 (prohibiting the \xe2\x80\x9cwear[ing] or carry[ng]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cany pistol \xe2\x80\xa6 except such pistols as are used in the army or navy,\xe2\x80\x9d except while traveling or at home); Tex. Act of Apr. 12, 1871, ch. 34 (prohibiting the carrying of pistols unless there are \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate and pressing\xe2\x80\x9d reasonable grounds to fear \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate and pressing\xe2\x80\x9d attack or for militia service).  Fifteen States banned the concealed carry of pistols and other deadly weapons.  See Legal Historians\xe2\x80\x99 Brief 16, n.\xc2\xa014.  And individual municipalities enacted stringent gun controls, often in response to local conditions\xe2\x80\x94Dodge City, Kansas, for example, joined many western cattle towns in banning the carrying of pistols and other dangerous weapons in response to violence accompanying western cattle drives.  See Brief for Municipal Respondents 30 (citing Dodge City, Kan., Ordinance No. 16, \xc2\xa7XI (Sept. 22, 1876)); D. Courtwright, The Cowboy Subculture, in Guns in America: A Reader 96 (J. Dizard et\xc2\xa0al. eds. 1999) (discussing how Western cattle towns required cowboys to \xe2\x80\x9ccheck\xe2\x80\x9d their guns upon entering town).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, much as they had during the period before the Civil War, state courts routinely upheld such restrictions.  See, <em>e.g., English</em> v. <em>State</em>, 35 Tex. 473 (1871); <em>Hill</em> v. <em>State</em>, 53 Ga. 472, 475 (1874); <em>Fife</em> v. <em>State</em>, 31 Ark. 455, 461 (1876); <em>State</em> v. <em>Workman</em>, 35 W.\xc2\xa0Va. 367, 373 (1891).  The Tennessee Supreme Court, in upholding a ban on possession of nonmilitary handguns and certain other weapons, summarized the Reconstruction understanding of the states\xe2\x80\x99 police power to regulate firearms:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAdmitting the right of self-defense in its broadest sense, still on sound principle every good citizen is bound to yield his preference as to the means to be used, to the demands of the public good; <em>and where certain weapons are forbidden to be kept or used by the law of the land</em>, in order to the prevention of <em>[sic]</em> crime\xe2\x80\x94a great public end\xe2\x80\x94<em>no man can be permitted to disregard this general end, and demand of the community the right, in order to gratify his whim or willful desire to use a particular weapon in his particular self-defense</em>.  The law allows ample means of self-defense, without the use of the weapons which we have held may be rightfully prescribed by this statute.  The object being to banish these weapons from the community by an absolute prohibition for the prevention of crime, no man\xe2\x80\x99s particular safety, if such case could exist, ought to be allowed to defeat this end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Andrews</em> v. <em>State</em>, 50 Tenn. 165, 188\xe2\x80\x93189 (1871) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>The Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the majority does not discuss 20th- or 21st-century evidence concerning the Second Amendment at any length, I think that it is essential to consider the recent history of the right to bear arms for private self-defense when considering whether the right is \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental.\xe2\x80\x9d  To that end, many States now provide state constitutional protection for an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to keep and bear arms.  See Volokh, State Constitutional Rights to Keep and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. &amp; Pol. 191, 205 (2006) (identifying over 40 States).  In determining the importance of this fact, we should keep the following considerations in mind:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First</em>, by the end of the 20th century, in every State and many local communities, highly detailed and complicated regulatory schemes governed (and continue to govern) nearly every aspect of firearm ownership: Who may sell guns and how they must be sold; who may purchase guns and what type of guns may be purchased; how firearms must be stored and where they may be used; and so on.  See generally Legal Community Against Violence, Regulating Guns In America (2008), available at http://\nwww.lcav.org/publications-briefs/regulating_guns. asp (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (detailing various arms regulations in every State).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of particular relevance here, some municipalities ban handguns, even in States that constitutionally protect the right to bear arms.  See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code, \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\x93050(c) (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa727\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x931, 27\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x931 (1995); Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code, ch. 549.25 (2010).  Moreover, at least seven States and Puerto Rico ban assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa712280(b) (West Supp. 2009); Conn. Gen. Stat.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> Winkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the \xe2\x80\x9ccourts of every state to consider\xe2\x80\x9d a gun regulation apply the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable regulation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d approach); <em>State</em> v. <em>McAdams</em>, 714 P.\xc2\xa02d 1236, 1238 (Wyo. 1986); <em>Robertson</em> v. <em>City &amp; County of Denver</em>, 874 P.\xc2\xa02d 325, 328 (Colo. 1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When determining reasonableness those courts have normally adopted a highly deferential attitude towards legislative determinations.  See Winkler, Scrutinizing 723 (identifying only six cases in the 60 years before the article\xe2\x80\x99s publication striking down gun control laws: three that banned \xe2\x80\x9cthe transportation of any firearms for any purpose whatsoever,\xe2\x80\x9d a single \xe2\x80\x9cpermitting law,\xe2\x80\x9d and two as-applied challenges in \xe2\x80\x9cunusual circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hence, as evidenced by the breadth of existing regulations, States and local governments maintain substantial flexibility to regulate firearms\xe2\x80\x94much as they seemingly have throughout the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history\xe2\x80\x94even in those States with an arms right in their constitutions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Although one scholar implies that state courts are less willing to permit total gun prohibitions, see Volokh, Implementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for Self-Defense: An Analytical Framework and a Research Agenda, 56 UCLA L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware of no instances in the past 50 years in which a state court has struck down as unconstitutional a law banning a particular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitutional (under their state constitutions) firearms regulations that have included handgun bans.  See <em>Kalodimos</em> v. <em>Village of Morton Grove</em>, 103 Ill. 2d 483, 499, 470 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 266, 273 (1984) (upholding a handgun ban because the arms right is merely a right \xe2\x80\x9cto possess some form of weapon suitable for self-defense or recreation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Cleveland</em> v. <em>Turner,</em> No. 36126, 1977 WL 201393, *5 (Ohio Ct. App., Aug. 4, 1977) (handgun ban \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not absolutely interfere with the right of the people to bear arms, but rather proscribes possession of a specifically defined category of handguns\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>State</em> v. <em>Bolin </em>378 S.\xc2\xa0C. 96, 99, 662 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 38, 39 (2008) (ban on handgun possession by persons under 21 did not infringe arms right because they can \xe2\x80\x9cposses[s] other types of guns\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision to incorporate the private self-defense right recognized in <em>Heller </em>threatens to alter state regulatory regimes, at least as they pertain to handguns.     </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third</em>, the plurality correctly points out that <em>only a few </em>state courts, a \xe2\x80\x9cpaucity\xe2\x80\x9d of state courts, have specifically upheld handgun bans.  <em>Ante, </em>at 39.  But which state courts have struck them down?  The absence of supporting information does not help the majority find support. Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wells</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/482/index.html">519 U. S. 482</a>, 496 (1997) (noting that it is \xe2\x80\x9ctreacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Silence does not show or tend to show a consensus that a private self-defense right (strong enough to strike down a handgun ban) is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self-defense.  There has been, and is, no consensus that the right is, or was, \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental.\xe2\x80\x9d  No broader constitutional interest or principle supports legal treatment of that right as fundamental.  To the contrary, broader constitutional concerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against that treatment.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, nothing in 18th-, 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century history shows a consensus that the right to private armed self-defense, as described in <em>Heller</em>, is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history or tradition\xe2\x80\x9d or is otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, incorporating the right recognized in <em>Heller</em> may change the law in many of the 50 States.  Read in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s favor, the historical evidence is at most ambiguous.  And, in the absence of any other support for its conclusion, ambiguous history cannot show that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates a private right of self-defense against the States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect, I dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIX</p>\n<p align="left">Sources Supporting Data in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Popular Consensus</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>Please see the following sources to support the paragraph on popular opinion on pages 9\xe2\x80\x9310:</p>\n<p>\n<left>\xe2\x80\xa2Briefs filed in this case that argue against incorporation include: Brief for United States Conference of Mayors as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 1, 17\xe2\x80\x9333 (organization representing \xe2\x80\x9call United States cities with populations of 30,000 or more\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for American Cities et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 1\xe2\x80\x933 (brief filed on behalf of many cities, <em>e.g.</em>, Philadelphia, Seattle, San Francisco, Oakland, Cleveland); Brief for Representative Carolyn McCarthy et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5\xe2\x80\x9310; Brief for State of Illinois et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae\n</em>7\xe2\x80\x9335.</left></p>\n<p>\n<left>\xe2\x80\xa2Wilkinson, Of Guns, Abortions, and the Unraveling Rule of Law, 95 Va.

S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 1), the Court answered the question whether a federal enclave\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition on the possession of usable handguns in the home violates the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  The question we should be answering in this case is whether the Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cguarantees individuals a fundamental right,\xe2\x80\x9d enforceable against the States, \xe2\x80\x9cto possess a functional, personal firearm, including a handgun, within the home.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb634, App. 23.  That is a different\xe2\x80\x94and more difficult\xe2\x80\x94inquiry than asking if the Fourteenth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cincorporates\xe2\x80\x9d the Second Amendment.  The so-called incorporation question was squarely and, in my view, correctly resolved in the late 19th century.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the District Court, petitioners focused their pleadings on the special considerations raised by domestic possession, which they identified as the core of their asserted right.  In support of their claim that the city of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s handgun ban violates the Constitution, they now rely primarily on the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Brief for Petitioners 9\xe2\x80\x9365.  They rely secondarily on the Due Process Clause of that Amendment.  See <em>id.,</em> at 66\xe2\x80\x9372.  Neither submission requires the Court to express an opinion on whether the Fourteenth Amendment places any limit on the power of States to regulate possession, use, or carriage of firearms outside the home.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to accept petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 primary submission.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  Their briefs marshal an impressive amount of historical evidence for their argument that the Court interpreted the Privileges or Immunities Clause too narrowly in the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, 16 Wall. 36 (1873).  But the original meaning of the Clause is not as clear as they suggest[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]\xe2\x80\x94and not nearly as clear as it would need to be to dislodge 137 years of precedent.  The burden is severe for those who seek radical change in such an established body of constitutional doctrine.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Moreover, the suggestion that invigorating the Privileges or Immunities Clause will reduce judicial discretion, see Reply Brief for Petitioners 22, n.\xc2\xa08, 26; Tr. of Oral Arg. 64\xe2\x80\x9365, strikes me as implausible, if not exactly backwards.  \xe2\x80\x9cFor the very reason that it has so long remained a clean slate, a revitalized Privileges or Immunities Clause holds special hazards for judges who are mindful that their proper task is not to write their personal views of appropriate public policy into the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I further agree with the plurality that there are weighty arguments supporting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 second submission, insofar as it concerns the possession of firearms for lawful self-defense in the home.  But these arguments are less compelling than the plurality suggests; they are much less compelling when applied outside the home; and their validity does not depend on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Heller</em>.  For that holding sheds no light on the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Our decisions construing that Clause to render various procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights enforceable against the States likewise tell us little about the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d in the Clause or about the scope of its protection of nonprocedural rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a substantive due process case.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment decrees that no State shall \xe2\x80\x9cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court has filled thousands of pages expounding that spare text.  As I read the vast corpus of substantive due process opinions, they confirm several important principles that ought to guide our resolution of this case.  The principal opinion\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy summary of our \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, see <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x939, 11\xe2\x80\x9319 (majority opinion), 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (plurality opinion), and its implicit (and untenable) effort to wall off that doctrine from the rest of our substantive due process jurisprudence, invite a fresh survey of this old terrain.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Substantive Content</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first, and most basic, principle established by our cases is that the rights protected by the Due Process Clause are not merely procedural in nature.  At first glance, this proposition might seem surprising, given that the Clause refers to \xe2\x80\x9cprocess.\xe2\x80\x9d  But substance and procedure are often deeply entwined.  Upon closer inspection, the text can be read to \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[e] nothing less than an obligation to give substantive content to the words \xe2\x80\x98liberty\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98due process of law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/702/index.html">521 U.

Procedural guarantees are hollow unless linked to substantive interests; and no amount of process can legitimize some deprivations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have yet to see a persuasive argument that the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment thought otherwise.  To the contrary, the historical evidence suggests that, at least by the time of the Civil War if not much earlier, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdue process of law\xe2\x80\x9d had acquired substantive content as a term of art within the legal community.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  This understanding is consonant with the venerable \xe2\x80\x9cnotion that governmental authority has implied limits which preserve private autonomy,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] a notion which predates the founding and which finds reinforcement in the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth Amendment, see <em>Griswold</em> v. <em>Connecticut</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/index.html"></a><a href="/us/381/479/index.html">381 U.

Some of our most enduring precedents, accepted today by virtually everyone, were substantive due process decisions.  See, <em>e.g., Loving</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/388/1/index.html">388 U.

For it is the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment that grounds our most important holdings in this field.  It is the liberty clause that enacts the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpromise\xe2\x80\x9d that a measure of dignity and self-rule will be afforded to all persons.  <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/833/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/833/index.html">505 U. S. 833</a>, 847 (1992).  It is the liberty clause that reflects and renews \xe2\x80\x9cthe origins of the American heritage of freedom [and] the abiding interest in individual liberty that makes certain state intrusions on the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s right to decide how he will live his own life intolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fitzgerald</em> v. <em>Porter Memorial Hospital</em>, 523 F.\xc2\xa02d 716, 720 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.).  Our substantive due process cases have episodically invoked values such as privacy and equality as well, values that in certain contexts may intersect with or complement a subject\xe2\x80\x99s liberty interests in profound ways.  But as I have observed on numerous occasions, \xe2\x80\x9cmost of the significant [20th-century] cases raising Bill of Rights issues have, in the final analysis, actually interpreted the word \xe2\x80\x98liberty\xe2\x80\x99 in the Fourteenth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It follows that the term \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation,\xe2\x80\x9d like the term \xe2\x80\x9cunenumerated rights,\xe2\x80\x9d is something of a misnomer.  Whether an asserted substantive due process interest is explicitly named in one of the first eight Amendments to the Constitution or is not mentioned, the underlying inquiry is the same: We must ask whether the interest is \xe2\x80\x9ccomprised within the term liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitney</em>, 274 U. S., at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring).  As the second Justice Harlan has shown, ever since the Court began considering the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the States, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Court\xe2\x80\x99s usual approach has been to ground the prohibitions against state action squarely on due process, without intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Malloy</em> v. <em>Hogan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/1/index.html">378 U.

As drafted, the Bill of Rights directly constrained only the Federal Government.  See <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan</em> v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore</em>, 7 Pet. 243 (1833).  Although the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment profoundly altered our legal order, it \xe2\x80\x9cdid not unstitch the basic federalist pattern woven into our constitutional fabric.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/399/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/399/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/399/78/index.html">399 U. S. 78</a>, 133 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result).  Nor, for that matter, did it expressly alter the Bill of Rights.  The Constitution still envisions a system of divided sovereignty, still \xe2\x80\x9cestablishes a federal republic where local differences are to be cherished as elements of liberty\xe2\x80\x9d in the vast run of cases, <em>National Rifle Assn. of Am. Inc.</em> v. <em>Chicago</em>, 567 F.\xc2\xa03d 856, 860 (CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C.\xc2\xa0J.), still allocates a general \xe2\x80\x9cpolice power \xe2\x80\xa6 to the States and the States alone,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Comstock</em>, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  Elementary considerations of constitutional text and structure suggest there may be legitimate reasons to hold state governments to different standards than the Federal Government in certain areas.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true, as the Court emphasizes, <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9319, that we have made numerous provisions of the Bill of Rights fully applicable to the States.  It is settled, for instance, that the Governor of Alabama has no more power than the President of the United States to authorize unreasonable searches and seizures.  <em>Ker</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/23/index.html">374 U. S. 23</a> (1963).  But we have never accepted a \xe2\x80\x9ctotal incorporation\xe2\x80\x9d theory of the Fourteenth Amendment, whereby the Amendment is deemed to subsume the provisions of the Bill of Rights en masse.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15.  And we have declined to apply several provisions to the States in any measure.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co.</em> v. <em>Bombolis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/241/211/index.html">241 U. S. 211</a> (1916) (Seventh Amendment); <em>Hurtado</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/110/516/index.html">110 U. S. 516</a> (1884) (Grand Jury Clause).  We have, moreover, resisted a uniform approach to the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s criminal jury guarantee, demanding 12-member panels and unanimous verdicts in federal trials, yet not in state trials.  See <em>Apodaca</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/404/index.html">406 U. S. 404</a> (1972) (plurality opinion); <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/399/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/399/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/399/78/index.html">399 U. S. 78</a>.  In recent years, the Court has repeatedly declined to grant certiorari to review that disparity.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  While those denials have no precedential significance, they confirm the proposition that the \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation\xe2\x80\x9d of a provision of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment does not, in itself, mean the provision must have precisely the same meaning in both contexts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true, as well, that during the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s the Court decided a number of cases involving procedural rights in which it treated the Due Process Clause as if it transplanted language from the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment.  See, <em>e.g., Benton</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/784/index.html">395 U. S. 784</a>, 795 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); <em>Pointer</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/400/index.html">380 U. S. 400</a>, 406 (1965) (Confrontation Clause).  \xe2\x80\x9cJot-for-jot\xe2\x80\x9d incorporation was the norm in this expansionary era.  Yet at least one subsequent opinion suggests that these precedents require perfect state/federal congruence only on matters \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98at the core\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the relevant constitutional guarantee.  <em>Crist</em> v. <em>Bretz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/28/index.html">437 U. S. 28</a>, 37 (1978); see also <em>id.,</em> at 52\xe2\x80\x9353 (Powell, J., dissenting).  In my judgment, this line of cases is best understood as having concluded that, to ensure a criminal trial satisfies essential standards of fairness, some procedures should be the same in state and federal courts: The need for certainty and uniformity is more pressing, and the margin for error slimmer, when criminal justice is at issue.  That principle has little relevance to the question whether a <em>non</em>procedural rule set forth in the Bill of Rights qualifies as an aspect of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding some overheated dicta in <em>Malloy</em>, 378 U. S., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, it is therefore an overstatement to say that the Court has \xe2\x80\x9cabandoned,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, 17 (majority opinion), 39 (plurality opinion), a \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-track approach to incorporation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 37 (plurality opinion).  The Court moved away from that approach in the area of criminal procedure.  But the Second Amendment differs in fundamental respects from its neighboring provisions in the Bill of Rights, as I shall explain in Part V, <em>infra;</em> and if some 1960\xe2\x80\x99s opinions purported to establish a general method of incorporation, that hardly binds us in this case.  The Court has not hesitated to cut back on perceived Warren Court excesses in more areas than I can count.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not mean to deny that there can be significant practical, as well as esthetic, benefits from treating rights symmetrically with regard to the State and Federal Governments.  Jot-for-jot incorporation of a provision may entail greater protection of the right at issue and therefore greater freedom for those who hold it; jot-for-jot incorporation may also yield greater clarity about the contours of the legal rule.  See<em> Johnson</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/356/index.html">406 U. S. 356</a>, 384\xe2\x80\x93388 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting); <em>Pointer</em>, 380 U. S., at 413\xe2\x80\x93414 (Goldberg, J., concurring).  In a federalist system such as ours, however, this approach can carry substantial costs.  When a federal court insists that state and local authorities follow its dictates on a matter not critical to personal liberty or procedural justice, the latter may be prevented from engaging in the kind of beneficent \xe2\x80\x9cexperimentation in things social and economic\xe2\x80\x9d that ultimately redounds to the benefit of all Americans.  <em>New State Ice Co.</em> v. <em>Liebmann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/262/index.html">285 U. S. 262</a>, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  The costs of federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 imposing a uniform national standard may be especially high when the relevant regulatory interests vary significantly across localities, and when the ruling implicates the States\xe2\x80\x99 core police powers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, there is a real risk that, by demanding the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply identically to the States, federal courts will cause those provisions to \xe2\x80\x9cbe watered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/index.html">391 U. S. 145</a>, 182, n.\xc2\xa021 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissenting).  When one legal standard must prevail across dozens of jurisdictions with disparate needs and customs, courts will often settle on a relaxed standard.  This watering-down risk is particularly acute when we move beyond the narrow realm of criminal procedure and into the relatively vast domain of substantive rights.  So long as the requirements of fundamental fairness are always and everywhere respected, it is not clear that greater liberty results from the jot-for-jot application of a provision of the Bill of Rights to the States.  Indeed, it is far from clear that proponents of an individual right to keep and bear arms ought to celebrate today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So far, I have explained that substantive due process analysis generally requires us to consider the term \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d in the Fourteenth Amendment, and that this inquiry may be informed by but does not depend upon the content of the Bill of Rights.  How should a court go about the analysis, then?  Our precedents have established, not an exact methodology, but rather a framework for decisionmaking.  In this respect, too, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s narrative fails to capture the continuity and flexibility in our doctrine.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The basic inquiry was described by Justice Cardozo more than 70 years ago.  When confronted with a substantive due process claim, we must ask whether the allegedly unlawful practice violates values \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Palko</em> v. <em>Connecticut</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/index.html"></a><a href="/us/302/319/index.html">302 U. S. 319</a>, 325 (1937).[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  If the practice in question lacks any \xe2\x80\x9coppressive and arbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d character, if judicial enforcement of the asserted right would not materially contribute to \xe2\x80\x9ca fair and enlightened system of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d then the claim is unsuitable for substantive due process protection.  <em>Id.,</em> at 327, 325.  Implicit in Justice Cardozo\xe2\x80\x99s test is a recognition that the postulates of liberty have a universal character.  Liberty claims that are inseparable from the customs that prevail in a certain region, the idiosyncratic expectations of a certain group, or the personal preferences of their champions, may be valid claims in some sense; but they are not of constitutional stature.  Whether conceptualized as a \xe2\x80\x9crational continuum\xe2\x80\x9d of legal precepts, <em>Poe</em>, 367 U. S., at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting), or a seamless web of moral commitments, the rights embraced by the liberty clause transcend the local and the particular.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Cardozo\xe2\x80\x99s test undeniably requires judges to apply their own reasoned judgment, but that does not mean it involves an exercise in abstract philosophy.  In addition to other constraints I will soon discuss, see Part III, <em>infra</em>, historical and empirical data of various kinds ground the analysis.  Textual commitments laid down elsewhere in the Constitution, judicial precedents, English common law, legislative and social facts, scientific and professional developments, practices of other civilized societies,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] and, above all else, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98traditions and conscience of our people,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Palko</em>, 302 U. S., at 325 (quoting <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/291/97/index.html">291 U. S. 97</a>, 105 (1934)), are critical variables.  They can provide evidence about which rights really are vital to ordered liberty, as well as a spur to judicial action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court errs both in its interpretation of <em>Palko </em>and in its suggestion that later cases rendered <em>Palko</em>\xe2\x80\x99s methodology defunct.  Echoing <em>Duncan</em>, the Court advises that Justice Cardozo\xe2\x80\x99s test will not be satisfied \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (quoting 391 U. S., at 149, n.\xc2\xa014).  <em>Palko </em>does contain some language that could be read to set an inordinate bar to substantive due process recognition, reserving it for practices without which \xe2\x80\x9cneither liberty nor justice would exist.\xe2\x80\x9d  302 U. S., at 326.  But in view of Justice Cardozo\xe2\x80\x99s broader analysis, as well as the numerous cases that have upheld liberty claims under the <em>Palko </em>standard, such readings are plainly overreadings.  We have never applied <em>Palko </em>in such a draconian manner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor, as the Court intimates, see <em>ante</em>, at 16, did <em>Duncan </em>mark an irreparable break from <em>Palko</em>,<em> </em>swapping out liberty for history.  <em>Duncan </em>limited its discussion to \xe2\x80\x9cparticular procedural safeguard[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in the Bill of Rights relating to \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal processes,\xe2\x80\x9d 391 U. S., at 149, n.\xc2\xa014; it did not purport to set a standard for other types of liberty interests.  Even with regard to procedural safeguards, <em>Duncan </em>did not jettison the <em>Palko </em>test so much as refine it: The judge is still tasked with evaluating whether a practice \xe2\x80\x9cis fundamental \xe2\x80\xa6 to ordered liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d within the context of the \xe2\x80\x9cAnglo-American\xe2\x80\x9d system.  <em>Duncan</em>, 391 U. S., at 149\xe2\x80\x93150, n.\xc2\xa014.  Several of our most important recent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive due process analysis\xe2\x80\x94from which, once again, \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation\xe2\x80\x9d analysis derives\xe2\x80\x94must not be wholly backward looking.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/558/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/558/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/558/index.html">539 U.

The Court hinges its entire decision on one mode of intellectual history, culling selected pronouncements and enactments from the 18th and 19th centuries to ascertain what Americans thought about firearms.  Relying on <em>Duncan </em>and <em>Glucksberg</em>, the plurality suggests that only interests that have proved \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental from an American perspective,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 37, 44, or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19 (quoting <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U. S., at 721), to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction, may qualify for incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment.  To the extent the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion could be read to imply that the historical pedigree of a right is the exclusive or dispositive determinant of its status under the Due Process Clause, the opinion is seriously mistaken.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A rigid historical test is inappropriate in this case, most basically, because our substantive due process doctrine has never evaluated substantive rights in purely, or even predominantly, historical terms.  When the Court applied many of the <em>procedural</em> guarantees in the Bill of Rights to the States in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s, it often asked whether the guarantee in question was \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental in the context of the criminal processes maintained by the American States.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  <em>Duncan</em>, 391 U. S., at 150, n.\xc2\xa014.  That inquiry could extend back through time, but it was focused not so much on historical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional significance within the States\xe2\x80\x99 regimes.  This contextualized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any given trial-type procedure means little in the abstract.  It is only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes with other procedures and practices in a criminal justice system that its relationship to \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdue process\xe2\x80\x9d can be determined.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to recognize rights distinct from the trial context\xe2\x80\x94rights relating to the primary conduct of free individuals\xe2\x80\x94Justice Cardozo\xe2\x80\x99s test has been our guide.  The right to free speech, for instance, has been safeguarded from state infringement not because the States have always honored it, but because it is \xe2\x80\x9cessential to free government\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto the maintenance of democratic institutions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, because the right to free speech is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.  <em>Thornhill</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/88/index.html"></a><a href="/us/310/88/index.html">310 U.

For if it were really the case that the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of liberty embraces only those rights \xe2\x80\x9cso rooted in our history, tradition, and practice as to require special protection,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U.

S., at 183 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (critiquing \xe2\x80\x9ccircular[ity]\xe2\x80\x9d of historicized test for incorporation).  That approach is unfaithful to the expansive principle Americans laid down when they ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and to the level of generality they chose when they crafted its language; it promises an objectivity it cannot deliver and masks the value judgments that pervade any analysis of what customs, defined in what manner, are sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rooted\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; it countenances the most revolting injustices in the name of continuity,[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] for we must never forget that not only slavery but also the subjugation of women and other rank forms of discrimination are part of our history; and it effaces this Court\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive role in saying what the law is, leaving the development and safekeeping of liberty to majoritarian political processes.  It is judicial abdication in the guise of judicial modesty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No, the liberty safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment is not merely preservative in nature but rather is a \xe2\x80\x9cdynamic concept.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stevens, The Bill of Rights: A Century of Progress, 59 U. Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 13, 38 (1972).  Its dynamism provides a central means through which the Framers enabled the Constitution to \xe2\x80\x9cendure for ages to come,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819), a central example of how they \xe2\x80\x9cwisely spoke in general language and left to succeeding generations the task of applying that language to the unceasingly changing environment in which they would live,\xe2\x80\x9d Rehnquist, The Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Tex.

In considering such a majestic term as \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d and applying it to present circumstances, how are we to do justice to its urgent call and its open texture\xe2\x80\x94and to the grant of interpretive discretion the latter embodies\xe2\x80\x94without injecting excessive subjectivity or unduly restricting the States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cbroad latitude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems of vital local concern,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Whalen</em> v. <em>Roe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/589/index.html">429 U. S. 589</a>, 597 (1977)?  One part of the answer, already discussed, is that we must ground the analysis in historical experience and reasoned judgment, and never on \xe2\x80\x9cmerely personal and private notions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rochin</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/165/index.html">342 U. S. 165</a>, 170 (1952).  Our precedents place a number of additional constraints on the decisional process.  Although \xe2\x80\x9cguideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Collins</em> v. <em>Harker Heights</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/115/index.html">503 U. S. 115</a>, 125 (1992), significant guideposts do exist.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most basic is that we have eschewed attempts to provide any all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of \xe2\x80\x9cliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  That project is bound to end in failure or worse.  The Framers did not express a clear understanding of the term to guide us, and the now-repudiated <em>Lochner </em>line of cases attests to the dangers of judicial overconfidence in using substantive due process to advance a broad theory of the right or the good.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lochner</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/index.html">198 U. S. 45</a> (1905).  In its most durable precedents, the Court \xe2\x80\x9chas not attempted to define with exactness the liberty \xe2\x80\xa6 guaranteed\xe2\x80\x9d by the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Meyer</em>, 262 U. S., at 399; see also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Bolling</em>, 347 U. S. at 499.  By its very nature, the meaning of liberty cannot be \xe2\x80\x9creduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by reference to any code.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Poe</em>, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet while \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98liberty\xe2\x80\x99 specially protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps not capable of being fully clarified,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U. S., at 722, it is capable of being refined and delimited.  We have insisted that only certain types of especially significant personal interests may qualify for especially heightened protection.  Ever since \xe2\x80\x9cthe deviant economic due process cases [were] repudiated,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 761 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment), our doctrine has steered away from \xe2\x80\x9claws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Griswold</em>, 381 U. S., at 482, and has instead centered on \xe2\x80\x9cmatters relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Paul</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/693/index.html">424 U. S. 693</a>, 713 (1976).  These categories are not exclusive.  Government action that shocks the conscience, pointlessly infringes settled expectations, trespasses into sensitive private realms or life choices without adequate justification, perpetrates gross injustice, or simply lacks a rational basis will always be vulnerable to judicial invalidation.  Nor does the fact that an asserted right falls within one of these categories end the inquiry.  More fundamental rights may receive more robust judicial protection, but the strength of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s liberty interests and the State\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory interests must always be assessed and compared.  No right is absolute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than seek a categorical understanding of the liberty clause, our precedents have thus elucidated a conceptual core.  The clause safeguards, most basically, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability independently to define one\xe2\x80\x99s identity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Roberts</em> v. <em>United States Jaycees</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/609/index.html">468 U. S. 609</a>, 619 (1984), \xe2\x80\x9cthe individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to make certain unusually important decisions that will affect his own, or his family\xe2\x80\x99s, destiny,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 523 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 719, and the right to be respected as a human being.  Self-determination, bodily integrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political equality, dignity and respect\xe2\x80\x94these are the central values we have found implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another key constraint on substantive due process analysis is respect for the democratic process.  If a particular liberty interest is already being given careful consideration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the States, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.  When the Court declined to establish a general right to physician-assisted suicide, for example, it did so in part because \xe2\x80\x9cthe States [were] currently engaged in serious, thoughtful examinations of physician-assisted suicide and other similar issues,\xe2\x80\x9d rendering judicial intervention both less necessary and potentially more disruptive.  <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U. S., at 719, 735.  Conversely, we have long appreciated that more \xe2\x80\x9csearching\xe2\x80\x9d judicial review may be justified when the rights of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete and insular minorities\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94groups that may face systematic barriers in the political system\xe2\x80\x94are at stake.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Carolene Products Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/144/index.html">304 U. S. 144</a>, 153, n.\xc2\xa04 (1938).  Courts have a \xe2\x80\x9ccomparative \xe2\x80\xa6 advantage\xe2\x80\x9d over the elected branches on a limited, but significant, range of legal matters.  <em>Post</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing a new liberty right is a momentous step.  It takes that right, to a considerable extent, \xe2\x80\x9coutside the arena of public debate and legislative action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U. S., at 720.  Sometimes that momentous step must be taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dignity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and demand a baseline level of protection.  But sensitivity to the interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and the practical realities of contemporary society provides an important tool for guiding judicial discretion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the need to approach our work with humility and caution.  Because the relevant constitutional language is so \xe2\x80\x9cspacious,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Duncan</em>, 391 U. S., at 148, I have emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Collins</em>, 503 U. S., at 125.  Many of my colleagues and predecessors have stressed the same point, some with great eloquence.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Casey</em>, 505 U. S., at 849; <em>Moore</em> v. <em>East Cleveland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/494/index.html"></a><a href="/us/431/494/index.html">431 U. S. 494</a>, 502\xe2\x80\x93503 (1977) (plurality opinion); <em>Poe</em>, 367 U. S., at 542\xe2\x80\x93545 (Harlan, J., dissenting); <em>Adamson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/46/index.html"></a><a href="/us/332/46/index.html">332 U. S. 46</a>, 68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  Historical study may discipline as well as enrich the analysis.  But the inescapable reality is that no serious theory of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment yields clear answers in every case, and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o formula could serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Poe</em>, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such restraint.  In the substantive due process field as in others, the Court has applied both the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em>\xe2\x80\x94adhering to precedents, respecting reliance interests, prizing stability and order in the law\xe2\x80\x94and the common-law method\xe2\x80\x94taking cases and controversies as they present themselves, proceeding slowly and incrementally, building on what came before.  This restrained methodology was evident even in the heyday of \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation\xe2\x80\x9d during the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s.  Although it would have been much easier for the Court simply to declare certain Amendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States <em>in toto</em>, the Court took care to parse each Amendment into its component guarantees, evaluating them one by one.  This piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize more closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reducing both the risk and the cost of error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an abstract plane, the Court has \xe2\x80\x9crequired in substantive-due-process cases a \xe2\x80\x98careful description\xe2\x80\x99 of the asserted fundamental liberty interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U. S., at 721 (quoting <em>Reno</em> v. <em>Flores</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/292/index.html">507 U. S. 292</a>, 302 (1993); <em>Collins</em>, 503 U. S., at 125; <em>Cruzan</em> v. <em>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/261/index.html">497 U. S. 261</a>, 277\xe2\x80\x93278 (1990)).  And just as we have required such careful description from the litigants, we have required of ourselves that we \xe2\x80\x9cfocus on the allegations in the complaint to determine how petitioner describes the constitutional right at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Collins</em>, 503 U. S., at 125; see also Stevens, Judicial Restraint, 22 San Diego L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 437, 446\xe2\x80\x93448 (1985).  This does not mean that we must define the asserted right at the most specific level, thereby sapping it of a universal valence and a moral force it might otherwise have.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  It means, simply, that we must pay close attention to the precise liberty interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holdings should be similarly tailored.  Even if the most expansive formulation of a claim does not qualify for substantive due process recognition, particular components of the claim might.  Just because there may not be a categorical right to physician-assisted suicide, for example, does not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98foreclose the possibility that an individual plaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose assistance was sought, could prevail in a more particularized challenge.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Glucksberg</em>,<em> </em>521 U. S., at 735, n.\xc2\xa024 (quoting <em>id.,</em> at 750 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgments)); see also <em>Vacco</em> v. <em>Quill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/793/index.html">521 U.

Even if a State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in regulating a certain matter must be permitted, in the general course, to trump the individual\xe2\x80\x99s countervailing liberty interest, there may still be situations in which the latter \xe2\x80\x9cis entitled to constitutional protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U.

To the contrary, only an honest reckoning with our discretion allows for honest argumentation and meaningful accountability.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question in this case, then, is not whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms (whatever that right\xe2\x80\x99s precise contours) applies to the States because the Amendment has been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.  It has not been.  The question, rather, is whether the particular right asserted by petitioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment itself, standing on its own bottom.  And to answer that question, we need to determine, first, the nature of the right that has been asserted and, second, whether that right is an aspect of Fourteenth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Even accepting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Heller</em>, it remains entirely possible that the right to keep and bear arms identified in that opinion is not judicially enforceable against the States, or that only part<em> </em>of the right is so enforceable.[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  It is likewise possible for the Court to find in this case that some part of the <em>Heller </em>right applies to the States, and then to find in later cases that other parts of the right also apply, or apply on different terms.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted at the outset, the liberty interest petitioners have asserted is the \xe2\x80\x9cright to possess a functional, personal firearm, including a handgun, within the home.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb634, App. 23.  The city of Chicago allows residents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are registered, but it generally prohibits the possession of handguns, sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and short-barreled rifles.  See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\x93050 (2009).[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint centered on their desire to keep a handgun at their domicile\xe2\x80\x94it references the \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb63\xe2\x80\x934, 11\xe2\x80\x9330, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19\xe2\x80\x9326\xe2\x80\x94as did their supporting declarations, see, <em>e.g.,</em> App. 34, 36, 40, 43, 49\xe2\x80\x9352, 54\xe2\x80\x9356.

The majority opinion<em> </em>contained some dicta suggesting the possibility of a more expansive arms-bearing right, one that would travel with the individual to an extent into public places, as \xe2\x80\x9cin case of confrontation.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19).  But the <em>Heller</em> plaintiff sought only dispensation to keep an operable firearm in his home for lawful self-defense, see <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 2, and n.\xc2\xa02), and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was bookended by reminders that its holding was limited to that one issue, <em>id.,</em> at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 64); accord, <em>ante</em>, at 44 (plurality opinion).  The distinction between the liberty right these petitioners have asserted and the Second Amendment right identified in <em>Heller </em>is therefore evanescent.  Both are rooted to the home.  Moreover, even if both rights have the logical potential to extend further, upon \xe2\x80\x9cfuture evaluation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 63), it is incumbent upon us, as federal judges contemplating a novel rule that would bind all 50 States, to proceed cautiously and to decide only what must be decided.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Understood as a plea to keep their preferred type of firearm in the home, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument has real force.[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  The decision to keep a loaded handgun in the house is often motivated by the desire to protect life, liberty, and property.  It is comparable, in some ways, to decisions about the education and upbringing of one\xe2\x80\x99s children.  For it is the kind of decision that may have profound consequences for every member of the family, and for the world beyond.  In considering whether to keep a handgun, heads of households must ask themselves whether the desired safety benefits outweigh the risks of deliberate or accidental misuse that may result in death or serious injury, not only to residents of the home but to others as well.  Millions of Americans have answered this question in the affirmative, not infrequently because they believe they have an inalienable right to do so\xe2\x80\x94because they consider it an aspect of \xe2\x80\x9cthe supreme human dignity of being master of one\xe2\x80\x99s fate rather than a ward of the State,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Indiana</em> v. <em>Edwards</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/164/index.html">554 U.

S. 573</a>, 585\xe2\x80\x93590 (1980); <em>Stanley</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/index.html">394 U. S. 557</a>, 565\xe2\x80\x93568 (1969); <em>Griswold</em>, 381 U. S., at 484\xe2\x80\x93485.  Consequently, we have long accorded special deference to the privacy of the home, whether a humble cottage or a magnificent manse.  This veneration of the domestic harkens back to the common law.  William Blackstone recognized a \xe2\x80\x9cright of habitation,\xe2\x80\x9d 4 Commentaries *223, and opined that \xe2\x80\x9cevery man\xe2\x80\x99s house is looked upon by the law to be his castle of defence and asylum,\xe2\x80\x9d 3 <em>id.,</em> at *288.  <em>Heller </em>carried forward this legacy, observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\xe2\x80\x9d in one\xe2\x80\x99s abode, and celebrating \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 56, 63).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the individual\xe2\x80\x99s interest in firearm possession is thus heightened in the home, the State\xe2\x80\x99s corresponding interest in regulation is somewhat weaker.  The State generally has a lesser basis for regulating private as compared to public acts, and firearms kept inside the home generally pose a lesser threat to public welfare as compared to firearms taken outside.  The historical case for regulation is likewise stronger outside the home, as many States have for many years imposed stricter, and less controversial, restrictions on the carriage of arms than on their domestic possession.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 54) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> English</em> v. <em>State</em>, 35 Tex. 473, 478\xe2\x80\x93479 (1871) (observing that \xe2\x80\x9calmost, if not every one of the States of this Union have [a prohibition on the carrying of deadly weapons] upon their statute books,\xe2\x80\x9d and lambasting claims of a right to carry such weapons as \xe2\x80\x9clittle short of ridiculous\xe2\x80\x9d); Miller, Guns as Smut: Defending the Home-Bound Second Amendment, 109 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1278, 1321\xe2\x80\x931336 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is significant, as well, that a rule limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home would be less intrusive on state prerogatives and easier to administer.  Having unleashed in <em>Heller</em> a tsunami of legal uncertainty, and thus litigation,[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] and now on the cusp of imposing a national rule on the States in this area for the first time in United States history, the Court could at least moderate the confusion, upheaval, and burden on the States by adopting a rule that is clearly and tightly bounded in scope.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In their briefs to this Court, several <em>amici </em>have sought to bolster petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim still further by invoking a right to individual self-defense.[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  As petitioners note, the <em>Heller </em>majority<em> </em>discussed this subject extensively and<em> </em>remarked that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 56).  And it is true that if a State were to try to deprive its residents of any reasonable means of defending themselves from imminent physical threats, or to deny persons any ability to assert self-defense in response to criminal prosecution, that might pose a significant constitutional problem.  The argument that there is a substantive due process right to be spared such untenable dilemmas is a serious one.[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But that is not the case before us.  Petitioners have not<em> </em>asked that we establish a constitutional right to individual self-defense; neither their pleadings in the District Court nor their filings in this Court make any such request.  Nor do petitioners contend that the city of Chicago\xe2\x80\x94which, recall, allows its residents to keep most rifles and shotguns, and to keep them loaded\xe2\x80\x94has unduly burdened any such right.  What petitioners have asked is that we \xe2\x80\x9cincorporate\xe2\x80\x9d the Second Amendment and thereby establish a constitutional entitlement, enforceable against the States, to keep a handgun in the home.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, owning a handgun may be useful for practicing self-defense.  But the right to take a certain type of action is analytically distinct from the right to acquire and utilize specific instrumentalities in furtherance of that action.  And while some might favor handguns, it is not clear that they are a superior weapon for lawful self-defense, and nothing in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument turns on that being the case.  The notion that a right of self-defense <em>implies</em> an auxiliary right to own a certain type of firearm presupposes not only controversial judgments about the strength and scope of the (posited) self-defense right, but also controversial assumptions about the likely effects\nof making that type of firearm more broadly available.  It is a very long way from the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a basic individual right of self-defense to the conclusion that a city may not ban handguns.[<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in particular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly relevant to an assessment of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 asserted right, there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case.  The question we must decide is whether the interest in keeping in the home a firearm of one\xe2\x80\x99s choosing\xe2\x80\x94a handgun, for petitioners\xe2\x80\x94is one that is \xe2\x80\x9ccomprised within the term liberty\xe2\x80\x9d in the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Whitney</em>, 274 U. S., at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring).</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I agree with the Court that our substantive due process cases offer a principled basis for holding that petitioners have a constitutional right to possess a usable fiream in the home, I am ultimately persuaded that a better reading of our case law supports the city of Chicago.  I would not foreclose the possibility that a particular plaintiff\xe2\x80\x94say, an elderly widow who lives in a dangerous neighborhood and does not have the strength to operate a long gun\xe2\x80\x94may have a cognizable liberty interest in possessing a handgun.  But I cannot accept petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 broader submission.  A number of factors, taken together, lead me to this conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship to liberty.  Just as they can help homeowners defend their families and property from intruders, they can help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent victims.  The threat that firearms will be misused is far from hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of our communities.  <em>Amici </em>calculate that approximately one million Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire in the last decade.[<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Urban areas such as Chicago suffer disproportionately from this epidemic of violence.  Handguns contribute disproportionately to it.  Just as some homeowners may prefer handguns because of their small size, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals will value them for the same reasons.  See <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 32\xe2\x80\x9333).  In recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more than four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of all murders nationwide.[<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from particular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides of the equation.  Guns may be useful for self-defense, as well as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique potential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to destabilize ordered liberty.  <em>Your</em> interest in keeping and bearing a certain firearm may diminish <em>my</em> interest in being and feeling safe from armed violence.  And while granting you the right to own a handgun might make you safer on any given day\xe2\x80\x94assuming the handgun\xe2\x80\x99s marginal contribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contribution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mischief\xe2\x80\x94it may make you and the community you live in less safe overall, owing to the increased number of handguns in circulation.  It is at least reasonable for a democratically elected legislature to take such concerns into account in considering what sorts of regulations would best serve the public welfare.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The practical impact of various gun-control measures may be highly controversial, but this basic insight should not be.  The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive threat to the social order\xe2\x80\x94and that reasonable restrictions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable burden on one\xe2\x80\x99s personal liberty\xe2\x80\x94is as old as the Republic.  As The Chief Justice observed just the other day, it is a foundational premise of modern government that the State holds a monopoly on legitimate violence: \xe2\x80\x9cA basic step in organizing a civilized society is to take [the] sword out of private hands and turn it over to an organized government, acting on behalf of all the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Robertson</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Watson</em>, <em>ante</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 11) (dissenting opinion).  The same holds true for the handgun.  The power a man has in the state of nature \xe2\x80\x9cof doing whatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind, he gives up,\xe2\x80\x9d to a significant extent, \xe2\x80\x9cto be regulated by laws made by the society.\xe2\x80\x9d  J.\xc2\xa0Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \xc2\xa7129, p.\xc2\xa064 (J. Gough ed. 1947).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home complicates the analysis but does not dislodge this conclusion.  Even though the Court has long afforded special solicitude for the privacy of the home, we have never understood that principle to \xe2\x80\x9cinfring[e] upon\xe2\x80\x9d the authority of the States to proscribe certain inherently dangerous items, for \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n such cases, compelling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the individual to possess those materials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stanley</em>, 394 U. S., at 568, n.\xc2\xa011.  And, of course, guns that start out in the home may not stay in the home.  Even if the government has a weaker basis for restricting domestic possession of firearms as compared to public carriage\xe2\x80\x94and even if a blanket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might therefore be unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x94the line between the two is a porous one.  A state or local legislature may determine that a prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon is necessary to police that line.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the right to possess a firearm of one\xe2\x80\x99s choosing is different in kind from the liberty interests we have recognized under the Due Process Clause.  Despite the plethora of substantive due process cases that have been decided in the post-<em>Lochner</em> century, I have found none that holds, states, or even suggests that the term \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense or a right to keep and bear arms.  I do not doubt for a moment that many Americans feel deeply passionate about firearms, and see them as critical to their way of life as well as to their security.  Nevertheless, it does not appear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or any particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of autonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace offers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imperfect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their <em>amici </em>make such a contention.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim is not the kind of substantive interest, accordingly, on which a uniform, judicially enforced national standard is presumptively appropriate.[<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue may be better viewed as a property right.  Petitioners wish to <em>acquire </em>certain types of firearms, or to <em>keep </em>certain firearms they have previously acquired.  Interests in the possession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as property interests subject to definition and regulation by the States.  Cf. <em>Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc.</em> v. <em>Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection</em>, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally speaking, state law defines property interests\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under that tradition, Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s ordinance is unexceptional.[<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The liberty interest asserted by petitioners is also dissimilar from those we have recognized in its capacity to undermine the security of others.  To be sure, some of the Bill of Rights\xe2\x80\x99 procedural guarantees may place \xe2\x80\x9crestrictions on law enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d that have \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversial public safety implications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 36 (plurality opinion); see also <em>ante</em>, at 9 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  But those implications are generally quite attenuated.  A defendant\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness, or to exclude certain evidence cannot directly cause any threat.  The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liberty interest is constrained by (and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process.  The link between handgun ownership and public safety is much tighter.  The handgun is itself a tool for crime; the handgun\xe2\x80\x99s bullets <em>are </em>the violence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, it is undeniable that some may take profound offense at a remark made by the soapbox speaker, the practices of another religion, or a gay couple\xe2\x80\x99s choice to have intimate relations.  But that offense is moral, psychological, or theological in nature; the actions taken by the rights-bearers do not actually threaten the physical safety of any other person.[<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Firearms may be used to kill another person.  If a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s response to dangerous weapons ends up impinging upon the liberty of any individuals in pursuit of the greater good, it invariably does so on the basis of more than the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98own moral code,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lawrence</em>, 539 U. S., at 571 (quoting <em>Casey</em>, 505 U. S., at 850).  While specific policies may of course be misguided, gun control is an area in which it \xe2\x80\x9cis quite wrong \xe2\x80\xa6 to assume that regulation and liberty occupy mutually exclusive zones\xe2\x80\x94that as one expands, the other must contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stevens, 41 U. Miami L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 280.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the experience of other advanced democracies, including those that share our British heritage, undercuts the notion that an expansive right to keep and bear arms is intrinsic to ordered liberty.  Many of these countries place restrictions on the possession, use, and carriage of firearms far more onerous than the restrictions found in this Nation.  See Municipal Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Brief 21\xe2\x80\x9323 (discussing laws of England, Canada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand).  That the United States is an international outlier in the permissiveness of its approach to guns does not suggest that our laws are bad laws.  It does suggest that this Court may not need to assume responsibility for making our laws still more<em> </em>permissive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Admittedly, these other countries differ from ours in many relevant respects, including their problems with violent crime and the traditional role that firearms have played in their societies.  But they are not so<em> </em>different from the United States that we ought to dismiss their experience entirely.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335 (plurality opinion); <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The fact that our oldest allies have almost uniformly found it appropriate to regulate firearms extensively tends to weaken petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 submission that the right to possess a gun of one\xe2\x80\x99s choosing is fundamental to a life of liberty.  While the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican perspective\xe2\x80\x9d must always be our focus, <em>ante</em>, at 37, 44 (plurality opinion), it is silly\xe2\x80\x94indeed, arrogant\xe2\x80\x94to think we have nothing to learn about liberty from the billions of people beyond our borders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the Second Amendment differs in kind from the Amendments that surround it, with the consequence that its inclusion in the Bill of Rights is not merely unhelpful but positively harmful to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim.  Generally, the inclusion of a liberty interest in the Bill of Rights points toward the conclusion that it is of fundamental significance and ought to be enforceable against the States.  But the Second Amendment plays a peculiar role within the Bill, as announced by its peculiar opening clause.[<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  Even accepting the <em>Heller </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that the Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms disconnected from militia service, it remains undeniable that \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose for which the right was codified\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent elimination of the militia.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Miller</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/307/174/index.html">307 U. S. 174</a>, 178 (1939) (Second Amendment was enacted \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ith obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of [militia] forces\xe2\x80\x9d).  It was the States, not private persons, on whose immediate behalf the Second Amendment was adopted.  Notwithstanding the <em>Heller </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to write the Second Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s preamble out of the Constitution, the Amendment still serves the structural function of protecting the States from encroachment by an overreaching Federal Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Amendment, in other words, \xe2\x80\x9cis a federalism provision,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Elk Grove Unified School Dist.</em> v. <em>Newdow</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/1/index.html">542 U. S. 1</a>, 45 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  It is directed at preserving the autonomy of the sovereign States, and its logic therefore \xe2\x80\x9cresists\xe2\x80\x9d incorporation by a federal court <em>against </em>the States.  <em>Ibid.</em>  No one suggests that the Tenth Amendment, which provides that powers not given to the Federal Government remain with \xe2\x80\x9cthe States,\xe2\x80\x9d applies to the States; such a reading would border on incoherent, given that the Tenth Amendment exists (in significant part) to safeguard the vitality of state governance.  The Second Amendment is no different.[<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is surely correct that Americans\xe2\x80\x99 conceptions of the Second Amendment right evolved over time in a more individualistic direction; that Members of the Reconstruction Congress were urgently concerned about the safety of the newly freed slaves; and that some Members believed that, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Second Amendment would apply to the States.  But it is a giant leap from these data points to the conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cincorporated\xe2\x80\x9d the Second Amendment as a matter of original meaning or postenactment interpretation.  Consider, for example, that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment says nothing about the Second Amendment or firearms; that there is substantial evidence to suggest that, when the Reconstruction Congress enacted measures to ensure newly freed slaves and Union sympathizers in the South enjoyed the right to possess firearms, it was motivated by antidiscrimination and equality concerns rather than arms-bearing concerns <em>per se;[<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]</em> that many contemporaneous courts and commentators did not understand the Fourteenth Amendment to have had an \xe2\x80\x9cincorporating\xe2\x80\x9d effect; and that the States heavily regulated the right to keep and bear arms both before and after the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s narrative largely elides these facts.  The complications they raise show why even the most dogged historical inquiry into the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentality\xe2\x80\x9d of the Second Amendment right (or any other) necessarily entails judicial judgment\xe2\x80\x94and therefore judicial discretion\xe2\x80\x94every step of the way.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I accept that the evolution in Americans\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of the Second Amendment may help shed light on the question whether a right to keep and bear arms is comprised within Fourteenth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the reasons that motivated the Framers to protect the ability of militiamen to keep muskets available for military use when our Nation was in its infancy, or that motivated the Reconstruction Congress to extend full citizenship to the freedmen in the wake of the Civil War, have only a limited bearing on the question that confronts the homeowner in a crime-infested metropolis today.  The many episodes of brutal violence against African-Americans that blight our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, see <em>ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9329 (majority opinion); <em>ante</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9344, 53\xe2\x80\x9355 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), do not suggest that every American must be allowed to own whatever type of firearm he or she desires\xe2\x80\x94just that no group of Americans should be systematically and discriminatorily disarmed and left to the mercy of racial terrorists.  And the fact that some Americans may have thought or hoped that the Fourteenth Amendment would nationalize the Second Amendment hardly suffices to justify the conclusion that it did.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, although it may be true that Americans\xe2\x80\x99 interest in firearm possession and state-law recognition of that interest are \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted\xe2\x80\x9d in some important senses, <em>ante</em>, at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted), it is equally true that the States have a long and unbroken history of regulating firearms.  The idea that States may place substantial restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms short of complete disarmament is, in fact, far more entrenched than the notion that the Federal Constitution protects any such right.  Federalism is a far \xe2\x80\x9colder and more deeply rooted tradition than is a right to carry,\xe2\x80\x9d or to own, \xe2\x80\x9cany particular kind of weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  567 F.\xc2\xa03d 856, 860 (CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C.\xc2\xa0J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the early days of the Republic, through the Reconstruction era, to the present day, States and municipalities have placed extensive licensing requirements on firearm acquisition, restricted the public carriage of weapons, and banned altogether the possession of especially dangerous weapons, including handguns.  See <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x937) (reviewing colonial laws); Cornell &amp; DeDino, A Well Regulated Right: The Early American Origins of Gun Control, 73 Fordham L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 487, 502\xe2\x80\x93516 (2004) (reviewing pre-Civil War laws); Brief for 34 Professional Historians and Legal Historians as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4\xe2\x80\x9322 (reviewing Reconstruction-era laws); Winkler, Scrutinizing the Second Amendment, 105 Mich.

And let us not forget that this Court did not recognize <em>any </em>non-militia-related interests under the Second Amendment until two Terms ago, in <em>Heller</em>.  Petitioners do not dispute the city of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s observation that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o other substantive Bill of Rights protection has been regulated nearly as intrusively\xe2\x80\x9d as the right to keep and bear arms.  Municipal Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Brief 25.[<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This history of intrusive regulation is not surprising given that the very text of the Second Amendment calls out for regulation,[<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>] and the ability to respond to the social ills associated with dangerous weapons goes to the very core of the States\xe2\x80\x99 police powers.  Our precedent is crystal-clear on this latter point.  See, <em>e.g., Gonzales</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/243/index.html">546 U. S. 243</a>, 270 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he structure and limitations of federalism \xe2\x80\xa6 allow the States great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U. S. 598</a>, 618 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e can think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Kelley</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/238/index.html">425 U. S. 238</a>, 247 (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe promotion of safety of persons and property is unquestionably at the core of the State\xe2\x80\x99s police power\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Automobile Workers</em> v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/351/266/index.html">351 U. S. 266</a>, 274 (1956) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe dominant interest of the State in preventing violence and property damage cannot be questioned.  It is a matter of genuine local concern\xe2\x80\x9d).  Compared with today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, most if not all of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions requiring the States to comply with other provisions in the Bill of Rights did not exact nearly so heavy a toll in terms of state sovereignty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, even apart from the States\xe2\x80\x99 long history of firearms regulation and its location at the core of their police powers, this is a quintessential area in which federalism ought to be allowed to flourish without this Court\xe2\x80\x99s meddling.  Whether or not we <em>can </em>assert a plausible constitutional basis for intervening, there are powerful reasons why we <em>should not</em> do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Across the Nation, States and localities vary significantly in the patterns and problems of gun violence they face, as well as in the traditions and cultures of lawful gun use they claim.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  The city of Chicago, for example, faces a pressing challenge in combating criminal street gangs.  Most rural areas do not.  The city of Chicago has a high population density, which increases the potential for a gunman to inflict mass terror and casualties.  Most rural areas do not.[<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]  The city of Chicago offers little in the way of hunting opportunities.  Residents of rural communities are, one presumes, much more likely to stock the dinner table with game they have personally felled.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given that relevant background conditions diverge so much across jurisdictions, the Court ought to pay particular heed to state and local legislatures\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cright to experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>New State Ice</em>, 285 U. S., at 311 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  So long as the regulatory measures they have chosen are not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d we should be allowing them to \xe2\x80\x9ctry novel social and economic\xe2\x80\x9d policies.  <em>Ibid.</em>  It \xe2\x80\x9cis more in keeping \xe2\x80\xa6 with our status as a court in a federal system,\xe2\x80\x9d under these circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid imposing a single solution \xe2\x80\xa6 from the top down.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/259/index.html">528 U. S. 259</a>, 275 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is all the more unwise for this Court to limit experimentation in an area \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the best solution is far from clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lopez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/index.html">514 U. S. 549</a>, 581 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Few issues of public policy are subject to such intensive and rapidly developing empirical controversy as gun control.  See <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20\xe2\x80\x9325) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s handgun ban, in itself, has divided researchers.  Compare Brief for Professors of Criminal Justice as <em>Amici Curiae</em> (arguing that ordinance has been effective at reducing gun violence), with Brief for International Law Enforcement Educators and Trainers Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>17\xe2\x80\x9326 (arguing that ordinance has been a failure).[<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]  Of course, on some matters the Constitution requires that we ignore such pragmatic considerations.  But the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text, history, and structure are not so clear on the matter before us\xe2\x80\x94as evidenced by the groundbreaking nature of today\xe2\x80\x99s fractured decision\xe2\x80\x94and this Court lacks both the technical capacity and the localized expertise to assess \xe2\x80\x9cthe wisdom, need, and propriety\xe2\x80\x9d of most gun-control measures.  <em>Griswold</em>, 381 U. S., at 482.[<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor will the Court\xe2\x80\x99s intervention bring any clarity to this enormously complex area of law.  Quite to the contrary, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision invites an avalanche of litigation that could mire the federal courts in fine-grained determinations about which state and local regulations comport with the <em>Heller </em>right\xe2\x80\x94the precise contours of which are far from pellucid\xe2\x80\x94under a standard of review we have not even established.  See <em>post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9315.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cassuranc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation does not imperil every law regulating firearms,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 40, provides only modest comfort.  For it is also an admission of just how many different types of regulations are potentially implicated by today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, and of just how ad\xc2\xa0hoc the<em> </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s initial attempt to draw distinctions among them was in <em>Heller</em>.  The practical significance of the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1 (majority opinion), remains to be worked out by this Court over many, many years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, and critically, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of a national standard is still more<em> </em>unwise because the elected branches have shown themselves to be perfectly capable of safeguarding the interest in keeping and bearing arms.  The strength of a liberty claim must be assessed in connection with its status in the democratic process.  And in this case, no one disputes \xe2\x80\x9cthat opponents of [gun] control have considerable political power and do not seem to be at a systematic disadvantage in the democratic process,\xe2\x80\x9d or that \xe2\x80\x9cthe widespread commitment to an individual right to own guns \xe2\x80\xa6 operates as a safeguard against excessive or unjustified gun control laws.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>]  Sunstein, Second Amendment Minimalism: <em>Heller </em>as <em>Griswold</em>, 122 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 246, 260 (2008).  Indeed, there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that, if anything, American lawmakers tend to <em>under</em>regulate guns, relative to the policy views expressed by majorities in opinion polls.  See K. Goss, Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America 6 (2006).  If a particular State or locality has enacted some \xe2\x80\x9cimprovident\xe2\x80\x9d gun-control measures, as petitioners believe Chicago has done, there is no apparent reason to infer that the mistake will not \xe2\x80\x9ceventually be rectified by the democratic process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vance</em> v. <em>Bradley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/93/index.html">440 U. S. 93</a>, 97 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not a case, then, that involves a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial condition\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cmay call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carolene Products</em>, 304 U. S., at 153, n.\xc2\xa04.  Neither petitioners nor those most zealously committed to their views represent a group or a claim that is liable to receive unfair treatment at the hands of the majority.  On the contrary, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 views are supported by powerful participants in the legislative process.  Petitioners have given us no reason to believe that the interest in keeping and bearing arms entails any special need for judicial lawmaking, or that federal judges are more qualified to craft appropriate rules than the people\xe2\x80\x99s elected representatives.  Having failed to show why their asserted interest is intrinsic to the concept of ordered liberty or vulnerable to maltreatment in the political arena, they have failed to show why \xe2\x80\x9cthe word liberty in the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d should be \xe2\x80\x9cheld to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion\xe2\x80\x9d about how to deal with the problem of handgun violence in the city\nof Chicago.  <em>Lochner</em>, 198 U. S., at 76 (Holmes, J.,\ndissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\nVI</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The preceding sections have already addressed many of the points made by Justice Scalia in his concurrence.  But in light of that opinion\xe2\x80\x99s fixation on this one, it is appropriate to say a few words about Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s broader claim: that his preferred method of substantive due process analysis, a method \xe2\x80\x9cthat makes the traditions of our people paramount,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1, is both more restrained and more facilitative of democracy than the method I have outlined.  Colorful as it is, Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s critique does not have nearly as much force as does his rhetoric.  His theory of substantive due process, moreover, comes with its own profound difficulties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although Justice Scalia aspires to an \xe2\x80\x9cobjective,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d method of substantive due process analysis, <em>ante</em>, at 10, his actual method is nothing of the sort.  Under the \xe2\x80\x9chistorically focused\xe2\x80\x9d approach he advocates, <em>ante</em>, at 13, numerous threshold questions arise before one ever gets to the history.  At what level of generality should one frame the liberty interest in question?  See n.\xc2\xa025, <em>supra</em>.  What does it mean for a right to be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 3 (quoting <em>Glucksberg</em>, 521 U. S., at 721)?  By what standard will that proposition be tested?  Which types of sources will count, and how will those sources be weighed and aggregated?  There is no objective, neutral answer to these questions.  There is not even a theory\xe2\x80\x94at least, Justice Scalia provides none\xe2\x80\x94of how to go about answering them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there any escaping <em>Palko</em>, it seems.  To qualify for substantive due process protection, Justice Scalia has stated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply rooted in American tradition, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it must <em>also</em> be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lawrence</em>, 539 U. S., at 593, n.\xc2\xa03 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying the latter, <em>Palko</em>-derived half of that test requires precisely the sort of reasoned judgment\xe2\x80\x94the same multifaceted evaluation of the right\xe2\x80\x99s contours and consequences\xe2\x80\x94that Justice Scalia mocks in his concurrence today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So does applying the first half.  It is hardly a novel insight that history is not an objective science, and that its use can therefore \xe2\x80\x9cpoint in any direction the judges favor,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Yet 21 years after the point was brought to his attention by Justice Brennan, Justice Scalia remains \xe2\x80\x9coblivious to the fact that [the concept of \xe2\x80\x98tradition\xe2\x80\x99] can be as malleable and elusive as \xe2\x80\x98liberty\xe2\x80\x99 itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Michael H.</em>, 491 U. S., at 137 (dissenting opinion).  Even when historical analysis is focused on a discrete proposition, such as the original public meaning of the Second Amendment, the evidence often points in different directions.  The historian must choose which pieces to credit and which to discount, and then must try to assemble them into a coherent whole.  In <em>Heller</em>, Justice Scalia preferred to rely on sources created much earlier and later in time than the Second Amendment itself, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935) (consulting late 19th-century treatises to ascertain how Americans would have read the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s preamble in 1791); I focused more closely on sources contemporaneous with the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s drafting and ratification.[<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>]  No mechanical yardstick can measure which of us was correct, either with respect to the materials we chose to privilege or the insights we gleaned from them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The malleability and elusiveness of history increase exponentially when we move from a pure question of original meaning, as in <em>Heller</em>, to Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s theory of substantive due process.  At least with the former sort of question, the judge can focus on a single legal provision; the temporal scope of the inquiry is (or should be) relatively bounded; and there is substantial agreement on what sorts of authorities merit consideration.  With Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s approach to substantive due process, these guideposts all fall away.  The judge must canvas the entire landscape of American law as it has evolved through time, and perhaps older laws as well, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lawrence</em>, 539 U. S., at 596 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (discussing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ancient roots\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of proscriptions against sodomy (quoting <em>Bowers</em> v. <em>Hardwick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/index.html"></a><a href="/us/478/186/index.html">478 U. S. 186</a>, 192 (1986)), pursuant to a standard (deeply rootedness) that has never been defined.  In conducting this rudderless, panoramic tour of American legal history, the judge has more than ample opportunity to \xe2\x80\x9clook over the heads of the crowd and pick out [his] friends,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 617 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My point is not to criticize judges\xe2\x80\x99 use of history in general or to suggest that it always generates indeterminate answers; I have already emphasized that historical study can discipline as well as enrich substantive due process analysis.  My point is simply that Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s defense of his method, which holds out objectivity and restraint as its cardinal\xe2\x80\x94and, it seems, only\xe2\x80\x94virtues, is unsatisfying on its own terms.  For a limitless number of subjective judgments may be smuggled into his historical analysis.  Worse, they may be <em>buried </em>in the analysis.  At least with my approach, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s cards are laid on the table for all to see, and to critique.  The judge must exercise judgment, to be sure.  When answering a constitutional question to which the text provides no clear answer, there is always some amount of discretion; our constitutional system has always depended on judges\xe2\x80\x99 filling in the document\xe2\x80\x99s vast open spaces.[<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]  But there is also transparency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s approach is even less restrained in another sense: It would effect a major break from our case law outside of the \xe2\x80\x9cincorporation\xe2\x80\x9d area.  Justice Scalia does not seem troubled by the fact that his method is largely inconsistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s canonical substantive due process decisions, ranging from <em>Meyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/390/index.html"></a><a href="/us/262/390/index.html">262 U. S. 390</a>, and <em>Pierce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/268/510/index.html"></a><a href="/us/268/510/index.html">268 U. S. 510</a>, in the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s, to <em>Griswold</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/index.html"></a><a href="/us/381/479/index.html">381 U. S. 479</a>, in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s, to <em>Lawrence</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/558/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/558/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/558/index.html">539 U. S. 558</a>, in the 2000\xe2\x80\x99s.  To the contrary, he seems to embrace this dissonance.  My method seeks to synthesize dozens of cases on which the American people have relied for decades.  Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s method seeks to vaporize them.  So I am left to wonder, which of us is more faithful to this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional history?  And which of us is more faithful to the values and commitments of the American people, as they stand today?  In 1967, when the Court held in <em>Loving</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/388/1/index.html">388 U. S. 1</a>, that adults have a liberty-based as well as equality-based right to wed persons of another race, interracial marriage was hardly \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted\xe2\x80\x9d in American tradition.  Racial segregation and subordination were deeply rooted.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s substantive due process holding was nonetheless correct\xe2\x80\x94and we should be wary of any interpretive theory that implies, emphatically, that it was not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Which leads me to the final set of points I wish to make: Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s method invites not only bad history, but also bad constitutional law.  As I have already explained, in evaluating a claimed liberty interest (or any constitutional claim for that matter), it makes perfect sense to give history significant weight: Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s position is closer to my own than he apparently feels comfortable acknowledging.  But it makes little sense to give history dispositive weight in every case.  And it makes <em>especially</em> little sense to answer questions like whether the right to bear arms is \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d by focusing only on the past, given that both the practical significance and the public understandings of such a right often change as society changes.  What if the evidence had shown that, whereas at one time firearm possession contributed substantially to personal liberty and safety, nowadays it contributes nothing, or even tends to undermine them?  Would it still have been reasonable to constitutionalize the right?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concern runs still deeper.  Not only can historical views be less than completely clear or informative, but they can also be wrong.   Some notions that many Americans deeply believed to be true, at one time, turned out not to be true.  Some practices that many Americans believed to be consistent with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantees of liberty and equality, at one time, turned out to be inconsistent with them.  The fact that we have a written Constitution does not consign this Nation to a static legal existence.  Although we should always \xe2\x80\x9cpa[y] a decent regard to the opinions of former times,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cis not the glory of the people of America\xe2\x80\x9d to have \xe2\x80\x9csuffered a blind veneration for antiquity.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 14, p. 99, 104 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).  It is not the role of federal judges to be amateur historians.  And it is not fidelity to the Constitution to ignore its use of deliberately capacious language, in an effort to transform foundational legal commitments into narrow rules of decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for \xe2\x80\x9cthe democratic process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, 15, a method that looks exclusively to history can easily do more harm than good.  Just consider this case.  The net result of Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly objective analysis is to vest federal judges\xe2\x80\x94ultimately a majority of the judges on this Court\xe2\x80\x94with unprecedented lawmaking powers in an area in which they have no special qualifications, and in which the give-and-take of the political process has functioned effectively for decades.  Why this \xe2\x80\x9cintrudes much less upon the democratic process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, than an approach that would defer<em> </em>to the democratic process on the regulation of firearms is, to say the least, not self-evident.  I cannot even tell what, under Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s view, constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cintrusion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is worth pondering, furthermore, the vision of democracy that underlies Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s critique.  Because very few of us would welcome a system in which majorities or powerful interest groups always get their way.  Under our constitutional scheme, I would have thought that a judicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have outlined\xe2\x80\x94an approach that investigates both the intrinsic nature of the claimed interest and the practical significance of its judicial enforcement, that is transparent in its reasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate constraints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it, and that is willing to protect some rights even if they have not already received uniform protection from the elected branches\xe2\x80\x94has the capacity to improve, rather than \xe2\x80\x9c[im]peril,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15, our democracy.  It all depends on judges\xe2\x80\x99 exercising careful, reasoned judgment.  As it always has, and as it always will.</p>\n<p align="left">VII</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that the right to keep and bear arms appears in the Constitution should not obscure the novelty of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to enforce that right against the States.  By its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the States; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals outside of the militia context.  The Second Amendment was adopted to protect<em> </em>the<em> States</em> from federal encroachment.  And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been understood by the Court to have \xe2\x80\x9cincorporated\xe2\x80\x9d the entire Bill of Rights.  There was nothing foreordained about today\xe2\x80\x99s outcome.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this case might be seen as a mere adjunct to its decision in <em>Heller</em>, the consequences could prove far more destructive\xe2\x80\x94quite literally\xe2\x80\x94to our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s communities and to our constitutional structure.  Thankfully, the Second Amendment right identified in <em>Heller </em>and its newly minted Fourteenth Amendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the home.

All 50 States already recognize self-defense as a defense to criminal prosecution, see 2 P. Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses \xc2\xa7132, p.\xc2\xa096 (1984 and Supp. 2009), so this is hardly an interest to which the democratic process has been insensitive.  And the States have always diverged on how exactly to implement this interest, so there is wide variety across the Nation in the types and amounts of force that may be used, the necessity of retreat, the rights of aggressors, the availability of the \xe2\x80\x9ccastle doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth.  See Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 9\xe2\x80\x9321; Brief for American Cities et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 17\xe2\x80\x9319; 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa710.4, pp.\xc2\xa0142\xe2\x80\x93160 (2d ed. 2003).  Such variation is presumed to be a healthy part of our federalist system, as the States and localities select different rules in light of different priorities, customs, and conditions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a historical and theoretical matter, moreover, the legal status of self-defense is far more complicated than it might first appear.  We have generally understood Fourteenth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d as something one holds against direct state interference, whereas a personal right of self-defense runs primarily against other individuals; absent government tyranny, it is only when the state has <em>failed</em> to interfere with (violent) private conduct that self-help becomes potentially necessary.  Moreover, it was a basic tenet of founding-era political philosophy that, in entering civil society and gaining \xe2\x80\x9cthe advantages of mutual commerce\xe2\x80\x9d and the protections of the rule of law, one had to relinquish, to a significant degree, \xe2\x80\x9cthat wild and savage liberty\xe2\x80\x9d one possessed in the state of nature.  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *125; see also, <em>e.g.,</em> J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \xc2\xa7128, pp.\xc2\xa063\xe2\x80\x9364 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (in state of nature man has power \xe2\x80\x9cto do whatever he thinks fit for the preservation of himself and others,\xe2\x80\x9d but this \xe2\x80\x9che gives up when he joins in a \xe2\x80\xa6 particular political society\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Green</em> v. <em>Biddle</em>, 8 Wheat. 1, 63 (1823) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a trite maxim, that man gives up a part of his natural liberty when he enters into civil society, as the price of the blessings of that state: and it may be said, with truth, that this liberty is well exchanged for the advantages which flow from law and justice\xe2\x80\x9d).  Some strains of founding-era thought took a very narrow view of the right to armed self-defense.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief of Historians on Early American Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 6\xe2\x80\x9313 (discussing Whig and Quaker theories).  Just because there may be a natural or common-law right to some measure of self-defense, it hardly follows that States may not place substantial restrictions on its exercise or that this Court should recognize a constitutional right to the same.</p>\n<a href="#T33" name="F33">Footnote 33</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Second Amendment right identified in <em>Heller</em> is likewise clearly distinct from a right to protect oneself.  In my view, the Court badly misconstrued the Second Amendment in linking it to the value of personal self-defense above and beyond the functioning of the state militias; as enacted, the Second Amendment was concerned with tyrants and invaders, and paradigmatically with the federal military, not with criminals and intruders.  But even still, the Court made clear that self-defense plays a limited role in determining the scope and substance of the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee.  The Court struck down the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s handgun ban not because of the <em>utility</em> of handguns for lawful self-defense, but rather because of their <em>popularity </em>for that purpose.

Both the constitutional text and our cases use the term \xe2\x80\x9cliberty,\xe2\x80\x9d however, and liberty is not a purely objective concept.
