The company refused to pay, alleging that they had paid no "dividends" to their depositors, and had only paid to them semiannual interest on their deposits.

The dividend apportioned to each account was to be in proportion to the time the several amounts represented in the account formed part of the funds of the corporation, and the rate of dividends or ordinary deposits was to be increased by twenty percent to form the rate upon funds remaining permanently in the hands of the corporation, including what were denominated "term deposits."  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="40">Page 89 U.

S. 41</a></p><p></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>A distinction is expressly recognized in the Act of Congress between interest and dividends, and the circuit court decided that the payments to the depositors were for dividends.  The question is whether this decision was correct.</p>\n<p>We think it was.  The depositors contracted not for a rate of interest to be paid upon their deposits, but for a share of the profits of the business in which their money was, by agreement, to be employed.  It is true that the profits of the company were principally to be derived from interest upon loans made, but they were nonetheless on that account profits.  The interest received for the loan of each deposit was not kept by itself and paid to the depositors after deducting a charge to cover expenses, but all was placed in a common fund, and when the net result of the business was ascertained, that was divided among the several contributors according to the value of their contributions.  Such a division clearly produces a dividend according to the common understanding of that term.  The parties themselves so understood it, for they gave it that name in the contracts, executed when the depositors made their deposits.  They stipulated for the payment of dividends and not interest.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment accordingly.</em></p>\n<p>* 13 Stat. at Large 283; 14 <em>id.</em> 138.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
