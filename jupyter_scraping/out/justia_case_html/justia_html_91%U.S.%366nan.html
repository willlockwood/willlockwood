CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The depositions in question were taken since the appeal, under a commission issued from the circuit court.  Further proof in the case has not been ordered by this Court.  No such order would have been granted if application therefor had been made unless a sufficient excuse was shown for not taking the evidence in the usual way before the courts below.  This was the rule established in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/77/419/case.html">The Mabey,</a></span></em> 10 Wall. 419.  We cannot admit depositions taken under a commission from the circuit court except upon a similar showing.  That has not been made.  Leave is granted to renew the motion if this defect can be supplied.</p>\n<p><em>Motion denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
