It is positive, and not alternative.  It leaves no question of right between the parties open for future adjudication.  The decree orders the money to be brought into court within a limited time, and the court warns the defendants that if they fail or make default a particular measure will be taken to compel obedience.  There is no want of finality here.</p>\n<p><em>The motion is denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
