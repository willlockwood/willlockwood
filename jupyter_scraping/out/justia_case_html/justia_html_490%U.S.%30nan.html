This case involves the status of twin illegitimate babies, whose parents were enrolled members of appellant Tribe and residents and domiciliaries of its reservation in Neshoba County, Mississippi.  After the twins\' births in Harrison County, some 200 miles from the reservation, and their parents\' execution of consent-to-adoption forms, they were adopted in that county\'s Chancery Court by the appellees Holyfield, who were non-Indian.  That court subsequently overruled appellant\'s motion to vacate the adoption decree, which was based on the assertion that, under the ICWA exclusive jurisdiction was vested in appellant\'s tribal court.  The Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed, holding, among other things, that the twins were not "domiciled" on the reservation under state law, in light of the Chancery Court\'s findings (1) that they had never been physically present there, and (2) that they were "voluntarily surrendered" by their parents, who went to some efforts to see that they were born outside the reservation and promptly arranged for their adoption.

This result is not altered by the fact that they were "voluntarily surrendered" for adoption.  Congress enacted the ICWA because of concerns going beyond the wishes of individual parents, finding that the removal of Indian children from their cultural setting seriously impacts on long-term tribal survival, and has a damaging social and psychological impact on many individual Indian children.  These concerns demonstrate that Congress could not have intended to enact a rule of domicile that would permit individual Indian parents to defeat the ICWA\'s jurisdictional scheme simply by giving birth and placing the child for adoption off the reservation.

Senate oversight hearings in 1974 yielded numerous examples, statistical data, and expert testimony documenting what one witness called "[t]he wholesale removal of Indian children from their homes, . . . the most tragic aspect of Indian life today."  Indian Child Welfare Program, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (statement of William Byler) (hereinafter 1974 Hearings).  Studies undertaken by the Association on American Indian Affairs in 1969 and 1974, and presented in the Senate hearings, showed that 25 to 35% of all Indian children had been separated from their families and placed in adoptive families, foster care, or institutions.  <em>Id.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="33">Page 490 U. S. 33</a></p><p> at 15; <em>see also</em> H.R.Rep. No. 95-1386, p. 9 (1978) (hereinafter House Report).  Adoptive placements counted significantly in this total:  in the State of Minnesota, for example, one in eight Indian children under the age of 18 was in an adoptive home, and, during the year 1971-1972, nearly one in every four infants under one year of age was placed for adoption.  The adoption rate of Indian children was eight times that of non-Indian children.  Approximately 90% of the Indian placements were in non-Indian homes.  1974 Hearings, at 75-83.  A number of witnesses also testified to the serious adjustment problems encountered by such children during adolescence, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  as well as the impact of the adoptions on Indian parents and the tribes themselves.  <em>See generally</em> 1974 Hearings.</p>\n<p>Further hearings, covering much the same ground, were held during 1977 and 1978 on the bill that became the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="34">Page 490 U. S. 34</a></p><p> ICWA. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  While much of the testimony again focused on the harm to Indian parents and their children who were involuntarily separated by decisions of local welfare authorities, there was also considerable emphasis on the impact on the tribes themselves of the massive removal of their children.  For example, Mr. Calvin Isaac, Tribal Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and representative of the National Tribal Chairmen\'s Association, testified as follows:</p>\n<p>"Culturally, the chances of Indian survival are significantly reduced if our children, the only real means for the transmission of the tribal heritage, are to be raised in non-Indian homes and denied exposure to the ways of their People.  Furthermore, these practices seriously undercut the tribes\' ability to continue as self-governing communities.  Probably in no area is it more important that tribal sovereignty be respected than in an area as socially and culturally determinative as family relationships."</p>\n<p>1978 Hearings at 193.  <em>See also id.</em> at 62. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Chief Isaac also summarized succinctly what numerous witnesses saw as the principal reason for the high rates of removal of Indian children:</p>\n<p>"One of the most serious failings of the present system is that Indian children are removed from the custody of their natural parents by nontribal government authorities who have no basis for intelligently evaluating the cultural and social premises underlying Indian home life </p><p><a class="page-number" name="35">Page 490 U. S. 35</a></p><p> and childrearing.  Many of the individuals who decide the fate of our children are, at best, ignorant of our cultural values, and, at worst, contemptful of the Indian way and convinced that removal, usually to a non-Indian household or institution, can only benefit an Indian child."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 191-192. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The congressional findings that were incorporated into the ICWA reflect these sentiments.  The Congress found:</p>\n<p>"(3) that there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children . . . ;"</p>\n<p>"(4) that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies, and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions; and"</p>\n<p>"(5) that the States, exercising their recognized jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings through administrative and judicial bodies, have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people </p><p><a class="page-number" name="36">Page 490 U. S. 36</a></p><p> and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families."</p>\n<p>25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1901.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the ICWA are its provisions concerning jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings.  Section 1911 lays out a dual jurisdictional scheme.  Section 1911(a) establishes exclusive jurisdiction in the tribal courts for proceedings concerning an Indian child "who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe," as well as for wards of tribal courts regardless of domicile. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Section 1911(b), on the other hand, creates concurrent but presumptively tribal jurisdiction in the case of children not domiciled on the reservation:  on petition of either parent or the tribe, state court proceedings for foster care placement or termination of parental rights are to be transferred to the tribal court, except in cases of "good cause," objection by either parent, or declination of jurisdiction by the tribal court.</p>\n<p>Various other provisions of ICWA Title I set procedural and substantive standards for those child custody proceedings that do take place in state court.  The procedural safeguards include requirements concerning notice and appointment of counsel; parental and tribal rights of intervention and petition for invalidation of illegal proceedings; procedures governing voluntary consent to termination of parental rights; and a full faith and credit obligation in respect to tribal court decisions.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1901-1914.  The most important substantive requirement imposed on state courts is that of \xc2\xa7 1915(a), which, absent "good cause" to the contrary, mandates </p><p><a class="page-number" name="37">Page 490 U. S. 37</a></p><p> that adoptive placements be made preferentially with (1) members of the child\'s extended family, (2) other members of the same tribe, or (3) other Indian families.</p>\n<p>The ICWA, thus, in the words of the House Report accompanying it,</p>\n<p>"seeks to protect the rights of the Indian child as an Indian and the rights of the Indian community and tribe in retaining its children in its society."</p>\n<p>House Report, at 23.  It does so by establishing "a Federal policy that, where possible, an Indian child should remain in the Indian community," <em>ibid.,</em> and by making sure that Indian child welfare determinations are not based on "a white, middle-class standard which, in many cases, forecloses placement with [an] Indian family."  <em>Id.</em> at 24. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>This case involves the status of twin babies, known for our purposes as B.B. and G.B., who were born out of wedlock on December 29, 1985.  Their mother, J.B., and father, W.J., were both enrolled members of appellant Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (Tribe), and were residents and domiciliaries of the Choctaw Reservation in Neshoba County, Mississippi.  J.B. gave birth to the twins in Gulfport, Harrison County, Mississippi, some 200 miles from the reservation.  On January 10, 1986, J.B. executed a consent-to-adoption form before the Chancery Court of Harrison </p><p><a class="page-number" name="38">Page 490 U. S. 38</a></p><p> County.  Record 8-10. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  W.J. signed a similar form. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  On January 16, appellees Orrey and Vivian Holyfield [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] filed a petition for adoption in the same court, <em>id.</em> at 1-5, and the chancellor issued a Final Decree of Adoption on January 28.  <em>Id.</em> at 13-14. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Despite the court\'s apparent awareness of the ICWA, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] the adoption decree contained no reference to it, nor to the infants\' Indian background.</p>\n<p>Two months later, the Tribe moved in the Chancery Court to vacate the adoption decree on the ground that, under the ICWA, exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the tribal court.  <em>Id.</em> at 15-18. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  On July 14, 1986, the court overruled the motion, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="39">Page 490 U. S. 39</a></p><p> holding that the Tribe "never obtained exclusive jurisdiction over the children involved herein. . . ."  The court\'s one-page opinion relied on two facts in reaching that conclusion.  The court noted first that the twins\' mother "went to some efforts to see that they were born outside the confines of the Choctaw Indian Reservation," and that the parents had promptly arranged for the adoption by the Holyfields.  Second, the court stated:</p>\n<p>"At no time from the birth of these children to the present date have either of them resided on or physically been on the Choctaw Indian Reservation."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 78.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed. 511 So.2d 918 (1987).  It rejected the Tribe\'s arguments that the state court lacked jurisdiction and that it, in any event, had not applied the standards laid out in the ICWA.  The court recognized that the jurisdictional question turned on whether the twins were domiciled on the Choctaw Reservation.  It answered that question as follows:</p>\n<p>"At no point in time can it be said the twins resided on or were domiciled within the territory set aside for the reservation.  Appellant\'s argument that living within the womb of their mother qualifies the children\'s residency on the reservation may be lauded for its creativity; however, apparently it is unsupported by any law within this state, and will not be addressed at this time due to the far-reaching legal ramifications that would occur were we to follow such a complicated tangential course."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 921.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="40">Page 490 U. S. 40</a></p><p> The court distinguished Mississippi cases that appeared to establish the principle that "the domicile of minor children follows that of the parents," <em>ibid.; see Boyle v. Griffin,</em> 84 Miss. 41, 36 So. 141 (1904); <em>Stubbs v. Stubbs,</em> 211 So.2d 821 (Miss.1968); <em>see also In re Guardianship of Watson,</em> 317 So.2d 30 (Miss.1975).  It noted that</p>\n<p>"the Indian twins . . . were voluntarily surrendered and legally abandoned by the natural parents to the adoptive parents, and it is undisputed that the parents went to some efforts to prevent the children from being placed on the reservation as the mother arranged for their birth and adoption in Gulfport Memorial Hospital, Harrison County, Mississippi."</p>\n<p>511 So.2d at 921.  Therefore, the court said, the twins\' domicile was in Harrison County, and the state court properly exercised jurisdiction over the adoption proceedings.  Indeed, the court appears to have concluded that, for this reason, <em>none</em> of the provisions of the ICWA was applicable.  <em>Ibid.</em>  ("[T]hese proceedings . . . actually escape applicable federal law on Indian Child Welfare").  In any case, it rejected the Tribe\'s contention that the requirements of the ICWA applicable in state courts had not been followed:</p>\n<p>"[T]he judge did conform and strictly adhere to the minimum federal standards governing adoption of Indian children with respect to parental consent, notice, service of process, etc."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="41">Page 490 U. S. 41</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Because of the centrality of the exclusive tribal jurisdiction provision to the overall scheme of the ICWA, as well as the conflict between this decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court and those of several other state courts, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] we granted plenary review.  486 U.S. 1021 (1988). [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  We now reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="42">Page 490 U. S. 42</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Tribal jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings is not a novelty of the ICWA.  Indeed, some of the ICWA\'s jurisdictional provisions have a strong basis in pre-ICWA case law in the federal and state courts.  <em>See, e.g., Fisher v. District Court, Sixth Judicial District of Montana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/382/case.html">424 U. S. 382</a></span> (1976) (per curiam) (tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction over adoption proceeding where all parties were tribal members and reservation residents); <em>Wisconsin Potowatomies of Hannahville Indian Community v. Houston,</em> 393 F.Supp. 719 (WD Mich.1973) (tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction over custody of Indian children found to have been domiciled on reservation); <em>Wakefield v. Little Light,</em> 276 Md. 333, 347 A.2d 228 (1975) (same); <em>In re Adoption of Buehl,</em> 87 Wash.2d 649, 555 P.2d 1334 (1976) (state court lacked jurisdiction over custody of Indian children placed in off-reservation foster care by tribal court order); <em>see also In re Lelah-puc-ka-chee,</em> 98 F. 429 (ND Iowa 1899) (state court lacked jurisdiction to appoint guardian for Indian child living on reservation).  In enacting the ICWA, Congress confirmed that, in child custody proceedings involving Indian children domiciled on the reservation, tribal jurisdiction was exclusive as to the States.</p>\n<p>The state court proceeding at issue here was a "child custody proceeding."  That term is defined to include any "<em>adoptive placement\' which shall mean the permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption, including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption."  25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1903(1)(iv).  Moreover, the twins were "Indian children."  <em>See</em> 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1903(4).  The sole issue in this case is, as the Supreme Court of Mississippi recognized, whether the twins were "domiciled" on the reservation. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="43">Page 490 U. S. 43</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The meaning of "domicile" in the ICWA is, of course, a matter of Congress\' intent.  The ICWA itself does not define it.  The initial question we must confront is whether there is any reason to believe that Congress intended the ICWA definition of "domicile" to be a matter of state law.  While the meaning of a federal statute is necessarily a federal question in the sense that its construction remains subject to this Court\'s supervision, <em>see</em> P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P.

Accordingly, the cases in which we have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="44">Page 490 U.

S. 111</a></span> (1944), we rejected an argument that the term "employee" as used in the Wagner Act should be defined by state law.  We explained our conclusion as follows:</p>\n<p>"Both the terms and the purposes of the statute as well as the legislative history show that Congress had in mind no . . . patchwork plan for securing freedom of employees\' organization and of collective bargaining.  The Wagner Act is . . . intended to solve a national problem on a national scale. . . .  Nothing in the statute\'s background, history, terms or purposes indicates its scope is to be limited by . . . varying local conceptions, either statutory or judicial, or that it is to be administered in accordance with whatever different standards the respective states may see fit to adopt for the disposition of unrelated, local problems."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/111/case.html#123">322 U. S. 123</a></span>.  <em>See also Natural Gas Utility Dist., supra,</em> at 603-604.  For the two principal reasons that follow, we believe that what we said of the Wagner Act applies equally well to the ICWA.</p>\n<p>First, and most fundamentally, the purpose of the ICWA gives no reason to believe that Congress intended to rely on state law for the definition of a critical term; quite the contrary.  It is clear from the very text of the ICWA, not to mention its legislative history and the hearings that led to its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="45">Page 490 U. S. 45</a></p><p> enactment, that Congress was concerned with the rights of Indian families and Indian communities <em>vis-a-vis</em> state authorities. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  More specifically, its purpose was, in part, to make clear that, in certain situations, the state courts did <em>not</em> have jurisdiction over child custody proceedings.  Indeed, the congressional findings that are a part of the statute demonstrate that Congress perceived the States and their courts as partly responsible for the problem it intended to correct.  <em>See</em> 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1901(5) (state "judicial bodies . . . have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families"). [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Under these circumstances, it is most improbable that Congress would have intended to leave the scope of the statute\'s key jurisdictional provision subject to definition by state courts as a matter of state law.</p>\n<p>Second, Congress could hardly have intended the lack of nationwide uniformity that would result from state law definitions of domicile.  An example will illustrate.  In a case quite similar to this one, the New Mexico state courts found exclusive jurisdiction in the tribal court pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1911(a), </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 490 U. S. 46</a></p><p> because the illegitimate child took the reservation domicile of its mother at birth -- notwithstanding that the child was placed in the custody of adoptive parents two days after its off-reservation birth and the mother executed a consent to adoption 10 days later.  <em>In re Adoption of Baby Child,</em> 102 N.M. 735, 737-738, 700 P.2d 198, 200-201 (App.1985). [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Had that mother traveled to Mississippi to give birth, rather than to Albuquerque, a different result would have obtained if state law definitions of domicile applied.  The same, presumably, would be true if the child had been transported to Mississippi for adoption after her off-reservation birth in New Mexico.  While the child\'s custody proceeding would have been subject to exclusive tribal jurisdiction in her home State, her mother, prospective adoptive parents, or an adoption intermediary could have obtained an adoption decree in state court merely by transporting her across state lines. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Even if we could conceive of a federal statute under which the rules of domicile (and thus of jurisdiction) applied differently to different Indian children, a statute under which different rules apply from time to time to the same child, simply as a result of his or her transport from one State to another, cannot be what Congress had in mind. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="47">Page 490 U. S. 47</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We therefore think it beyond dispute that Congress intended a uniform federal law of domicile for the ICWA. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>It remains to give content to the term "domicile" in the circumstances of the present case.  The holding of the Supreme Court of Mississippi that the twin babies were not domiciled on the Choctaw Reservation appears to have rested on two findings of fact by the trial court:  (1) that they had never been physically present there, and (2) that they were "voluntarily surrendered" by their parents.  511 So.2d at 921; <em>see</em> Record 78.  The question before us, therefore, is whether, under the ICWA definition of "domicile," such facts suffice to render the twins nondomiciliaries of the reservation.</p>\n<p>We have often stated that, in the absence of a statutory definition, we "start with the assumption that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used."  <em>Richards v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/1/case.html">369 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/1/case.html#9">369 U.

We do so, of course, in the light of the "\'object and policy"\' of the statute.  <em>Mastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/270/case.html">350 U. S. 270</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/270/case.html#285">350 U.

We therefore look both to the generally accepted meaning of the term "domicile" and to the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p>That we are dealing with a uniform federal rather than a state definition does not, of course, prevent us from drawing on general state law principles to determine "the ordinary meaning of the words used."  Well settled state law can inform our understanding of what Congress had in mind when it employed a term it did not define.  Accordingly, we find it helpful to borrow established common law principles of domicile </p><p><a class="page-number" name="48">Page 490 U. S. 48</a></p><p> to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the objectives of the congressional scheme.</p>\n<p>"Domicile" is, of course, a concept widely used in both federal and state courts for jurisdiction and conflict-of-laws purposes, and its meaning is generally uncontroverted.  <em>See generally</em> Restatement \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 11-23; R. Leflar, L. McDougal, &amp; R. Felix, American Conflicts Law 17-38 (4th ed.1986); R. Weintraub, Commentary on the Conflict of Laws 12-24 (2d ed.1980).  "Domicile" is not necessarily synonymous with "residence," <em>Perri v. Kisselbach,</em> 34 N.J. 84, 87, 167 A.2d 377, 379 (1961), and one can reside in one place but be domiciled in another, <em>District of Columbia v.

For adults, domicile is established by physical presence in a place in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one\'s intent to remain there.  <em>Texas v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/398/case.html">306 U. S. 398</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/398/case.html#424">306 U. S. 424</a></span> (1939).  One acquires a "domicile of origin" at birth, and that domicile continues until a new one (a "domicile of choice") is acquired.  <em>Jones, supra,</em> at 81, 182 N.W. at 228; <em>In re Estate of Moore,</em> 68 Wash.2d 792, 796, 415 P.2d 653, 656 (1966).  Since most minors are legally incapable of forming the requisite intent to establish a domicile, their domicile is determined by that of their parents.  <em>Yarborough v. Yarborough,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/202/case.html">290 U. S. 202</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/202/case.html#211">290 U. S. 211</a></span> (1933).  In the case of an illegitimate child, that has traditionally meant the domicile of its mother.  <em>Kowalski v. Wojtkowski,</em> 19 N.J. 247, 258, 116 A.2d 6, 12 (1955); <em>Moore, supra,</em> at 796, 415 P.2d at 656; Restatement \xc2\xa7 14(2), \xc2\xa7 22, Comment c; 25 Am. Jur.2d Domicil \xc2\xa7 69 (1966).  Under these principles, it is entirely logical that "[o]n occasion, a child\'s domicil of origin will be in a place where the child has never been."  Restatement \xc2\xa7 14, Comment b.</p>\n<p>It is undisputed in this case that the domicile of the mother (as well as the father) has been, at all relevant times, on the Choctaw Reservation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29.  Thus, it is clear that at their birth the twin babies were also domiciled </p><p><a class="page-number" name="49">Page 490 U. S. 49</a></p><p> on the reservation, even though they themselves had never been there.  The statement of the Supreme Court of Mississippi that "[a]t no point in time can it be said the twins . . . were domiciled within the territory set aside for the reservation," 511 So.2d at 921, may be a correct statement of that State\'s law of domicile, but it is inconsistent with generally accepted doctrine in this country and cannot be what Congress had in mind when it used the term in the ICWA.</p>\n<p>Nor can the result be any different simply because the twins were "voluntarily surrendered" by their mother.  Tribal jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1911(a) was not meant to be defeated by the actions of individual members of the tribe, for Congress was concerned not solely about the interests of Indian children and families, but also about the impact on the tribes themselves of the large numbers of Indian children adopted by non-Indians.  <em>See</em> 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1901(3) ("[T]here is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children"), 1902 ("promote the stability and security of Indian tribes"). [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  The numerous prerogatives accorded the tribes through the ICWA\'s substantive provisions, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1911(a) (exclusive jurisdiction over reservation domiciliaries), 1911(b) (presumptive jurisdiction over nondomiciliaries), 1911(c) (right of intervention), 1912(a) (notice), 1914 (right to petition for invalidation of state court action), 1915(c) (right to alter presumptive placement priorities applicable to state court actions), 1915(e) (right to obtain records), 1919 (authority to conclude agreements with States), must, accordingly, be seen as a means of protecting not only the interests of individual Indian children and families, but also of the tribes themselves.</p>\n<p>In addition, it is clear that Congress\' concern over the placement of Indian children in non-Indian homes was based in part on evidence of the detrimental impact on the children </p><p><a class="page-number" name="50">Page 490 U. S. 50</a></p><p> themselves of such placements outside their culture. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Congress determined to subject such placements to the ICWA\'s jurisdictional and other provisions, even in cases where the parents consented to an adoption, because of concerns going beyond the wishes of individual parents.  As the 1977 Final Report of the congressionally established American Indian Policy Review Commission stated, in summarizing these two concerns,</p>\n<p>"[r]emoval of Indian children from their cultural setting seriously impacts a long-term tribal survival and has damaging social and psychological impact on many individual Indian children."</p>\n<p>Senate Report, at 52. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="51">Page 490 U. S. 51</a></p><p></p>\n<p>These congressional objectives make clear that a rule of domicile that would permit individual Indian parents to defeat the ICWA\'s jurisdictional scheme is inconsistent with what Congress intended. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  <em>See In re Adoption of Child of Indian Heritage,</em> 111 N.J. 155, 168-171, 543 A.2d 925, 931-933 (1988).  The appellees in this case argue strenuously that the twins\' mother went to great lengths to give birth off the reservation so that her children could be adopted by the Holyfields.  But that was precisely part of Congress\' concern.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="52">Page 490 U. S. 52</a></p><p> Permitting individual members of the tribe to avoid tribal exclusive jurisdiction by the simple expedient of giving birth off the reservation would, to a large extent, nullify the purpose the ICWA was intended to accomplish. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  The Supreme Court of Utah expressed this well in its scholarly and sensitive opinion in what has become a leading case on the ICWA:</p>\n<p>"To the extent that [state] abandonment law operates to permit [the child\'s] mother to change [the child\'s] domicile as part of a scheme to facilitate his adoption by non-Indians while she remains a domiciliary of the reservation, it conflicts with and undermines the operative scheme established by subsections [1911(a)] and [1913(a)] to deal with children of domiciliaries of the reservation, and weakens considerably the tribe\'s ability to assert its interest in its children.  The protection of this tribal interest is at the core of the ICWA, which recognizes that the tribe has an interest in the child which is distinct from, but on a parity with, the interest of the parents.  This relationship between Indian tribes and Indian children domiciled on the reservation finds no parallel in other ethnic cultures found in the United States.  It is a relationship that many non-Indians find difficult to understand, and that non-Indian courts are slow to recognize.  It is precisely in recognition of this relationship, however, that the ICWA designates the tribal court as the exclusive forum for the determination of custody and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 490 U. S. 53</a></p><p> adoption matters for reservation-domiciled Indian children, and the preferred forum for nondomiciliary Indian children.  [State] abandonment law cannot be used to frustrate the federal legislative judgment expressed in the ICWA that the interests of the tribe in custodial decisions made with respect to Indian children are as entitled to respect as the interests of the parents."</p>\n<p><em>In re Adoption of Halloway,</em> 732 P.2d 962, 969-970 (1986).</p>\n<p>We agree with the Supreme Court of Utah that the law of domicile Congress used in the ICWA cannot be one that permits individual reservation-domiciled tribal members to defeat the tribe\'s exclusive jurisdiction by the simple expedient of giving birth and placing the child for adoption off the reservation.  Since, for purposes of the ICWA, the twin babies in this case were domiciled on the reservation when adoption proceedings were begun, the Choctaw tribal court possessed exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1911(a).  The Chancery Court of Harrison County was, accordingly, without jurisdiction to enter a decree of adoption; under ICWA \xc2\xa7 104, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1914, its decree of January 28, 1986, must be vacated.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We are not unaware that over three years have passed since the twin babies were born and placed in the Holyfield home, and that a court deciding their fate today is not writing on a blank slate in the same way it would have in January, 1986.  Three years\' development of family ties cannot be undone, and a separation at this point would doubtless cause considerable pain.</p>\n<p>Whatever feelings we might have as to where the twins should live, however, it is not for us to decide that question.  We have been asked to decide the legal question of who should make the custody determination concerning these children -- not what the outcome of that determination should be.  The law places that decision in the hands of the Choctaw tribal court.  Had the mandate of the ICWA been followed in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 490 U. S. 54</a></p><p> 1986, of course, much potential anguish might have been avoided, and in any case the law cannot be applied so as automatically to "reward those who obtain custody, whether lawfully or otherwise, and maintain it during any ensuing (and protracted) litigation."  <em>Halloway,</em> 732 P.2d at 972.  It is not ours to say whether the trauma that might result from removing these children from their adoptive family should outweigh the interest of the Tribe -- and perhaps the children themselves -- in having them raised as part of the Choctaw community. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  Rather, "we must defer to the experience, wisdom, and compassion of the [Choctaw] tribal courts to fashion an appropriate remedy."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, Dr. Joseph Westermeyer, a University of Minnesota social psychiatrist, testified about his research with Indian adolescents who experienced difficulty coping in white society, despite the fact that they had been raised in a purely white environment:</p>\n<p>"[T]hey were raised with a white cultural and social identity.  They are raised in a white home.  They attended, predominantly white schools, and in almost all cases, attended a church that was predominantly white, and really came to understand very little about Indian culture, Indian behavior, and had virtually no viable Indian identity.  They can recall such things as seeing cowboys and Indians on TV and feeling that Indians were a historical figure, but were not a viable contemporary social group."</p>\n<p>"Then, during adolescence, they found that society was not to grant them the white identity that they had.  They began to find this out in a number of ways.  For example, a universal experience was that, when they began to date white children, the parents of the white youngsters were against this, and there were pressures among white children from the parents not to date these Indian children. . . ."</p>\n<p>"The other experience was derogatory name-calling in relation to their racial identity. . . . "</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"[T]hey were finding that society was putting on them an identity which they didn\'t possess and taking from them an identity that they did possess."</p>\n<p>1974 Hearings, at 46.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Hearing on S. 1214 before the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.

At the conclusion of the 1974 Senate hearings, Senator Abourezk noted the role that such extended families played in the care of children:</p>\n<p>"We\'ve had testimony here that, in Indian communities throughout the Nation, there is no such thing as an abandoned child, because, when a child does have a need for parents for one reason or another, a relative or a friend will take that child in.

In regard to reservation domiciliaries, these goals are pursued through the establishment of exclusive tribal jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1911(a).</p>\n<p>Beyond its jurisdictional and other provisions concerning child custody proceedings, the ICWA also created, in its Title II, a program of grants to Indian tribes and organizations to aid in the establishment of child welfare programs.  <em>See</em> 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1931-1934.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 103(a) of the ICWA, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1913(a), requires that any voluntary consent to termination of parental rights be executed in writing and recorded before a judge of a "court of competent jurisdiction," who must certify that the terms and consequences of the consent were fully explained and understood.

Since, in the near future, our appellate jurisdiction will extend only to rare cases, <em>see</em> Pub.L. 100-352, 102 Stat. 662, it is also a question of little prospective importance.  Rather than attempting to resolve this question, therefore, we think it advisable to assume that the appeal is improper, and to consider by writ of certiorari the important question this case presents.  <em>See Spencer v.

There is no dispute that the Choctaw Reservation falls within that definition.</p>\n<p>Section 1911(a) does not apply "where such jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the State by existing Federal law."  This proviso would appear to refer to Pub.L. 280, 67 Stat. 588, <em>as amended,</em> which allows States under certain conditions to assume civil and criminal jurisdiction on the reservations.  Title 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1918 permits a tribe in that situation to reassume jurisdiction over child custody proceedings upon petition to the Secretary of the Interior.  The State of Mississippi has never asserted jurisdiction over the Choctaw Reservation under Public Law 280.  <em>See</em> F.

Even in the less extreme case, a state law definition of domicile would likely spur the development of an adoption brokerage business.  Indian children, whose parents consented (with or without financial inducement) to give them up, could be transported for adoption to States like Mississippi, where the law of domicile permitted the proceedings to take place in state court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>For this reason, the general rule that domicile is determined according to the law of the forum, <em>see</em> Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa7 13 (1971) (hereinafter Restatement), can have no application here.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>We note also the likelihood that, had Congress intended a state law definition of domicile, it would have said so.

No. 95-597, p. 43 (1977) (hereinafter Senate Report).  More generally, placements in non-Indian homes were seen as "depriving the child of his or her tribal and cultural heritage."  <em>Id.</em> at 45; <em>see also</em> 124 Cong.Rec. 38102-38103 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Lagomarsino).  The Senate Report on the ICWA incorporates the testimony in this sense of Louis La Rose, chairman of the Winnebago Tribe, before the American Indian Policy Review Commission:</p>\n<p>"I think the cruelest trick that the white man has ever done to Indian children is to take them into adoption courts, erase all of their records and send them off to some nebulous family that has a value system that is A-1 in the State of Nebraska and that child reaches 16 or 17, he is a little brown child residing in a white community, and he goes back to the reservation and he has absolutely no idea who his relatives are, and they effectively make him a non-person, and I think . . . they destroy him."</p>\n<p>Senate Report at 43.  Thus, the conclusion seems justified that, as one state court has put it, "[t]he Act is based on the fundamental assumption that it is in the Indian child\'s best interest that its relationship to the tribe be protected."  <em>In re Appeal in Pima County Juvenile Action No. S-903,</em> 130 Ariz., at 204, 635 P.2d at 189.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>While the statute itself makes clear that Congress intended the ICWA to reach voluntary as well as involuntary removal of Indian children, the same conclusion can also be drawn from the ICWA\'s legislative history.  For example, the House Report contains the following expression of Congress\' concern with both aspects of the problem:</p>\n<p>"One of the effects of our national paternalism has been to so alienate some Indian [parents] from their society that they abandon their children at hospitals or to welfare departments rather than entrust them to the care of relatives in the extended family.  Another expression of it is the involuntary, arbitrary, and unwarranted separation of families."</p>\n<p>House Report, at 12.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs pointed out, in issuing nonbinding ICWA guidelines for the state courts, that the terms "residence" and "domicile" "are well defined under existing state law.  There is no indication that these state law definitions tend to undermine in any way the purposes of the Act."  44 Fed.Reg. 67584, 67585 (1979).  The clear implication is that state law that <em>did</em> tend to undermine the ICWA\'s purposes could not be taken to express Congress\' intent.  There is some authority for the proposition that abandonment can effectuate a change in the child\'s domicile, <em>In re Adoption of Halloway,</em> 732 P.2d at 967, although this may not be the majority rule.  <em>See</em> Restatement \xc2\xa7 22, Comment e (abandoned child generally retains the domicile of the last-abandoning parent).  In any case, as will be seen below, the Supreme Court of Utah declined in the <em>Halloway</em> case to apply Utah abandonment law to defeat the purpose of the ICWA.  Similarly, the conclusory statement of the Supreme Court of Mississippi that the twin babies had been "legally abandoned," 511 So.2d at 921, cannot be determinative of ICWA jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>There is also another reason for reaching this conclusion.  The predicate for the state court\'s abandonment finding was the parents\' consent to termination of their parental rights, recorded before a judge of the state Chancery Court. ICWA \xc2\xa7 103(a), 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1913(a), requires, however, that such a consent be recorded before "a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction."  <em>See</em> <a href="#F7" name="T7">n</a> 7, <em>supra.</em>  In the case of reservation-domiciled children, that could be only the tribal court.  The children therefore could not be made nondomiciliaries of the reservation through any such state court consent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T27" name="F27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>It appears, in fact, that all Choctaw women give birth off the reservation, because of the lack of appropriate obstetric facilities there.  <em>See</em> Juris. Statement 4, n. 2.  In most cases, of course, the mother and child return to the reservation after the birth, and this would presumably be sufficient to make the child a reservation domiciliary even under the Mississippi court\'s theory.  Application of the Mississippi domicile rule would, however, permit state authorities to avoid the tribal court\'s exclusive \xc2\xa7 1911(a) jurisdiction by removing a newborn from an allegedly unfit mother while in the hospital, and seeking to terminate her parental rights in state court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T28" name="F28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>We were assured at oral argument that the Choctaw court has the authority under the tribal code to permit adoption by the present adoptive family, should it see fit to do so.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE KENNEDY join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The parents of these twin babies unquestionably expressed their intention to have the state court exercise jurisdiction over them.  J.B. gave birth to the twins at a hospital 200 miles from the reservation, even though a closer hospital was available.  Both parents gave their written advance consent to the adoption and, when the adoption was later challenged by the Tribe, they reaffirmed their desire that the Holyfields adopt the two children.  As the Mississippi Supreme Court found,</p>\n<p>"the parents went to some efforts to prevent the children from being placed on the reservation, as the mother arranged for their birth and adoption in Gulfport Memorial Hospital, Harrison County, Mississippi."</p>\n<p>511 So.2d 918, 921 (1987).  Indeed, both parents appear before us today, urging that Vivian Holyfield be allowed to retain custody of B.B and G.B. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 490 U. S. 55</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Because J.B.\'s domicile is on the reservation and the children are eligible for membership in the Tribe, the Court today closes the state courthouse door to her.  I agree with the Court that Congress intended a uniform federal law of domicile for the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 92 Stat. 3069, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1901-1963, and that domicile should be defined with reference to the objectives of the congressional scheme.</p>\n<p>"To ascertain [the term\'s] meaning, we . . . consider the Congressional history of the Act, the situation with reference to which it was enacted, and the existing judicial precedents, with which Congress may be taken to have been familiar in at least a general way."</p>\n<p><em>District of Columbia v. Murphy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/314/441/case.html">314 U.

I cannot agree, however, with the cramped definition the Court gives that term.  To preclude parents domiciled on a reservation from deliberately invoking the adoption procedures of state court, the Court gives "domicile" a meaning that Congress could not have intended and distorts the delicate balance between individual rights and group rights recognized by the ICWA.</p>\n<p>The ICWA was passed in 1978 in response to congressional findings that</p>\n<p>"an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the <em>removal,</em> often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies,"</p>\n<p>and that</p>\n<p>"the States, exercising their recognized jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings through administrative and judicial bodies, have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families."</p>\n<p>25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1901(4), (5) (emphasis added).  The Act is thus primarily addressed to the unjustified removal of Indian children from their families through the application of standards that inadequately recognized the distinct Indian culture.

S. 56</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The most important provisions of the ICWA are those setting forth minimum standards for the placement of Indian children by state courts and providing procedural safeguards to insure that parental rights are protected. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The Act provides </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 490 U. S. 57</a></p><p> that any party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or involuntary termination of parental rights to, an Indian child must establish by stringent standards of proof that efforts have been made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, and that the continued custody of the child by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1912(d), (e), (f).  Each party to the proceeding has a right to examine all reports and documents filed with the court, and an indigent parent or custodian has the right to appointment of counsel.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1912(b), (c).  In the case of a voluntary termination, the ICWA provides that consent is valid only if given after the terms and consequences of the consent have been fully explained, may be withdrawn at any time up to the final entry of a decree of termination or adoption, and even then may be collaterally attacked on the grounds that it was obtained through fraud or duress.  \xc2\xa7 1913.  Finally, because the Act protects not only the rights of the parents but also the interests of the tribe and the Indian children, the Act sets forth criteria for adoptive, foster care, and preadoptive placements that favor the Indian child\'s extended family or tribe, and that can be altered by resolution of the tribe.  \xc2\xa7 1915.</p>\n<p>The Act gives Indian tribes certain rights, not to restrict the rights of parents of Indian children, but to complement and help effect them.  The Indian tribe may petition to transfer an action in state court to the tribal court, but the Indian parent may veto the transfer.  \xc2\xa7 1911(b).

[<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Finally, the tribe may petition the court to set aside a parental termination action upon a showing that the provisions of the ICWA that are designed to protect parents and Indian children have been violated.  \xc2\xa7 1914. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>While the Act\'s substantive and procedural provisions effect a major change in state child custody proceedings, its jurisdictional provision is designed primarily to preserve tribal sovereignty over the domestic relations of tribe members and to confirm a developing line of cases which held that the tribe\'s exclusive jurisdiction could not be defeated by the temporary presence of an Indian child off the reservation.  The legislative history indicates that Congress did not intend "to oust the States of their traditional jurisdiction over Indian children falling within their geographic limits."  House Report, at 19; Wamser, Child Welfare Under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978:  A New Mexico Focus, 10 N.M.L.Rev. 413, 416 (1980).  The apparent intent of Congress was to overrule such decisions as that in <em>In re Cantrell,</em> 159 Mont. 66, 495 P.2d 179 (1972), in which the State placed an Indian child, who had lived on a Reservation with his mother, in a foster home only three days after he left the Reservation to accompany his father on a trip.

[<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Although parents of Indian children are shielded from the exercise of state jurisdiction when they are temporarily off the reservation, the Act also reflects a recognition that allowing the tribe to defeat the parents\' deliberate choice of jurisdiction would be conducive neither to the best interests of the child nor to the stability and security of Indian tribes and families.  Section 1911(b), providing for the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction by state and tribal courts when the Indian child is not domiciled on the reservation, gives the Indian parents a veto to prevent the transfer of a state court action to tribal court.

The law of abandonment, as enunciated by the Mississippi Supreme Court in this case, does not defeat, but serves, the purposes of the Act.  An abandonment occurs when a parent deserts a child and places the child with another with an intent to relinquish all parental rights and obligations.

S. 63</a></p><p></p>\n<p>When an Indian child is temporarily off the reservation, but has not been abandoned to a person off the reservation, the tribe has an interest in exclusive jurisdiction.  The ICWA expresses the intent that exclusive tribal jurisdiction is not so frail that it should be defeated as soon as the Indian child steps off the reservation.  Similarly, when the child is abandoned by one parent to a person off the reservation, the tribe and the other parent domiciled on the reservation may still have an interest in the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction.  That interest is protected by the rule that a child abandoned by one parent takes on the domicile of the other.  But when an Indian child is deliberately abandoned by both parents to a person off the reservation, no purpose of the ICWA is served by closing the state courthouse door to them.  The interests of the parents, the Indian child, and the tribe in preventing the unwarranted removal of Indian children from their families and from the reservation are protected by the Act\'s substantive and procedural provisions.  In addition, if both parents have intentionally invoked the jurisdiction of the state court in an action involving a non-Indian, no interest in tribal self-governance is implicated. <em>See McClanahan v.

Moreover, it renders any custody decision made by a state court forever suspect, susceptible to challenge at any time as void for having been entered in the absence of jurisdiction. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  Finally, it forces parents of Indian children who desire to invoke state court jurisdiction to establish a domicile off the reservation.  Only if the custodial parent has the wealth and ability to establish a domicile off the reservation will the parent be able to use the processes of state court.  I fail to see how such a requirement serves the paramount congressional purpose of "promot[ing] the stability and security of Indian tribes and families."  25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1902. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 490 U.

By holding that parents who are domiciled on the reservation cannot voluntarily avail themselves of the adoption procedures of state court, and that all such proceedings will be void for lack of jurisdiction, however, the Court establishes a rule of law that is virtually certain to ensure that similar anguish will be suffered by other families in the future.

In that case, the mother, a member of an Indian Tribe in New Mexico voluntarily abandoned an Indian child to the custody of the child\'s maternal aunt off the Reservation with the knowledge that the child would be placed for adoption in Utah.  The mother learned of the adoption two weeks after the child left the Reservation, and did not object and, two months later, she executed a consent to adoption.  Nevertheless, some two years after the petition for adoption was filed, the Indian Tribe intervened in the proceeding and set aside the adoption.  The Tribe argued successfully that, regardless of whether the Indian parent consented to it, the adoption was void because she resided on the Reservation, and thus the tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction.  Although the decision in <em>Halloway,</em> and the Court\'s approving reference to it, may be colored somewhat by the fact that the mother in that case withdrew her consent (a fact which would entitle her to relief even if there were only concurrent jurisdiction, <em>see</em> 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1913(c)), the rule set forth by the majority contains no such limitation.  As the Tribe acknowledged at oral argument, any adoption of an Indian child effected through a state court will be susceptible of challenge by the Indian tribe no matter how old the child and how long it has lived with its adoptive parents.
