JUSTICE MILLER of this Court with a petition similar to that which he had presented to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Florida, and also a form of citation and a form of bond, and that he and his counsel presented to the said MR. JUSTICE MILLER those three papers and stated the case, and that thereupon that judge made an endorsement upon the petition for the allowance of the writ of error, of the allowance of said petition, and dated it with his own hand and signed the citation and also approved the bond.

S. 782</a></p><p> the files thereof by some person, and for some purpose unknown.</p>\n<p>Upon this affidavit and the matter of diminution, the case was again subsequently spoken to.</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Court has considered the affidavit of the plaintiff in error, submitted by his counsel as evidence of the allowance of a writ of error in this case by one of the Justices of this Court, and without determining now whether in any case the affidavit of a party to the record can be used as evidence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="783">Page 76 U. S. 783</a></p><p> of that fact, we are obliged to say that the affidavit submitted to us has failed to satisfy us that such an allowance was in fact made.  The affidavit states that three papers -- namely a petition for the writ of error, the form of a bond, and a citation -- were presented to the Associate Justice, and lays some stress upon the fact that the papers were three in number.  It omits to mention that any copy of the record of the state court was presented to the judge, without which it is obvious there could be no allowance of a writ of error.  It seems to us highly probable, therefore, that the plaintiff in error is mistaken in his recollection.  A copy of the record was probably one of the three papers of which he speaks.  In the absence of any affidavit from the clerk who prepared the papers and of any showing of the loss of the petition by the clerk of the Supreme Court of Florida, with whom the allowance supposed to have been endorsed on it must in regular course have been filed, we cannot regard the evidence of allowance as sufficient, and must proceed to dispose of this cause as if no such allowance were claimed to have been made.</p>\n<p>As respects jurisdiction under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, it seems to us that, considered under the view presented with much force by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, a writ of error might have been properly enough allowed under that section.  But on looking into the record, we find no allowance of the writ.  And this has been repeatedly held to be essential to the exercise by this Court of revisory jurisdiction over final judgments or decrees by the courts of the states.  In the case of <em>Twitchell v. Commonwealth,</em> <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/76/779/case.html">*</a></span> the rule which governs the allowance, by national courts and judges, for writs of error to state courts, was thus stated:</p>\n<p>"Writs of error to state courts have never been allowed as of right.  It has always been the practice to submit the record of the state court to a judge of this Court whose duty has been to ascertain whether any question cognizable here on appeal was made and decided in the proper court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 76 U. S. 784</a></p><p> of the state, and whether the case, upon the face of the record, will justify the allowance of the writ."</p>\n<p>And this may now be considered as the settled construction of the Judiciary Act on this subject.  The foundation of the jurisdiction of this Court over the judgments of state courts is the writ of error, and no writ of error to a state court can issue without allowance, either by the proper judge of the state court or by a judge of this Court, after examination as just stated.</p>\n<p>In this case, the plaintiff in error has evidently acted under the impression that a writ of error to a state court is a matter of right.  Under this impression he applied to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Florida for his signature to a citation, but that magistrate, who had presided in the court where the proceeding for ouster had taken place, refused his signature upon the ground that the state court had decided no question cognizable here upon writ of error.  Application was then made to a judge of this Court, by whom a citation was signed, but there was no allowance of a writ of error by him.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, the issuing of the writ of error was unauthorized, and the writ, not having been allowed, gives no jurisdiction to this Court.  It must therefore be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n<p>*  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/321/case.html">74 U.
