The Supreme Court of Alabama held that "there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that there was negligence on the part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company."  264 Ala. 522, 527, 88 So.2d 189, 193.  We agree.  We now hold that the evidence also presented a jury question whether the employee\'s death resulted in whole or in part from such negligence.  35 Stat. 65, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 51; <em>Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/352/500/case.html">352 U. S. 500</a></span>; <em>Schulz v. Pennsylvania R.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded for consideration of any grounds not disposed of on the first appeal, and, if none has merit, with instructions to reinstate the judgment entered on the jury verdict of June 12, 1953,  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="63">Page 355 U.
