That the signature of the defendant in error to the alleged agreement was procured by the fraud of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p>Third.  That the signature of the defendant in error was procured by the undue influence of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p>And also three supplemental pleas on equitable grounds:</p>\n<p>First.

That at the time of the alleged assignment of the patent, Harrison was not the owner of, and had not a valid title to, the said patent.</p>\n<p>The defendant also filed a plea of set-off, and, upon demand for a bill of particulars of such set-off, filed a bill of particulars, amounting to thirty-one thousand seven hundred and ninety-one dollars and fifty-two cents ($31,791.52).</p>\n<p>Replications were duly filed and issues joined on all of them.</p>\n<p>The case was tried before the judge, without a jury.</p>\n<p>At the trial, the parties asked the court to rule on certain propositions contained in what the record calls "prayers."

(Rejected.)"</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Fifth Prayer</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"That the agreement of January, 1892, between Henry Campbell and the Campbell Barrel Company offered in evidence by the defendant is no defense to this action if the court shall find that, by the true construction of said agreement, the invention and device described in the contract set out in the declaration is not embraced within said agreement.  (Granted.)"</p>\n<p>And the defendant offered the following two prayers:</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Defendant\'s First Prayer</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"The defendant asks the court to rule as matter of law that, upon the pleadings of the case, the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove the delivery of the sealed instrument sued on, and if the court, sitting as a jury, finds that the paper sued on never was delivered, the verdict must be for the defendant.  (Granted.)"</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Defendant\'s Second Prayer</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"If the court, sitting as a jury, shall find that when the paper sued on was presented by the plaintiff to the defendant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="43">Page 171 U. S. 43</a></p><p> for the latter\'s signature, with the request that he would sign it, the defendant declined so to do, as the terms of such papers did not correspond with any agreement made or talked of between the plaintiff and defendant, and that thereupon it was agreed between them that the papers in duplicate should be signed by the defendant, and both kept in his possession, and should not be of any force, and should belong to the defendant until he chose to put them in force, and that, in pursuance of this agreement, they were then signed by the defendant, and always afterwards kept in his possession until produced at the trial of this cause, on notice, and that at no time after the signing of said papers did the defendant ever exercise his option of putting into force, but on the contrary, subsequently thereto, exercise  his option by declining to recognize them as in force, then the verdict shall be for the defendant.  (Granted.)"</p>\n<p>The trial judge rendered a general verdict for the defendant, on which judgment was entered for $35,091.65, with interest and costs.</p>\n<p>An appeal having been taken to the Court of Appeals of Maryland by the plaintiff, Harrison, the judgment of the court below was affirmed by the said Court of Appeals on the 17th of June, 1896, for $39,091.65, with interest from the 13th of December, 1894, until paid, and costs.</p>\n<p>On September 21, 1896, a writ of error to review this judgment was issued to the Court of Appeals of Maryland.</p>\n<p>There are nine assignments of error.  They embrace rulings on testimony, on the prayers, and the following:</p>\n<p>"1. It was error to decide that, under the laws of the United States, the assignments from Henry Campbell to Walter H. Harrison, dated the 11th day of September, A.D. 1894, and the 26th day of November, 1894, respectively, purporting to convey to the said Harrison the \'entire right, title, and interest in and to the application for patent -- serial number 522,266 -- and the patent right contained therein and covered thereby,\' operated to convey to the plaintiff, Harrison, merely the equitable title in and to said invention and the patent rights covered by said application."</p>\n<p>"2. It was error to decide that the said assignments were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="44">Page 171 U. S. 44</a></p><p> not drawn as the laws required, and hence did not convey the legal title to the invention in question."</p>\n<p>The opinion of the Supreme Court of Maryland, 83 Md. 456, is quite long -- necessarily so, as it passes upon all the points which were raised by plaintiff.  The parts of it which concern the case are as follows:</p>\n<p>"We think there can be no doubt that the defendant\'s two prayers were properly granted.  By the first, the court declared as matter of law that, upon the pleadings, the burden was upon the plaintiff to prove the delivery of the sealed instrument sued on, and that, if the court, sitting as a jury, should find that said paper never was delivered, the verdict must be for the defendant.  The second prayer recites the evidence more at length, but asserts the same proposition of law which appears to be well settled in this state.  <em>Edelen v. Saunders,</em> 8 Md. 129.  We discover no inconsistency between the two prayers.  The plaintiff specially excepted to the second on the ground that there was no evidence in the cause legally sufficient to prove the facts therein set forth.  It is clear, however, that the testimony of the witnesses Morton and Coale support the facts set forth in the prayer, and we have already held it to be competent and admissible under the issue made by the plea of <em>non est factum.</em>"</p>\n<p>"We will now consider the prayers of the plaintiff.  He offered five, the second having been conceded and the fifth granted."</p>\n<p>"The controlling proposition in this part of the case is that contended for by the plaintiff in his first, third, and fourth prayers -- namely that there is no legally sufficient evidence in the case to show that he had any knowledge or notice of the agreement between the inventor, Campbell, and the Campbell Barrel Company."</p>\n<p>"The correctness of this contention of the plaintiff depends first upon the legal effect of the assignments from Campbell to the plaintiff, and secondly upon the effect of the contract of Campbell with the Campbell Barrel Company -- that is to say whether said company thereby assigned to said company an equitable title to his invention prior in date to the title he </p><p><a class="page-number" name="45">Page 171 U. S. 45</a></p><p> claims to have assigned to the defendant, which latter title the plaintiff claims to be an absolute legal title, and the defendant\'s contention, on the contrary is that it is a mere equitable title, subsequent in date and therefore inferior to the title of the barrel company.  The plaintiff claims title through two assignments from Campbell, each being for one-half interest in a certain application filed in the Patent Office of the United States at Washington, D.C., which application is for letters patent covering the invention of a machine for forming and making barrels and kegs."</p>\n<p>"It will be found upon an examination of these instruments that they do not contain a request to the Commissioner of Patents to issue letters patent to the plaintiff.  Notwithstanding they were recorded in the Patent Office, letters patent were issued in the name of Henry Campbell, the inventor, and the defendant contends that the legal effect of such an assignment, in which the inventor fails to embody a request to the Commissioner of Patents to issue letters to the assignee, is to convey to such assignee only an equitable title.  It is conceded that, by one of the rules of the Patent Office, the Commissioner will not and cannot issue the letters patent to an assignee, unless specially requested so to do by the terms of the assignment.  One of the witnesses refers to this rule in his testimony.  The patent having been issued to Campbell instead of to the defendant, the witness thus explains:"</p>\n<p>"I ascertained that the probable reason why it [the patent] had not been issued to Mr. Morton was this:  the original assignment from Mr. Campbell to Mr. Harrison did not contain the request which the rules of the Patent Office required in order that the patent should be issued in the name of the assignee."</p>\n<p>"Rule 26, Rules of Practice in United States Patent Office, p. 9, revised April 1, 1892."</p>\n<p>After considering authorities, the opinion decides that:</p>\n<p>"If, therefore, the Campbell Barrel Company acquired an equitable title to the patent, as it undoubtedly did, under its contract with the inventor, before the assignment of the equity to the defendant, the latter took subject to the equitable title in the said company, and the first, third, and fourth prayers of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 171 U. S. 46</a></p><p> the plaintiff were properly refused, for they all asked the court to say that there was no legally sufficient evidence to show that the plaintiff had knowledge or notice of the agreement between the plaintiff and the barrel company; but, as we have seen, knowledge and notice will be imputed to him, as Chief Justice Gibson said in <em>Chew v. Barnett, supra,</em> \'whether he had notice or not,\' holding, as he did, only an equitable title."</p>\n<p>The opinion concludes as follows:  "Finding no error in the rulings of the learned judge below, the judgment will be affirmed."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1918315">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Harrison v.

The plaintiff claims title through two assignments from Campbell, each being for one-half interest in a certain application filed in the Patent Office of the United States at Washington, D.C., which application is for letters patent covering the invention of a machine for forming and making barrels and kegs."</p>\n<p>"It will be found upon an examination of these instruments that they do not contain a request to the Commissioner of Patents to issue letters patent to the plaintiff.  Notwithstanding they were recorded in the Patent Office, letters patent were issued in the name of Henry Campbell, the inventor, and the defendant contends that the legal effect of such an assignment, in which the inventor fails to embody a request to the Commissioner of Patents to issue letters to the assignee, is to convey to such assignee only an equitable title.  It is conceded that, by one of the rules of the Patent Office, the Commissioner will not and cannot issue the letters patent to an assignee, unless specially requested so to do by the terms of the assignment.  One of the witnesses refers to this rule in his testimony.  The patent having been issued to Campbell instead of to the defendant, the witness thus explains:"</p>\n<p>"I ascertained that the probable reason why it [the patent] had not been issued to Mr. Morton was this:  the original assignment from Mr. Campbell to Mr. Harrison did not contain the request which the rules of the Patent Office required in order that the patent should be issued in the name of the assignee."</p>\n<p>"Rule 26, Rules of Practice in United States Patent Office, p. 9, revised April 1, 1892."</p>\n<p>After considering authorities, the opinion decides that:</p>\n<p>"If, therefore, the Campbell Barrel Company acquired an equitable title to the patent, as it undoubtedly did, under its contract with the inventor, before the assignment of the equity to the defendant, the latter took subject to the equitable title in the said company, and the first, third, and fourth prayers of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 171 U. S. 46</a></p><p> the plaintiff were properly refused, for they all asked the court to say that there was no legally sufficient evidence to show that the plaintiff had knowledge or notice of the agreement between the plaintiff and the barrel company; but, as we have seen, knowledge and notice will be imputed to him, as Chief Justice Gibson said in <em>Chew v. Barnett, supra,</em> \'whether he had notice or not,\' holding, as he did, only an equitable title."</p>\n<p>The opinion concludes as follows:  "Finding no error in the rulings of the learned judge below, the judgment will be affirmed."</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McKENNA, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>It is manifest that the pleadings of the parties presented for decision other questions besides federal ones, and which could be, independent of the federal ones, determinative of the controversy.  Assuming therefore, that a federal question was involved, it does not appear but that the decision was given on the contention of the defendant that the agreement never became operative for want of delivery.  This contention was clearly presented by defendant\'s prayers, and they contained the only rulings urged upon the court in that way -- that is, in the nature of instructions.  They were given, and the verdict was generally for the defendant.  It is therefore natural to presume that the verdict was rendered on account of them and on the ground urged by them.  The ruling of the court granting them was sustained by the supreme court of the state.  It affirmed the ruling as correct in law and as supported by competent testimony.  The supreme court, it is true, passed on other grounds, passed on the one which it is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="47">Page 171 U. S. 47</a></p><p> claimed involved a federal question, and decided it adversely to plaintiff.  But the rule in such cases has been repeatedly declared by this Court.  It is not necessary to review the decisions.  That has been done by MR. JUSTICE SHIRAS in <em>Eustis v. Bolles,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/150/361/case.html">150 U. S. 361</a></span>.  It is sufficient to announce the rule pronounced in that case:</p>\n<p>"It is settled law that, to give this Court jurisdiction of a writ of error to a state court, it must appear affirmatively not only that a federal question was presented for decision by the state court, but that its decision was necessary to the determination of the cause, and that it was actually decided adversely to the party claiming a right under he federal laws or Constitution, or that the judgment as rendered could not have been given without deciding it.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/87/590/case.html">Murdock v. Memphis,</a></span></em> 20 Wall. 590; <em>Cook County v. Calumet &amp; Chicago Canal Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/138/635/case.html">138 U. S. 635</a></span>."</p>\n<p>"It is likewise settled law that where the record discloses that if a question has been raised and decided adversely to a party claiming the benefit of a provision of the Constitution or laws of the United States, another question not federal has been also raised and decided against such party, and the decision of the latter question is sufficient, notwithstanding the federal question, to sustain the judgment, this Court will not review the judgment."</p>\n<p><em>See also Wade v.Lawder,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/165/624/case.html">165 U. S. 624</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>The writ of error must therefore be dismissed.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY did not hear the argument, and took no part in the decision.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
