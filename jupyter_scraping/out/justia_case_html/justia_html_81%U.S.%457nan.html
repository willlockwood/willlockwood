A minor point of pleading (arising from the fact that the court below did not send the case to the jury on the issue joined on the first plea) being also raised. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 81 U. S. 462</a></p><p></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question is whether the description of fees now collected under the general regulations of the Treasury Department of February, 1857, includes the sums collected under these regulations for licenses to steamers, and as compensation for the inspections and examinations made for the year under the Steamboat Act of August 30, 1852, in addition to the fees for issuing enrolments and licenses.</p>\n<p>These sums are collected as fees under the regulations, and are not distinguished from the collector\'s fees proper, except by the circumstance that they are described as a compensation for inspections and examinations.  The provision, that these sums shall be quarterly accounted for and paid over to the United States, does not distinguish them from fees and emoluments to be accounted for under the act of the 17th of June, 1864, or under the regulations of the Treasury Department of February, 1857.</p>\n<p>The language of the regulations is, that the fees are to be charged, and collected, and accounted for, and paid over to the United States by collectors, in the same manner as other revenue.  This language obviously means that they are to be accounted for in all cases, and paid over, unless retained under authority of law.  The Act of June 17, 1864, authorizes the collector to retain the fees and a commission of three percent on moneys collected and accounted for, paying over to the Treasury only the excess beyond two thousand five hundred dollars; and there is no distinction in the regulations between the fees for admeasurement, licenses, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 81 U. S. 463</a></p><p> &amp;c., and the fees for licenses as a compensation for inspections and examinations.</p>\n<p>We think, therefore, that the collector was authorized to retain all descriptions of fees paid him not in excess of two thousand five hundred dollars.  It follows that the demurrer was properly overruled; and, as the defendant did not think it proper to reply, but allowed judgment to be entered upon the plea, the other plea of <em>nil debet</em> became immaterial, and the judgment was properly entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p>It is therefore</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>10 Stat at Large, 73.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>13 Stat. at Large 134.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>3 <em>id.</em> 695.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
