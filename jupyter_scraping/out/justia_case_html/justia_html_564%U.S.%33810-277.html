They claim that local managers exercise their discretion over pay and promotions disproportionately in favor of men, which has an unlawful disparate impact on female employees; and that Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to cabin its managers\xe2\x80\x99 authority amounts to disparate treatment.  The District Court certified the class, finding that respondents satisfied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), and Rule 23(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of showing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Ninth Circuit substantially affirmed, concluding, <em>inter alia,</em> that respondents met Rule 23(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s commonality requirement and that their backpay claims could be certified as part of a (b)(2) class because those claims did not predominate over the declaratory and injunctive relief requests.  It also ruled that the class action could be manageably tried without depriving Wal-Mart of its right to present its statutory defenses if the District Court selected a random set of claims for valuation and then extrapolated the validity and value of the untested claims from the sample set.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The certification of the plaintiff class was not consistent with Rule 23(a).

Here, proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with respondents\xe2\x80\x99 merits contention that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination.  The crux of a Title VII inquiry is \xe2\x80\x9cthe reason for a particular employment decision,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cooper</em> v. <em>Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/867/index.html">467 U. S. 867</a>, 876, and respondents wish to sue for millions of employment decisions at once.  Without some glue holding together the alleged reasons for those decisions, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members\xe2\x80\x99 claims will produce a common answer to the crucial discrimination question.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>General Telephone Co. of Southwest</em> v. <em>Falcon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/147/index.html">457 U. S. 147</a>, describes the proper approach to commonality.  On the facts of this case, the conceptual gap between an individual\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination claim and \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 157\xe2\x80\x93158, must be bridged by \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 159, n.\xc2\xa015.  Such proof is absent here.  Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s announced policy forbids sex discrimination, and the company has penalties for denials of equal opportunity.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 only evidence of a general discrimination policy was a sociologist\xe2\x80\x99s analysis asserting that Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s corporate culture made it vulnerable to gender bias.  But because he could not estimate what percent of Wal-Mart employment decisions might be determined by stereotypical thinking, his testimony was worlds away from \xe2\x80\x9csignificant proof\xe2\x80\x9d that Wal-Mart \xe2\x80\x9coperated under a general policy of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 evidence convincingly establishes is Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\xe2\x80\x9d of giving local supervisors discretion over employment matters.  While such a policy could be the basis of a Title VII disparate-impact claim, recognizing that a claim \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x9d exist does not mean that every employee in a company with that policy has a common claim.  In a company of Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s size and geographical scope, it is unlikely that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to show such direction by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence falls well short.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 backpay claims were improperly certified under Rule 23(b)(2).  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Claims for monetary relief may not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2), at least where the monetary relief is not incidental to the requested injunctive or declaratory relief.  It is unnecessary to decide whether monetary claims can ever be certified under the Rule because, at a minimum, claims for individualized relief, like backpay, are excluded.  Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single, indivisible remedy would provide relief to each class member.  The Rule\xe2\x80\x99s history and structure indicate that individualized monetary claims belong instead in Rule 23(b)(3), with its procedural protections of predominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Respondents nonetheless argue that their backpay claims were appropriately certified under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not \xe2\x80\x9cpredominate\xe2\x80\x9d over their injunctive and declaratory relief requests.  That interpretation has no basis in the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s text and does obvious violence to the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s structural features.  The mere \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance\xe2\x80\x9d of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim does nothing to justify eliminating Rule 23(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s procedural protections, and creates incentives for class representatives to place at risk potentially valid monetary relief claims.  Moreover, a district court would have to reevaluate the roster of class members continuously to excise those who leave their employment and become ineligible for classwide injunctive or declaratory relief.  By contrast, in a properly certified (b)(3) class action for backpay, it would be irrelevant whether the plaintiffs are still employed at Wal-Mart.  It follows that backpay claims should not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2).  Pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0It is unnecessary to decide whether there are any forms of \xe2\x80\x9cincidental\xe2\x80\x9d monetary relief that are consistent with the above interpretation of Rule 23(b)(2) and the Due Process Clause because respondents\xe2\x80\x99 backpay claims are not incidental to their requested injunction.  Wal-Mart is entitled to individualized determinations of each employee\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for backpay.  Once a plaintiff establishes a pattern or practice of discrimination, a district court must usually conduct \xe2\x80\x9cadditional proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 to determine the scope of individual relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Teamsters</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/index.html">431 U. S. 324</a>, 361.  The company can then raise individual affirmative defenses and demonstrate that its action was lawful.  <em>Id.</em>, at 362.  The Ninth Circuit erred in trying to replace such proceedings with Trial by Formula.  Because Rule 23 cannot be interpreted to \xe2\x80\x9cabridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72072(b), a class cannot be certified on the premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled to litigate its statutory defenses to individual claims.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals approved the certification of a class comprising about one and a half million plaintiffs, current and former female employees of petitioner Wal-Mart who allege that the discretion exercised by their local supervisors over pay and promotion matters violates Title VII by discriminat-ing against women.  In addition to injunctive and declaratory relief, the plaintiffs seek an award of backpay.  We consider whether the certification of the plaintiff class\nwas consistent with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Wal-Mart is the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest private employer.  It operates four types of retail stores throughout the country: Discount Stores, Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, and Sam\xe2\x80\x99s Clubs.  Those stores are divided into seven nationwide divisions, which in turn comprise 41 regions of 80 to 85 stores apiece.  Each store has between 40 and 53 separate departments and 80 to 500 staff positions.  In all, Wal-Mart operates approximately 3,400 stores and employs more than one million people.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pay and promotion decisions at Wal-Mart are generally committed to local managers\xe2\x80\x99 broad discretion, which is exercised \xe2\x80\x9cin a largely subjective manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  222 F. R. D. 137, 145 (ND Cal. 2004).  Local store managers may increase the wages of hourly employees (within limits) with only limited corporate oversight.  As for salaried employees, such as store managers and their deputies, higher corporate authorities have discretion to set their pay with-in preestablished ranges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Promotions work in a similar fashion.  Wal-Mart permits store managers to apply their own subjective criteria when selecting candidates as \xe2\x80\x9csupport managers,\xe2\x80\x9d which is the first step on the path to management.  Admission to Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s management training program, however, does require that a candidate meet certain objective criteria, including an above-average performance rating, at least one year\xe2\x80\x99s tenure in the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s current position, and a willingness to relocate.  But except for those requirements, regional and district managers have discretion to use their own judgment when selecting candidates for management training.  Promotion to higher office\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, assistant manager, co-manager, or store manager\xe2\x80\x94is similarly at the discretion of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s superiors after prescribed objective factors are satisfied.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The named plaintiffs in this lawsuit, representing the 1.5 million members of the certified class, are three current or former Wal-Mart employees who allege that the company discriminated against them on the basis of their sex by denying them equal pay or promotions, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x931 <em>et seq.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Betty Dukes began working at a Pittsburgh, California, Wal-Mart in 1994.  She started as a cashier, but later sought and received a promotion to customer service manager.  After a series of disciplinary violations, however, Dukes was demoted back to cashier and then to greeter.  Dukes concedes she violated company policy, but contends that the disciplinary actions were in fact retaliation for invoking internal complaint procedures and that male employees have not been disciplined for similar infractions.  Dukes also claims two male greeters in the Pittsburgh store are paid more than she is.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Christine Kwapnoski has worked at Sam\xe2\x80\x99s Club stores in Missouri and California for most of her adult life.  She has held a number of positions, including a supervisory position.  She claims that a male manager yelled at her frequently and screamed at female employees, but not at men.  The manager in question \xe2\x80\x9ctold her to \xe2\x80\x98doll up,\xe2\x80\x99 to wear some makeup, and to dress a little better.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1003a.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The final named plaintiff, Edith Arana, worked at a Wal-Mart store in Duarte, California, from 1995 to 2001.  In 2000, she approached the store manager on more than one occasion about management training, but was brushed off.  Arana concluded she was being denied opportunity for advancement because of her sex.  She initiated internal complaint procedures, whereupon she was told to apply directly to the district manager if she thought her store manager was being unfair.  Arana, however, decided against that and never applied for management training again.  In 2001, she was fired for failure to comply with Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s timekeeping policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These plaintiffs, respondents here, do not allege that Wal-Mart has any express corporate policy against the advancement of women.  Rather, they claim that their local managers\xe2\x80\x99 discretion over pay and promotions is exercised disproportionately in favor of men, leading to an unlawful disparate impact on female employees, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(k).  And, respondents say, because Wal-Mart is aware of this effect, its refusal to cabin its managers\xe2\x80\x99 authority amounts to disparate treatment, see \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).  Their complaint seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, punitive damages, and backpay.  It does not ask for compensatory damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Importantly for our purposes, respondents claim that the discrimination to which they have been subjected is common to <em>all </em>Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s female employees.  The basic theory of their case is that a strong and uniform \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate culture\xe2\x80\x9d permits bias against women to infect, perhaps subconsciously, the discretionary decisionmaking of each one of Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s thousands of managers\xe2\x80\x94thereby making every woman at the company the victim of one common discriminatory practice.  Respondents therefore wish to litigate the Title VII claims of all female employees at Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s stores in a nationwide class action.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  Under Rule 23(a), the party seeking certification must demonstrate, first, that:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all mem-\nbers is impracticable,</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class,</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class\xe2\x80\x9d (paragraph breaks added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSecond, the proposed class must satisfy at least one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).  Respondents rely on Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when \xe2\x80\x9cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Invoking these provisions, respondents moved the District Court to certify a plaintiff class consisting of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]ll women employed at any Wal-Mart domestic retail store\nat any time since December 26, 1998, who have been or may be subjected to Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  222 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D., at 141\xe2\x80\x93142 (quoting Plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s Motion for Class Certification in case No. 3:01\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9302252\xe2\x80\x93CRB (ND Cal.), Doc. 99, p.\xc2\xa037).  As evidence that there were indeed \xe2\x80\x9cquestions of law or fact common to\xe2\x80\x9d all the women of Wal-Mart, as Rule 23(a)(2) requires, respondents relied chiefly on three forms of proof: statistical evidence about pay and promotion disparities between men and women at the company, anecdotal reports of discrimination from about 120 of Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s female employees, and the testimony of a sociologist, Dr. William Bielby, who conducted a \xe2\x80\x9csocial framework analysis\xe2\x80\x9d of Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cculture\xe2\x80\x9d and personnel practices, and concluded that the company was \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerable\xe2\x80\x9d to gender discrimination.  603 F. 3d 571, 601 (CA9 2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wal-Mart unsuccessfully moved to strike much of this evidence.  It also offered its own countervailing statistical and other proof in an effort to defeat Rule 23(a)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements of commonality, typicality, and adequate representation.  Wal-Mart further contended that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 monetary claims for backpay could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2), first because that Rule refers only to injunctive and declaratory relief, and second because the backpay claims could not be manageably tried as a class without depriving Wal-Mart of its right to present certain statutory defenses.  With one limitation not relevant here, the District Court granted respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion and certified their proposed class.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided en banc Court of Appeals substantially affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s certification order.  603 F. 3d 571.  The majority concluded that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 evidence of commonality was sufficient to \xe2\x80\x9craise the common question whether Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s female employees nationwide were subjected to a single set of corporate policies (not merely a number of independent discriminatory acts) that may have worked to unlawfully discriminate against them in violation of Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 612 (emphasis deleted).  It also agreed with the District Court that the named plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims were sufficiently typical of the class as a whole to satisfy Rule 23(a)(3), and that they could serve as adequate class representatives, see Rule 23(a)(4).  <em>Id.</em>, at 614\xe2\x80\x93615.  With respect to the Rule 23(b)(2) question, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 backpay claims could be certified as part of a (b)(2) class because they did not \xe2\x80\x9cpredominat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d over the requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, meaning they were not \xe2\x80\x9csuperior in strength, influence, or authority\xe2\x80\x9d to the nonmonetary claims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 616 (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court of Appeals determined that the action could be manageably tried as a class action because the District Court could adopt the approach the Ninth Circuit approved in <em>Hilao</em> v. <em>Estate of Marcos</em>, 103 F.\xc2\xa03d 767, 782\xe2\x80\x93787 (1996).  There compensatory damages for some 9,541 class members were calculated by selecting 137 claims at random, referring those claims to a special master for valuation, and then extrapolating the validity and value of the untested claims from the sample set.  See 603 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 625\xe2\x80\x93626.  The Court of Appeals \xe2\x80\x9cs[aw] no reason why a similar procedure to that used in <em>Hilao</em> could not be employed in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 627.  It would allow Wal-Mart \xe2\x80\x9cto present individual defenses in the randomly selected \xe2\x80\x98sample cases,\xe2\x80\x99 thus revealing the approximate percentage of class members whose unequal pay or nonpromotion was due to something other than gender discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>, n. 56 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  562 U.

For example: Do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart?  Do our managers have discretion over pay?  Is that an unlawful employment practice?  What remedies should we get?  Reciting these questions is not sufficient to obtain class certification.  Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members \xe2\x80\x9chave suffered the same injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Falcon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 157.  This does not mean merely that they have all suffered a violation of the same pro-vision of law.  Title VII, for example, can be violated in many ways\xe2\x80\x94by intentional discrimination, or by hiring and promotion criteria that result in disparate impact, and by the use of these practices on the part of many different superiors in a single company.  Quite obviously, the mere claim by employees of the same company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate-impact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all their claims can productively be litigated at once.  Their claims must depend upon a common contention\xe2\x80\x94for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor.  That common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution\xe2\x80\x94which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters to class certification \xe2\x80\xa6 is not the raising of common \xe2\x80\x98questions\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94even in droves\xe2\x80\x94but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common <em>answers</em> apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.  Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common answers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nagareda, <em>supra</em>, at 132.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.  A party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule\xe2\x80\x94that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are <em>in fact </em>sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc.  We recognized in <em>Falcon </em>that \xe2\x80\x9csometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question,\xe2\x80\x9d 457 U. S., at 160, and that certification is proper only if \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 161; see <em>id.</em>, at 160 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ctual, not presumed, conformance with Rule 23(a) remains \xe2\x80\xa6 indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d).  Frequently that \xe2\x80\x9crigorous analysis\xe2\x80\x9d will entail some overlap with the merits of\nthe plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s underlying claim.  That cannot be helped. \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Falcon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 160 (quoting <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</em> v. <em>Livesay</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/463/index.html">437 U.

Without some glue holding the alleged <em>reasons </em>for all those decisions together, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members\xe2\x80\x99 claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial question <em>why was I disfavored</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Falcon</em> describes how the commonality issue must be approached.  There an employee who claimed that he was deliberately denied a promotion on account of race obtained certification of a class comprising all employees wrongfully denied promotions and all applicants wrongfully denied jobs.  457 U. S., at 152.  We rejected that composite class for lack of commonality and typicality, explaining:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cConceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an individual\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he has been denied a promotion [or higher pay] on discriminatory grounds, and his otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of discrimination, and (b) the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual, such that the individual\xe2\x80\x99s claim and the class claim will share common questions of law or fact and that the individual\xe2\x80\x99s claim will be typical of the class claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 157\xe2\x80\x93158.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>Falcon</em> suggested two ways in which that conceptual gap might be bridged.  First, if the employer \xe2\x80\x9cused a biased testing procedure to evaluate both applicants for employment and incumbent employees, a class action on behalf of every applicant or employee who might have been prejudiced by the test clearly would satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 159, n.\xc2\xa015.  Second, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably could justify a class of both applicants and employees\nif the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion practices in the same general fashion, such as through entirely subjective decisionmaking processes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We think that statement precisely describes respondents\xe2\x80\x99 burden in this case.  The first manner of bridging the gap obviously has no application here; Wal-Mart has no testing procedure or other companywide evaluation method that can be charged with bias.  The whole point of permitting discretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evaluating employees under a common standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second manner of bridging the gap requires \xe2\x80\x9csignificant proof\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that Wal-Mart \xe2\x80\x9coperated under a general policy of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is entirely absent here.  Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s announced policy forbids sex discrimination, see App. 1567a\xe2\x80\x931596a, and as the District Court recognized the company imposes penalties for denials of equal employment opportunity, 222 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D., at 154.  The only evidence of a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral policy of discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d respondents produced was the testimony of Dr. William Bielby, their sociological expert.  Relying on \xe2\x80\x9csocial framework\xe2\x80\x9d analysis, Bielby testified that Wal-Mart has a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong corporate culture,\xe2\x80\x9d that makes it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98vulnerable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cgender bias.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 152.  He could not, however, \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine with any specificity how regularly stereotypes play a meaningful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart.  At his deposition \xe2\x80\xa6 Dr. Bielby conceded that he could not calculate whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d  222 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 189, 192 (ND Cal. 2004).  The parties dispute whether Bielby\xe2\x80\x99s testimony even met the standards for the admission of expert testimony under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 702 and our <em>Daubert </em>case, see <em>Daubert</em> v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/579/index.html">509 U. S. 579</a> (1993).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The District Court concluded that <em>Daubert</em> did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage of class-action proceedings.  222 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D., at 191.  We doubt that is so, but even if properly considered, Bielby\xe2\x80\x99s testimony does nothing to advance respondents\xe2\x80\x99 case.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking\xe2\x80\x9d is the essential question on which respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory of commonality depends.  If Bielby admittedly has no answer to that question, we can safely disregard what he has to say.  It is worlds away from \xe2\x80\x9csignificant proof\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that Wal-Mart \xe2\x80\x9coperated under a general policy of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 evidence convincingly establishes is Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>allowing discretion</em> by local supervisors over employment matters.  On its face, of course, that is just the opposite of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a class action; it is a policy <em>against</em> <em>having</em> uniform employment practices.  It is also a very common and presumptively reasonable way of doing business\xe2\x80\x94one that we have said \xe2\x80\x9cshould itself raise no inference of discriminatory conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Watson</em> v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/index.html">487 U. S. 977</a>, 990 (1988).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, we have recognized that, \xe2\x80\x9cin appropriate cases,\xe2\x80\x9d giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact theory\xe2\x80\x94since \xe2\x80\x9can employer\xe2\x80\x99s undisciplined system of subjective decisionmaking [can have] precisely the same effects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 990\xe2\x80\x93991.  But the recognition that this type of Title VII claim \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x9d exist does not lead to\nthe conclusion that every employee in a company using a system of discretion has such a claim in common.  To the contrary, left to their own devices most managers in any corporation\xe2\x80\x94and surely most managers in a corporation that forbids sex discrimination\xe2\x80\x94would select sex-neutral, performance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that produce no actionable disparity at all.  Others may choose to reward various attributes that produce disparate impact\xe2\x80\x94such as scores on general aptitude tests or educational achievements, see <em>Griggs</em> v. <em>Duke Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/424/index.html">401 U. S. 424</a>, 431\xe2\x80\x93432 (1971).  And still other managers may be guilty of intentional discrimination that produces a sex-based disparity.  In such a company, demonstrating the invalidity of one manager\xe2\x80\x99s use of discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another\xe2\x80\x99s.  A party seeking to certify a nationwide class will be unable to show that all the employees\xe2\x80\x99 Title VII claims will in fact depend on the answers to common questions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents have not identified a common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire company\xe2\x80\x94aside from their reliance on Dr. Bielby\xe2\x80\x99s social frameworks analysis that we have rejected.  In a company of Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s size and geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction.  Respondents attempt to make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence, but their evidence falls well short.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statistical evidence consists primarily of regression analyses performed by Dr. Richard Drogin, a statistician, and Dr. Marc Bendick, a labor economist.  Drogin conducted his analysis region-by-region, comparing the number of women promoted into management positions with the percentage of women in the available pool of hourly workers.  After considering regional and national data, Drogin concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are statistically significant disparities between men and women at Wal-Mart . .\xc2\xa0. [and] these disparities \xe2\x80\xa6 can be explained only by gender discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  603 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 604 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Bendick compared work-force data from Wal-Mart and competitive retailers and concluded that Wal-Mart \xe2\x80\x9cpromotes a lower percentage of women than its competitors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if they are taken at face value, these studies are insufficient to establish that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory can be proved on a classwide basis.  In <em>Falcon</em>, we held that one named plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s experience of discrimination was insufficient to infer that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory treatment is typical of [the employer\xe2\x80\x99s employment] practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  457 U. S., at 158.  A similar failure of inference arises here.  As Judge Ikuta observed in her dissent, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nformation about disparities at the regional and national level does not establish the existence of disparities at individual stores, let alone raise the inference that a company-wide policy of discrimination is implemented by discretionary decisions at the store and district level.\xe2\x80\x9d  603 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 637.  A regional pay disparity, for example, may be attributable to only a small set of Wal-Mart stores, and cannot by itself establish the uniform, store-by-store disparity upon which the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 theory of commonality depends.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is another, more fundamental, respect in which respondents\xe2\x80\x99 statistical proof fails.  Even if it established (as it does not) a pay or promotion pattern that differs from the nationwide figures or the regional figures in <em>all </em>of Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s 3,400 stores, that would still not demonstrate that commonality of issue exists.  Some managers will claim that the availability of women, or qualified women, or interested women, in their stores\xe2\x80\x99 area does not mirror the national or regional statistics.  And almost all of them will claim to have been applying some sex-neutral,\nperformance-based criteria\xe2\x80\x94whose nature and effects\nwill differ from store to store.  In the landmark case of ours which held that giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact theory, the plurality opinion <em>conditioned </em>that holding on the corollary that merely proving that the discretionary system has produced a racial or sexual disparity <em>is not enough.  </em>\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he plaintiff must begin by identifying the specific employment practice that is challenged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Watson</em>, 487 U. S., at 994; accord, <em>Wards Cove Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Atonio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/index.html">490 U.

That is all the more necessary when a class of plaintiffs is sought to be certified.  Other than the bare existence of delegated discretion, respondents have identified no \xe2\x80\x9cspecific employment practice\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94much less one that ties all their 1.5 million claims together.  Merely showing that Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s policy of discretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity does not suffice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 anecdotal evidence suffers from the same defects, and in addition is too weak to raise any inference that all the individual, discretionary personnel decisions are discriminatory.

S. 324</a> (1977), in addition to substantial statistical evidence of company-wide discrimination, the Government (as plaintiff) produced about 40 specific accounts of racial discrimination from particular individuals.  See <em>id.,</em> at 338.  That number was significant because the company involved had only 6,472 employees, of whom 571 were minorities, <em>id.</em>, at 337, and the class itself consisted of around 334 persons, <em>United States</em> v. <em>T.I.M.E.-D.\xc2\xa0C., Inc.</em>, 517 F.\xc2\xa02d 299, 308 (CA5 1975), overruled on other grounds<em>, Teamsters</em>, <em>supra</em>.  The 40 anecdotes thus represented roughly one account for every eight members of\nthe class.

More than half of these reports are concentrated in only six States (Alabama, California, Florida, Missouri, Texas, and Wisconsin); half of all States have only one or two anecdotes; and 14 States have no anecdotes about Wal-Mart\xe2\x80\x99s operations at all.  <em>Id.</em>, at 634\xe2\x80\x93635, and n.\xc2\xa010.

It criticizes our focus on the dissimilarities be-tween the putative class members on the ground that\nwe have \xe2\x80\x9cblend[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 23(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s commonality requirement with Rule 23(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into whether common questions \xe2\x80\x9cpredominate\xe2\x80\x9d over individual ones.  See <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  That is not so.  We quite agree that for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[e]ven a single [common] question\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d will do, <em>post</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa09 (quoting Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the Structure of the Class Action, 103 Colum.

We consider dissimilarities not in order to determine (as Rule 23(b)(3) requires) whether common questions <em>predominate</em>, but in order to determine (as Rule 23(a)(2) requires) whether there <em>is</em> \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven a single [common] question.\xe2\x80\x9d  And there is not here.

We need not reach that broader question in this case, because we think that, at a minimum, claims for <em>individualized</em> relief (like the backpay at issue here) do not satisfy the Rule.  The key to the (b)(2) class is \xe2\x80\x9cthe indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted\xe2\x80\x94the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nagareda, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 132.  In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.  It does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a <em>different</em> injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.  Similarly, it does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That interpretation accords with the history of the Rule.  Because Rule 23 \xe2\x80\x9cstems from equity practice\xe2\x80\x9d that predated its codification, <em>Amchem Products, Inc.</em> v. <em>Windsor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/591/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/591/index.html">521 U. S. 591</a>, 613 (1997), in determining its meaning we have previously looked to the historical models on which the Rule was based, <em>Ortiz</em> v. <em>Fibreboard Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/815/index.html">527 U. S. 815</a>, 841\xe2\x80\x93845 (1999).  As we observed in <em>Amchem</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples\xe2\x80\x9d of what (b)(2) is meant to capture.  521 U. S., at 614.  In particular, the Rule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to racial segregation\xe2\x80\x94conduct that was remedied by a single classwide order.  In none of the cases cited by the Advisory Committee as examples of (b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s antecedents did the plaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with their classwide injunction.  See Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Note, 39 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 69, 102 (1966) (citing cases); <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Potts</em> v. <em>Flax</em>, 313 F. 2d 284, 289, n. 5 (CA5 1963); <em>Brunson</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Univ. of School Dist. No. 1, Clarendon Cty., </em>311 F.\xc2\xa02d 107, 109 (CA4 1962) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Frasier</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of N.C.</em>, 134 F. Supp. 589, 593 (NC 1955) (three-judge court), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/979/index.html">350 U. S. 979</a> (1956).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Permitting the combination of individualized and classwide relief in a (b)(2) class is also inconsistent with the structure of Rule 23(b).  Classes certified under (b)(1) and (b)(2) share the most traditional justifications for class treatment\xe2\x80\x94that individual adjudications would be impossible or unworkable, as in a (b)(1) class,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] or that the relief sought must perforce affect the entire class at once, as in a (b)(2) class.  For that reason these are also mandatory classes: The Rule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even oblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action.  Rule 23(b)(3), by contrast, is an \xe2\x80\x9cadventuresome innovation\xe2\x80\x9d of the 1966 amendments, <em>Amchem</em>, 521 U. S., at 614 (internal quotation marks omitted), framed for situations \xe2\x80\x9cin which \xe2\x80\x98class-action treatment is not as clearly called for\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 615 (quoting Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 697 (1994 ed.)).  It allows class certification in a much wider set of circumstances but with greater procedural protections.  Its only prerequisites are that \xe2\x80\x9cthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 23(b)(3).  And unlike (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes, the (b)(3) class is not mandatory; class members are entitled to receive \xe2\x80\x9cthe best notice that is practicable under the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d and to withdraw from the class at their option.  See Rule 23(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given that structure, we think it clear that individ-ualized monetary claims belong in Rule 23(b)(3).  The procedural protections attending the (b)(3) class\xe2\x80\x94predominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out\xe2\x80\x94are missing from (b)(2) not because the Rule considers them unnecessary, but because it considers them unnecessary <em>to a (b)(2) class</em>.  When a class seeks an indivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once, there is no reason to undertake a case-specific inquiry into whether class issues predominate or whether class action is a superior method of adjudicating the dispute.  Predominance and superiority are self-evident.  But with respect to each class member\xe2\x80\x99s individualized claim for money, that is not so\xe2\x80\x94which is precisely why (b)(3) requires the judge to make findings about predominance and superiority before allowing the class.  Similarly, (b)(2) does not require that class members be given notice and opt-\nout rights, presumably because it is thought (rightly or wrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is mandatory, and that depriving people of their right to sue in this manner complies with the Due Process Clause.  In the context of a class action predominantly for money damages we have held that absence of notice and opt-out violates due process.  See <em>Phillips Petroleum Co.</em> v. <em>Shutts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/797/index.html">472 U. S. 797</a>, 812 (1985).  While we have never held that to be so where the monetary claims do not predominate, the serious possibility that it may be so provides an additional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the monetary claims here.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against that conclusion, respondents argue that their claims for backpay were appropriately certified as part of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not \xe2\x80\x9cpredominate\xe2\x80\x9d over their requests for injunctive and declaratory relief.  They rely upon the Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s statement that Rule 23(b)(2) \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates <em>exclusively or predominantly</em> to money damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  39 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D., at 102 (emphasis added).  The negative implication, they argue, is that it <em>does </em>extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates only partially and nonpredominantly to money damages.  Of course it is the Rule itself, not the Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s description of it, that governs.  And a mere negative inference does not in our view suffice to establish a disposition that has no basis in the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s text, and that does obvious violence to the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s structural features.  The mere \xe2\x80\x9cpredominance\xe2\x80\x9d of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim does nothing to justify elimination of Rule 23(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s procedural protections: It neither establishes the superiority of <em>class </em>adjudication over <em>individual</em> adjudication nor cures the notice and opt-out problems.  We fail to see why the Rule should be read to nullify these protections whenever a plaintiff class, at its option, combines its monetary claims with a request\xe2\x80\x94even a \xe2\x80\x9cpredominating request\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for an injunction.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 predominance test, moreover, creates perverse incentives for class representatives to place at risk potentially valid claims for monetary relief.  In this case, for example, the named plaintiffs declined to include employees\xe2\x80\x99 claims for compensatory damages in their complaint.  That strategy of including only backpay claims made it more likely that monetary relief would not \xe2\x80\x9cpredominate.\xe2\x80\x9d  But it also created the possibility (if the predominance test were correct) that individual class members\xe2\x80\x99 compensatory-damages claims would be <em>precluded</em> by litigation they had no power to hold themselves apart from.  If it were determined, for example, that a particular class member is not entitled to backpay because her denial of increased pay or a promotion was <em>not </em>the product of discrimination, that employee might be collaterally estopped from independently seeking compensatory damages based on that same denial.  That possibility underscores the need for plaintiffs with individual monetary claims to decide <em>for themselves</em> whether to tie their fates to the class representatives\xe2\x80\x99 or go it alone\xe2\x80\x94a choice Rule 23(b)(2) does not ensure that they have.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The predominance test would also require the District Court to reevaluate the roster of class members continually.  The Ninth Circuit recognized the necessity for this when it concluded that those plaintiffs no longer employed by Wal-Mart lack standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief against its employment practices.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 response to that difficulty, however, was not to eliminate <em>all</em> former employees from the certified class, but to eliminate only those who had left the company\xe2\x80\x99s employ by the date the complaint was filed.  That solution has no logical connection to the problem, since those who have left their Wal-Mart jobs <em>since</em> the complaint was filed have no more need for prospective relief than those who left beforehand.  As a consequence, even though the validity of a (b)(2) class depends on whether \xe2\x80\x9cfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class <em>as a whole</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 23(b)(2) (emphasis added), about half the members of the class approved by the Ninth Circuit have no claim for injunctive or declaratory relief at all.  Of course, the alternative (and logical) solution of excising plaintiffs from the class as they leave their employment may have struck the Court of Appeals as wasteful of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s time.  Which indeed it is, since if a backpay action were properly certified for class treatment under <em>(b)(3)</em>, the ability to litigate a plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s backpay claim as part of the class would not turn on the irrelevant question whether she is still employed at Wal-Mart.  What follows from this, however, is not that some arbitrary limitation on class membership should be imposed but that the backpay claims should not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents argue that their backpay claims are appropriate for a (b)(2) class action because a backpay award is equitable in nature.  The latter may be true, but it is irrelevant.  The Rule does not speak of \xe2\x80\x9cequitable\xe2\x80\x9d remedies generally but of injunctions and declaratory judgments.  As Title VII itself makes pellucidly clear, backpay is neither.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) (distinguishing between declaratory and injunc-tive relief and the payment of \xe2\x80\x9cbackpay,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(A)).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Allison</em> v. <em>Citgo Petroleum Corp.</em>, 151 F.\xc2\xa03d 402, 415 (CA5 1998), the Fifth Circuit held that a (b)(2) class would permit the certification of monetary relief that is \xe2\x80\x9cincidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief,\xe2\x80\x9d which it defined as \xe2\x80\x9cdamages that flow directly from liability to\nthe class <em>as a whole</em> on the claims forming the basis of the injunctive or declaratory relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  In that court\xe2\x80\x99s view, such \xe2\x80\x9cincidental damage should not require additional hearings to resolve the disparate merits of each individual\xe2\x80\x99s case; it should neither introduce new substantial legal or factual issues, nor entail complex individualized determinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We need not decide in this case whether there are any forms of \xe2\x80\x9cincidental\xe2\x80\x9d monetary relief that are consistent with the interpretation of Rule 23(b)(2) we have announced and that comply with the Due Process Clause.  Respondents do not argue that they can satisfy this standard, and in any event they cannot.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, Wal-Mart is entitled to individualized determinations of each employee\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for backpay.  Title VII includes a detailed remedial scheme.  If a plaintiff prevails in showing that an employer has discriminated against him in violation of the statute, the court \xe2\x80\x9cmay enjoin the respondent from en-gaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, [including] reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without backpay \xe2\x80\xa6 or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(1).  But if the employer can show that it took an adverse employment action against an employee for any reason other than discrimination, the court cannot order the \xe2\x80\x9chiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or the payment to him of any backpay.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have established a procedure for trying pattern-or-practice cases that gives effect to these statutory requirements.  When the plaintiff seeks individual relief such as reinstatement or backpay after establishing a pattern or practice of discrimination, \xe2\x80\x9ca district court must usually conduct additional proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 to determine the scope of individual relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Teamsters</em>, 431 U. S., at 361.  At this phase, the burden of proof will shift to the company, but it will have the right to raise any individual affirmative defenses it may have, and to \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment opportunity for lawful reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 362.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals believed that it was possible to replace such proceedings with Trial by Formula.  A sample set of the class members would be selected, as to whom liability for sex discrimination and the backpay owing as a result would be determined in depositions supervised by a master.  The percentage of claims determined to be valid would then be applied to the entire remaining class, and the number of (presumptively) valid claims thus derived would be multiplied by the average backpay award in the sample set to arrive at the entire class recovery\xe2\x80\x94without further individualized proceedings.  603 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 625\xe2\x80\x93627.  We disapprove that novel project.  Because the Rules Enabling Act forbids interpreting Rule 23 to \xe2\x80\x9cabridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72072(b); see <em>Ortiz</em>, 527 U. S., at 845, a class cannot be certified on the premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled to litigate its statutory defenses to individual claims.  And because the necessity of that litigation will prevent backpay from being \xe2\x80\x9cincidental\xe2\x80\x9d to the classwide injunction, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 class could not be certified even assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that \xe2\x80\x9cincidental\xe2\x80\x9d monetary relief can be awarded to a 23(b)(2) class.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p align="left">Reversed.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The complaint included seven named plaintiffs, but only three remain part of the certified class as narrowed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Rule 23(b)(1) allows a class to be maintained where \xe2\x80\x9cprosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d either \xe2\x80\x9c(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c(B) adjudications \xe2\x80\xa6 that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impeded their ability to protect their interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 23(b)(3) states that a class may be maintained where \xe2\x80\x9cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,\xe2\x80\x9d and a class action would be \xe2\x80\x9csuperior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  The applicability of these provisions to the plaintiff class is not before us.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The District Court excluded backpay claims based on promotion opportunities that had not been publicly posted, for the reason that no applicant data could exist for such positions.  222 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 137, 182 (ND Cal. 2004).
