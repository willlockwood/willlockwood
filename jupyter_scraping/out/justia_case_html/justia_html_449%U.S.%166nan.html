Although providing that employees who lacked the requisite 10 years of railroad employment to qualify for railroad retirement benefits as of the January 1, 1975, changeover date would not receive any windfall benefits, the 1974 Act preserved windfall benefits for individuals who had retired and were receiving dual benefits as of the changeover date.  A provision of the 1974 Act, 45 U.S.C. $ 231b(h)(1), also preserved windfall benefits for employees who had qualified for dual benefits as of the changeover date, but who had not yet retired, if they had (1) performed some railroad service in 1974 or (2) had a "current connection" with the railroad industry as of December 31, 1974, or their later retirement date, or (3) completed 25 years of railroad service as of December 31, 1974.  The 1974 Act further provided, 45 U.S.C. $ 231b(h)(2), that employees who had qualified for railroad benefits as of the changeover date, but lacked a current connection with the railroad industry in 1974 and 25 years of railroad employment, could obtain a lesser amount of windfall benefits if they had qualified for social security benefits as of the year (prior to 1975) they left railroad employment.  Appellee and others filed a class action in Federal District Court for a declaratory judgment that $ 231b(h) is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, contending that it was irrational for Congress to distinguish between employees who had more than 10 years but less than 25 years of railroad employment simply on the basis of whether they had a "current connection" with the railroad industry as of the changeover date or as of the date of retirement.  The District Court certified a plaintiff class of all persons eligible to retire between January 1, 1975, and January 31, 1977, who were permanently insured under the Social Security Act as of December 31, 1974, but who were not eligible to receive any windfall benefits because they had left the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="167">Page 449 U.

We noted probable jurisdiction. 444 U.S. 1069 (1980).</p>\n<p>The 1974 Act fundamentally restructured the railroad retirement system.  The Act\'s predecessor statute, adopted in 1937, provided a system of retirement and disability benefits for persons who pursued careers in the railroad industry.  Under that statute, a person who worked for both railroad and nonrailroad employers and who qualified for railroad retirement benefits and social security benefits, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 401 <em>et seq.,</em> received retirement benefits under both systems and an accompanying "windfall" benefit. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The legislative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="169">Page 449 U. S. 169</a></p><p> history of the 1974 Act shows that the payment of windfall benefits threatened the railroad retirement system with bankruptcy by the year 1981. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Congress therefore determined to place the system on a "sound financial basis" by eliminating future accruals of those benefits. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Congress also enacted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="170">Page 449 U. S. 170</a></p><p> various transitional provisions, including a grandfather provision, \xc2\xa7 231b(h), [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] which expressly preserved windfall benefits for some classes of employees. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="171">Page 449 U. S. 171</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In restructuring the Railroad Retirement Act in 1974, Congress divided employees into various groups.  <em>First,</em> those employees who lacked the requisite 10 years of railroad employment to qualify for railroad retirement benefits as of January 1, 1975, the changeover date, would have their retirement benefits computed under the new system and would not receive any windfall benefit.  <em>Second,</em> those individuals already retired and already receiving dual benefits as of the changeover date would have their benefits. computed under the old system, and would continue to receive a windfall benefit. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Third,</em> those employees who had qualified for both railroad and social security benefits as of the changeover date, but who had not yet retired as of that date (and thus were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="172">Page 449 U. S. 172</a></p><p> not yet receiving dual benefits), were entitled to windfall benefits if they had (1) performed some railroad service in 1974 or (2) had a "current connection" with the railroad industry as of December 31, 1974, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] or (3) completed 25 years of railroad service as of December 31, 1974.  45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 231b(h)(1).  Fourth, those employees who had qualified for railroad benefits as of the changeover date, but lacked a current connection with the railroad industry in 1974 and lacked 25 years of railroad employment, could obtain a lesser amount of windfall benefit if they had qualified for social security benefits as of the year (prior to 1975) they left railroad employment.  45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 231b(h)(2). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, an individual who, as of the changeover date, was unretired and had 10 years of railroad employment and sufficient nonrailroad employment to qualify for social security benefits is eligible for the full windfall amount if he worked for the railroad in 1974 or had a current connection with the railroad as of December 31, 1974, or his later retirement date.  But an unretired individual with 24 years of railroad service and sufficient nonrailroad service to qualify for social security benefits is not eligible for a full windfall amount unless he worked for the railroad in 1974, or had a current connection with the railroad as of December 31, 1974, or his later retirement date.  And an employee with 10 years of railroad employment who qualified for social security benefits only after </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 449 U. S. 173</a></p><p> leaving the railroad industry will not receive a reduced windfall benefit, while an employee who qualified for social security benefits prior to leaving the railroad industry would receive a reduced benefit.  It was with these complicated comparisons that Congress wrestled in 1974.</p>\n<p>Appellee and others filed this class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a declaratory judgment that 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 231b(h) is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it irrationally distinguishes between classes of annuitants. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The District Court eventually certified a class of all persons eligible to retire between January 1, 1975, and January 31, 1977, who were permanently insured under the Social Security Act as of December 31, 1974, but who were not eligible to receive any "windfall component" because they had left the railroad industry before 1974, had no "current connection" with it at the end of 1974, and had less than 25 years of railroad service. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Appellee contended below that it was irrational for Congress to have drawn a distinction between employees who had more than 10 years but less than 25 years of railroad employment simply on the basis of whether they had a "current connection" with the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="174">Page 449 U. S. 174</a></p><p> railroad industry as of the changeover date or as of the date of retirement.</p>\n<p>The District Court agreed with appellee that a differentiation based solely on whether an employee was "active" in the railroad business as of 1974 was not "rationally related" to the congressional purposes of insuring the solvency of the railroad retirement system and protecting vested benefits.  We disagree, and reverse.</p>\n<p>The initial issue presented by this case is the appropriate standard of judicial review to be applied when social and economic legislation enacted by Congress is challenged as being violative of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  There is no claim here that Congress has taken property in violation of the Fifth Amendment, since railroad benefits, like social security benefits, are not contractual, and may be altered or even eliminated at any time.  <em>Hisquierdo v.

And because the distinctions drawn in \xc2\xa7 231b(h) do not burden fundamental constitutional rights or create "suspect" classifications, such as race or national origin, we may put cases involving judicial review of such claims to one side.  <em>San Antonio Independent School District v.

Since budgetary constraints do not allow the payment of the full standard of need for all welfare recipients, the State may have concluded that the aged and infirm are the least able of the categorical grant recipients to bear the hardships of an inadequate standard of living.  While different policy judgments are, of course, possible, it is not irrational for the State to believe that the young are more adaptable than the sick and elderly, especially because the latter have less hope of improving their situation in the years remaining to them.

Because Congress could have eliminated windfall benefits for all classes of employees, it is not constitutionally impermissible for Congress to have drawn lines between groups of employees for the purpose of phasing out those benefits.  <em>New Orleans v. Dukes, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/297/case.html#305">427 U. S. 305</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The only remaining question is whether Congress achieved its purpose in a patently arbitrary or irrational way.  The classification here is not arbitrary, says appellant, because it is an attempt to protect the relative equities of employees and to provide benefits to career railroad employees.  Congress fully protected, for example, the expectations of those employees who had already retired and those unretired employees who had 25 years of railroad employment.  Conversely, Congress denied all windfall benefits to those employees who lacked 10 years of railroad employment.  Congress additionally provided windfall benefits, in lesser amount, to those employees with 10 years\' railroad employment who had qualified for social security benefits at the time they had left railroad employment, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="178">Page 449 U. S. 178</a></p><p> regardless of a current connection with the industry in 1974 or on their retirement date.</p>\n<p>Thus, the only eligible former railroad employees denied full windfall benefits are those, like appellee, who had no statutory entitlement to dual benefits at the time they left the railroad industry, but thereafter became eligible for dual benefits when they subsequently qualified for social security benefits.  Congress could properly conclude that persons who had actually acquired statutory entitlement to windfall benefits while still employed in the railroad industry had a greater equitable claim to those benefits than the members of appellee\'s class who were no longer in railroad employment when they became eligible for dual benefits.  Furthermore, the "current connection" test is not a patently arbitrary means for determining which employees are "career railroaders," particularly since the test has been used by Congress elsewhere as an eligibility requirement for retirement benefits. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Congress could assume that those who had a current connection with the railroad industry when the Act was passed in 1974, or who returned to the industry before their retirement, were more likely than those who had left the industry prior to 1974, and who never returned, to be among the class of persons who pursue careers in the railroad industry, the class for whom the Railroad Retirement Act was designed.  <em>Hisquierdo v.

It is, of course, "constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision," <em>Flemming v. Nestor,</em> 363 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/603/case.html#612">363 U. S. 612</a></span>, because this Court has never insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute.  This is particularly true where the legislature must necessarily engage in a process of line-drawing.  The</p>\n<p>"task of classifying persons for . . . benefits . . . inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line,"</p>\n<p><em>Mathews v.

If this test were applied literally to every member of any legislature that ever voted on a law, there would be very few laws which would survive it.  The language of the statute is clear, and we have historically assumed that Congress intended what it enacted.  To be sure, appellee lost a political battle in which he had a strong interest, but this is neither the first nor the last time that such a result will occur in the legislative forum.  What we have said is enough to dispose of the claims that Congress not only failed to accept appellee\'s argument as to restructuring <em>in toto,</em> but that such failure denied him equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.

If the employee also worked outside the railroad industry for a sufficient time to qualify for social security benefits, he qualified for dual benefits.  Due to the formula under which those benefits were computed, however, persons who split their employment between railroad and nonrailroad employment received dual benefits in excess of the amount they would have received had they not split their employment.  For example, if 10 years of either railroad or nonrailroad employment would produce a monthly benefit of $300, an additional 10 years of the same employment at the same level of creditable compensation would not double that benefit, but would increase it by some lesser amount to say $500.  If that 20 years of service had been divided equally between railroad and nonrailroad employment, however, the social security benefit would be $300 and the railroad retirement benefit would also be $300, for a total benefit of $600.  The $100 difference in the example constitutes the "windfall" benefit.  <em>See generally,</em> S.Rep. No. 93-1163, pp. 2-3 (1974); H.R.Rep. No. 93-1345, pp. 2-3 (1974).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The relevant Committee Reports stated:</p>\n<p>"Resolution of the so called \'dual benefit\' problem is central both to insuring the fiscal soundness of the railroad retirement system and to establishing equitable retirement benefits for all railroad employees."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 93-1163, <em>supra</em> at 11; H.R.Rep. No. 93-1345, <em>supra</em> at 11.  The reason for the problem was that a financial interchange agreement entered into in 1951 between the social security and railroad systems caused the entire cost of the windfall benefits to be borne by the railroad system, not the social security system.  The annual drain on the railroad system amounted to approximately $450 million per year, and if it were not for "the problem of dual beneficiaries, the railroad retirement system would be almost completely solvent."  S.Rep. No. 93-1163, <em>supra</em> at 8; H.R.Rep. No. 93-1345, <em>supra</em> at 7.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 93-1163, <em>supra</em> at 1; H.R.Rep. No. 93-1345, <em>supra</em> at 1.  Congress eliminated future accruals of windfall benefits by establishing a two-tier system for benefits.  The first tier is measured by what the social security system would pay on the basis of combined railroad and nonrailroad service, while the second tier is based on railroad service alone.  However, both tiers are part of the railroad retirement system, rather than the first tier being placed directly under social security, and the benefits actually paid by social security on the basis of nonrailroad employment are deducted so as to eliminate the windfall benefit.</p>\n<p>The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 had its origins in 1970 when Congress created the Commission on Railroad Retirement to study the actuarial soundness of the railroad retirement system.  The Commission submitted its report in 1972, and identified "dual benefits and their attendant windfalls" as a principal cause of the system\'s financial difficulties.  It also found that windfall benefits were inequitable, favoring those employees who split their employment over those employees who spent their entire career in the railroad industry.  Report of the Commission on Railroad Retirement, The Railroad Retirement System:  Its Coming Crisis, H.R. Doc. No. 92-350 (1972).  It therefore recommended that future accruals of windfall benefits be eliminated by the establishment of a two-tier system, somewhat similar to the type of system eventually adopted by Congress.  It also recommended that "legally vested rights of railroad workers" be preserved.  An employee who was fully insured under both the railroad and social security systems as of the changeover date (<em>i.e.,</em> by having at least 10 years of railroad employment and the requisite length of social security employment) was deemed to have "legally vested rights."</p>\n<p>Following receipt of the Commission\'s report, Congress requested members of management, labor, and retirees to form a Joint Labor Management Railroad Retirement Negotiating Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Joint Committee) and submit a report, "tak[ing] into account" the recommendations of the Commission.  The Joint Committee outlined its proposals in the form of a letter to Congress, dated April 10, 1974.  120 Cong.Rec. 18391-18392 (1974).  Although it agreed with the Commission that future accruals of windfall benefits be eliminated, it differed as to the protection to be afforded those already statutorily entitled to benefits, and recommended the transitional provisions that were eventually adopted by Congress.  A bill embodying those principles was drafted and submitted to Congress, where the relevant committees held lengthy hearings and submitted detailed Reports.  <em>See</em> S.Rep.

S. 97</a></span> (1979) (footnote omitted) .</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s criticism of the Court\'s approach to this case merits a more thoughtful response than that contained in  <a href="#F10" name="T10">footnote 10</a> <em>ante</em> at 176-177.  JUSTICE BRENNAN correctly points out that, if the analysis of legislative purpose requires only a reading of the statutory language in a disputed provision, and if any "conceivable basis" for a discriminatory classification will repel a constitutional attack on the statute, judicial review will constitute a mere tautological recognition of the fact that Congress did what it intended to do.  JUSTICE BRENNAN is also correct in reminding us that, even though the statute is an example of "social and economic legislation," the challenge here is mounted by individuals whose legitimate expectations of receiving a fixed retirement income are being frustrated by, in effect, a breach of a solemn commitment by their Government.  When Congress deprives a small class of persons of vested rights that are protected -- and, indeed, even enhanced [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] -- for others who are in a similar though not identical position, I believe the Constitution requires something more than merely a "conceivable" or a "plausible" explanation for the unequal treatment.</p>\n<p>I do not, however, share JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s conclusion that every statutory classification must further an objective that can be confidently identified as the "actual purpose" of the legislature.  Actual purpose is sometimes unknown.  Moreover, undue emphasis on actual motivation may result in identically worded statutes\' being held valid in one State and invalid in a neighboring State. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  I therefore believe that we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 449 U. S. 181</a></p><p> must discover a correlation between the classification and either the actual purpose of the statute or a legitimate purpose that we may reasonably presume to have motivated an impartial legislature.  If the adverse impact on the disfavored class is an apparent aim of the legislature, its impartiality would be suspect.  If, however, the adverse impact may reasonably be viewed as an acceptable cost of achieving a larger goal, an impartial lawmaker could rationally decide that that cost should be incurred.</p>\n<p>In this case, we need not look beyond the actual purpose of the legislature.  As is often true, this legislation is the product of multiple and somewhat inconsistent purposes that led to certain compromises.  One purpose was to eliminate in the future the benefit that is described by the Court as a "windfall benefit" and by JUSTICE BRENNAN as an "earned dual benefit."  That aim was incident to the broader objective of protecting the solvency of the entire railroad retirement program.  Two purposes that conflicted somewhat with this broad objective were the purposes of preserving those benefits that had already vested and of increasing the level of payments to beneficiaries whose rights were not otherwise to be changed.  As JUSTICE BRENNAN emphasizes, Congress originally intended to protect all vested benefits, but it ultimately sacrificed some benefits in the interest of achieving other objectives.</p>\n<p>Given these conflicting purposes, I believe the decisive questions are (1) whether Congress can rationally reduce the vested benefits of some employees to improve the solvency of the entire program while simultaneously increasing the benefits of others; and (2) whether, in deciding which vested benefits to reduce, Congress may favor annuitants whose railroad service was more recent than that of disfavored annuitants who had an equal or greater quantum of employment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 449 U. S. 182</a></p><p></p>\n<p>My answer to both questions is in the affirmative.  The congressional purpose to eliminate dual benefits is unquestionably legitimate; that legitimacy is not undermined by the adjustment in the level of remaining benefits in response to inflation in the economy.  As for the second question, some hardship -- in the form of frustrated long-term expectations -- must inevitably result from any reduction in vested benefits.  Arguably, therefore, Congress had a duty -- and surely it had the right to decide -- to eliminate no more vested benefits than necessary to achieve its fiscal purpose.  Having made that decision, any distinction it chose within the class of vested beneficiaries would involve a difference of degree, rather than a difference in entitlement.  I am satisfied that a distinction based upon currency of railroad employment represents an impartial method of identifying that sort of difference.  Because retirement plans frequently provide greater benefits for recent retirees than for those who retired years ago -- and thus give a greater reward for recent service than for past service of equal duration -- the basis for the statutory discrimination is supported by relevant precedent. It follows, in my judgment, that the timing of the employees\' railroad service is a "reasonable basis" for the classification as that term is used in <em>Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/220/61/case.html">220 U.

The answer to this question turns in large part on the way in which the strictures of equal protection are conceived by this Court.  <em>See Morey v.

The Court today purports to apply this standard, but in actuality fails to scrutinize the challenged classification in the manner established by our governing precedents.

When faced with a challenge to a legislative classification under the rational basis test, the court should ask, first, what the purposes of the statute are, and, second, whether the classification is rationally related to achievement of those purposes. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 449 U. S. 185</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The purposes of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 are clear, because Congress has commendably stated them in the House and Senate Reports accompanying the Act.  A section of the Reports is entitled "Principal Purpose of the Bill."  It notes generally that "[t]he bill provides for a complete restructuring of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, and will place it on a sound financial basis," [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>] and then states:</p>\n<p>"Persons who already have vested rights under both the Railroad Retirement and the Social Security systems will in the future be permitted to receive benefits computed under both systems, just as is true under existing law."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 93-1345, pp. 1, 2 (1974); S.Rep. No. 93-1163, pp. 1, 2 (1974). [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  Moreover, Congress explained that this purpose was based on considerations of fairness and the legitimate expectations of the retirees:</p>\n<p>"[A]ny plan to eliminate these dual benefits should include protection of the equities of existing beneficiaries </p><p><a class="page-number" name="186">Page 449 U. S. 186</a></p><p> and employees with claims upon such benefits.  Dual beneficiaries cannot fairly be criticized, since they have merely secured the benefits to which they are entitled under existing law.  That is why their equities should be preserved."</p>\n<p>H.R. No. 93-1345, at 11; S.Rep. No. 93-1163, at 11.</p>\n<p>Thus, a "principal purpose" of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, as explicitly stated by Congress, was to preserve the vested earned benefits of retirees who had already qualified for them.  The classification at issue here, which deprives some retirees of vested dual benefits that they had earned prior to 1974, directly conflicts with Congress\' stated purpose.  As such, the classification is not only rationally unrelated to the congressional purpose; it is inimical to it.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court today avoids the conclusion that \xc2\xa7 231b(h) must be invalidated by deviating in three ways from traditional rational basis analysis.  First, the Court adopts a tautological approach to statutory purpose, thereby avoiding the necessity for evaluating the relationship between the challenged classification and the legislative purpose.  Second, it disregards the actual stated purpose of Congress in favor of a justification which was never suggested by any Representative or Senator, and which in fact conflicts with the stated congressional purpose.  Third, it upholds the classification without any analysis of its rational relationship to the identified purpose.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court states that "the plain language of [45 U.S.C.] \xc2\xa7 231b(h) marks the beginning and end of our inquiry."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/166/case.html#176">449 U. S. 176</a></span>.  This statement is strange indeed, for the "plain language" of the statute can tell us only what the classification is; it can tell us nothing about the purpose of the classification, let alone the relationship between the classification </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 449 U. S. 187</a></p><p> and that purpose.  Since \xc2\xa7 231b(h) deprives the members of appellee class of their vested earned dual benefits, the Court apparently assumes that Congress must have <em>intended that result.</em>  But by presuming purpose from result, the Court reduces analysis to tautology.  It may always be said that Congress intended to do what it in fact did.  If that were the extent of our analysis, we would find every statute, no matter how arbitrary or irrational, perfectly tailored to achieve its purpose.  But equal protection scrutiny under the rational basis test requires the courts first to deduce the independent objectives of the statute, usually from statements of purpose and other evidence in the statute and legislative history, and second to analyze whether the challenged classification rationally furthers achievement of those objectives.  The Court\'s tautological approach will not suffice.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court analyzes the rationality of \xc2\xa7 231b(h) in terms of a justification suggested by Government attorneys, but never adopted by Congress.  The Court states that it is "<em>constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/166/case.html#179">449 U. S. 179</a></span> (quoting <em>Flemming v. Nestor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/603/case.html">363 U. S. 603</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/603/case.html#612">363 U. S. 612</a></span> (1960)).  In fact, however, equal protection analysis has evolved substantially on this question since <em>Flemming</em> was decided.  Over the past 10 years, this Court has frequently recognized that the actual purposes of Congress, rather than the <em>post hoc</em> justifications offered by Government attorneys, must be the primary basis for analysis under the rational basis test.  In <em>Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/636/case.html">420 U. S. 636</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/636/case.html#648">420 U. S. 648</a></span>, n. 16 (1975), we said:\n</em></p>\n<p>"This Court need not in equal protection cases accept at face value assertions of legislative purposes, when an examination of the legislative scheme and its history demonstrates that the asserted purpose could not have been a goal of the legislation."</p>\n<p>(Citing cases.) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="188">Page 449 U. S. 188</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Thus, in <em>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/1/case.html">411 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/1/case.html#17">411 U. S. 17</a></span> (1973), this Court stated that a challenged classification will pass muster under "rational basis" scrutiny only if it "rationally furthers some legitimate, <em>articulated</em> state purpose" (emphasis added), and in <em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Muria,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/307/case.html#314">427 U. S. 314</a></span>, we stated that such a classification will be sustained only if it "rationally furthers the purposes <em>identified by the State.</em>"  (Emphasis added.)  Moreover, in <em>Johnson v. Robison,</em> 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/361/case.html#381">415 U. S. 381</a></span>-382, we upheld a classification on the finding that "[t]hese quantitative and qualitative distinctions, <em>expressly recognize by Congress,</em> form a rational basis for Congress\' classification. . . ."  (Emphasis added.)  <em>See also Califano v. Goldfarb,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/199/case.html">430 U. S. 199</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/199/case.html#212">430 U. S. 212</a></span>-213 (1977).</p>\n<p>From these cases and others, it is clear that this Court will no longer sustain a challenged classification under the rational basis test merely because Government attorneys can suggest a "conceivable basis" upon which it might be thought rational.  The standard we have applied is properly deferential to the Legislative Branch:  where Congress has articulated a legitimate governmental objective, and the challenged classification rationally furthers that objective, we must sustain the provision.  In other cases, however, the courts must probe more deeply.  Where Congress has expressly stated the purpose of a piece of legislation, but where the challenged classification is either irrelevant to or counter to that purpose, we must view any <em>post hoc</em> justifications proffered by Government attorneys with skepticism.  A challenged classification may be sustained only if it is rationally related to achievement of an <em>actual</em> legitimate governmental purpose.</p>\n<p>The Court argues that Congress chose to discriminate against appellee for reasons of equity, stating that</p>\n<p>"Congress could properly conclude that persons who had actually acquired statutory entitlement to windfall benefits while still employed in the railroad industry had a greater equitable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="189">Page 449 U. S. 189</a></p><p> claim to those benefits than the members of appellee\'s class who were no longer in railroad employment when they became eligible for dual benefits. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/166/case.html#178">449 U. S. 178</a></span>.  This statement turns Congress\' assessment of the equities on its head.  As I have shown, [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>] Congress expressed the view that it would be inequitable to deprive any retirees of any portion of the benefits they had been promised and that they had earned under prior law.  <em>See also</em> H.R.Rep. No. 93-1345, pp. 4, 11 (1974); S.Rep. No. 91163, pp. 4, 11 (1974); 120 Cong.Rec. 35613 (1974) (statement of Rep. Hudnut); <em>id.</em> at 35614 (statement of Rep. Shuster); <em>id.</em> at 35615 (statement of Rep. Morgan).  The Court is unable to cite even one statement in the legislative history by a Representative or Senator that makes the equitable judgment it imputes to Congress.  In the entire legislative history of the Act, the only persons to state that the equities justified eliminating appellee\'s earned dual benefits were representatives of railroad management and labor, whose self-serving interest in bringing about this result destroys any basis for attaching weight to their statements. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The factual findings of the District Court concerning the development of \xc2\xa7 231b(h), amply supported by the legislative history, are revealing on this point. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  In 1970, Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="190">Page 449 U. S. 190</a></p><p> established a Commission to investigate the actuarial soundness of the Railroad Retirement system and to make recommendations for its reform.  <em>See</em> Pub.L. 91-377, 84 Stat. 791.  The Commission was composed of one railroad management representative, one railroad labor representative, and three public representatives.  The Commission submitted a report in 1972 recommending, <em>inter alia,</em> that railroad retirees in the future no longer be permitted to earn full Railroad Retirement and Social Security benefits without offset.  The Commission insisted, however, that</p>\n<p>"[i]ndividuals who have vested rights to social security benefits by virtue of permanently or fully insured status, but cannot exercise them because they are not at retirement age under railroad retirement, should be guaranteed an equivalent right in dollar terms to the staff tier portion of their benefits, including vested dual benefits. . . ."</p>\n<p>Commission on Railroad Retirement, The Railroad Retirement System:  Its Coming Crisis, H.R. Doc. No. 92350, p. 368 (1972).</p>\n<p>After receiving the Commission report, Congress asked railroad management and labor representatives to negotiate and submit a bill to restructure the Railroad Retirement system, which should "take into account the specific recommendations of the Commission on Railroad Retirement."  Pub.L. 93-69, \xc2\xa7 107, 87 Stat. 165.  The members of this Joint Labor-Management Negotiating Committee were not appointed by public officials, nor did they represent the interests of the appellee class, who were no longer active railroaders or union members. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="191">Page 449 U. S. 191</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In an initial proposed restructuring of the system, the Joint Committee devised a means whereby the system deficit could be completely eliminated without depriving retirees of vested earned benefits.  <em>See</em> Finding of Fact No. 43, reprinted at App. to Juris.Statement 12a.  However, labor representatives demanded that benefits be increased for their current members, the cost to be offset by divesting the appellee class of a portion of the benefits they had earned under prior law.  <em>See</em> Findings of Fact Nos. 39, 40, 44, reprinted <em>id.</em> at 11a-12a.  As the District Court found:</p>\n<p>"Essentially, the railroad labor negotiators traded off the plaintiff class of beneficiaries to achieve added benefits for their current employees, even though doing so violated the basic Congressional purposes of the negotiations.  Furthermore, by sacrificing the plaintiff class, the railroad labor unions breached the duty of fair representation they owed to the plaintiff class, which duty resulted from the labor unions\' purported representation of the plaintiff class\' interests in the [Joint Committee] negotiations."</p>\n<p>Finding of Fact No. 44, reprinted <em>id.</em> at 12a-13a.</p>\n<p>Congress conducted hearings to consider the Joint Committee\'s recommendations, but never directed its attention to their effect on persons in appellee class\' situation.  In fact, the Joint Committee negotiators and Railroad Retirement Board members who testified at congressional hearings perpetuated the inaccurate impression that all retirees with earned vested dual benefits under prior law would retain their benefits unchanged.  For example, Mr. William H. Dempsey, chairman of the management negotiators on the Joint </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 449 U.

They have made their contributions.  They have relied upon the law.  They . . . should be protected."</p>\n<p>Restructuring of the Railroad Retirement System:  Hearings on H.R. 15301 before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 214 (1974).  <em>Accord, id.</em> at 190 (statement of Mr. Dempsey); <em>id.</em> at 194 (statement of Mr. Dempsey); <em>id.</em> at 204 (statement of Rep.

[<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, a misstatement or several misstatements by witnesses before Congress would not ordinarily lead us to conclude that Congress misapprehended what it was doing.  In this instance, however, where complex legislation was drafted by outside parties and Congress relied on them to explain it, where the misstatements are frequent and unrebutted, and where no Member of Congress can be found to have stated the effect of the classification correctly, we are entitled to suspect that Congress may have been misled.  As the District Court found:</p>\n<p>"At no time during the hearings did Congress even give a hint that it understood that the bill by its language eliminated an earned benefit of plaintiff\'s class."</p>\n<p>Finding of Fact No. 63, reprinted at App. to Juris.Statement 22a.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I do not think that this classification was rationally related to an <em>actual</em> governmental purpose.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The third way in which the Court has deviated from the principles of rational basis scrutiny is its failure to analyze </p><p><a class="page-number" name="194">Page 449 U. S. 194</a></p><p> whether the challenged classification is genuinely related to the purpose identified by the Court.  Having suggested that "equitable considerations" underlay the challenged classification -- in direct contradiction to Congress\' evaluation of those considerations, and in the face of evidence that the classification was the product of private negotiation by interested parties, inadequately examined and understood by Congress -- the Court proceeds to accept that suggestion without further analysis.</p>\n<p>An unadorned claim of "equitable" considerations is, of course, difficult to assess.  It seems to me that, before a court may accept a litigant\'s assertion of "equity," it must inquire what principles of equity or fairness might genuinely support such a judgment. But apparently the Court does not demand such inquiry, for it has failed to address any equitable considerations that might be relevant to the challenged classification.</p>\n<p>In my view, the following considerations are of greatest relevance to the equities of this case:  (1) contribution to the system; (2) reasonable expectation and reliance; (3) need; and (4) character of service to the railroad industry.  With respect to each of these considerations, I would conclude that the members of appellee class have as great an equitable claim to their earned dual benefits as do their more favored coworkers, who remain entitled to their earned dual benefits under \xc2\xa7 231b(h).</p>\n<p><em>Contribution to the system.</em>  The members of the appellee class worked in the railroad industry for more than 10 but fewer than 25 years, and also worked in nonrailroad jobs for the required number of years for vesting under Social Security -- usually 40 quarters.  During that time, they contributed to both the Railroad Retirement and Social Security systems, and met all requirements of the law for the vesting of benefits under those systems.  In this respect, they are identical to their more favored coworkers, who contributed no more of their earnings to the systems than did appellee </p><p><a class="page-number" name="195">Page 449 U. S. 195</a></p><p> class.  On the basis of contributions to the systems, therefore, there is no reason for this discrimination.</p>\n<p><em>Reasonable expectation and reliance.</em>  Throughout their working lives, the members of appellee class were assured that they would receive retirement benefits in accordance with the terms of the law as it then stood.  <em>See</em> Finding of Fact No. 70, reprinted at App. to Juris.Statement 25a.  No less than their more favored coworkers, they chose career paths and made calculations for their retirement based on these assurances.  For Congress to change its rules and strip them of these benefits at the time of their retirement seems decidedly inequitable.  As the District Court found:</p>\n<p>"The class\' reliance on the earned railroad retirement benefit and on the anticipated receipt of full dual benefits is clear from the evidence adduced herein."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Equally clear from the evidence is the fact that the class\' reliance has been to the class\' detriment.  Class members have been forced to alter substantially their mode of retirement living due to the drastic reduction of Railroad Retirement benefits worked by the 1974 Act.  This point was confirmed in the [Joint Committee] negotiations shortly prior to the sending of its report to Congress in April, 1974:"</p>\n<p>"Mr. Dempsey:  . . .  The benefit [dual benefit] is one that, if we were starting out, we would not have at all.  So theoretically we would urge that it be out completely as of January 1, 1975.  But we cannot do that -- we have people who are relying on benefits, not responsible for them, but merely working for them under the rules as they stood."</p>\n<p>Findings of Fact Nos. 70, 71, reprinted <em>id.</em> at 25a-26a.  In fact, this reliance was one of the principal reasons Congress resolved not to disturb the vested earned dual benefits of retirees. [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="196">Page 449 U. S. 196</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Need.</em>  The appellee class is composed of fixed-income elderly people, no longer capable of reentering the workforce to reacquire benefits once earned but now lost.  The average loss to the class members is about $88 per month, no small element in the monthly budget.  The record provides no reason to suppose that members of the appellee class are any less likely to be in need than are their coworkers.</p>\n<p><em>Character of service to the railroad industry.</em>  Members of the appellee class worked at least 10 years for the railroad industry by 1974, and many of them worked as long as 24 years.  Their duration of railroad employment -- surely the best measure of their service to the industry -- was equal to that of their coworkers.  In fact, some members of the class worked <em>over twice as long</em> in the railroad industry as did some of those who retained their rights to a dual benefit.  Finding of Fact No. 60, reprinted <em>id.</em> at 21a-22a.  Admittedly, the members of the appellee class retired from railroad work prior to 1974, but the record shows that many left railroad work involuntarily, not because of a lack of commitment to the industry.  Finding of Fact No. 72, reprinted <em>id.</em> at 26a.  Moreover, since one purpose of the Railroad Retirement system was to encourage railroad workers to retire early, so as to create positions for younger workers, <em>Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/572/case.html">439 U. S. 572</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/572/case.html#573">439 U. S. 573</a></span> 574 (1979), it is hardly fair to fault the appellee class now for having done so.</p>\n<p>Even if I were able to accept the notion that Congress considered it equitable to deprive a class of railroad retirees of a portion of their vested earned benefits because they no longer worked for the railroad, I would still consider the means adopted in \xc2\xa7 231b(h) irrational. [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  Under this provision, a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="197">Page 449 U. S. 197</a></p><p> retiree is favored by retention of his full vested earned benefits if he had worked so much as one day for a railroad in 1974.  This is a plainly capricious basis for distinguishing among retirees, every one of whom had worked in the industry for at least <em>10 years:</em>  the fortuity of one day of employment in a particular year should not govern entitlement to benefits earned over a lifetime. [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]</p>\n<p>I therefore conclude that the Government\'s proffered justification of "equitable considerations," accepted without question by the Court, cannot be defended.  Rather, as the legislative history repeatedly states, equity and fairness demand that the members of appellee class, like their coworkers, retain the vested dual benefits they earned prior to 1974.  A conscientious application of rational basis scrutiny demands, therefore, that \xc2\xa7 231b(h) be invalidated.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Equal protection rationality analysis does not empower the courts to second-guess the wisdom of legislative classifications.  On this, we are agreed, and have been for over 40 years.  On the other hand, we are not powerless to probe beneath claims by Government attorneys concerning the means and ends of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="198">Page 449 U.

The instant case serves as an example of the unfortunate consequence of such misplaced deference.  Because the Court is willing to accept a tautological analysis of congressional purpose, an assertion of "equitable" considerations contrary to the expressed judgment of Congress, and a classification patently unrelated to achievement of the identified purpose, it succeeds in effectuating neither equity nor congressional intent.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Weinberger v.

Under this subsection, some members of the appellee class are entitled to retain a portion of their earned dual benefit, albeit at a reduced level, while the others are divested of the dual benefit altogether.  The basis for this added twist is the timing of their qualification for Railroad Retirement and Social Security.  Those who qualified for Social Security first retain a portion of their dual benefit; those who qualified for Railroad Retirement first do not.  Needless to say, the retirees had no notice at the time that the timing of qualification would make any difference to their entitlement to benefits.  This kind of after-the-fact shifting of the rules for retirement benefits has not been justified, and cannot be justified.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
