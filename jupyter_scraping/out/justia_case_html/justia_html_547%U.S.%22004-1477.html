Once the mortgage was paid off, the property taxes\xe2\x80\x94which had been paid by the mortgage company\xe2\x80\x94went unpaid, and the property was certified as delinquent.  Respondent Commissioner of State Lands mailed Jones a certified letter at the property\xe2\x80\x99s address, stating that unless he redeemed the property, it would be subject to public sale in two years.  Nobody was home to sign for the letter and nobody retrieved it from the post office within 15 days, so it was returned to the Commissioner, marked \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Two years later, the Commissioner published a notice of public sale in a local newspaper.  No bids were submitted, so the State negotiated a private sale to respondent Flowers.  Before selling the house, the Commissioner mailed another certified letter to Jones, which was also returned unclaimed.  Flowers purchased the house and had an unlawful detainer notice delivered to the property.  It was served on Jones\xe2\x80\x99 daughter, who notified him of the sale.  He filed a state-court suit against respondents, alleging that the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide adequate notice resulted in the taking of his property without due process.  Granting respondents summary judgment, the trial court concluded that Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 tax sale statute, which sets out the notice procedure used here, complied with due process.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0When mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so.

S. 306</a>, 314, but has never addressed whether due process requires further efforts when the government becomes aware prior to the taking that its notice attempt has failed.  Most Courts of Appeals and State Supreme Courts addressing this question have decided that the government must do more in such a case, and many state statutes require more than mailed notice in the first instance.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The means a State employs to provide notice \xe2\x80\x9cmust be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mullane,</em> 399 U. S.<em>,</em> at 315.  The adequacy of a particular form of notice is assessed by balancing the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest against \xe2\x80\x9cthe individual interest sought to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 314.  Here, the evaluation concerns the adequacy of notice prior to the State\xe2\x80\x99s extinguishing a property owner\xe2\x80\x99s interest in a home.  It is unlikely that a person who actually desired to inform an owner about an impending tax sale of a house would do nothing when a certified letter addressed to the owner is returned unclaimed.  The sender would ordinarily attempt to resend the letter, if that is practical, especially given that it concerns the important and irreversible prospect of losing a house.  The State may have made a reasonable calculation of how to reach Jones, but it had good reason to suspect when the notice was returned that Jones was no better off than if no notice had been sent.  The government must consider unique information about an intended recipient regardless of whether a statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide notice in the ordinary case.  See <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Hanrahan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/38/index.html">409 U. S. 38</a>, 40 <em>(per curiam), </em>and<em> Covey</em> v. <em>Town of Somers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/351/141/index.html">351 U. S. 141</a>, 146\xe2\x80\x93147.  It does not matter that the State in each of those cases was aware of the information <em>before </em>it calculated the best way to send notice.  Knowledge that notice was ineffective was one of the \xe2\x80\x9cpracticalities and peculiarities of the case\xe2\x80\x9d taken into account, <em>Mullane, supra, </em>at 314\xe2\x80\x93315, and it should similarly be taken into account in assessing the adequacy of notice here.  The Commissioner and Solicitor General correctly note the constitutionality of that a particular notice procedure is assessed <em>ex ante</em>, not <em>post hoc.  </em>But<em> </em>if a feature of the State\xe2\x80\x99s procedure is that it promptly provides additional information to the government about the effectiveness of attempted notice, the <em>ex ante </em>principle is not contravened by considering what the government does with that information.  None of the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s additional contentions\xe2\x80\x94that notice was sent to an address that Jones provided and had a legal obligation to keep updated, that a property owner who fails to receive a property tax bill and pay taxes is on inquiry notice that his property is subject to governmental taking, and that Jones was obliged to ensure that those in whose hands he left his property would alert him if it was in jeopardy\xe2\x80\x94relieves the State of its constitutional obligation to provide adequate notice.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Because additional reasonable steps were available to the State, given the circumstances here, the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s effort to provide notice to Jones was insufficient to satisfy due process.  What is reasonable in response to new information depends on what that information reveals.  The certified letter\xe2\x80\x99s return \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed\xe2\x80\x9d meant either that Jones was not home when the postman called and did not retrieve the letter or that he no longer resided there.  One reasonable step addressed to the former possibility would be for the State to resend the notice by regular mail, which requires no signature.  Certified mail makes actual notice more likely only if someone is there to sign for the letter or tell the mail carrier that the address is incorrect.  Regular mail can be left until the person returns home, and might increase the chances of actual notice.  Other reasonable follow-up measures would have been to post notice on the front door or address otherwise undeliverable mail to \xe2\x80\x9coccupant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Either approach would increase the likelihood that any occupants would alert the owner, if only because an ownership change could affect their own occupancy.  Contrary to Jones\xe2\x80\x99 claim, the Commissioner was not required to search the local phone book and other government records.  Such an open-ended search imposes burdens on the State significantly greater than the several relatively easy options outlined here.  The Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint about the burden of even these additional steps is belied by Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 requirement that notice to homestead owners be accomplished by personal service if certified mail is returned and by the fact that the State transfers the cost of notice to the taxpayer or tax sale purchaser.  The Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments\xe2\x80\x94that posted notice could be removed by children or vandals, and that the follow-up requirement will encourage States to favor modes of delivery that will not generate additional information\xe2\x80\x94are rejected.  This Court will not prescribe the form of service that Arkansas should adopt.  Arkansas can determine how best to proceed, and the States have taken a variety of approaches.

S. 306</a>, 313 (1950).  We granted certiorari to determine whether, when notice of a tax sale is mailed to the owner and returned undelivered, the government must take additional reasonable steps to provide notice before taking the owner\xe2\x80\x99s property.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1967, petitioner Gary Jones purchased a house at 717 North Bryan Street in Little Rock, Arkansas.  He lived in the house with his wife until they separated in 1993.  Jones then moved into an apartment in Little Rock, and his wife continued to live in the North Bryan Street house.  Jones paid his mortgage each month for 30 years, and the mortgage company paid Jones\xe2\x80\x99 property taxes.  After Jones paid off his mortgage in 1997, the property taxes went unpaid, and the property was certified as delinquent.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 2000, respondent Mark Wilcox, the Commissioner of State Lands (Commissioner), attempted to notify Jones of his tax delinquency, and his right to redeem the property, by mailing a certified letter to Jones at the North Bryan Street address.  See Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x93301 (1997).  The packet of information stated that unless Jones redeemed the property, it would be subject to public sale two years later on April 17, 2002.  See <em>ibid.  </em>Nobody was home to sign for the letter, and nobody appeared at the post office to retrieve the letter within the next 15 days.  The post office returned the unopened packet to the Commissioner marked \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unclaimed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two years later, and just a few weeks before the public sale, the Commissioner published a notice of public sale in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette.  No bids were submitted, which permitted the State to negotiate a private sale of the property.  See \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x93202(b).  Several months later, respondent Linda Flowers submitted a purchase offer.  The Commissioner mailed another certified letter to Jones at the North Bryan Street address, attempting to notify him that his house would be sold to Flowers if he did not pay his taxes.  Like the first letter, the second was also returned to the Commissioner marked \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Flowers purchased the house, which the parties stipulated in the trial court had a fair market value of $80,000, for $21,042.15.  Record 224.  Immediately after the 30-day period for postsale redemption passed, see \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x93202(e), Flowers had an unlawful detainer notice delivered to the property.  The notice was served on Jones\xe2\x80\x99 daughter, who contacted Jones and notified him of the tax sale.  <em>Id., </em>at 11 (Exh. B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jones filed a lawsuit in Arkansas state court against the Commissioner and Flowers, alleging that the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide notice of the tax sale and of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 right to redeem resulted in the taking of his property without due process.  The Commissioner and Flowers moved for summary judgment on the ground that the two unclaimed letters sent by the Commissioner were a constitutionally adequate attempt at notice, and Jones filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner and Flowers.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a\xe2\x80\x9313a.  It concluded that the Arkansas tax sale statute, which set forth the notice procedure followed by the Commissioner, complied with constitutional due process requirements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jones appealed, and the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  359 Ark. 443, ___ S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d ___ (2004).  The court noted our precedent stating that due process does not require actual notice, see <em>Dusenbery</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/161/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/161/index.html">534 U. S. 161</a>, 170 (2002), and it held that attempting to provide notice by certified mail satisfied due process in the circumstances presented, 359 Ark., at ___, ___ S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at ___.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. ___ (2005), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits and State Supreme Courts concerning whether the Due Process Clause requires the government to take additional reasonable steps to notify a property owner when notice of a tax sale is returned undelivered.  Compare, <em>e.g., Akey </em>v. <em>Clinton County</em>, 375 F.\xc2\xa03d 231, 236 (CA2 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn light of the notice\xe2\x80\x99s return, the County was required to use \xe2\x80\x98reasonably diligent efforts\xe2\x80\x99 to ascertain Akey\xe2\x80\x99s correct address\xe2\x80\x9d), and <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mossafa</em>, 100 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 2d 1, 9, 789 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 607, 611 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e reject the view that the enforcing officer\xe2\x80\x99s obligation is always satisfied by sending the notice to the address listed in the tax roll, even where the notice is returned as undeliverable\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Cliffs on the Bay Condominium Assn.</em>, 463 Mich. 420, 429, 617 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 536, 541 (2000) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that one of the mailings was returned by the post office as undeliverable does not impose on the state the obligation to undertake an investigation to see if a new address \xe2\x80\xa6 could be located\xe2\x80\x9d).  We hold that when mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, the State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so.  Under the circumstances presented here, additional reasonable steps were available to the State.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Due process does not require that a property owner receive actual notice before the government may take his property.  <em>Dusenbery</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 170.  Rather, we have stated that due process requires the government to provide \xe2\x80\x9cnotice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mullane</em>, 339 U. S., at 314.  The Commissioner argues that once the State provided notice reasonably calculated to apprise Jones of the impending tax sale by mailing him a certified letter, due process was satisfied.  The Arkansas statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide notice, the Commissioner continues, because it provides for notice by certified mail to an address that the property owner is responsible for keeping up to date.  See Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9335\xe2\x80\x93705 (1997).  The Commissioner notes this Court\xe2\x80\x99s ample precedent condoning notice by mail, see, <em>e.g., Dusenbery, supra, </em>at 169; <em>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pope,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/478/index.html"></a><a href="/us/485/478/index.html">485 U.

Brief for Respondent Commissioner 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that this Court has deemed notice constitutionally sufficient if it was reasonably calculated to reach the intended recipient when sent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Dusenbery</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 168\xe2\x80\x93169; <em>Mullane</em>, 339 U. S., at 314.  In each of these cases, the government attempted to provide notice and heard nothing back indicating that anything had gone awry, and we stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he reasonableness and hence the constitutional validity of [the] chosen method may be defended on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 315; see also <em>Dusenbery</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 170.  But we have never addressed whether due process entails further responsibility when the government becomes aware prior to the taking that its attempt at notice has failed.  That is a new wrinkle, and we have explained that the \xe2\x80\x9cnotice required will vary with circumstances and conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Walker</em> v. <em>City of Hutchinson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/112/index.html">352 U. S. 112</a>, 115 (1956).  The question presented\nis whether such knowledge on the government\xe2\x80\x99s part is\na \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance and condition\xe2\x80\x9d that varies the \xe2\x80\x9cnotice\nrequired.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals and State Supreme Courts have addressed this question on frequent occasions, and most have decided that when the government learns its attempt at notice has failed, due process requires the government to do something more before real property may be sold in a tax sale.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Plemons </em>v. <em>Gale</em>, 396 F.\xc2\xa03d 569, 576 (CA4 2005); <em>Akey</em>, 375 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 236; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Renewed Hope, Inc.</em>, 277 Ga. 465, 468, 589 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 81, 85 (2003); <em>Kennedy</em>, 100 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 2d, at 9, 789 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 611; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Robinson</em>, 614 A.\xc2\xa02d 33, 38 (D.\xc2\xa0C.

But see <em>Smith</em>, 463 Mich., at 429, 617 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 541; <em>Dahn </em>v. <em>Trownsell</em>, 1998 SD 36, \xc2\xb623, 576 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 535, 541\xe2\x80\x93542; <em>Elizondo </em>v. <em>Read</em>, 588 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 501, 504 (Ind. 1992); <em>Atlantic City</em> v. <em>Block C\xe2\x80\x9311, Lot 11</em>, 74 N.\xc2\xa0J. 34, 39\xe2\x80\x9340, 376 A.\xc2\xa02d 926, 928 (1977).  Many States already require in their statutes that the government do more than simply mail notice to delinquent owners, either at the outset or as a followup measure if initial mailed notice is ineffective.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In <em>Mullane</em>, we stated that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen notice is a person\xe2\x80\x99s due \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it,\xe2\x80\x9d 339 U.

In this case, we evaluate the adequacy of notice prior to the State extinguishing a property owner\xe2\x80\x99s interest in a home.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not think that a person who actually desired to inform a real property owner of an impending tax sale of a house he owns would do nothing when a certified letter sent to the owner is returned unclaimed.  If the Commissioner prepared a stack of letters to mail to delinquent taxpayers, handed them to the postman, and then watched as the departing postman accidentally dropped the letters down a storm drain, one would certainly expect the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s office to prepare a new stack of letters and send them again.  No one \xe2\x80\x9cdesirous of actually informing\xe2\x80\x9d the owners would simply shrug his shoulders as the letters disappeared and say \xe2\x80\x9cI tried.\xe2\x80\x9d  Failure to follow up would be unreasonable, despite the fact that the letters were reasonably calculated to reach their intended recipients when delivered to the postman.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the same token, when a letter is returned by the post office, the sender will ordinarily attempt to resend it, if it is practicable to do so.  See <em>Small </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 136 F.\xc2\xa03d 1334, 1337 (CADC 1998).  This is especially true when, as here, the subject matter of the letter concerns such an important and irreversible prospect as the loss of a house.  Although the State may have made a reasonable calculation of how to reach Jones, it had good reason to suspect when the notice was returned that Jones was \xe2\x80\x9cno better off than if the notice had never been sent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Malone</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 37.  Deciding to take no further action is not what someone \xe2\x80\x9cdesirous of actually informing\xe2\x80\x9d Jones would do; such a person would take further reasonable steps if any were available.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In prior cases, we have required the government to consider unique information about an intended recipient regardless of whether a statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide notice in the ordinary case.  In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Hanrahan,</em> we held that notice of forfeiture proceedings sent to a vehicle owner\xe2\x80\x99s home address was inadequate when the State knew that the property owner was in prison.  409 U. S., at 40.  In <em>Covey</em> v. <em>Town of Somers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/351/141/index.html">351 U. S. 141</a> (1956), we held that notice of foreclosure by mailing, posting, and publication was inadequate when town officials knew that the property owner was incompetent and without a guardian\xe2\x80\x99s protection.  <em>Id.</em>, at 146\xe2\x80\x93147.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commissioner points out that in these cases, the State was aware of such information <em>before </em>it calculated how best to provide notice.  But it is difficult to explain why due process would have settled for something less if the government had learned after notice was sent, but before the taking occurred, that the property owner was in prison or was incompetent.  Under <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Covey</em>, the government\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge that notice pursuant to the normal procedure was ineffective triggered an obligation on the government\xe2\x80\x99s part to take additional steps to effect notice.  That knowledge was one of the \xe2\x80\x9cpracticalities and peculiarities of the case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mullane</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 314\xe2\x80\x93315, that the Court took into account in determining whether constitutional requirements were met.  It should similarly be taken into account in assessing the adequacy of notice in this case.  The dissent dismisses the State\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge that its notice was ineffective as \xe2\x80\x9clearned long after the fact,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa05 (opinion of Thomas, J.), but the notice letter was promptly returned to the State two to three weeks after it was sent, and the Arkansas statutory regime precludes the State from taking the property for two <em>years</em> while the property owner may exercise his right to redeem, see Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x93301 (Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is certainly true, as the Commissioner and Solicitor General contend, that the failure of notice in a specific case does not establish the inadequacy of the attempted notice; in that sense, the constitutionality of a particular procedure for notice is assessed <em>ex ante</em>, rather than <em>post hoc</em>.  But if a feature of the State\xe2\x80\x99s chosen procedure is that it promptly provides additional information to the government about the effectiveness of notice, it does not contravene the <em>ex ante </em>principle to consider what the government does with that information in assessing the adequacy of the chosen procedure.  After all, the State knew <em>ex ante</em> that it would promptly learn whether its effort to effect notice through certified mail had succeeded.  It would not be inconsistent with the approach the Court has taken in notice cases to ask, with respect to a procedure under which telephone calls were placed to owners, what the State did when no one answered.  Asking what the State does when a notice letter is returned unclaimed is not substantively different.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commissioner has three further arguments for why reasonable followup measures were not required in this case.  First, notice was sent to an address that Jones provided and had a legal obligation to keep updated.  See Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9335\xe2\x80\x93705 (1997).  Second, \xe2\x80\x9cafter failing to receive a property tax bill and pay property taxes, a property holder is on inquiry-notice that his property is subject to governmental taking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Commissioner 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Third, Jones was obliged to ensure that those in whose hands he left his property would alert him if it was in jeopardy.  None of these contentions relieves the State of its constitutional obligation to provide adequate notice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commissioner does not argue that Jones\xe2\x80\x99 failure to comply with a statutory obligation to keep his address updated forfeits his right to constitutionally sufficient notice, and we agree.  <em>Id.</em>, at 19; see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16, n.\xc2\xa05 (quoting <em>Mennonite</em>, 462 U. S., at 799 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[A] party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to take steps to safeguard its own interests does not relieve the State of its constitutional obligation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d)).  In <em>Robinson</em>, we noted that Illinois law required each vehicle owner to register his address with the secretary of state, and that the State\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle forfeiture scheme provided for notice by mail to the address listed in the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s records.  See 409 U. S., at 38, n.\xc2\xa01 (citing Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 95<font super="1">1<font super="-1">2, \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x93405 (1971), and ch. 38, \xc2\xa736\xe2\x80\x931 (1969)).  But we found that the State had not provided constitutionally sufficient notice, despite having followed its reasonably calculated scheme, because it knew that Robinson could not be reached at his address of record.  409 U. S., at 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  Although Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9335\xe2\x80\x93705 provides strong support for the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that mailing a certified letter to Jones at 717 North Bryan Street was reasonably calculated to reach him, it does not alter the reasonableness of the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s position that he must do nothing more when the notice is promptly returned \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed.\xe2\x80\x9d</font></font></p><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry notice argument, the common knowledge that property may become subject to government taking when taxes are not paid does not excuse the government from complying with its constitutional obligation of notice before taking private property.  We have previously stated the opposite: An interested party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge of delinquency in the payment of taxes is not equivalent to notice that a tax sale is pending.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mennonite</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 800.  It is at least as widely known that arrestees have the right to remain silent, and that anything they say may be used against them, see <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 443 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Miranda </em>[v. <em>Arizona, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966),] has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture\xe2\x80\x9d), but that knowledge does not excuse a police failure to provide <em>Miranda </em>warnings.  Arkansas affords even a delinquent taxpayer the right to settle accounts with the State and redeem his property, so Jones\xe2\x80\x99 failure to pay his taxes in a timely manner cannot by itself excuse inadequate notice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Commissioner reminds us of a statement from <em>Mullane </em>that the State can assume an owner leaves his property in the hands of one who will inform him if his interest is in jeopardy.  339 U. S., at 316.  But in this passage, Justice Jackson writes of \xe2\x80\x9clibel of a ship, attachment of a chattel[,] or entry upon real estate in the name of law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94such \xe2\x80\x9cseiz[ures]\xe2\x80\x9d of property, he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cmay reasonably be expected to come promptly to the owner\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  An occupant, however, is not charged with acting as the owner\xe2\x80\x99s agent in all respects, and it is quite a leap from Justice Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s examples to conclude that it is an obligation of tenancy to follow up with certified mail of unknown content addressed to the owner.  In fact, the State makes it impossible for the occupant to learn why the Commissioner is writing the owner, because an occupant cannot call for a certified letter without first obtaining the owner\xe2\x80\x99s signature.  For all the occupant knows, the Commissioner of State Lands might write to certain residents about a variety of matters he finds important, such as state parks or highway construction; it would by no means be obvious to an occupant observing a certified mail slip from the Commissioner that the owner is in danger of losing his property.  In any event, there is no record evidence that notices of attempted delivery were left at 717 North Bryan Street.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mr. Jones should have been more diligent with respect to his property, no question.  People must pay their taxes, and the government may hold citizens accountable for tax delinquency by taking their property.  But before forcing a citizen to satisfy his debt by forfeiting his property, due process requires the government to provide adequate notice of the impending taking.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; <em>Mennonite</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 799.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to the returned form suggesting that Jones had not received notice that he was about to lose his property, the State did\xe2\x80\x94nothing.  For the reasons stated, we conclude the State should have taken additional reasonable steps to notify Jones, if practicable to do so.  The question remains whether there were any such available steps.  While \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not our responsibility to prescribe the form of service that the [government] should adopt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Greene,</em> 456 U. S., at 455, n.\xc2\xa09, if there were no reasonable additional steps the government could have taken upon return of the unclaimed notice letter, it cannot be faulted for doing nothing.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think there were several reasonable steps the State could have taken.  What steps are reasonable in response to new information depends upon what the new information reveals.  The return of the certified letter marked \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed\xe2\x80\x9d meant either that Jones still lived at 717 North Bryan Street, but was not home when the postman called and did not retrieve the letter at the post office, or that Jones no longer resided at that address.  One reasonable step primarily addressed to the former possibility would be for the State to resend the notice by regular mail, so that a signature was not required.  The Commissioner says that use of certified mail makes actual notice more likely, because requiring the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s signature protects against misdelivery.  But that is only true, of course, when someone is home to sign for the letter, or to inform the mail carrier that he has arrived at the wrong address.  Otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ertified mail is dispatched and handled in transit as ordinary mail,\xe2\x80\x9d United States Postal Service, Domestic<em> </em>Mail Manual \xc2\xa7503.3.2.1 (Mar. 16, 2006), and the use of certified mail might make actual notice less likely in some cases\xe2\x80\x94the letter cannot be left like regular mail to be examined at the end of the day, and it can only be retrieved from the post office for a specified period of time.  Following up with regular mail might also increase the chances of actual notice to Jones if\xe2\x80\x94as it turned out\xe2\x80\x94he had moved.  Even occupants who ignored certified mail notice slips addressed to the owner (if any had been left) might scrawl the owner\xe2\x80\x99s new address on the notice packet and leave it for the postman to retrieve, or notify Jones directly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other reasonable followup measures, directed at the possibility that Jones had moved as well as that he had simply not retrieved the certified letter, would have been to post notice on the front door, or to address otherwise undeliverable mail to \xe2\x80\x9coccupant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Most States that explicitly outline additional procedures in their tax sale statutes require just such steps.  See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.  Either approach would increase the likelihood that the owner would be notified that he was about to lose his property, given the failure of a letter deliverable only to the owner in person.  That is clear in the case of an owner who still resided at the premises.  It is also true in the case of an owner who has moved: Occupants who might disregard a certified mail slip not addressed to them are less likely to ignore posted notice, and a letter addressed to them (even as \xe2\x80\x9coccupant\xe2\x80\x9d) might be opened and read.  In either case, there is a significant chance the occupants will alert the owner, if only because a change in ownership could well affect their own occupancy.  In fact, Jones first learned of the State\xe2\x80\x99s effort to sell his house when he was alerted by one of the occupants\xe2\x80\x94his daughter\xe2\x80\x94after she was served with an unlawful detainer notice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jones believes that the Commissioner should have searched for his new address in the Little Rock phonebook and other government records such as income tax rolls.  We do not believe the government was required to go this far.  As the Commissioner points out, the return of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 mail marked \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed\xe2\x80\x9d did not necessarily mean that 717 North Bryan Street was an incorrect address; it merely informed the Commissioner that no one appeared to sign for the mail before the designated date on which it would be returned to the sender.  An open-ended search for a new address\xe2\x80\x94especially when the State obligates the taxpayer to keep his address updated with the tax collector, see Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9335\xe2\x80\x93705 (1997)\xe2\x80\x94imposes burdens on the State significantly greater than the several relatively easy options outlined above.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commissioner complains about the burden of even those additional steps, but his argument is belied by Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 current requirement that notice to homestead owners be accomplished by personal service if certified mail is returned, \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x93301(e) (Supp. 2005), and the fact that Arkansas transfers the cost of notice to the taxpayer or the tax sale purchaser, \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x93104(a).  The Commissioner has offered no estimate of how many notice letters are returned, and no facts to support the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the Commissioner must now physically locate \xe2\x80\x9ctens of thousands of properties every year.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 10.  Citing our decision in <em>Greene</em> v. <em>Lindsey,</em> the Solicitor General adds that posted notice could be taken down by children or vandals.  But in <em>Greene</em>, we noted that outside the specific facts of that case, posting notice on real property is \xe2\x80\x9ca singularly appropriate and effective way of ensuring that a person \xe2\x80\xa6 is actually apprised of proceedings against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  456 U. S., at 452\xe2\x80\x93453.  Successfully providing notice is often the most efficient way to collect unpaid taxes, see <em>Mennonite</em>, 462 U. S., at 800, n.\xc2\xa05 (more effective notice may ease burden on State if recipient arranges to pay delinquent taxes prior to tax sale); Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (85 percent of tax delinquent properties in Arkansas are redeemed upon notice of delinquency), but rather than taking relatively easy additional steps to effect notice, the State undertook the burden and expense of purchasing a newspaper advertisement, conducting an auction, and then negotiating a private sale of the property to Flowers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General argues that requiring further effort when the government learns that notice was not delivered will cause the government to favor modes of providing notice that do not generate additional information\xe2\x80\x94for example, starting (and stopping) with regular mail instead of certified mail.  We find this unlikely, as we have no doubt that the government repeatedly finds itself being asked to prove that notice was sent and received.  Using certified mail provides the State with documentation of personal delivery and protection against false claims that notice was never received.  That added security, however, comes at a price\xe2\x80\x94the State also learns when notice has <em>not </em>been received.  We conclude that, under the circumstances presented, the State cannot simply ignore that information in proceeding to take and sell the owner\xe2\x80\x99s property\xe2\x80\x94any more than it could ignore the information that the owner in <em>Robinson</em> was in jail, or that the owner in <em>Covey </em>was incompetent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the Commissioner argues that followup measures are not constitutionally required, he reminds us that the State did make some attempt to follow up with Jones by publishing notice in the newspaper a few weeks before the public sale.  Several decades ago, this Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]hance alone\xe2\x80\x9d brings a person\xe2\x80\x99s attention to \xe2\x80\x9can advertisement in small type inserted in the back pages of a newspaper,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mullane</em>, 339 U. S., at 315, and that notice by publication is adequate only where \xe2\x80\x9cit is not reasonably possible or practicable to give more adequate warning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 317.  Following up by publication was not constitutionally adequate under the circumstances presented here because, as we have explained, it was possible and practicable to give Jones more adequate warning of the impending tax sale.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent forcefully articulates some basic principles about constitutionally required notice, principles from which we have no intention to depart.  In particular, we disclaim any \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to <em>Dusenbery </em>and a significant departure from <em>Mullane</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6.  In <em>Dusenbery</em>, the Government was aware that someone at the prison had signed for the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s notice letter, and we determined that this attempt at notice was adequate, despite the fact that the State could have made notice more likely by requiring the prisoner to sign for the letter himself.  534 U. S., at 171.  In this case, of course, the notice letter was returned to the Commissioner, informing him that his attempt at notice had failed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for <em>Mullane</em>, it directs that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen notice is a person\xe2\x80\x99s due \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 U. S., at 315.  Mindful of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s concerns, we conclude, at the end of the day, that someone who actually wanted to alert Jones that he was in danger of losing his house would do more when the attempted notice letter was returned unclaimed, and there was more that reasonably could be done.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not our responsibility to prescribe the form of service that the [government] should adopt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Greene</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 455, n.\xc2\xa09.  In prior cases finding notice inadequate, we have not attempted to redraft the State\xe2\x80\x99s notice statute.  See, <em>e.g., Tulsa Professional</em>,<em> </em>485 U. S., at 490\xe2\x80\x93491; <em>Robinson</em>, 409 U. S., at 40; <em>Schroeder</em> v. <em>City of New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/208/index.html">371 U.

The State can determine how to proceed in response to our conclusion that notice was inadequate here, and the States have taken a variety of approaches to the present question.  See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.  It suffices for present purposes that we are confident that additional reasonable steps were available for Arkansas to employ before taking Jones\xe2\x80\x99 property.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no reason to suppose that the State will ever be less than fully zealous in its efforts to secure the tax revenue it needs.  The same cannot be said for the State\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to ensure that its citizens receive proper notice before the State takes action against them.  In this case, the State is exerting extraordinary power against a property owner\xe2\x80\x94taking and selling a house he owns.

After petitioner failed to respond, the State also published notice of the delinquency and public sale in an Arkansas newspaper.  Soon after respondent Linda K. Flowers submitted a purchase offer to the State, it sent petitioner a second letter by certified mail explaining that the sale would proceed if the delinquent taxes and penalties were not paid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that the State violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, in his view, the State failed to take sufficient steps to contact him before selling his property to Flowers.  Petitioner contends that once the State became aware that he had not claimed the certified mail, it was constitutionally obligated to employ additional methods to locate him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adopting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, the Court holds today that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, the State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  The Court concludes that it was practicable for Arkansas to take additional steps here\xe2\x80\x94namely, notice by regular mail, posting notice on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s door, and addressing mail to \xe2\x80\x9coccupant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.

Balancing a State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in efficiently managing its administrative system and an individual\xe2\x80\x99s interest in adequate notice, this Court has held that a State must provide \xe2\x80\x9cnotice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 313\xe2\x80\x93314.  As this Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen notice is a person\xe2\x80\x99s due \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 315.  \xe2\x80\x9c[H]eroic efforts,\xe2\x80\x9d however, are not required.  <em>Dusenbery</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/161/index.html">534 U.

Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cnone of our cases \xe2\x80\xa6 has required actual notice\xe2\x80\x9d; instead, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have allowed the Government to defend the \xe2\x80\x98reasonableness and hence the constitutional validity of any chosen method \xe2\x80\xa6 on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dusenbery,</em> <em>supra, </em>at 169\xe2\x80\x93170 (quoting <em>Mullane</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 315).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The methods of notice employed by Arkansas were reasonably calculated to inform petitioner of proceedings affecting his property interest and thus satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause.  The State mailed a notice by certified letter to the address provided by petitioner.  The certified letter was returned to the State marked \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed\xe2\x80\x9d after three attempts to deliver it.  The State then published a notice of public sale containing redemption information in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette newspaper.  After Flowers submitted a purchase offer, the State sent yet another certified letter to petitioner at his record address.  That letter, too, was returned to the State marked \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed\xe2\x80\x9d after three delivery attempts.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to contact petitioner by certified mail at his \xe2\x80\x9crecord address,\xe2\x80\x9d without more, satisfy due process.  <em>Dusenbery, supra</em>, at 169.  See also <em>Mullane, supra</em>, at 318; <em>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pope,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/478/index.html">485 U. S. 478</a>, 490 (1988) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have repeatedly recognized that mail service is an inexpensive and efficient mechanism that is reasonably calculated to provide actual notice\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions</em> v. <em>Adams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/791/index.html">462 U.

Because the notices were sent to the address provided by petitioner himself, the State had an especially sound basis for determining that notice would reach him.  Moreover, Arkansas exceeded the constitutional minimum by additionally publishing notice in a local newspaper.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See <em>Mullane</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 318.  Due process requires nothing more\xe2\x80\x94and certainly not here, where petitioner had a statutory duty to pay his taxes and to report any change of address to the state taxing authority.  See Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x9335\xe2\x80\x93705 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My conclusion that Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 notice methods satisfy due process is reinforced by the well-established presumption that individuals, especially those owning property, act in their own interest.  Recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]t is the part of common prudence for all those who have any interest in [a thing], to guard that interest by persons who are in a situation to protect it,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mullane</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 316 (quoting <em>The Mary</em>, 9 Cranch 126, 144<em> </em>(1815)), this Court has concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ways of an owner with tangible property are such that he usually arranges means to learn of any direct attack upon his possessory or proprietary rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mullane</em>, 339 U. S., at 316.  Consistent with this observation, Arkansas was free to \xe2\x80\x9cindulge the assumption\xe2\x80\x9d that petitioner had either provided the State taxing authority with a correct and up-to-date mailing address\xe2\x80\x94as required by state law\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cor that he \xe2\x80\xa6 left some caretaker under a duty to let him know that [his property was] being jeopardized.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not conclude that certified mail is inherently insufficient as a means of notice, but rather that \xe2\x80\x9cthe government\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge that notice pursuant to the normal procedure was ineffective triggered an obligation on the government\xe2\x80\x99s part to take additional steps to effect notice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  I disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, whether a method of notice is reasonably calculated to notify the interested party is determined <em>ex ante, i.e.,</em> from the viewpoint of the government agency at the time its notice is sent.  This follows from <em>Mullane</em>, where this Court rested its analysis on the information the sender had \xe2\x80\x9cat hand\xe2\x80\x9d when its notice was sent.  339 U. S., at 318.  Relatedly, we have refused to evaluate the reasonableness of a particular method of notice by comparing it to alternative methods that are identified after the fact.  See <em>Dusenbery</em>, 534 U. S., at 171\xe2\x80\x93172.  Today the Court appears to abandon both of these practices.  Its rejection of Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 selected method of notice\xe2\x80\x94a method this Court has repeatedly concluded is constitutionally sufficient\xe2\x80\x94is based upon information that was unavailable when notice was sent.  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s proposed notice methods\xe2\x80\x94regular mail, posting and addressing mail to \xe2\x80\x9coccupant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x94are entirely the product of <em>post hoc</em> considerations, including the discovery that members of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s family continued to live in the house.  Similarly, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s observation that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Commissioner[\xe2\x80\x99s] complain[t] about the burden of \xe2\x80\xa6 additional steps \xe2\x80\xa6 is belied by Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 current requirement that notice to homestead-owners be accomplished by personal service if certified mail is returned,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, is contrary to <em>Dusenbery</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion that the Government ought not be penalized and told to \xe2\x80\x98try harder\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 simply because [it] has since upgraded its policies,\xe2\x80\x9d  534 U. S., at 172 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, implicit in our holding that due process does not require \xe2\x80\x9cactual notice,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>id.,</em> at 169\xe2\x80\x93170, is that when the \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment becomes aware \xe2\x80\xa6 that its attempt at notice has failed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 5, it is not required to take additional steps to ensure that notice has been received.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 notice methods, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of it, is little more than a thinly veiled attack on <em>Dusenbery.</em>  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s logic, each time a doubt is raised with respect to whether notice has reached an interested party, the State will have to consider additional means better calculated to achieve notice.  Because this rule turns on speculative, newly acquired information, it has no natural end point, and, in effect, requires the States to achieve something close to actual notice.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s new rule is contrary to <em>Dusenbery</em> and a significant departure from <em>Mullane</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only circumstances in which this Court has found notice by mail and publication inadequate under the Due Process Clause involve situations where the state or local government knew at the outset that its notice efforts were destined to fail and knew how to rectify the problem prior to sending notice.  See <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Hanrahan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/38/index.html">409 U. S. 38</a>, 39 (1972) <em>(per curiam) </em>(intended recipient known to be in jail)<em>;</em> <em>Covey</em> v. <em>Town of Somers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/351/141/index.html">351 U. S. 141</a>, 145 (1956) (intended recipient known to be incompetent and without a guardian).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Robinson</em>, the State, having arrested petitioner and detained him in county jail, immediately instituted forfeiture proceedings against his automobile and mailed notice of those proceedings to his residential address.  409 U. S., at 38.  Robinson, who was incarcerated in the county jail during the entirety of the forfeiture proceedings, did not receive notice of the proceedings until after he was released and the forfeiture order had been entered.  <em>Id.</em>, at 38\xe2\x80\x9339.  Because the State knew beforehand<em> </em>that Robinson was not at, and had no access to, the address to which it sent the notice, this Court held that the State\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were not \xe2\x80\x9creasonably calculated\xe2\x80\x9d to notify him of the pending proceedings.  <em>Id.,</em> at 40.  Similarly, in <em>Covey</em>, the Court concluded that the methods of notice used by the town\xe2\x80\x94mailing, posting, and publishing\xe2\x80\x94were not reasonably calculated to inform Covey of proceedings adverse to her property interests because local officials knew prior to sending notice that she was \xe2\x80\x9cwithout mental capacity to handle her affairs\xe2\x80\x9d and unable to comprehend the meaning of the notices.  351 U. S., at 144, 146.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, Arkansas did not know at the time it sent notice to petitioner that its method would fail; and Arkansas did not know that petitioner no longer lived at the record address simply because letters were returned \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. 3.  \xe2\x80\x9c[U]nclaimed\xe2\x80\x9d does not necessarily mean that an address is no longer correct; it may indicate that an intended recipient has simply failed or refused to claim mail.  See United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM), \xc2\xa7507, Exh. 1.4.1, http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/507.htm.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Given that the State had been using the address provided by petitioner and that petitioner had a legal duty to maintain a current mailing address with the state taxing authority, return of the mail as \xe2\x80\x9cunclaimed\xe2\x80\x9d did not arm Arkansas with the type of specific knowledge that the governments had at hand in<em> Robinson </em>and <em>Covey</em>.  Cf. <em>ante,</em> at 13.  The State cannot be charged to correct a problem of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s own creation and of which it was not aware.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Even if the State had divined that petitioner was no longer at the record address, its publication of notice in a local newspaper would have sufficed because <em>Mullane</em> authorizes the use of publication when the record address is unknown.  See 339 U. S., at 316 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]ublication traditionally has been acceptable as notification supplemental to other action which in itself may reasonably be expected to convey a warning\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s proposed methods, aside from being constitutionally unnecessary, are also burdensome, impractical, and no more likely to effect notice than the methods actually employed by the State.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Arkansas, approximately 18,000 parcels of delinquent real estate are certified annually.  <em>Tsann Kuen Enterprises Co. </em>v.<em> Campbell</em>, 335 Ark. 110, 119\xe2\x80\x93120, 129 S. W. 3d 822, 828 (2003).  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule, the State will bear the burden of locating thousands of delinquent property owners.  These administrative burdens are not compelled by the Due Process Clause.  See <em>Mullane, supra</em>, at 313\xe2\x80\x93314; <em>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.,</em> 485 U. S., at 489\xe2\x80\x93490 (stating that constitutionally sufficient notice \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be inefficient or burdensome\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, Arkansas has determined that its law requiring property owners to maintain a current address with the state taxing authority, in conjunction with its authorization to send property notices to the record address, is an efficient and fair way to administer its tax collection system.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today forecloses such a reasonable system and burdens the State with inefficiencies caused by delinquent taxpayers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s proposed methods are no more reasonably calculated to achieve notice than the methods employed by the State here.  Regular mail is hardly foolproof; indeed, it is arguably less effective than certified mail.  Certified mail is tracked, delivery attempts are recorded, actual delivery is logged, and notices are posted to alert someone at the residence that certified mail is being held at a local post office.  By creating a record, these features give parties grounds for defending or challenging notice.  By contrast, regular mail is untraceable; there is no record of either delivery or receipt.  Had the State used regular mail, petitioner would presumably argue that it should have sent notice by certified mail because it creates a paper trail.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court itself recognizes the deficiencies of its proposed methods.  It acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ollowing up with regular mail <em>might </em>\xe2\x80\xa6 increase the chances of actual notice\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9coccupants who ignored certified mail notice slips \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>might</em> scrawl the owner\xe2\x80\x99s new address on the notice packet,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12; and \xe2\x80\x9ca letter addressed to [occupant] <em>might</em> be opened and read,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14 (emphasis added).  Nevertheless, the Court justifies its redrafting of Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 notice statute on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[its] approach[es] would increase the likelihood that the owner would be notified that he was about to lose his property\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  That, however, is not the test; indeed, we rejected such reasoning in <em>Dusenbery</em>.  See 534 U. S., at 171 (rejecting the argument that \xe2\x80\x9cthe FBI\xe2\x80\x99s notice was constitutionally flawed because it was \xe2\x80\x98substantially less likely to bring home notice\xe2\x80\x99 than a feasible substitute\xe2\x80\x9d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Arkansas post notice is similarly unavailing.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s records are organized by legal description, not address, which makes the prospect of physically locating tens of thousands of properties every year, and posting notice on each, impractical.  See <em>Tsann Kuen Enterprises Co.</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 119\xe2\x80\x93120, 129 S. W. 3d, at 828.  Also, this Court has previously concluded that posting is an inherently unreliable method of notice.  See G<em>reene </em>v.<em> Lindsey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/444/index.html">456 U.

It is sheer speculation to assume, as the Court does, that although \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ccupants . . . might disregard a certified mail slip \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, a letter addressed to them (even as \xe2\x80\x98occupant\xe2\x80\x99) might be opened and read.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  It is at least as likely that an occupant who receives generically addressed mail will discard it as junk mail.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If \xe2\x80\x9ctitle to property should not depend on [factual] vagaries,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dusenberry</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 171, then certainly it cannot turn on \xe2\x80\x9cwrinkle[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5, caused by a property owner\xe2\x80\x99s own failure to be a prudent ward of his interests.  The meaning of the Constitution should not turn on the antics of tax evaders and scofflaws.  Nor is the self-created conundrum in which petitioner finds himself a legitimate ground for imposing additional constitutional obligations on the State.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to notify petitioner by certified mail at the address that he provided and, additionally, by publishing notice in a local newspaper satisfy due process.  Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Though the Court posits that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no record evidence that notices of attempted delivery were left at 717 North Bryan Street,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12, the postal carrier was required to leave notice at the address at each delivery attempt indicating that delivery of certified mail had been attempted and that the mail could be retrieved at the local post office.
