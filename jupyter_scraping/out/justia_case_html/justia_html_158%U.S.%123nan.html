Beardsley, without leave, filed a supplemental bill making the St. Louis, Iron Mountain, and Southern Railway Company a party with the original defendants, J. D. Beardsley and the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Company.  A motion to strike this bill from the files was made, and a demurrer and motion to dismiss filed, but the supplemental bill was retained, an amendment allowed to it making Jay Gould a party, the demurrer overruled, the bill taken as confessed by the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Company, issues made up on the answers of J. D. Beardsley, the St. Louis Company, and Gould, evidence taken, and the case went to final decree before Caldwell, J., May 9, 1891.</p>\n<p>It was thereby decreed that defendant J. D.

S. 125</a></p><p> a proper deed of conveyance thereof.  Certain exceptions to a master\'s report were sustained, and the court ordered that in all other respects the report be confirmed, and adjudged and decreed that the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Company have and recover of J. D. Beardsley the sum of $21,072.16, with interest from August 5, 1889, and further that it appearing to the court that since the rendition of the decree on the original bill, the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Company had issued and delivered to defendant J.

L. Hopkins, as trustee, in pledge for the use and benefit of Gould, which delivery and pledge were in violation of the rights of complainant as adjudged in the original decree, upon the payment by complainant of the amount adjudged on the original bill to be due J. D. Beardsley, either to said J. D. Beardsley or his solicitor, the said J. D. Beardsley and Gould deliver and cause their trustee to deliver to complainant or to his solicitor of record, or into the registry of the court, certificates for seventeen hundred shares of the stock of the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Company, of the face value of $100 each, of the stock so held by said trustee.  It was further ordered and decreed that upon the payment by the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Company of its debt to the defendant St. Louis, Iron Mountain, and Southern Railway Company, for which certain of the bonds of the Arkansas Company were held in pledge, and upon payment by complainant of his indebtedness to defendant J.

CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This appeal was perfected as to the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Company only by the giving of bond as required by statute.  Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1000, 1012.  And while the omission of the bond does not necessarily avoid an appeal, if otherwise properly taken, and in proper cases this Court may permit the bond to be supplied, no application for such relief has been made in this case, nor could it properly be accorded after the lapse of nearly four years since the decree.  The appeal might therefore well be dismissed because ineffectual as to complainant Paul F. Beardsley.</p>\n<p>But this must be the result on another ground.  To the decree Paul F. Beardsley was party complainant, and John D. Beardsley, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain, and Southern Railway Company, Jay Gould, and the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Company were parties defendant.</p>\n<p>It is settled, for reasons too obvious to need repetition, that in equity causes, all parties against whom a joint decree is rendered must join in an appeal, if any be taken; but this appeal was taken by John D. Beardsley alone, and there is nothing in the record to show that his codefendants were applied to and refused to appeal, nor was any order entered by the Court, on notice, granting a separate appeal to John D. Beardsley in respect of his own interest.  The appeal cannot be sustained.  <em>Hardee v. Wilson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/146/179/case.html">146 U.
