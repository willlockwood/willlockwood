F. Melsing et al. v. John I.

That he duly qualified as such receiver and took possession of and operated said mine and was engaged in operating the same continuously from the time of his appointment down to and including the 14th day of September, 1900.  That, on the 29th of August, 1900, an appeal from said order, so appointing him receiver, was allowed by the Hon. W. W.

Tornanses,</em> the parties claiming under Tornanses moved the district court to vacate the order of July 23, supporting the motion by Tornanses\' notice of location of his claim, by his deed of conveyance, and by numerous affidavits in respect of action thereunder.  The district judge on August 10 entered an order denying the motion made to vacate the order granting the injunction and appointing the receiver, and on August 14 defendants applied to the district judge for an order allowing an appeal from the order granting the injunction and appointing the receiver, the proper bond on appeal being at the same time presented to the judge, together with an assignment of errors and a proposed bill of exceptions for settlement and allowance, in response to which the district judge, on August 15, made an order</p>\n<p>"that said proposed bill of exceptions is in each and every part thereof disallowed as a bill of exceptions herein, and the settlement thereof, or of any proposed bill of exceptions herein, is hereby refused; that said petition for an order allowing said appeal is hereby denied, and said judge declines to accept or fix the amount of any bond for costs thereof or allow a supersedeas bond to be given, or fix the amount thereof."</p>\n<p>On the same day, to-wit, August 15, 1900, the judge made and entered the following order:</p>\n<p>"It is further ordered that, in addition to the powers and authorities already granted the receiver appointed, the said receiver is hereby ordered to take possession of the placer claim mentioned in the complaint herein, and all sluice boxes, dams, excavations, machinery, pipe, boarding houses, tents, buildings, safes, scales, and all other personal property fixed or movable on the said placer claim; also all gold, gold dust, precious metals, money, books of account, and each and all personal property </p><p><a class="page-number" name="545">Page 180 U.

Certified copies of the order allowing the appeal in each case, together with certified copies of the assignments of error and of the bond, were with the original writ of supersedeas and the original citation in each case filed in the lower court on the 14th of September, 1900, and copies thereof served at once upon the receiver McKenzie and a demand made upon him for restitution of the property in accordance with the writs.</p>\n<p>The circuit court of appeals, from the evidence taken on the hearing of the proceedings in contempt, found the fact to be</p>\n<p>"that the respondent McKenzie thereupon refused and continued to refuse to restore, in accordance with the requirements of the writs of supersedeas, the gold, gold dust, and other personal property received by him under the orders of the trial court, and that fact being made to appear to this court by affidavits on the 1st day of October, 1900, and it further being made to appear to this court that the last steamer for the season </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 180 U. S. 546</a></p><p> would leave the City of Seattle for Nome within a few days, and that no further communication could be had with that section of the country until the spring or early summer of 1901, this court thereupon made an order directing its marshal to proceed to Nome, enforce its writs of supersedeas, arrest the offending receiver, and produce him at the bar of this court.  The evidence taken upon the hearing of these proceedings is also to the effect, and we so find the fact to be, that the receiver McKenzie at all times had it within his power to comply with the requirements of the writs of supersedeas issued out of this court; that he contumaciously refused to restore the gold, gold dust, and other personal property to the defendants, as required by those writs, and has continued such refusal ever since."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1919401">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>In re Alexander McKenzie, 180 U.S.  536 (1901)</h3><p><b>In re Alexander McKenzie</b></p><p><b>No. ___ Original</b></p><p><b>Submitted February 26, 1901</b></p><p><b>Decided March 25, 1901</b></p><p><b>180 U.S. 536</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em>ORIGINAL\n</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The writ of habeas corpus cannot be made use of as a writ of error, and when applied for to relieve from restraint in punishment for contempt in the violation of orders of court, will not be issued unless the orders violated are absolutely void.</p>\n<p>Orders of the District Court of Alaska, Second Division, appointing a receiver and granting an injunction are appealable to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and on refusal of the district court to do so, the court of appeals may allow such appeals with supersedeas, and grant writs of supersedeas, if considered necessary.</p>\n<p>If a judge of the court of appeals allows such appeals and supersedeas, and directs the issue of writs of supersedeas, ordering, among other things, the restoration of the property taken possession of by the receiver, orders of the court of appeals approving of his action in doing so, and of the writs so issued, are not void.</p>\n<p>Where appeals are granted and the original citation and writ of supersedeas together with certified copies of the assignments of error and of the supersedeas </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 180 U.

Monckton"</p>\n<p>"<em>Clerk of the United States Circuit Court of</em>"</p>\n<p>"<em>Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</em>"</p>\n<p>From the records and exhibits attached to the petition, it appeared that, on July 24, in the case of <em>Melsing v. Tornanses,</em> the parties claiming under Tornanses moved the district court to vacate the order of July 23, supporting the motion by Tornanses\' notice of location of his claim, by his deed of conveyance, and by numerous affidavits in respect of action thereunder.  The district judge on August 10 entered an order denying the motion made to vacate the order granting the injunction and appointing the receiver, and on August 14 defendants applied to the district judge for an order allowing an appeal from the order granting the injunction and appointing the receiver, the proper bond on appeal being at the same time presented to the judge, together with an assignment of errors and a proposed bill of exceptions for settlement and allowance, in response to which the district judge, on August 15, made an order</p>\n<p>"that said proposed bill of exceptions is in each and every part thereof disallowed as a bill of exceptions herein, and the settlement thereof, or of any proposed bill of exceptions herein, is hereby refused; that said petition for an order allowing said appeal is hereby denied, and said judge declines to accept or fix the amount of any bond for costs thereof or allow a supersedeas bond to be given, or fix the amount thereof."</p>\n<p>On the same day, to-wit, August 15, 1900, the judge made and entered the following order:</p>\n<p>"It is further ordered that, in addition to the powers and authorities already granted the receiver appointed, the said receiver is hereby ordered to take possession of the placer claim mentioned in the complaint herein, and all sluice boxes, dams, excavations, machinery, pipe, boarding houses, tents, buildings, safes, scales, and all other personal property fixed or movable on the said placer claim; also all gold, gold dust, precious metals, money, books of account, and each and all personal property </p><p><a class="page-number" name="545">Page 180 U. S. 545</a></p><p> upon the said claim connected therewith, and in any way appertaining thereto, in possession of and under the control of the defendant, his lessees, grantees, assigns, employees, and all and every person in possession of the said claim or claiming any right, title, or interest in and to the said placer claim, or any gold dust therein or any personal property thereon of any nature whatsoever, are hereby ordered to deliver the same to the said receiver, and are hereby restrained from interfering with the said receiver in quiet and peaceable possession of the same, or any agent that the said receiver may designate to take possession thereof."</p>\n<p>"It is further ordered that this order shall revoke all and any order in conflict herewith, and does hereby revoke the same; and"</p>\n<p>"It is further ordered that this order shall remain in full force and effect until further order of this court."</p>\n<p>"It is further ordered that a copy of this order shall be served upon any person in possession of or claiming possession of the property described."</p>\n<p>The allowance of an appeal, the taking of a supersedeas bond, the issue and approval of a writ of supersedeas, in this and another case, followed.  Certified copies of the order allowing the appeal in each case, together with certified copies of the assignments of error and of the bond, were with the original writ of supersedeas and the original citation in each case filed in the lower court on the 14th of September, 1900, and copies thereof served at once upon the receiver McKenzie and a demand made upon him for restitution of the property in accordance with the writs.</p>\n<p>The circuit court of appeals, from the evidence taken on the hearing of the proceedings in contempt, found the fact to be</p>\n<p>"that the respondent McKenzie thereupon refused and continued to refuse to restore, in accordance with the requirements of the writs of supersedeas, the gold, gold dust, and other personal property received by him under the orders of the trial court, and that fact being made to appear to this court by affidavits on the 1st day of October, 1900, and it further being made to appear to this court that the last steamer for the season </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 180 U. S. 546</a></p><p> would leave the City of Seattle for Nome within a few days, and that no further communication could be had with that section of the country until the spring or early summer of 1901, this court thereupon made an order directing its marshal to proceed to Nome, enforce its writs of supersedeas, arrest the offending receiver, and produce him at the bar of this court.  The evidence taken upon the hearing of these proceedings is also to the effect, and we so find the fact to be, that the receiver McKenzie at all times had it within his power to comply with the requirements of the writs of supersedeas issued out of this court; that he contumaciously refused to restore the gold, gold dust, and other personal property to the defendants, as required by those writs, and has continued such refusal ever since."</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The writ of habeas corpus cannot be availed of as a writ of error, and unless the writ or orders for a violation of which petitioner is being punished, in the case referred to in the petition were absolutely void, this application must be denied.  Accordingly, it is contended that there was no legal authority for the issue of the writ of supersedeas, and that the circuit court of appeals had not at the time the writ was issued, nor at any other time, jurisdiction of the appeal in question.</p>\n<p>It is said the appeal was not "taken" until the allowance thereof was filed in the office of the District Court for the District of Alaska.</p>\n<p>In <em>Credit Company v. Arkansas Central Railway Company,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/249/case.html#258">123 U. S. 258</a></span>, a final decree had been entered in the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas dismissing a bill for want of equity on the 22d of January, 1883, and on the 22d of January, 1885, a petition for an appeal was presented to Mr. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 180 U. S. 547</a></p><p> Justice Miller in Washington and allowed, citation signed, and bond approved.  These papers were filed with the clerk of the circuit court, January 27, 1885, being five days after the expiration of two years from the date of the final decree.  It was ruled that an appeal could not be said to be "taken" until it was in some way presented to the court which made the decree appealed from, thereby putting an end to its jurisdiction over the cause and making it its duty to send it to the appellate court.</p>\n<p>In <em>Brandies v. Cochrane,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/105/262/case.html">105 U. S. 262</a></span>, it was decided that, in the absence of a petition and allowance, the filing of the appeal bond, duly approved by a Justice of this Court, was sufficient evidence of the allowance of an appeal, and was a compliance with the law requiring the appeal to be filed in the clerk\'s office.</p>\n<p>In <em>Brown v. McConnell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/124/489/case.html">124 U. S. 489</a></span>, it was held that the signing of a citation returnable to the proper term of this Court, though without the acceptance of security, nevertheless constituted an allowance of appeal which would enable this Court to take jurisdiction and to afford the appellants an opportunity to furnish the requisite security here.</p>\n<p>In these cases, the original citation and the original writ of supersedeas, together with certified copies of the assignment of errors and of the supersedeas bond and of the orders allowing the appeals, were filed in the district court September 14, 1900.  This was held by the circuit court of appeals sufficient to give effect to the appeals, and we concur in that conclusion if treated as open to reexamination here.</p>\n<p>It is also contended that an appeal did not lie from the orders of July 23 and August 10, inasmuch as they were interlocutory orders in respect of the appointment of a receiver.  June 6, 1900, an act was passed "making further provision for the civil government in Alaska and for other purposes," 31 Stat. 321, c. 786, section 504 of which provided:</p>\n<p>"Appeals and writs of error may be taken and prosecuted from the final judgments of the District Court for the District of Alaska or any division thereof direct to the Supreme Court of the United States in the following cases, namely:  . . . and that in all other cases </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 180 U. S. 548</a></p><p> where the amount involved or the value of the subject matter exceeds five hundred dollars, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit shall have jurisdiction to review by writ of error or appeal the final judgments, orders, of the district court."</p>\n<p>Section 507 read as follows:</p>\n<p>"An appeal may be taken to the circuit court of appeals from any interlocutory order granting or dissolving an injunction, refusing to grant or dissolve an injunction, made or rendered in any cause pending before the district court within sixty days after the entry of such interlocutory order.  The proceedings in other respects in the district court in the cause in which such interlocutory order was made shall not be stayed during the pendency of such appeal, unless otherwise ordered by the district court."</p>\n<p>Section 508 provided that</p>\n<p>"all provisions of law now in force regulating the procedure and practice in cases brought by appeal or writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States or to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, except insofar as the same may be inconsistent with any provision of this act, shall regulate the procedure and practice in cases brought to the courts, respectively, from the District Court for the District of Alaska."</p>\n<p>Section 7 of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891, as amended by the act of February 18, 1895, 28 Stat. 666, c. 96, provided that, where upon a hearing in equity in a district court or a circuit court, an injunction should be granted, continued, refused, or dissolved by an interlocutory order or decree, or an application to dissolve an injunction should be refused, an appeal might be taken from such interlocutory order or decree to the circuit court of appeals within thirty days from the entry of such order or decree,</p>\n<p>"and the proceedings in other respects in the court below shall not be stayed unless otherwise ordered by that court during the pendency of such appeal."</p>\n<p>On June 6, 1900, the section was further amended so as to allow such appeals from orders appointing a receiver.  31 Stat. 660, c. 803.  Reading these acts <em>in pari materia,</em> as we should, it may well be concluded that appeals were thereby authorized from the District Court of Alaska from interlocutory orders appointing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 180 U. S. 549</a></p><p> receivers, and that such appeals might be prosecuted from that court within sixty days from the entry of such orders.  Moreover, the order of July 23 granted an injunction in connection with the appointment of the receiver.  In the case of the <em>Tampa Railroad Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/168/583/case.html">168 U. S. 583</a></span>, decided before the statute was amended, it was held that an appeal would lie from such an order, and would bring up the entire order, including the appointment.</p>\n<p>In <em>Highland Avenue Railroad v. Columbian Equipment Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/168/627/case.html">168 U. S. 627</a></span>, the order was confined to the appointment of the receiver, and contained no injunction.</p>\n<p>The circuit court of appeals, however, held that these orders were final decrees, and appealable as such.  As we are of opinion that an appeal was allowable on other grounds, we need not discuss the correctness of this view.</p>\n<p>Granting all this, it is further insisted that the writ of supersedeas was void because not directed to be issued by the court of appeals as a court.  By section 4 of the Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826, c. 517, it is provided that</p>\n<p>"the review, by appeals, by writ of error, or otherwise, from the existing circuit courts shall be had only in the Supreme Court of the United States or in the circuit courts of appeals hereby established according to the provisions of this act regulating the same,"</p>\n<p>and by section 11 that</p>\n<p>"any judge of the circuit courts of appeals, in respect of cases brought or to be brought to that court, shall have the same powers and duties as to the allowance of appeals or writs of error, and the conditions of such allowance, as now by law belong to the justices or judges in respect of the existing courts of the United States respectively."</p>\n<p>That this court as a court has power to issue a writ of supersedeas under section 716 of the Revised Statutes is clear, for that section concedes its power to issue writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction and agreeably to the usages and principles of law.  This is equally true of the circuit courts of appeals under section 12 of the Act of March 3, 1891.</p>\n<p>Although the issue of the writ is not ordinarily required, there are instances in which it has been done, under special circumstances </p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 180 U. S. 550</a></p><p> and in furtherance of justice.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/74/case.html">Stockton v. Bishop,</a></span></em> 2 How. 74; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/45/640/case.html">Hardeman v. Anderson,</a></span></em> 4 How. 640; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/72/188/case.html">Ex Parte Milwaukee Railroad,</a></span></em> 5 Wall. 188.</p>\n<p>In <em>In re Claasen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/140/200/case.html">140 U. S. 200</a></span>, we held, referring to sections 1000 and 1007 of the Revised Statutes, that a Justice of this Court had authority not only to allow the writ of error, but also to grant the supersedeas. After the decision in that case, Rule 36 was adopted providing that any Justice of this Court, or any circuit judge within his circuit, or any district judge within his district, might allow an appeal or writ of error, take proper security, and sign the citation, and that he might "also grant a supersedeas and stay of execution, or of proceedings, pending such writ of error or appeal."</p>\n<p>The court below had refused to grant an appeal, and as an appeal lay, the judge of the circuit court of appeals had the power to award it and to grant a supersedeas, and if in his judgment a writ of supersedeas was required, under the particular circumstances, the order for it to issue was not, in itself, void, nor was the process void, issued under such order.  Obedience to an order granting a supersedeas is as much required as to an order for a writ of supersedeas and to the writ thereupon issued.  The essential point is that the order or decree below is superseded, and the parties affected must govern themselves accordingly.</p>\n<p>Nor do we think that the language used in section 507 of the Alaska Code operated as a limitation on the power of the court of appeals to grant a supersedeas.  It is true that the section provided that</p>\n<p>"the proceedings in other respects in the district court in the cause in which such interlocutory order was entered, shall not be stayed during the pendency of such appeal unless otherwise ordered by the district court."</p>\n<p>And similar language was used in section 7 of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891.</p>\n<p>In <em>In re Haberman Manufacturing Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/147/525/case.html">147 U. S. 525</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/147/525/case.html#530">147 U. S. 530</a></span>, it was held that, in view of the terms of the act, the lower court had a discretion to grant or refuse a supersedeas, and that thereupon this Court would not issue a mandamus to command the judge of that court to approve a supersedeas bond, to supersede </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 180 U. S. 551</a></p><p> an injunction, and to enter an order vacating the injunction.  Even if the language used by given this scope beyond proceeding with the main cause, it nevertheless does not interfere with the inherent power of the appellate court to stay or supersede proceedings on appeal from such orders as those here.  Tested by the principles and rules which relate to chancery proceedings, the power of the appellate court to render its jurisdiction efficacious, the court below refusing to do so, is unquestionable.</p>\n<p>The frame of the writs in these two cases, one of which is attacked on this application, was approved by a specific order of the circuit judge, but it is objected that so much thereof as directed the receiver to restore the property taken by him was void.  The authorities are many that, where the appointment of a receiver is superseded, it may become his duty to restore that which has come to his hands to the parties from whom it has been withdrawn, and that this may be directed to be done.  It is, at all events, evident that an order that he should do so is not void in itself.  We cannot on this application review the judgment of the circuit court of appeals sustaining such an order and approving of the writs as issued.</p>\n<p>The opinion of the circuit court of appeals presents a comprehensive review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the granting of the orders appealed from, but it has not been necessary to recapitulate these matters at length on this inquiry.  The question before us is whether petitioner is unlawfully restrained of his liberty by way of punishment for violation of orders absolutely void.</p>\n<p>The distinction between a total want of power and a defective exercise of it is obvious, and want of power cannot be predicated of mere errors, if such were committed here, which we do not intimate.</p>\n<p>We hold that the circuit court of appeals had jurisdiction in the premises, and was clothed with the power to pass on all questions in respect of the means taken to enforce and maintain it.  We are not called on to revise its conclusions on this application.  It is enough that, in our judgment, it has not exceeded its powers.</p>\n<p><em>Leave denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
