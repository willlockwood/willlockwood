PINHOLSTER</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x931088.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 9, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided April 4, 2011</p>\n<p align="left">A California jury convicted respondent Pinholster on two counts of first-degree murder.  At the penalty phase before the same jury, the prosecution produced eight witnesses, who testified about Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s history of threatening and violent behavior.  Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel, who unsuccessfully sought to exclude the aggravating evidence on the ground that the prosecution had not given Pinholster proper notice under California law, called only Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother.  Counsel did not call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted with Dr. Stalberg, who had diagnosed Pinholster with antisocial personality disorder.  The jury recommended the death penalty, and Pinholster was sentenced to death.  Pinholster twice sought habeas relief in the California Supreme Court, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial counsel had failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase.  He introduced additional evidence to support his claim: school, medical, and legal records; and declarations from family members, one of his trial attorneys, and Dr. Woods, a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar mood disorder and seizure disorders, and who criticized Dr. Stalberg\xe2\x80\x99s report.  Each time, the State Supreme Court unanimously and summarily denied the claim on the merits.  Subsequently, a Federal District Court held an evidentiary hearing and granted Pinholster federal habeas relief under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.  Affirming, the en banc Ninth Circuit considered the new evidence adduced in the District Court hearing and held that the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved an unreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Review under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \xc2\xa72254 sets several limits on a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s power to grant habeas relief to a state prisoner.  As relevant here, a claim that has been \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be granted \xe2\x80\xa6 unless the adjudication\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(d).  This \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to meet,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harrington</em> v. <em>Richter</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___, and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98highly deferential standard\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Visciotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/19/index.html">537 U. S. 19</a>, 24.  Section 2254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s backward-looking language\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cresulted in\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94requires an examination of the state-court decision at the time it was made.  It follows that the record under review is also limited to the record in existence at that same time\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> the state-court record.  This understanding is compelled by \xe2\x80\x9cthe broader context of the statute as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d which demonstrates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to channel prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 claims first to state courts.  <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a>, 341.  It is also consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, which emphasize that \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) review focuses on what a state court knew and did.  See, <em>e.g., Lockyer</em> v. <em>Andrade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/63/index.html">538 U. S. 63</a>, 71\xe2\x80\x9372.  Moreover, it is consistent with <em>Schriro</em> v. <em>Landrigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/465/index.html">550 U. S. 465</a>, 474, which explained that a federal habeas court is \xe2\x80\x9cnot required to hold an evidentiary hearing\xe2\x80\x9d when the state-court record \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes habeas relief\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations.  The Ninth Circuit wrongly interpreted <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/420/index.html">529 U. S. 420</a>, and <em>Holland</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/649/index.html">542 U. S. 649</a>, as supporting the contrary view.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This holding does not render superfluous \xc2\xa72254(e)(2)\xe2\x80\x94which limits the federal habeas courts\xe2\x80\x99 discretion to take new evidence in an evidentiary hearing.  At a minimum, \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) still restricts their discretion in claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state court.  Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence in federal court, AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory scheme is designed to strongly discourage them from doing so.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Remand for a properly limited review is inappropriate here, because the Ninth Circuit ruled, in the alternative, that Pinholster merited habeas relief on the state-court record alone.  P.\xc2\xa014.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0On the record before the state court, Pinholster was not entitled to federal habeas relief.

To overcome the strong presumption that counsel has acted competently, <em>id.,</em> at 690, a defendant must show that counsel failed to act \xe2\x80\x9creasonabl[y] considering all the circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 688, and must prove the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 694.

Billing records show that they spent time investigating mitigating evidence.  The record also shows that they had an unsympathetic client who had boasted about his criminal history during the guilt phase, leaving them with limited mitigation strategies.  In addition, when Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had no significant mental disorder or defect, he was aware of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s medical and social history.  Given these impediments, it would have been a reasonable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy for Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother.  Pinholster has responded with only a handful of <em>post-hoc</em> nondenials by one of his lawyers.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit misapplied <em>Strickland </em>when it drew from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent cases a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional duty to investigate\xe2\x80\x9d and a principle that it was <em>prima facie </em>ineffective for counsel to abandon an investigation based on rudimentary knowledge of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s background.  Beyond the general requirement of reasonableness, \xe2\x80\x9cspecific guidelines are not appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Strickland.</em>  466 U. S., at 688.  Nor did the Ninth Circuit properly apply the strong presumption of competence mandated by <em>Strickland</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Even if his trial counsel had performed deficiently, Pinholster also has failed to show that the State Supreme Court must have unreasonably concluded that he was not prejudiced.  Pp. 26\xe2\x80\x9331.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0To determine \xe2\x80\x9cwhether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer \xe2\x80\xa6 would have concluded that\xe2\x80\x9d death was not warranted, <em>Strickland</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 695, the aggravating evidence is reweighed \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the totality of available mitigating evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U. S. 510</a>, 534.  Here, the State presented extensive aggravating evidence at both the guilt and penalty phases.  The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the penalty-phase testimony of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother and guilt-phase testimony given by his brother.  After considering the evidence, the jury returned a sentence of death, which the state trial court found supported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence.  Pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0There is no reasonable probability that the additional evidence presented at Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s state proceedings would have changed the verdict.  The \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence of his mother and brother at trial.  To the extent that there were new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of questionable mitigating value.  Dr. Woods\xe2\x80\x99 testimony would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state expert; and new evidence relating to Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems could lead a jury to conclude that he was beyond rehabilitation.  The remaining new material in the state habeas record is sparse.  Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinholster presented in state habeas, the Court cannot say that the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination was unreasonable.  Pp.\xc2\xa029\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Because this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the question of prejudice in <em>Williams </em>v.<em> Taylor, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U.

A jury convicted Pinholster of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the California Supreme Court twice unanimously denied Pinholster habeas relief, a Federal District Court held an evidentiary hearing and granted Pinholster habeas relief under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.  The District Court concluded that Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective at the penalty phase of trial.  Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  <em>Pinholster</em> v. <em>Ayers</em>,<em> </em>590 F.\xc2\xa03d 651 (2009).  Considering the new evidence adduced in the District Court hearing, the Court of Appeals held that the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the evening of January 8, 1982, Pinholster solicited Art Corona and Paul David Brown to help him rob Michael Kumar, a local drug dealer.  On the way, they stopped at Lisa Tapar\xe2\x80\x99s house, where Pinholster put his buck knife through her front door and scratched a swastika into her car after she refused to talk to him.  The three men, who were all armed with buck knives, found no one at Kumar\xe2\x80\x99s house, broke in, and began ransacking the home.  They came across only a small amount of marijuana before Kumar\xe2\x80\x99s friends, Thomas Johnson and Robert Beckett, arrived and shouted that they were calling the police.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pinholster and his accomplices tried to escape through the rear door, but Johnson blocked their path.  Pinholster backed Johnson onto the patio, demanding drugs and money and repeatedly striking him in the chest.  Johnson dropped his wallet on the ground and stopped resisting.  Beckett then came around the corner, and Pinholster attacked him, too, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest.  Pinholster forced Beckett to the ground, took both men\xe2\x80\x99s wallets, and began kicking Beckett in the head.  Meanwhile, Brown stabbed Johnson in the chest, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bury[ing] his knife to the hilt.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  35 Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Tr. 4947 (hereinafter Tr.).  Johnson and Beckett died of their wounds.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Corona drove the three men to Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.  While in the car, Pinholster and Brown exulted, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We got \xe2\x80\x99em, man, we got \xe2\x80\x99em good.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  At the apartment, Pinholster washed his knife, and the three split the proceeds of the robbery: $23 and one quarter-ounce of marijuana.  Although Pinholster instructed Corona to \xe2\x80\x9clay low,\xe2\x80\x9d Corona turned himself in to the police two weeks later.  <em>Id.,</em> at 4955.  Pinholster was arrested shortly thereafter and threatened to kill Corona if he did not keep quiet about the burglary and murders.  Corona later became the State\xe2\x80\x99s primary witness.  The prosecution brought numerous charges against Pinholster, including two counts of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California trial court appointed Harry Brainard and Wilbur Dettmar to defend Pinholster on charges of first-degree murder, robbery, and burglary.  Before their appointment, Pinholster had rejected other attorneys and insisted on representing himself.  During that time, the State had mailed Pinholster a letter in jail informing him that the prosecution planned to offer aggravating evidence during the penalty phase of trial to support a sentence of death.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guilt phase of the trial began on February 28, 1984.  Pinholster testified on his own behalf and presented an alibi defense.  He claimed that he had broken into Kumar\xe2\x80\x99s house alone at around 8 p.m. on January 8, 1982, and had stolen marijuana but denied killing anyone.  Pinholster asserted that later that night around 1 a.m., while he was elsewhere, Corona went to Kumar\xe2\x80\x99s house to steal more drugs and did not return for three hours.  Pinholster told the jury that he was a \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional robber,\xe2\x80\x9d not a murderer.  43 <em>id.,</em> at 6204.  He boasted of committing hundreds of robberies over the previous six years but insisted that he always used a gun, never a knife.  The jury convicted Pinholster on both counts of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the penalty phase, Brainard and Dettmar moved to exclude any aggravating evidence on the ground that the prosecution had failed to provide notice of the evidence to be introduced, as required by Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.3 (West 2008).  At a hearing on April 24, Dettmar argued that, in reliance on the lack of notice, he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot presently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  52 Tr. 7250.  He acknowledged, however, that the prosecutor \xe2\x80\x9cpossibly ha[d] met the [notice] requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The trial court asked whether a continuance might be helpful, but Dettmar declined, explaining that he could not think of a mitigation witness other than Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother and that additional time would not \xe2\x80\x9cmake a great deal of difference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 7257\xe2\x80\x937258.  Three days later, after hearing testimony, the court found that Pinholster had received notice while representing himself and denied the motion to exclude.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The penalty phase was held before the same jury that had convicted Pinholster.  The prosecution produced eight witnesses, who testified about Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s history of threatening and violent behavior, including resisting arrest and assaulting police officers, involvement with juvenile gangs, and a substantial prison disciplinary record.  Defense counsel called only Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Burnice Brashear.

Represented by new counsel, Pinholster alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase of his trial.  He alleged that Brainard and Dettmar had failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence, including evidence of mental disorders.  Pinholster supported this claim with school, medical, and legal records, as well as declarations from family members, Brainard, and Dr. George Woods, a psychiatrist who diagnosed Pinholster with bipolar mood disorder and seizure disorders.  Dr. Woods criticized Dr. Stalberg\xe2\x80\x99s report as incompetent, unreliable, and inaccurate.  The California Supreme Court unanimously and summarily[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] denied Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s penalty-phase ineffective-assistance claim \xe2\x80\x9con the substantive ground that it is without merit.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 302.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pinholster filed a federal habeas petition in April 1997.

In support of the new allegations, Dr. Stalberg provided a declaration stating that in 1984, Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel had provided him with only some police reports and a 1978 probation report.  Dr. Stalberg explained that, had he known about the material that had since been gathered by Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s habeas counsel, he would have conducted \xe2\x80\x9cfurther inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d before concluding that Pinholster suffered only from a personality disorder.

His allegations of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel mirrored those in his federal habeas petition.

In November 1997, he filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  His allegations of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel were identical to those in his second state habeas petition.  Both parties moved for summary judgment and Pinholster also moved, in the alternative, for an evidentiary hearing.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court concluded that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, did not apply and granted an evidentiary hearing.  Before the hearing, the State deposed Dr. Stalberg, who stated that none of the new material he reviewed altered his original diagnosis.  Dr. Stalberg disagreed with Dr. Woods\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that Pinholster suffers from bipolar disorder.  Pinholster did not call Dr. Stalberg to testify at the hearing.  He presented two new medical experts: Dr. Sophia Vinogradov, a psychiatrist who diagnosed Pinholster with organic personality syndrome and ruled out antisocial personality disorder, and Dr. Donald Olson, a pediatric neurologist who suggested that Pinholster suffers from partial epilepsy and brain injury.  The State called Dr. F.

Section 2254(d)(1) refers, in the past tense, to a state-court adjudication that \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in\xe2\x80\x9d a decision that was contrary to, or \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved\xe2\x80\x9d an unreasonable application of, established law.  This backward-looking language requires an examination of the state-court decision at the time it was made.  It follows that the record under review is limited to the record in existence at that same time<em>i.e.</em>, the record before the state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This understanding of the text is compelled by \xe2\x80\x9cthe broader context of the statute as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d which demonstrates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to channel prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 claims first to the state courts.  <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U.

Section 2254(b) requires that prisoners must ordinarily exhaust state remedies before filing for federal habeas relief.  It would be contrary to that purpose to allow a petitioner to overcome an adverse state-court decision with new evidence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed by that court in the first instance effectively <em>de novo</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Limiting \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) review to the state-court record is consistent with our precedents interpreting that statu-\ntory provision.  Our cases emphasize that review under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) focuses on what a state court knew and did.  State-court decisions are measured against this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents as of \xe2\x80\x9cthe time the state court renders its decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lockyer</em> v. <em>Andrade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/63/index.html">538 U.

To determine whether a particular decision is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d then-established law, a federal court must consider whether the decision \xe2\x80\x9capplies a rule that contradicts [such] law\xe2\x80\x9d and how the decision \xe2\x80\x9cconfronts [the] set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d that were before the state court.  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/362/index.html">529 U.

If the state-court decision \xe2\x80\x9cidentifies the correct governing legal principle\xe2\x80\x9d in existence at the time, a federal court must assess whether the decision \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 413.  It would be strange to ask federal courts to analyze whether a state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication resulted in a decision that unreasonably applied federal law to facts not before the state court.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our recent decision in <em>Schriro</em> v. <em>Landrigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/465/index.html">550 U.

In practical effect, we went on to note, this means that when the state-court record \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes habeas relief\xe2\x80\x9d under the limitations of \xc2\xa72254(d), a district court is \xe2\x80\x9cnot required to hold an evidentiary hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 474<em> </em>(citing with approval the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that \xe2\x80\x9can evidentiary hearing is not required on issues that can be resolved by reference to the state court record\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals wrongly interpreted <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/420/index.html">529 U. S. 420</a> (2000) <em>(Michael Williams)</em>, as supporting the contrary view.  The question there was whether the lower court had correctly determined that \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) barred the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request for a federal evidentiary hearing.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  <em>Michael Williams </em>did not concern whether evidence introduced in such a hearing could be considered under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  In fact, only one claim at issue in that case was even subject to \xc2\xa72254(d); the rest had not been adjudicated on the merits in state-court proceedings.  See <em>id.,</em> at 429 (\xe2\x80\x9cPetitioner did not develop, or raise, his claims \xe2\x80\xa6 until he filed his federal habeas petition\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If anything, the decision in <em>Michael Williams </em>supports our holding.  The lower court in that case had determined that the one claim subject to \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) did not satisfy that statutory requirement.  In light of that ruling, this Court concluded that it was \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary to reach the question whether \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) would permit a [federal] hearing on th[at] claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 444.  That conclusion is fully consistent with our holding that evidence later introduced in federal court is irrelevant to \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on <em>Holland</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/649/index.html">542 U. S. 649</a> (2004) <em>(per curiam)</em>, was also mistaken.  In <em>Holland</em>, we initially stated that \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was unreasonable [under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)] must be assessed in light of the record the court had before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 652.  We then went on to <em>assume </em>for the sake of argument what some Courts of Appeals had heldthat \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), despite its mandatory language, simply does not apply when a federal habeas court has admitted new evidence that supports a claim previously adjudicated in state court.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Id.,</em> at 653.  There was no reason to decide that question because regardless, the hearing should have been barred by \xc2\xa72254(e)(2).  Today, we reject that assumption and hold that evidence introduced in federal court\nhas no bearing on \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) review.  If a claim has\nbeen adjudicated on the merits by a state court, a fed-\neral habeas petitioner must overcome the limitation of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s contention that our holding renders \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) superfluous is incorrect.  Section 2254(e)(2) imposes a limitation on the discretion of federal habeas courts to take new evidence in an evidentiary hearing.  See <em>Landrigan</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 473 (noting that district courts, under AEDPA, generally retain the discretion to grant an evidentiary hearing).  Like \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), it carries out \xe2\x80\x9cAEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s goal of promoting comity, finality, and federalism by giving state courts the first opportunity to review [a] claim, and to correct any constitutional violation in the first instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jimenez</em> v. <em>Quarterman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/113/index.html">555 U.

For example, not all federal habeas claims by state prisoners fall within the scope of \xc2\xa72254(d), which applies only to claims \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  At a minimum, therefore, \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) still restricts the discretion of federal habeas courts to consider new evidence when deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state court.

Other statements made during the argument regarding the motion to exclude suggest that defense counsel were trying to take advantage of a legal technicality and were not truly surprised.  Brainard and Dettmar acknowledged that the prosecutor had invited them on numerous occasions to review Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s state prison file but argued that such an invitation did not meet with the \xe2\x80\x9cstrict demands\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa7190.3.  52 Tr. 7260.

By the end of the guilt phase, the jury had observed Pinholster \xe2\x80\x9cglor[y]\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9chis criminal disposition\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chundreds of robberies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pinholster</em>, 1 Cal.\xc2\xa04th, at 945, 907, 824 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 611, 584.

Dr. Stalberg was aware of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s hyperactivity as a youngster, hospitalization at age 14 for incorrigibility, alleged epileptic disorder, and history of drug dependency.  Nevertheless, Dr. Stalberg told counsel that Pinholster did not appear to suffer from brain damage, was not significantly intoxicated or impaired on the night in question, and did not have an impaired ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given these impediments, it would have been a reasonable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy for Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother.  In fact, such a family sympathy defense is precisely how the State understood defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategy.  The prosecutor carefully opened her cross-examination of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother with, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you understand I don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy cross-examining a mother of anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d  52 Tr. 7407.  And in her closing argument, the prosecutor attempted to undercut defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategy by pointing out, \xe2\x80\x9cEven the most heinous person born, even Adolph Hitler[,] probably had a mother who loved him.\xe2\x80\x9d  53 <em>id.,</em> at 7452.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s only response to this evidence is a series of declarations from Brainard submitted with Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s first state habeas petition, seven years after the trial.  Brainard declares that he has \xe2\x80\x9cno recollection\xe2\x80\x9d of interviewing any family members (other than Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother) regarding penalty-phase testimony, of attempting to secure Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s school or medical records, or of interviewing any former teachers or counselors.

Pinholster has responded to this evidence with only a handful of <em>post-hoc</em> nondenials by one of his lawyers.

He was disruptive in kindergarten and was failing by first grade.  He got in fights and would run out of the classroom.  In third grade, Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s teacher suggested that he was more than just a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98disruptive child.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 7394.

Pinholster had continued to initiate fights with his brothers and to act like \xe2\x80\x9cRobin Hood\xe2\x80\x9d around the neighborhood, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tealing from the rich and giving to the poor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 7395.

After a stint in state prison, Pinholster returned home but acted \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d and had trouble readjusting to life.  <em>Id.,</em> at 7405.</font></font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s siblings were \xe2\x80\x9cbasically very good children,\xe2\x80\x9d although they would get into trouble.  <em>Id.,</em> at 7401.

The state trial court found that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination was \xe2\x80\x9csupported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d and added that \xe2\x80\x9cthe factors in aggravation beyond all reasonable doubt outweigh those in mitigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clerk\xe2\x80\x99s Tr. 1184, 1186.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no reasonable probability that the additional evidence Pinholster presented in his state habeas proceedings would have changed the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.  The \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence at trial.  School and medical records basically substantiate the testimony of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother and brother.  Declarations from Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s siblings support his mother\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that his stepfather was abusive and explain that Pinholster was beaten with fists, belts, and even wooden boards.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent the state habeas record includes new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of questionable mitigating value.  If Pinholster had called Dr. Woods to testify consistently with his psychiatric report, Pinholster would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state expert.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wong</em> v. <em>Belmontes</em>, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) <em>(per curiam) </em>(slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9312) (taking into account that certain mitigating evidence would have exposed the petitioner to further aggravating evidence).  The new evidence relating to Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s familytheir more serious substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems, see <em>post</em>, at 22is also by no means clearly mitigating, as the jury might have concluded that Pinholster was simply beyond rehabilitation.  Cf. <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U.

We learn that Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s brother Alvin died of suicide by drug overdose, and<font b="1"> there are passing references to Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s own drug dependency.  According to Dr. Stalberg, Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cschool records\xe2\x80\x9d apparently evidenced \xe2\x80\x9csome degree\xe2\x80\x9d of brain damage.  App. to Brief in Opposition 219.  Mostly, there are just a few new details about Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s childhood.

Accordingly, whenever his grandparents \xe2\x80\x9cspanked or disciplined\xe2\x80\x9d the kids, Pinholster \xe2\x80\x9calways got the worst of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Pinholster was mostly unsupervised and \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t get much love,\xe2\x80\x9d because his mother and stepfather were always working and \xe2\x80\x9cwere more concerned with their own lives than the welfare of their kids.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 2<em>.</em>  Neither parent seemed concerned about Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s schooling.  Finally,<font b="1"> Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s aunt once saw the children mixing flour and water to make something to eat, although \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost meals consisted of canned spaghetti and foods of that ilk.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1<em>.</em></font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1"><em>\n</em><p><em>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</font></em><font b="1">Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinholster presented in state habeas, we cannot say that the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination was unreasonable.  Having already heard much of what is included in the state habeas record, the jury returned a sentence of death.  Moreover, some of the new testimony would likely have undercut the mitigating value of the testimony by Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mother.  The new material is thus not so significant that, even assuming Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel performed deficiently, it was necessarily unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to conclude that Pinholster had failed to show a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d likelihood of a different sentence.  <em>Richter</em>, 562 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) must take into account the evidence admitted at that hearing.  As the dissent points out, refusing to consider the evidence received in the hearing in federal court gives \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) an implausibly narrow scope and will lead either to results that Congress surely did not intend or to the distortion of other provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and the law on \xe2\x80\x9ccause and prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>post</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under AEDPA evidentiary hearings in federal court should be rare.  The petitioner generally must have made a diligent effort to produce in state court the new evidence on which he seeks to rely.  See \xc2\xa72254(e)(2); <em>Williams </em>v.<em> Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/420/index.html">529 U. S. 420</a>, 433\xe2\x80\x93434 (2000).  If that requirement is not satisfied, the petitioner may establish the factual predicate for a claim in a federal-court hearing only if, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even when the petitioner does satisfy the diligence standard adopted in <em>Williams </em>v.<em> Taylor</em>, <em>supra</em>, a hearing should not be held in federal court unless the new evidence that the petitioner seeks to introduce was not and could not have been offered in the state-court proceeding.  Section 2254(e)(2) bars a hearing in certain situations, but it does not mean that a hearing is allowed in all other situations.  See <em>Schriro</em> v. <em>Landrigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/465/index.html">550 U. S. 465</a>, 473\xe2\x80\x93474 (2007). The whole thrust of AEDPA is essentially to reserve federal habeas relief for those cases in which the state courts acted unreasonably.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1), (2), (e)(1).  Permitting a petitioner to obtain federal habeas relief on the basis of evidence that could have been but was not offered in state court would upset this scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, for essentially the reasons set out in the dissent from the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 en banc decision, see <em>Pinholster </em>v.<em> Ayers</em>, 590 F. 3d 651, 688\xe2\x80\x93691 (CA9 2009) (opinion of Kozinski, J.), I would hold that the federal-court hearing should not have been held because respondent did not diligently present his new evidence to the California courts.  And I join all but Part II of the opinion of the Court, as I agree that the decision of the state court represented a reasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent in light of the state-court record.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963484">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOTOMAYOR, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nCULLEN V.

Congress recognized as much when it enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and permitted therein the introduction of new evidence in federal habeas proceed-ings in certain limited circumstances.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(e)(2).  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s novel interpretation of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), however, federal courts must turn a blind eye to new evidence in deciding whether a petitioner has satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s threshold obstacle to federal habeas relief\xe2\x80\x94even when it is clear that the petitioner would be entitled to relief in light of that evidence.  In reading\nthe statute to \xe2\x80\x9ccompe[l]\xe2\x80\x9d this harsh result, <em>ante</em>, at 9,\nthe Court ignores a key textual difference between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1) and 2254(d)(2) and discards the previous understanding in our precedents that new evidence can, in fact, inform the \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) inquiry.  I therefore dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s first holding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I also disagree with the Court that, even if the \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state-court record, respondent Scott Pinholster failed to demonstrate that the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision denying his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  There is no reason for the majority to decide whether the \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state-court record because Pinholster satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) on either the state- or federal-court record.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court first holds that, in determining whether a state-court decision is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), \xe2\x80\x9creview \xe2\x80\xa6 is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  New evidence adduced at a federal evidentiary hearing is now\xc2\xa0irrelevant to determining whether a petitioner has satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  This holding is unnecessary to pro-mote AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, and it is inconsistent with the provision\xe2\x80\x99s text, the structure of the statute, and our precedents.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand the significance of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding, it is important to view the issue in context.  AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s entire structure\xe2\x80\x94which gives state courts the opportunity to decide factual and legal questions in the first instance\xe2\x80\x94ensures that evidentiary hearings in federal habeas proceedings are very rare.  See N. King, F. Cheesman, &amp; B. Ostrom, Final Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in U. S. District Courts 35\xe2\x80\x9336 (2007) (evidentiary hearings under AEDPA occur in 0.4 percent of noncapital cases and 9.5 percent of capital cases).  Even absent the new restriction created by today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, AEDPA erects multiple hurdles to a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s ability to introduce new evidence in a federal habeas proceeding.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder the exhaustion requirement, a habeas petitioner challenging a state conviction must first attempt to present his claim in state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harrington</em> v. <em>Richter</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13); see also \xc2\xa72254(b)(1)(A).  With certain narrow exceptions, federal courts cannot consider a claim at all, let alone accept new evidence relevant to the claim, if it has not been exhausted in state court.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The exhaustion requirement thus reserves to state courts the first opportunity to resolve factual disputes relevant to a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  See <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/838/index.html">526 U. S. 838</a>, 845 (1999).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the exhaustion requirement is \xe2\x80\x9ccomplement[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d by the standards set forth in \xc2\xa72254(d).  <em>Harrington</em>, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Under this provision, a federal court may not grant habeas relief on any \xe2\x80\x9cclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d unless the adjudication</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThese standards \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol whether to grant habeas relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schriro</em> v. <em>Landrigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/465/index.html">550 U. S. 465</a>, 474 (2007).  Accordingly, we have said, if the factual allegations a petitioner seeks to prove at an evidentiary hearing would not satisfy these standards, there is no reason for a hearing.  See <em>id.</em>, at 481.  In such a case, the district court may exercise its \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion to deny an evidentiary hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>infra</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  This approach makes eminent sense: If district courts held evidentiary hearings without first asking whether the evidence the petitioner seeks to present would satisfy AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s demanding standards, they would needlessly prolong federal habeas proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, even when a petitioner seeks to introduce new evidence that would entitle him to relief, AEDPA prohibits him from doing so, except in a narrow range of cases, unless he \xe2\x80\x9cmade a reasonable attempt, in light of the information available at the time, to investigate and pursue claims in state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/420/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/420/index.html">529 U.

Thus, \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIf the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A) the claim relies on\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn <em>Michael Williams</em>, we construed the opening clause of this provision\xe2\x80\x94which triggers the bar on evidentiary hearings\xe2\x80\x94to apply when \xe2\x80\x9cthere is lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at 432.  AEDPA thus bars an evidentiary hearing for a nondiligent petitioner unless the petitioner can satisfy both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(e)(2)(A) and (B), which few petitioners can.  Section 2254(e)(2) in this way incentivizes state petitioners to develop the factual basis of their claims in state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the limited extent that federal evidentiary hearings are available under AEDPA, they ensure that petitioners who diligently developed the factual basis of their claims in state court, discovered new evidence after the state-court proceeding, and cannot return to state court retain the ability to access the Great Writ.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Congress codified new rules governing this previously judicially managed area of law, it did so without losing sight of the fact that the \xe2\x80\x98writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Holland</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, 560 U.

Allowing a petitioner to introduce new evidence at a hearing in the limited circumstance permitted by \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) does not upset the balance that Congress struck in AEDPA between the state and federal courts.  By construing \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) to do the work of other provisions in AEDPA, the majority has subverted Congress\xe2\x80\x99 careful balance of responsibilities.  It has also created unnecessarily a brand-new set of procedural complexities that lower courts will have to confront.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) finds no support in the provision\xe2\x80\x99s text or the statute\xe2\x80\x99s structure as a whole.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 2254(d)(1) requires district courts to ask whether a state-court adjudication on the merits \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because this provision uses \xe2\x80\x9cbackward-looking language\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, past-tense verbs\xe2\x80\x94the majority believes that it limits review to the state-court record.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  But both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1) and 2254(d)(2) use \xe2\x80\x9cbackward-looking language,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x94unlike \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x94expressly directs district courts to base their review on \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  If use of the past tense were sufficient to indicate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to restrict analysis to the state-court record, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) would be superfluous.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) fails to give meaning to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to include language referring to the evidence presented to the state court in \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).

It speculates that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he omission of clarifying language from \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) just as likely reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 belief that such language was unnecessary as it does anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, n.\xc2\xa07.  The argument that this phrase is merely \xe2\x80\x9cclarifying\xe2\x80\x9d might have more force, however, had Congress included this phrase in \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) but not in \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).

In particular, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to include in AEDPA a provision, \xc2\xa72254(e)(2), that permits federal evidentiary hearings in certain circumstances provides further evidence that Congress did not intend to limit the \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) inquiry to the state-court record in every case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have long recognized that some diligent habeas petitioners are unable to develop all of the facts supporting their claims in state court.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  As discussed above, in enacting AEDPA, Congress generally barred evidentiary hearings for petitioners who did not \xe2\x80\x9cexercise diligence in pursuing their claims\xe2\x80\x9d in state court.  <em>Michael Williams</em>, 529 U.

It would undermine the comity principles motivating AEDPA to decline to defer to a state-court adjudication of a claim\nbecause the state court, through no fault of its own,\nlacked all the relevant evidence.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other courts of appeals, including the court below, have struck a more considered balance.  These courts have held that \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) continues to apply but that new evidence properly presented in a federal hearing is relevant to the reasonableness of the state-court decision.  See <em>Pinholster </em>v. <em>Ayers</em>, 590 F.\xc2\xa03d 651, 668 (CA9 2009) (en banc) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the evidence is admissible under <em>Michael Williams</em> or \xc2\xa72254(e)(2), and if it does not render the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims unexhausted \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, then it is properly considered in evaluating whether the legal conclusion reached by the state habeas court was a reasonable application of Supreme Court law\xe2\x80\x9d); accord, <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Mazzuca</em>, 570 F.\xc2\xa03d 490, 500 (CA2 2009);<em> Pecoraro</em> v. <em>Walls</em>, 286 F.\xc2\xa03d 439, 443 (CA7 2002); <em>Valdez</em> v. <em>Cockrell</em>, 274 F.\xc2\xa03d 941, 952 (CA5 2001).  This approach accommodates the competing goals, reflected in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d) and 2254(e)(2), of according deference to reasonable state-court decisions and preserving the opportunity for diligent petitioners to present evidence to the federal court when they were unable to do so in state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority charts a third, novel course that, so far as I am aware, no court of appeals has adopted: \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) continues to apply when a petitioner has additional evidence that he was unable to present to the state court, but the district court cannot consider that evidence in deciding whether the petitioner has satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The problem with this approach is its potential to bar federal habeas relief for diligent habeas petitioners who cannot present new evidence to a state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Consider, for example, a petitioner who diligently attempted in state court to develop the factual basis of a claim that prosecutors withheld exculpatory witness statements in violation of <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963).  The state court denied relief on the ground that the withheld evidence then known did not rise to the level of materiality required under <em>Brady</em>.  Before the time for filing a federal habeas petition has expired, however, a state court orders the State to disclose additional documents the petitioner had timely requested under the State\xe2\x80\x99s public records Act.  The disclosed documents reveal that the State withheld other exculpatory witness statements, but state law would not permit the petitioner to present the new evidence in a successive petition.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under our precedent, if the petitioner had not presented his <em>Brady</em> claim to the state court at all, his claim would be deemed defaulted and the petitioner could attempt to show cause and prejudice to overcome the default.  See <em>Michael Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 444; see also n. 1, <em>supra</em>.  If, however, the new evidence merely bolsters a <em>Brady</em> claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, it is unclear how the petitioner can obtain federal habeas relief after today\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  What may have been a reasonable decision on the state-court record may no longer be reasonable in light of the new evidence.  See <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/419/index.html">514 U. S. 419</a>, 436 (1995) (materiality of <em>Brady</em> evidence is viewed \xe2\x80\x9ccollectively, not item by item\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the state court adjudicated the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> claim on the merits, \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) would still apply.  Yet, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), a federal court is now prohibited from considering the new evidence in determining the reasonableness of the state-court decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) thus suggests the anomalous result that petitioners with new claims based on newly obtained evidence can obtain federal habeas relief if they can show cause and prejudice for their default but petitioners with newly obtained evidence supporting a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court cannot obtain federal habeas relief if they cannot first satisfy \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) without the new evidence.  That the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation leads to this anomaly is good reason to conclude that its interpretation is wrong.  See <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Tamayo-Reyes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/504/1/index.html">504 U.

This suggestion is puzzling.  New evidence does not usually give rise to a new claim; it merely provides additional proof of a claim already adjudicated on the merits.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The majority presumably means to\xc2\xa0suggest that the petitioner might be able to obtain federal-court review of his new evidence if he can show cause and\xc2\xa0prejudice for his failure to present the \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d claim to a state court.  In that scenario, however, the federal court would review the purportedly \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d claim <em>de novo</em>.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach thus threatens to replace deferential review of new evidence under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) with <em>de novo</em> review of new evidence in the form of \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d claims.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Because it is unlikely that Congress intended\n<em>de novo</em> review\xe2\x80\x94the result suggested by the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x94it must have intended for district courts to\nconsider newly discovered evidence in conducting the \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) appears ultimately to rest on its understanding that state courts must have the first opportunity to adjudicate habeas petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be contrary to [AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion requirement] to allow a petitioner to overcome an adverse state-court decision with new evidence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed by that court in the first instance effectively de <em>novo</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Justice Breyer takes the same position.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (AEDPA is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto give the State a first opportunity to consider most matters\xe2\x80\x9d).  I fully agree that habeas petitioners must attempt to present evidence to state courts in the first instance, as does Justice Alito, see <em>ante</em>, at 2.  Where I disagree with the majority is in my understanding that \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) already accomplishes this result.  By reading \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) to do the work of \xc2\xa72254(e)(2), the majority gives \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) an unnaturally cramped reading.  As a result, the majority either has foreclosed habeas relief for diligent petitioners who, through no fault of their own, were unable to present exculpatory evidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims or has created a new set of procedural complexities for the lower courts to navigate to ensure the availability of the Great Writ for diligent petitioners.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations lead me to agree with the courts of appeals that have concluded that a federal court should assess the reasonableness of a state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of clearly established federal law under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) in light of evidence properly admitted in a federal evidentiary hearing.  There is nothing \xe2\x80\x9cstrange\xe2\x80\x9d about this approach.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  Under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), federal courts routinely engage in analysis that the state court itself might never have conducted or did not conduct.  For example, when a state court summarily denies a claim without explanation, as the California Supreme Court did here, district courts must deny habeas relief pursuant to \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) so long as \xe2\x80\x9cthere is any reasonable argument\xe2\x80\x9d supporting the denial of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  <em>Harrington</em>, 562 U.

We likewise ask whether a state-court decision unreasonably applied clearly established federal law when the state court issued a reasoned decision but failed to cite federal law altogether.  See <em>Early</em> v. <em>Packer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/3/index.html">537 U. S. 3</a>, 8 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em>.

As noted above, we admonished district courts to consider whether a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, if proved true, would satisfy \xc2\xa72254(d) in determining whether to grant a hearing.  After highlighting the deference owed to state courts under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d) and 2254(e)(1), we stated:</font></p><font caps="1">\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing, a federal court must consider whether such a hearing could enable an applicant to prove the petition\xe2\x80\x99s factual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the\napplicant to federal habeas relief.  Because the deferential standards prescribed by \xc2\xa72254 control whether to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into account those standards in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d 550 U.

In rejecting that argument, we\nobserved:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA prisoner who developed his claim in state court and can prove the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was \xe2\x80\x98contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x99 is not barred from obtaining relief by \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  If the opening clause of \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) covers a request for an evidentiary hearing on a claim which was pursued with diligence but remained undeveloped in state court because, for instance, the prosecution concealed the facts, a prisoner lacking clear and convincing evidence of innocence could be barred from a hearing on the claim <em>even if he could satisfy \xc2\xa72254(d)</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 434 (citation omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nA petitioner in the latter situation would almost certainly be unable to \xe2\x80\x9csatisfy \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x9d without introducing the concealed facts in federal court.  This passage thus reflects our understanding that, in some circumstances, a petitioner might need an evidentiary hearing in federal court to prove the facts necessary to satisfy \xc2\xa72254(d).  To avoid foreclosing habeas relief for such petitioners, we concluded that \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) could not bear the warden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9charsh reading,\xe2\x80\x9d which essentially would have held petitioners strictly at fault for their inability to develop the facts in state court.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The majority today gives an equally \xe2\x80\x9charsh reading\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) to achieve the result we rejected in <em>Michael Williams</em>.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of the other cases cited by the majority supports its result.

However, we had no reason to decide whether the \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) inquiry was limited to the state-court record, as the District Court did not hold an evidentiary hearing in that case.  See <em>id.</em>, at 372.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Holland</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, we stated that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have made clear that whether a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was unreasonable must be assessed in light of the record the court had before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U.

This prompted discussion at sidebar regarding whether the State had provided notice of its intent to offer aggravating evidence.  Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s court-appointed attorney, Wilbur Dettmar, argued that the State should be precluded from offering aggravating evidence:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI am not presently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation.

His counsel later moved to modify the sentence to life imprisonment.

In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.  In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U.

Nor can Dr. Stalberg\xe2\x80\x99s two-page report, which was based on a very limited record and focused primarily on Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mental state at the time of\nthe homicides, excuse counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate the broader range of potential mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe record of the actual sentencing proceedings underscores the unreasonableness of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct by\nsuggesting that their failure to investigate thoroughly re-sulted from inattention, not reasoned strategic judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wiggins</em>, 539 U. S., at 526.  Dettmar told the trial judge that he was unprepared to present any mitigation evidence.  The mitigation case that counsel eventually put on can be described, at best, as \xe2\x80\x9chalfhearted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Counsel made no effort to bolster Brashear\xe2\x80\x99s self-interested testimony with school or medical records, as the prosecutor effectively emphasized in closing argument.  And because they did not pursue obvious leads, they failed to recognize that Brashear\xe2\x80\x99s testimony painting Pinholster as the bad apple in a normal, nondeprived family was false.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In denying Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s claim, the California Supreme Court necessarily overlooked <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s clearly established admonition that \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U. S., at 690\xe2\x80\x93691.  As in <em>Wiggins</em>, in light of the information available to Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, it is plain that \xe2\x80\x9creasonable professional judgments\xe2\x80\x9d could not have supported their woefully inadequate investigation.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  466 U.

Accordingly, the California Supreme Court could not reasonably have concluded that Pinholster had failed to allege that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s investigation was inadequate under <em>Strickland</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also concludes that the California Supreme Court could reasonably have concluded that Pinholster did not state a claim of prejudice.  This conclusion, in light of the overwhelming mitigating evidence that was not before the jury, is wrong.  To establish prejudice, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 694.  When a habeas petitioner challenges a death sentence, \xe2\x80\x9cthe question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer \xe2\x80\xa6 would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 695.  This inquiry requires evaluating \xe2\x80\x9cthe totality of the available mitigation evidence\xe2\x80\x94both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding\xe2\x80\x94in reweighing it against the evidence in aggravation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Terry Williams</em>, 529 U.

The ultimate question in this case is whether, taking into account all the mitigating and aggravating evidence, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wiggins</em>, 539 U. S., at 537; see Cal.

By virtue of its verdict in the guilt phase, the jury had already concluded that Pinholster had stabbed and killed the victims.  As the majority states, the jury saw Pinholster \xe2\x80\x9crevel\xe2\x80\x9d in his history of burglaries during the guilt phase.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  The jury heard evidence of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s violent tendencies: He had kidnapped someone with a knife, cut a person in the arm with a razor, and had a history of hitting and kicking people.  He threatened to kill the State\xe2\x80\x99s lead witness.  And he had an extensive disciplinary record in jail.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Brashear offered brief testimony that was apparently intended to be mitigating.  See <em>supra</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320; see also <em>ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  However, as the prosecutor argued, Brashear was not a neutral witness.  See 53 Tr. 7441 (\xe2\x80\x9cA mother clearly loves her son, ladies and gentlemen.  Clearly not the most unbiased witness in the world\xe2\x80\x9d).  Notwithstanding Brashear\xe2\x80\x99s obvious self-interest, counsel failed to offer readily available, objective evidence that would have substantiated and expanded on her testimony.  Their failure to do so allowed the prosecutor to belittle her testimony in closing argument.  See <em>supra</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  And Brashear\xe2\x80\x99s statement that Pinholster would not be alive much longer because he had \xe2\x80\x9ca chip in his head floating around,\xe2\x80\x9d 52 Tr. 7397, could only have undermined her credibility, as the prosecutor urged, see 53 <em>id.</em>, at 7447 (\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she want you to believe sometime before he got to country jail some doctor looked in a crystal ball and\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98In three years you are going to die\xe2\x80\x99?  That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous\xe2\x80\x9d).  The trial judge was thoroughly unimpressed with Brashear\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  See <em>supra</em>, at 20.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the evidence presented in Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s state-court petition revealed that Brashear distorted facts in her testimony in ways that undermined Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s mitigation case.  As in <em>Sears</em>, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3), the prosecutor used Brashear\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that Pinholster came from a good family against him.  See 53 Tr. 7442.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, counsel presented little in the way of mitigating evidence, and the prosecutor effectively used their halfhearted attempt to present a mitigation case to advocate for the death penalty.  The jury nonetheless took two days to reach a decision to impose a death sentence.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The additional mitigating evidence presented to the California Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9cadds up to a mitigation case that bears no relation\xe2\x80\x9d to Brashear\xe2\x80\x99s unsubstantiated testimony.  <em>Rompilla</em>, 545 U.

The family home was filled with violence.  Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s siblings had extremely troubled pasts.

Just months before the murders, a doctor had recommended that Pinholster be sent to a psychiatric institute.  Dr. Woods also explained that Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre behavior before the murders reflected \xe2\x80\x9c[a]uditory hallucinations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csevere psychosis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ER\xe2\x80\x93169.  The available records confirmed that Pinholster suffered from longstanding seizure disorders, which may have been caused by his childhood head injuries.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On this record, I do not see how it can be said that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he \xe2\x80\x98new\xe2\x80\x99 evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 29; see <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Fulminante</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/279/index.html">499 U.

The jury heard no testimony at all that Pinholster likely suffered from brain damage or bipolar mood disorder, and counsel offered no evidence to help the jury understand the likely effect of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s head injuries or his bizarre behavior on the night of the homicides.  The jury heard no testimony recounting the substantial evidence of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s likely neurological problems.  And it heard no medical evidence that Pinholster suffered from epilepsy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority responds that \xe2\x80\x9cmuch\xe2\x80\x9d of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s new mitigating evidence \xe2\x80\x9cis of questionable mitigating value.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 29.  By presenting psychiatric testimony, it contends, \xe2\x80\x9cPinholster would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state expert.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But, because the California Supreme Court denied Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s petition on the pleadings, it had no reason to know what a state expert might have said.  Moreover, given the record evidence, it is reasonably probable that at least one juror would have credited his expert.  In any event, even if a rebuttal expert testified that Pinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder, this would hardly have come as a surprise to the jury.  See <em>ante</em>, at 22 (describing Pinholster as a \xe2\x80\x9cpsychotic client whose performance at trial hardly endeared him to the jury\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is for this reason that it was especially important for counsel to present the available evidence to help the jury understand Pinholster.  See <em>Sears</em>, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Had counsel conducted an adequate investigation, the judge and jury would have heard credible evidence showing that Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s criminal acts and aggressive tendencies were \xe2\x80\x9cattributable to a disadvantaged background, or to emotional and mental problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Penry</em>, 492 U.

They would have learned that Pinholster had the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98kind of troubled history we have declared relevant to assessing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s moral culpability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Porter</em>, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting <em>Wiggins</em>, 539 U. S., at 535).  Applying <em>Strickland</em>, we have repeatedly found \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability,\xe2\x80\x9d 466 U. S., at 694, that the sentencer would have reached a different result had counsel presented similar evidence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Porter</em>, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313) (evidence of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s childhood history of physical abuse, brain abnormality, limited schooling, and heroic military service); <em>Rompilla</em>, 545 U.

S., at 535 (evidence of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csevere privation and abuse\xe2\x80\x9d as a child, homelessness, and \xe2\x80\x9cdiminished mental capacities\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Terry\nWilliams</em>, 529 U. S., at 398 (evidence of childhood\nmistreatment and neglect, head injuries, possible organic mental impairments, and borderline mental retardation).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority does not dispute the similarity between this case and the cited cases.  However, it criticizes the Court of Appeals for relying on <em>Rompilla</em> and <em>Terry Williams</em> on the ground that we reviewed the prejudice question <em>de novo</em> in those cases.  See <em>ante</em>, at 31.  I do not read <em>Terry Williams</em> to review the prejudice question <em>de novo</em>.[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  More fundamentally, however, I cannot agree with the premise that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hose cases \xe2\x80\xa6 offer no guidance with respect to whether a state court has unreasonably determined that prejudice is lacking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 31 (emphasis deleted).  In each of these cases, we did not purport to create new law; we simply applied the same clearly established precedent, <em>Strickland</em>, to a different set of facts.  Because these cases illuminate the kinds of mitigation evidence that suffice to establish prejudice under <em>Strickland</em>, they provide useful, but not dispositive, guidance for courts to consider when determining whether a state court has unreasonably applied <em>Strickland</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In many cases, a state court presented with additional mitigation evidence will reasonably conclude that there is no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 694.  This is not such a case.  Admittedly, Pinholster unjustifiably stabbed and killed two people, and his history of violent outbursts and burglaries surely did not endear him to the jury.  But the homicides did not appear premeditated.  And the State\xe2\x80\x99s aggravation case was no stronger than in <em>Rompilla</em> and <em>Terry Williams</em>.  See 545 U. S., at 378, 383 (the defendant committed murder by torture and had a significant history of violent felonies, including a rape); 529 U. S., at 418 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (the defendant had a lifetime of crime, and after the murder he \xe2\x80\x9csavagely beat an elderly woman,\xe2\x80\x9d set a home on fire, and stabbed a man (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Even on the trial record, it took the jury two days to decide on a penalty.  The contrast between the \xe2\x80\x9cnot persuasive\xe2\x80\x9d mitigation case put on by Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, 54 Tr. 7514, and the substantial mitigation evidence at their fingertips was stark.  Given these considerations, it is not a foregone conclusion, as the majority deems it, that a juror familiar with his troubled background and psychiatric issues would have reached the same conclusion regarding Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s culpability.  Fairminded jurists could not doubt that, on the record before the California Supreme Court, \xe2\x80\x9cthere [was] a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wiggins</em>, 539 U. S., at 537.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state-court record on its own was more than adequate to support the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that the California Supreme Court could not reasonably have rejected Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Strickland</em> claim.  The additional evidence presented in the federal evidentiary hearing only confirms that conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the hearing, Pinholster offered many of the same documents that were before the state habeas court.  He also offered his trial attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 billing records, which were before the state habeas court as part of the trial record.  Of the seven lay witnesses who testified at the hearing, six had previously executed declarations in support of Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s state-court petition.  (The seventh, Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, provided testimony cumulative of other testimony.)</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two experts testified on Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s behalf; neither had presented declarations to the state habeas court.  The first was Dr. Donald Olson, assistant professor of neurology and neurological sciences and director of the Pediatric Epilepsy Program at Stanford University Medical Center.  It appears that Pinholster retained Dr. Olson to rebut the testimony of the expert disclosed by the State in the federal proceeding.  See  Decl. of Michael D. Abzug in Support of Stipulated <em>Ex Parte</em> Application to Continue Evidentiary Hearing and Discovery Cut-Off and to Substitute Counsel in <em>Pinholster</em> v. <em>Calderon</em>, No. CV 95\xe2\x80\x936240\xe2\x80\x93GLT (CD Cal.), p.\xc2\xa02.  Relying in part on Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s abnormal EEG, Dr. Olson opined that Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s childhood accidents \xe2\x80\x9clikely result[ed] in brain injury\xe2\x80\x9d and that these injuries \xe2\x80\x9cconferred a risk of epilepsy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record ER\xe2\x80\x93699 to ER\xe2\x80\x93700.  He concluded that it was reasonably probable that Pinholster had suffered from partial epilepsy since at least 1968 and had suffered from brain injury since at least 1964.  <em>Id.</em>, at ER\xe2\x80\x93701.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s second expert was Dr. Sophia Vinogradov, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco.  Dr. Vinogradov\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was based on essentially the same facts as Dr. Woods\xe2\x80\x99 and Dr. Stalberg\xe2\x80\x99s state-court declarations.  She highlighted Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s childhood head traumas, history of epilepsy, abusive and neglected upbringing, history of substance abuse, and bizarre behavior on the night of the homicides.  She opined that his aggressive behavior resulted from childhood head traumas:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAll data indicates that there were severe effects of the two serious head injuries sustained at age 2 and age 3, with evidence for behavioral changes related to dysfunction of frontal cortex: severe attentional and learning problems in childhood, hyperactivity, aggressivity, impulsivity, social-emotional impairment, seizure disorder, and explosive dyscontrol.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ER\xe2\x80\x93731.</p>\n<p align="left">\nShe also opined that, right before the homicides, Pinholster was in an \xe2\x80\x9capparently hallucinatory state [that] was likely the result of his intoxication with multiple substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ER\xe2\x80\x93707</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State presented two experts: Dr. Stalberg, the psychiatrist who had examined Pinholster in the middle of trial,[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] and Dr. David Rudnick.  Although Dr. Stalberg maintained that Pinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder, which was his original diagnosis in the middle of trial, he again emphasized that there was \xe2\x80\x9cvoluminous\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling\xe2\x80\x9d mitigation evidence that had not previously been made available to him or presented to the jury.  <em>Id.</em>, at ER\xe2\x80\x93926, ER\xe2\x80\x93953.  He stated that conversations with Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s family revealed that he and his siblings were \xe2\x80\x9craised like animals, wild animals,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at ER\xe2\x80\x93948, and he opined that Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s upbringing was a risk factor for antisocial personality disorder.  See <em>ibid.</em> (Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s upbringing \xe2\x80\x9cwould speak volumes, looking at it from a mitigation point of view\xe2\x80\x9d).

Dr. Rudnick testified that Pinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State also introduced into evidence the 1978 probation report that Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had in their possession at the time of his trial.  The report demonstrated that counsel were aware that Pinholster was in classes for educationally handicapped children, that he was committed to a state hospital for emotionally handicapped children, and that he suffered two \xe2\x80\x9csevere head injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at SER\xe2\x80\x93243.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Much of the evidence presented at the federal hearing was duplicative of the evidence submitted to the California Supreme Court.

Although the State presented testimony that Pinholster had antisocial personality disorder, it was not clear error for the District Court to conclude that jurors could have credited Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s experts.  Even the State\xe2\x80\x99s own expert, Dr. Stalberg, testified to the \xe2\x80\x9cvoluminous\xe2\x80\x9d mitigation evidence in Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s case.

At a prehearing deposition, however, Dr. Stalberg revised his opinion and stated that he continued to believe that Pinholster suffered from psychopathic personality traits.  After the deposition, Pinholster elected to proceed with a different expert, presumably in light of Dr. Stalberg\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected change in position.  The State then retained Dr. Stalberg as its own expert.</p>\n<a href="#T29" name="F29">Footnote 29</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The State argues that the District Court was not entitled to rely on the evidence adduced at the hearing because Pinholster was not diligent in developing his claims in state court and the hearing was therefore barred by 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(e)(2).  This argument is somewhat imprecise.  Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s allegations in his amended federal petition were \xe2\x80\x9cidentical\xe2\x80\x9d to the allegations he presented to the California Supreme Court, <em>ante</em>, at 6, and he diligently requested a hearing in state court.  The State presumably means to argue that Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s new expert testimony changed \xe2\x80\x9cthe factual basis\xe2\x80\x9d of his claim such that, by the time of the evidentiary hearing, he no longer satisfied \xc2\xa72254(e)(2).  However, at oral argument, the State suggested that Pinholster was presenting an altogether new claim in the federal court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18.  If that is the case, \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) does not apply at all, and the State should be arguing lack of exhaustion or procedural default.  I do not understand Pinholster to have presented a new claim to the District Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, Pinholster satisfied \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) in this case.

S., at 435.  His experts relied on the very same facts and evidence.  I cannot read \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) to impose a strict requirement that petitioners must use the same experts they presented to the state court.  This rule would result in numerous practical problems, for example in the case of the unanticipated death of an expert.</p>\n<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s challenge in this Court is limited to the questions whether the Federal District Court was entitled to consider the additional evidence in the \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) analysis and whether Pinholster satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court record.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) does not leave AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s hearing section, \xc2\xa72254(e), without work to do.  An offender who believes he is entitled to habeas relief must first present a claim (including his evidence) to the state courts.  If the state courts reject the claim, then a federal habeas court may review that rejection on the basis of the materials considered by the state court.  If the federal habeas court finds that the state-court decision fails (d)\xe2\x80\x99s test (or if (d) does not apply), then an (e) hearing may be needed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, if the state-court rejection assumed the habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s facts (deciding that, <em>even if </em>those facts were true, federal law was not violated), then (after finding the state court wrong on a (d) ground) an (e) hearing might be needed to determine whether the facts alleged were indeed true.  Or if the state-court rejection rested on a state ground, which a federal habeas court found inadequate, then an (e) hearing might be needed to consider the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s (now unblocked) substantive federal claim.  Or if the state-court rejection rested on only one of several related federal grounds (<em>e.g.</em>, that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s assistance was not \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate\xe2\x80\x9d), then, if the federal court found that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in respect to the ground it decided violated (d), an (e) hearing might be needed to consider other related parts of the whole constitutional claim (<em>e.g.</em>, whether the counsel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate\xe2\x80\x9d assistance was also prejudicial).  There may be other situations in which an (e) hearing is needed as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, however, we cannot say whether an (e) hearing is needed until we know whether the state court, in rejecting Pinholster\xe2\x80\x99s claim on the basis presented to that state court, violated (d).  (In my view, the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 analysis in respect to this matter is inadequate.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no role in (d) analysis for a habeas petitioner to introduce evidence that was not first presented to the state courts.  But that does not mean that Pinholster is without recourse to present new evidence.  He can always return to state court presenting new evidence not previously presented.  If the state court again denies relief, he might be able to return to federal court to make claims related to the latest rejection, subject to AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations on successive petitions.  See \xc2\xa72244.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I am not trying to predict the future course of these proceedings.  I point out only that, in my view, AEDPA is not designed to take necessary remedies from a habeas petitioner but to give the State a first opportunity to consider most matters and to insist that federal courts properly respect state-court determinations.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></font></div>'
