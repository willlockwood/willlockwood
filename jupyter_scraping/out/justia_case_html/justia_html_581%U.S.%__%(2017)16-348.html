Other Code provisions are still more difficult to square with Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  For example, \xc2\xa7502(b)(1) says that if a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cunenforceable\xe2\x80\x9d it will be disallowed, not that it is not a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Other provisions make clear that the running of a limitations period constitutes an affirmative defense that a debtor is to assert after the creditor makes a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502, 558.  The law has long treated unenforceability of a claim (due to the expiration of the limitations period) as an affirmative defense, and there is nothing misleading or deceptive in the filing of a proof of claim that follows the Code\xe2\x80\x99s similar system.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Indeed, to determine whether a statement is misleading normally \xe2\x80\x9crequires consideration of the legal sophistication of its audience,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Bates</i> v. <i>State Bar of Ariz.</i>,\n\n433 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350\n, which in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy includes a trustee who is likely to understand that a proof of claim is a statement by the creditor that he or she has a right to payment that is subject to disallowance, including disallowance based on untimeliness.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Several circumstances, taken together, lead to the conclusion that Midland\xe2\x80\x99s proof of claim was not \xe2\x80\x9cunfair\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunconscionable\xe2\x80\x9d within the terms of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Johnson points out that several lower courts have found or indicated that, in the context of an ordinary civil action to collect a debt, a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of a claim known to be time barred is \xe2\x80\x9cunfair.\xe2\x80\x9d  But those courts rested their conclusions upon their concern that a consumer might unwittingly repay a time-barred debt.  Such considerations have significantly diminished force in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, where the consumer initiates the proceeding, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301, 303(a); where a knowledgeable trustee is available, see \xc2\xa71302(a); where procedural rules more directly guide the evaluation of claims, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3001(c)(3)(A); and where the claims resolution process is \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally a more streamlined and less unnerving prospect for a debtor than facing a collection lawsuit,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>In\xc2\xa0re Gatewood</i>, 533 B.\xc2\xa0R. 905, 909.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Also unpersuasive is Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s argument that there is no legitimate reason for allowing a practice like this one that risks harm to the debtor.  The bankruptcy system treats untimeliness as an affirmative defense and normally gives the trustee the burden of investigating claims to see if one is stale.  And, at least on occasion, the assertion of even a stale claim can benefit the debtor.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">More importantly, a change in the simple affirmative-defense approach, carving out an exception, would require defining the exception\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries.  Does it apply only where a claim\xe2\x80\x99s staleness appears on the face of the proof of claim?  Does it apply to other affirmative defenses or only to the running of the limitations period? Neither the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act nor the Bankruptcy Code indicates that Congress intended an ordinary civil court applying the Act to determine answers to such bankruptcy-related questions.  The Act and the Code have different purposes and structural features.  The Act seeks to help consumers by preventing consumer bankruptcies in the first place, while the Code creates and maintains the \xe2\x80\x9cdelicate balance of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s protections and obligations,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Kokoszka</i> v. <i>Belford</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 642\n.

In this case, a debt collector filed a written statement in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding claiming that the debtor owed the debt collector money.  The statement made clear, however, that the 6-year statute of limitations governing collection of the claimed debt had long since run.  The question before us is whether the debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s filing of that statement falls within the scope of the aforementioned provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In March 2014, Aleida Johnson, the respondent, filed for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code (or Code),\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq</i>, in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Alabama<i>.  </i>Two months later, Midland Funding, LLC, the petitioner, filed a \xe2\x80\x9cproof of claim,\xe2\x80\x9d a written statement asserting that Johnson owed Midland a credit-card debt of $1,879.71.  The statement added that the last time any charge appeared on Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s account was in May 2003, more than 10 years before Johnson filed for bankruptcy.  The relevant statute of limitations is six years.  See Ala. Code \xc2\xa76\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x9334 (2014).  Johnson, represented by counsel, objected to the claim; Midland did not respond to the objection; and the Bankruptcy Court disallowed the claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Subsequently, Johnson brought this lawsuit against Midland seeking actual damages, statutory damages, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and costs for a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  See\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692k.  The District Court decided that the Act did not apply and therefore dismissed the action.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit disagreed and reversed the District Court.  823 F.\xc2\xa03d 1334 (2016).  Midland filed a petition for certiorari, noting a division of opinion among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether the conduct at issue here is \xe2\x80\x9cfalse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdeceptive,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmisleading,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunconscionable,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunfair\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Act.

And, she concludes, Midland\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproof of claim\xe2\x80\x9d was false (or deceptive or misleading) because its \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d was not enforceable.  Brief for Respondent 22; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18\xe2\x80\x9320 (making a similar argument).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But we do not find this argument convincing.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cenforceable\xe2\x80\x9d does not appear in the Code\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cclaim.\xe2\x80\x9d  See\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101(5).  The Court in <i>Davenport</i> likely used the word \xe2\x80\x9cenforceable\xe2\x80\x9d descriptively, for that case involved an enforceable debt.  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 559.  And it is difficult to square Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation with our later statement that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to adopt the broadest available definition of \xe2\x80\x98claim.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>Home State Bank</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 78,\n83 (1991)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is still more difficult to square Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation with other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  Section 502(b)(1) of the Code, for example, says that, if a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cunenforceable,\xe2\x80\x9d it will be disallowed.  It does not say that an \xe2\x80\x9cunenforceable\xe2\x80\x9d claim is not a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Similarly, \xc2\xa7101(5)(A) says that a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cright to payment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not such right is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fixed, <i>contingent</i>, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [or] <i>disputed</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  If a contingency does not arise, or if a claimant loses a dispute, then the claim is unenforce-able.  Yet this section makes clear that the unenforceable claim is nonetheless a \xe2\x80\x9cright to payment,\xe2\x80\x9d hence a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Code uses those terms.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Johnson looks for support to other provisions that govern bankruptcy proceedings, including \xc2\xa7502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states that a claim will be allowed in the absence of an objection, and Rule 3001(f) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which states that a properly filed \xe2\x80\x9cproof of claim .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  But these provisions do not discuss the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9cclaim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, they restate the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x99s system for determining whether a claim will be allowed.  Other provisions make clear that the running of a limitations period constitutes an affirmative defense, a defense that the debtor is to assert after a creditor makes a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502, 558.  The law has long treated unenforceability of a claim (due to the expiration of the limitations period) as an affirmative defense.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa08(c)(1); 13 Encyclopaedia of Pleading and Practice 200 (W. McKinney ed. 1898).  And we see nothing misleading or deceptive in the filing of a proof of claim that, in effect, follows the Code\xe2\x80\x99s similar system.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, to determine whether a statement is misleading normally \xe2\x80\x9crequires consideration of the legal sophistication of its audience.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bates </i>v. <i>State Bar of Ariz.</i>,\n\n433 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350\n, n.\xc2\xa037 (1977).  The audience in Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases includes a trustee,\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71302(a), who must examine proofs of claim and, where appropriate, pose an objection, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7704(a)(5), 1302(b)(1) (including any timeliness objection, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502(b)(1), 558).  And that trustee is likely to understand that, as the Code says, a proof of claim is a statement by the creditor that he or she has a right to payment subject to disallowance (includingdisallowance based upon, and following, the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s objection for untimeliness).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101(5)(A), 502(b), 704(a)(5), 1302(b)(1).

First, Johnson points out that several lower courts have found or indicated that, in the context of an ordinary civil action to collect a debt, a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of a claim known to be time barred is \xe2\x80\x9cunfair.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g., Phillips </i>v. <i>Asset Acceptance, LLC</i>, 736 F.\xc2\xa03d 1076, 1079 (CA7 2013) (holding as much); <i>Kimber </i>v. <i>Federal Financial Corp.</i>, 668 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1480, 1487 (MD Ala. 1987) (same); <i>Huertas </i>v. <i>Galaxy Asset Management</i>, 641 F.\xc2\xa03d 28, 32\xe2\x80\x9333 (CA3 2011) (indicating as much); <i>Castro </i>v. <i>Collecto, Inc.</i>, 634 F.\xc2\xa03d 779, 783 (CA5 2011) (same); <i>Freyermuth </i>v. <i>Credit Bureau Servs., Inc.</i>, 248 F.\xc2\xa03d 767, 771 (CA8 2001) (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We are not convinced, however, by this precedent.  It considers a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s assertion <i>in a civil suit</i> of a claim known to be stale.  We assume, for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that the precedent is correct in that context (a matter this Court itself has not decided and does not now decide).  But the context of a civil suit differs significantly from the present context, that of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding.  The lower courts rested their conclusions upon their concern that a consumer might unwittingly repay a time-barred debt.  Thus the Seventh Circuit pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98few unsophisticated consumers would be aware that a statute of limitations could be used to defend against lawsuits based on stale debts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Phillips</i>,<i> supra,</i> at 1079 (quoting <i>Kimber</i>,<i> supra,</i> at 1487).  The \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98passage of time,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Circuit wrote, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dulls the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s memory of the circumstances and validity of the debt\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and the consumer may no longer have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98personal records.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  736 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1079 (quoting <i>Kimber</i>,<i> supra,</i> at 1487).  Moreover, a consumer might pay a stale debt simply to avoid the cost and embarrassment of suit.  736 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1079.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These considerations have significantly diminished force in the context of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  The consumer initiates such a proceeding, see 11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301, 303(a), and consequently the consumer is not likely to pay a stale claim just to avoid going to court.  A knowledgeable trustee is available.  See \xc2\xa71302(a).  Procedural bankruptcyrules more directly guide the evaluation of claims.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3001(c)(3)(A); Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on Rule 3001\xe2\x80\x932011 Amdt., 11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 678.  And, as the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel put it, the claims resolution process is \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally a more streamlined and less unnerving prospect for a debtor than facing a collection lawsuit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Gatewood</i>, 533 B.\xc2\xa0R. 905, 909 (2015); see also, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7502 (outlining generally the claims resolution process).  These features of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding make it considerably more likely that an effort to collect upon a stale claim in bankruptcy will be met with resistance, objection, and disallowance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, Johnson argues that the practice at least risks harm to the debtor and that there is not \xe2\x80\x9ca single legitimate reason\xe2\x80\x9d for allowing this kind of behavior.  Brief for Respondent 32.  Would it not be obviously \xe2\x80\x9cunfair,\xe2\x80\x9d she asks, for a debt collector to adopt a practice of buying up stale claims cheaply and asserting them in bankruptcy knowing they are stale and hoping for careless trustees?  The United States, supporting Johnson, adds its view that the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure make the practice open to sanction, and argues that sanctionable conduct is unfair conduct.  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011(b)(2) (sanction possible if party violates the Rule that by \xe2\x80\x9cpresenting to the [bankruptcy] court\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9cpaper,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cparty is certifying that to the best of\xe2\x80\x9d his or her \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the claims .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. therein are warranted by existing law\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We are ultimately not persuaded by these arguments.  The bankruptcy system, as we have already noted, treats untimeliness as an affirmative defense.  The trustee normally bears the burden of investigating claims and pointing out that a claim is stale.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Moreover, protections available in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding minimize the risk to the debtor.  See <i>supra,</i> at 6.  And, at least on occasion, the assertion of even a stale claim can benefit a debtor.  Its filing and disallowance \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the debt.\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71328(a).  And that discharge means that the debt (even if unenforceable) will not remain on a credit report potentially affecting an individual\xe2\x80\x99s ability to borrow money, buy a home, and perhaps secure employment.  See\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681c(a)(4) (debt may remain on a credit report for seven years); cf. Ala. Code \xc2\xa76\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x9334 (6-year statute of limitations); Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x93101 (2013) (3-year statute of limitations); cf.<i> </i>16 CFR pt. 600, App. \xc2\xa7607, \xc2\xb66 (1991) (a credit report may include discharged debt only if \xe2\x80\x9cthe debt [is reported] as having a zero balance due to reflect the fact that the consumer is no longer liable for the discharged debt\xe2\x80\x9d); FTC, 40 Years of Experience with the Fair Credit Reporting Act: An FTC Staff Report with Summary of Interpretations 66 (2011) (similar).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More importantly, a change in the simple affirmative-defense approach, carving out an exception, itself would require defining the boundaries of the exception.  Does it apply only where (as Johnson alleged in the complaint) a claim\xe2\x80\x99s staleness appears \xe2\x80\x9con [the] face\xe2\x80\x9d of the proof of claim?  Does it apply to other affirmative defenses or only to the running of a limitations period?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time, we do not find in either the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act or the Bankruptcy Code good reason to believe that Congress intended an ordinary civil court applying the Act to determine answers to these bankruptcy-related questions.  The Act and the Code have different purposes and structural features.  The Act seeks to help consumers, not necessarily by closing what Johnson and the United States characterize as a loophole inthe Bankruptcy Code, but by preventing consumer bankruptcies in the first place.  See, <i>e.g.,</i>\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692(a) (recognizing the \xe2\x80\x9cabundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices [which] contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies\xe2\x80\x9d); see also \xc2\xa71692(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cExisting laws and procedures .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are inadequate to protect consumers\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71692(e) (statute seeks to \xe2\x80\x9celiminate abusive debt collection practices\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Bankruptcy Code, by way of contrast, creates and maintains what we have called the \xe2\x80\x9cdelicate balance of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s protections and obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kokoszka </i>v. <i>Belford</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 642,\n651 (1974)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To find the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applicable here would upset that \xe2\x80\x9cdelicate balance.\xe2\x80\x9d  From a sub-stantive perspective it would authorize a new significant bankruptcy-related remedy in the absence of language in the Code providing for it.  Administratively, it would permit postbankruptcy litigation in an ordinary civil court concerning a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind\xe2\x80\x94a matter often hard to determine.  See\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692k(c) (safe harbor for any debt collector who \xe2\x80\x9cshows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error\xe2\x80\x9d).  Procedurally, it would require creditors (who assert a claim) to investigate the merits of an affirmative defense (typically the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s job to assert and prove) lest the creditor later be found to have known the claim was untimely.  The upshot could well be added complexity, changes in settlement incentives, and a shift from the debtor to the creditor the obligation to investigate the staleness of a claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the United States, we do not believe that the Advisory Committee on Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure settled the issue when it promulgated Bankruptcy Rule 9011.  The Committee, in considering amendments to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure in 2009, specifically rejected a proposal that would have required a creditor to certify that there is no valid statute of limitations defense.  See Agenda Book for Meeting<i> </i>86\xe2\x80\x9387 (Mar. 26\xe2\x80\x9327, 2009).  It did so in part because the working group did not want to impose an affirmative obligation on a creditor to make a prefiling investigation of a potential time-bar defense.  <i>Ibid.</i>  In rejecting that proposal, the Committee did note that Rule 9011 imposes a general \xe2\x80\x9cobligation on a claimant to undertake an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances to determine .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that a claim is warranted by existing law and that factual contentions have evidentiary support,\xe2\x80\x9d and to certify as much on the proof of claim.  <i>Id.</i>, at 87.  The Committee also acknowledged, however, that this requirement would \xe2\x80\x9cnot addres[s] the statute of limitation issue,\xe2\x80\x9d but would only ensure \xe2\x80\x9cthe accuracy of the information provided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We recognize that one Bankruptcy Court has held that filing a time-barred claim without a prefiling investigation of a potential time-bar defense merits sanctions under Rule 9011.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Sekema</i>, 523 B.\xc2\xa0R. 651, 654 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ind. 2015).  But others have held to the contrary.  See, <i>e.g., In\xc2\xa0re Freeman</i>, 540 B.\xc2\xa0R. 129, 143\xe2\x80\x93144 (Bkrtcy. Ct.

Debt buyers now hold hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer debt; indeed, a study conducted by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2009 found that nine of the leading debt buyers had purchased over $140 billion in debt just in the previous three years.

Because a creditor (or a debt collector) cannot enforce a time-barred debt in court, the debt is inherently worth very little indeed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But statutes of limitations have not deterred debt buyers.

Importantly, the debt buyers\xe2\x80\x99 only hope in these cases is that consumers will fail either to invoke the statute of limitations or to respond at all: In most States the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, meaning that a consumer must appear in court and raise it in order to dismiss the suit.

The same debt buyers that for years filed thousands of lawsuits in state courts across the country have begun to do the same thing in bankruptcy courts\xe2\x80\x94specifically, in cases governed by Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, which allows consumers earning regular incomes to restructure their debts and repay as many as they can over a period of several years.  See 8 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb61300.01 (A. Resnick &amp; H. Sommer eds., 16th ed. 2016).  As in ordinary civil cases, a debtor in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding is entitled to have dismissed any claim filed against his estate that is barred by a statute of limitations.  See\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7558.  As in ordinary civil cases, the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, one that must be raised by either the debtor or the trustee of his estate before it is honored.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502, 558.

As one thoughtful opinion explains:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cBecause few unsophisticated consumers would be aware that a statute of limitations could be used to defend against lawsuits based on stale debts, such consumers would unwittingly acquiesce to such lawsuits.  And, even if the consumer realizes that she can use time as a defense, she will more than likely still give in rather than fight the lawsuit because she must still expend energy and resources and subject herself to the embarrassment of going into court to present the defense .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kimber</i>, 668 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 1487.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Debt buyers\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to pursue stale debt in ordinary civil litigation may also entrap debtors into forfeiting their time defenses altogether.  When a debt collector sues or threatens to sue to collect a debt, many consumers respond by offering a small partial payment to forestall suit.  In many States, a consumer who makes an offer like this has\xe2\x80\x94unbeknownst to him\xe2\x80\x94forever given up his ability to claim the debt is unenforceable.  That is because in most States a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s partial payment on a time-barred debt\xe2\x80\x94or his promise to resume payments on such a debt\xe2\x80\x94will restart the statute of limitations.  FTC Report 47; see, <i>e.g., Young</i> v. <i>Sorenson</i>, 47 Cal. App. 3d 911, 914, 121 Cal. Rptr. 236, 237 (1975) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The theory on which this is based is that the payment is an acknowledgement on the existence of the indebtedness which raises an implied promise to continue the obligation and to pay the balance\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Debt collectors\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to entrap consumers in this way have no place in honest business practice.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The same dynamics are present in bankruptcy proceedings.  A proof of claim filed in bankruptcy court represents the debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s belief that it is entitled to payment, even though the debt should not be enforced as a matter of public policy.  The debtor\xe2\x80\x99s claim will be allowed, and will be incorporated in a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s payment plan, unless the debtor or his trustee objects.  But such objections require ordinary and unsophisticated people (and their overworked trustees) to be on guard not only against mistaken claims but also against claims that debt collectors know will fail under law if an objection is raised.  Debt collectors do not file these claims in good faith; they file them hoping and expecting that the bankruptcy system will fail.  Such a practice is \xe2\x80\x9cunfair\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunconscionable\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the FDCPA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court disagrees.  But it does so on narrow grounds.  To begin with, the Court does not hold that the Bankruptcy Code altogether displaces the FDCPA, leaving it withno role to play in bankruptcy proceedings.  Such a conclusion would be wrong.  Although the Code and the FDCPA \xe2\x80\x9chave different purposes and structural features,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 8, the Court has held that Congress, in passing the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, did so on the understanding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe provisions and the purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of the two statutes were intended to \xe2\x80\x9ccoexist.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kokoszka</i> v. <i>Belford</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 642,\n650 (1974)\n.  Although petitioner suggests that the FDCPA is best read \xe2\x80\x9cto have no application to [a] debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\xe2\x80\x9d in a bankruptcy proceeding, Brief for Petitioner 41, the majority declines its invitation to adopt such a sweeping rule.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does the majority take a position on whether a debt collector violates the FDCPA by filing suit in an ordinary court to collect a debt it knows is time barred.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.  Instead, the majority concludes, even assuming that such a practice would violate the FDCPA, a debt collector does not violate the Act by doing the same thing in bankruptcy proceedings.  Bankruptcy, the majority argues, is different.  True enough.  But none of the distinctions that the majority identifies bears the weight placed on it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the majority contends, structural features of the bankruptcy process reduce the risk that a stale debt will go unnoticed and thus be allowed.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  But there is virtually no evidence that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s theory holds true in practice.  The majority relies heavily on the presence of a bankruptcy trustee, appointed to act on the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s behalf and empowered to (among other things) object to claims that he believes lack merit.  See 11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7704(a)(5), 1302(b).  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s gatekeeping role makes it \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderably more likely that an effort to collect upon a stale claim in bankruptcy will be met with resistance, objection, and disallowance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  The problem with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s <i>ipse dixit</i> is that everyone with actual experience in the matter insists that it is false.  The Government, which oversees bankruptcy trustees, tells us that trustees \xe2\x80\x9ccannot realistically be expected to identify every time-barred .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. claim filed in every bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25\xe2\x80\x9326; see also <i>Resurgent</i> Complaint \xc2\xb643 (\xe2\x80\x9cFiling objections to all of [one collector]\xe2\x80\x99s unenforceable claims would clog the docket of this Court and other courts with objections to frivolous claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  The trustees themselves (appearing here as <i>amici curiae</i>) agree, describing the practice as \xe2\x80\x9cwasteful\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexploit[ative].\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for National Association of Chapter Thirteen Trustees as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 12.  And courts across the country recognize that Chapter 13 trustees are struggling under a \xe2\x80\x9cdeluge\xe2\x80\x9d of stale debt.  <i>Crawford</i>, 758 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1256.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the other features of the bankruptcy process that the majority believes will serve as a backstop against frivolous claims are even less likely to do so in practice.  The majority implies that a person who files for bankruptcy is more sophisticated than the average consumer debtor because the initiation of bankruptcy is a choice made by a debtor.  <i>Ante, </i>at 6.  But a person who has filed for bankruptcy will rarely be in such a superior position; he has, after all, just declared that he is unable to meet his financial obligations and in need of the assistance of the courts.  It is odd to speculate that such a person is better situated to monitor court filings and lodge objections than an ordinary consumer.  The majority also suggests that the rules of bankruptcy help \xe2\x80\x9cguide the evaluation of claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But the rules of bankruptcy in fact facilitate the <i>allowance</i> of claims: Claims are automatically allowed and made part of a plan unless an objection is made.  See\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7502(a).  A debtor is arguably more vulnerable in bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x94not less\xe2\x80\x94to the oversights that the debt buyers know will occur.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the majority suggests, in some cases a consumer will actually <i>benefit</i> if a claim for an untimely debt is filed.  <i>Ante, </i>at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  If such a claim is filed but disallowed, the majority explains, the debt will eventually be discharged, and the creditor will be barred from collecting it.  See \xc2\xa71328(a).  Here, too, practice refutes the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rosy portrait of these proceedings.  A debtor whose trustee does not spot and object to a stale debt will find no comfort  in the knowledge that <i>other</i> consumers with more attentive trustees may have their debts disallowed and discharged.  Moreover, given the high rate at which debtors are unable to fully pay off their debts in Chapter 13 proceedings, see Porter, The Pretend Solution: An Empirical Study of Bankruptcy Outcomes, 90 Texas L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 103, 111\xe2\x80\x93112 (2011), most debtors who fail to object to a stale claim will end up worse off than had they never entered bankruptcy at all: They will make payments on the stale debts, thereby resuscitating them, see <i>supra</i>, at\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937, and may thuswalk out of bankruptcy court owing more to their creditors than they did when they entered it.  There is no benefit to anyone in such a proceeding\xe2\x80\x94except the debt collectors.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It does not take a sophisticated attorney to understand why the practice I have described in this opinion is unfair.  It takes only the common sense to conclude that one should not be able to profit on the inadvertent inattention of others.  It is said that the law should not be a trap for the unwary.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision sets just such a trap.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I take comfort only in the knowledge that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today need not be the last word on the matter.

For one, nothing requires a debtor to engage in satellite litigation in order to sue a debt collector under the FDCPA; a debtor can easily file an adversary proceeding asserting an FDCPA claim with the bankruptcy court itself, and in many cases will be better served by doing so.  See, <i>e.g., Simon</i> v. <i>FIA Card Servs., N.\xc2\xa0A.</i>, 732 F.\xc2\xa03d 259, 263 (CA3 2013).  Nor is there any risk that finding the FDCPA applicable here will authorize bankruptcy courts (or, for that matter, civil courts) to engage in novel and unfettered inquiries into \xe2\x80\x9ca creditor\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 9.
