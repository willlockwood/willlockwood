Whether the failure to comply by persons owning and controlling the said bridge with the order of the Secretary of War can lawfully subject them to a prosecution for a misdemeanor."</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The appellate jurisdiction of this Court is defined by the acts of Congress.  By section 6 of the Act of April 29, 1802, 2 Stat. 159, c. 31, whenever there was a division of opinion in the circuit court upon a question of law, the question might be certified to this Court for decision, provided that the case might proceed in the circuit court if in its opinion further proceedings could be had without prejudice to the merits, and that no imprisonment should be allowed or punishment inflicted upon which the judges were divided in opinion.</p>\n<p>In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/542/case.html">United States v. Daniels,</a></span></em> 6 Wheat. 542,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/542/case.html#547">19 U. S. 547</a></span>, Chief Justice Marshall explained that</p>\n<p>"previous to the passage of that act, the circuit courts were composed of three judges, and the judges of the supreme court changed their circuits.  If all the judges were present, no division of opinion could take place.  If only one judge of the supreme court should attend and a division should take place, the cause was continued till the next term, when a different judge would attend.  Should the same division continue, there would then be the opinion of two judges against one, and the law provided that in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 163 U. S. 136</a></p><p> such case that opinion should be the judgment of the court."</p>\n<p>Act March 2, 1793, 1 Stat. 333, c. 22, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2, 333; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/35/286/case.html">Davis v. Braden,</a></span></em> 10 Pet. 286.  But, continued the Chief Justice, the act of 1802 made the judges of the Supreme Court stationary, so that the same judges constantly attended the same circuit, and, the court being always composed of the same two judges, any division of opinion would remain, and the question continue unsettled. "To remedy this inconvenience, the clause under consideration was introduced."  6 Wheat.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/542/case.html#548">19 U. S. 548</a></span>; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html">Ex Parte Milligan,</a></span></em> 4 Wall. 2.</p>\n<p>The Act of April 10, 1869, 16 Stat. 44, c. 22, provided for the appointment of a circuit judge in each circuit, but this did not repeal the act of 1802, as the same necessity existed as before for the power to certify questions.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/1/case.html">Insurance Co. v. Dunham,</a></span></em> 11 Wall. 1.</p>\n<p>By the Act of June 1, 1872, 17 Stat. 196, c. 255, whenever, in any proceedings or suit in a circuit court there occurred any difference of opinion between the judges, the opinion of the presiding judge was to prevail for the time being, but upon the entry of a final judgment, decree, or order, and a certificate of division of opinion as under the act of 1802, either party might remove the case to this Court on writ of error or appeal, according to the nature of the case.  This act continued in force about two years, when it was supplanted by sections 650, 652, and 693 of the Revised Statutes, by which its provisions were restricted to civil suits and proceedings, and by sections 651 and 697 the provisions of section 6 of the act of 1802 were reenacted as to criminal cases.  <em>United States v.

S. 138</a></p><p> of opinion was entirely obviated, and the provision for a certificate operated to give the benefit of review where the amount in controversy was less than that prescribed as essential to our jurisdiction, while as to criminal cases a certificate of division was the only mode in which alleged errors could be reviewed.</p>\n<p>The first act of Congress which authorized a criminal case to be brought from the circuit court of the United States to this Court, except upon a certificate of division of opinion, was the Act of February 6, 1889, c. 113, \xef\xbf\xbd 6, by which it was enacted that, "in all cases of conviction" of a "capital crime in any court of the United States," the final judgment "against the respondent" might, on his application, be reexamined, reversed, or affirmed by this Court on writ of error.  Up to that time, this Court had no general authority to review on error or appeal the judgments of the circuit courts of the United States in cases within their criminal jurisdiction.  <em>United States v. Sanges,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/144/310/case.html">144 U.

S. 574</a></span>.</p>\n<p>By section 4 of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826, c. 517, it was provided that</p>\n<p>"the review by appeal, by writ of error, or otherwise from the existing circuit courts shall be had only in the Supreme Court of the United States, or in the circuit courts of appeals hereby established, according to the provisions of this act regulating the same."</p>\n<p>By section 5, appeals or writs of error might be taken from the circuit court directly to this Court in certain enumerated classes of cases, including "cases of conviction of a capital or otherwise infamous crime."  And by section 6, the judgments or decrees of the circuit courts of appeals were made final "in all cases arising under the criminal laws," and in certain other classes of cases, unless questions were certified to this Court or the whole case ordered up by writ of certiorari, as therein provided.  <em>American Construction Co. v.

Thus, appellate jurisdiction was given in all criminal cases by writ of error either from this Court or from the circuit courts of appeals, and in all civil cases by appeal or error, without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 163 U. S. 139</a></p><p> regard to the amount in controversy, except as to appeals or writs of error to or from the circuit courts of appeals in cases not made final, as specified in section 6.</p>\n<p>By section fourteen, it was provided that</p>\n<p>"all acts and parts of acts relating to appeals or writs of error inconsistent with the provisions for review by appeals or writs of error in the preceding sections five and six of this act are hereby repealed,"</p>\n<p>and the particular question before us is whether sections 651 and 697 of the Revised Statutes, in relation to certificate of division of opinion in criminal cases, though not expressly repealed, still remain in force.  If so, and such division of opinion can be certified before final judgment, then all criminal cases, including those in which the judgments and decrees of the circuit courts of appeals are made final [of which the case at bar is one], as well as those which may be brought directly to this Court, might at preliminary stages of the proceedings be brought before us on certificate, and, after judgment, the whole subject be reexamined on writ of error from one or the other court.  This result, in itself, we think, could not have been intended, and it is wholly inconsistent with the object of the Act of March 3, 1891, which was to relieve this Court and to distribute between it and the circuit courts of appeals substantially the entire appellate jurisdiction over the circuit courts of the United States.  <em>McLish v.
