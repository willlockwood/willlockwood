An \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d includes \xe2\x80\x9can offense that \xe2\x80\xa6 involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the \xe2\x80\xa6 victims exceeds $10,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(i).  Petitioner, an alien, was convicted of conspiring to commit mail fraud and related crimes.  Because the relevant statutes did not require a finding of loss, the jury made no such finding.  However, at sentencing, petitioner stipulated that the loss exceeded $100 million.  He was sentenced to prison and required to make $683 million in restitution.  The Government subsequently sought to remove him from the United States, claiming that he had been convicted of an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Immigration Judge found that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction fell within the \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed, as did the Third Circuit, which held that the Immigration Judge could inquire into the underlying facts of a prior fraud conviction for purposes of determining whether the loss to the victims exceeded $10,000.    </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Subparagraph (M)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s $10,000 threshold refers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed a fraud or deceit crime on a particular occasion rather than to an element of the fraud or deceit crime.

The basic argument favoring the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation rests upon <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a><em>,</em> <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 555 U. S. ___<em>, </em>and <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a>.  These cases concerned the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), which enhances the sentence for firearm-law offenders who have prior \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d convictions, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e).  The Court held that the word \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a generic crime as generally committed.  Thus, for example, in <em>James</em>, the Court applied the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical method\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether an \xe2\x80\x9cattempted burglary\xe2\x80\x9d was a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  That method required the Court to examine \xe2\x80\x9cnot the unsuccessful burglary \xe2\x80\xa6 attempted on a particular occasion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  550 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Contrary to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, the \xe2\x80\x9c$10,000 loss\xe2\x80\x9d provision at issue calls for a \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance-specific\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation, not a \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical\xe2\x80\x9d one.  The \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d statute of which it is a part differs from ACCA in general, and the \xe2\x80\x9c$10,000 loss\xe2\x80\x9d provision differs specifically from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1) The \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d statute at issue resembles ACCA when it lists several \xe2\x80\x9coffenses\xe2\x80\x9d in language that must refer to generic crimes.  But other \xe2\x80\x9coffenses\xe2\x80\x9d are listed using language that almost certainly refers to specific circumstances.  Title 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(P), for example, after referring to \xe2\x80\x9can offense\xe2\x80\x9d that amounts to \xe2\x80\x9cfalsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering a passport,\xe2\x80\x9d adds, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept in the case of a first offense for which \xe2\x80\xa6 the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting \xe2\x80\xa6 the alien\xe2\x80\x99s spouse, child, or parent \xe2\x80\xa6 to violate a provision of this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  The language about \xe2\x80\x9cforging \xe2\x80\xa6 passport[s]\xe2\x80\x9d may well refer to a generic crime, but the exception cannot possibly refer to a generic crime, because there is no criminal statute that contains any such exception.  Subparagraph (M)(ii), which refers to an offense \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in [26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77201] (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds $10,000,\xe2\x80\x9d provides another example.  Because no \xc2\xa77201 offense has a specific loss amount<em> </em>as an element, the tax-evasion provision would be pointless, unless the \xe2\x80\x9crevenue loss\xe2\x80\x9d language calls for circumstance-specific application.  Here, the question is to which category subparagraph (M)(i) belongs.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Subparagraph (M)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s language is consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.  The words \xe2\x80\x9cin which\xe2\x80\x9d (modifying \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d) can refer to the conduct involved \xe2\x80\x9c<em>in</em>\xe2\x80\x9d the commission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements <em>of</em> the offense.  Moreover, subparagraph (M)(i) appears just prior to subparagraph (M)(ii), the tax-evasion provision, and their structures are identical.  Where, as here, Congress uses similar statutory language and similar statutory structure in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpretations.  <em>IBP, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alvarez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/21/index.html">546 U. S. 21</a>, 34.  Additionally, applying a categorical approach would leave subparagraph (M)(i) with little, if any, meaningful application.  Only three federal fraud statutes appear to contain a relevant monetary loss threshold.  And at the time the $10,000 threshold was added, only eight States had fraud and deceit statutes in respect to which that threshold, as categorically interpreted, would have full effect.  Congress is unlikely to have intended subparagraph (M)(i) to apply in such a limited and haphazard manner.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This Court rejects petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s alternative position that fairness calls for a \xe2\x80\x9cmodified categorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d requiring a jury verdict or a judge-approved equivalent to embody a loss-amount determination, and permitting the subsequent immigration court applying subparagraph (M)(i) to examine only charging documents, jury instructions, and any special jury finding, or their equivalents.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases developed the evidentiary list to which petitioner points for a very different purpose, namely, to determine which statutory phrase (contained within a statutory provision covering several different generic crimes) covered a prior conviction.  Additionally, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposal can prove impractical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a special verdict on a fact that is not an element of the offense.  Further, evidence of loss offered by the Government must meet a \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing\xe2\x80\x9d standard and the loss must be tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction.  These considerations mean that petitioner and others in similar circumstances have at least one and possibly two opportunities to contest the loss amount, the first at the earlier sentencing and the second at the deportation hearing.  There was nothing unfair about the Immigration Judge\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on earlier sentencing-related material here.  The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing stipulation and the court\xe2\x80\x99s restitution order show that the conviction involved losses considerably greater than $10,000.  Absent any conflicting evidence, this evidence is clear and convincing.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis added).  A related statute defines \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of a set of listed offenses that includes \xe2\x80\x9can offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit <em>in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(i) (emphasis added).  See Appendix A.  The question before us is whether the italicized language refers to an element of the fraud or deceit \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d as set forth in the particular fraud or deceit statute defining the offense of which the alien was previously convicted.  If so, then in order to determine whether a prior conviction is for the kind of offense described, the immigration judge must look to the criminal fraud or deceit statute to see whether it contains a monetary threshold of $10,000 or more.  See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a> (1990)<em> </em>(so interpreting the Armed Career Criminal Act)<em>.  </em>We conclude, however, that the italicized language does not refer to an element of the fraud or deceit crime.  Rather it refers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed a (more broadly defined) fraud or deceit crime on a particular occasion.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner, an alien, immigrated to the United States in 1985. In 2002 he was indicted for conspiring to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7371, 1341, 1343, 1344, 1956(h).  A jury found him guilty.  But because none of these statutes requires a finding of any particular amount of victim loss, the jury made no finding about the amount of the loss.  At sentencing petitioner stipulated that the loss exceeded $100 million.  The court then imposed a sentence of 41 months in prison and required restitution of $683 million.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2005 the Government, claiming that petitioner had been convicted of an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony,\xe2\x80\x9d sought to remove him from the United States.  The Immigration Judge found that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was for crimes of fraud and deceit; that the sentencing stipulation and restitution order showed that the victims\xe2\x80\x99 loss exceeded $10,000; and that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction consequently fell within the immigration statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(i), (U) (including within the definition of \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9cattempt or conspiracy to commit\xe2\x80\x9d a listed \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a\xe2\x80\x9351a.  So did the Third Circuit.  523 F.\xc2\xa03d 387 (2008).  The Third Circuit noted that the statutes of conviction were silent as to amounts, but, in its view, the determination of loss amounts for \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d purposes \xe2\x80\x9crequires an inquiry into the underlying facts of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclusions as to whether the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph (M)(i) refers to an element of a fraud statute or to the factual circumstances surrounding commission of the crime on a specific occasion.  Compare <em>Conteh </em>v.<em> Gonzales</em>, 461 F.\xc2\xa03d 45, 55 (CA1 2006) (fact-based approach); 523 F.\xc2\xa03d 387 (same) (case below);<em> Arguelles-Olivares </em>v. <em>Mukasey</em>, 526 F.\xc2\xa03d 171, 178 (CA5 2008) (same), with <em>Dulal-Whiteway</em> v. <em>United States</em> <em>Dept. of Homeland Security</em>, 501 F.\xc2\xa03d 116, 131 (CA2 2007) (definitional approach); <em>Kawashima</em> v. <em>Mukasey</em>, 530 F.\xc2\xa03d 1111, 1117 (CA9 2008) (same); <em>Obasohan </em>v. <em>United States Atty.

We granted certiorari to decide the question.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interpretive difficulty before us reflects the linguistic fact that in ordinary speech words such as \xe2\x80\x9ccrime,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfelony, \xe2\x80\x9coffense,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like sometimes refer to a generic crime, say, the crime of fraud or theft in general, and sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion, say, <em>the </em>fraud that the defendant planned and executed last month.  See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 3). <em> </em>The question here, as we have said, is whether the italicized statutory words \xe2\x80\x9coffense that involves fraud or deceit <em>in which the loss to the . . . victims exceeds $10,000</em>\xe2\x80\x9d should be interpreted in the first sense (which we shall call \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical\xe2\x80\x9d), <em>i.e.</em>, as referring to a generic crime, or in the second sense (which we shall call \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance-specific\xe2\x80\x9d), as referring to the specific way in which an offender committed the crime on a specific occasion.  If the first, we must look to the statute defining the offense to determine whether it has an appropriate monetary threshold; if the second, we must look to the facts and circumstances underlying an offender\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The basic argument favoring the first\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94interpretation rests upon <em>Taylor,</em> <em>Chambers, </em>and <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a> (2007)<em>.  </em>Those cases<em> </em>concerned the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a statute that enhances the sentence imposed upon certain firearm-law offenders who also have three prior convictions for \xe2\x80\x9ca violent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e).  See Appendix B, <em>infra</em>.  ACCA defines \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d to include, first, felonies with elements that involve the use of physical force against another; second, felonies that amount to \xe2\x80\x9cburglary, arson, or extortion\xe2\x80\x9d or that involve the use of explosives; and third, felonies that \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Taylor </em>and <em>James </em>we held that ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s language read naturally uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to a generic crime as <em>generally </em>committed.  <em>Chambers</em>, <em>supra, </em>at ___ (slip op., at 3) (discussing <em>Taylor</em>, 495 U. S., at 602); <em>James</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 201\xe2\x80\x93202. <em> </em>The Court noted that such an interpretation of the statute avoids \xe2\x80\x9cthe practical difficulty of trying to ascertain\xe2\x80\x9d in a later proceeding, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps from a paper record\xe2\x80\x9d containing only a citation (say, by number) to a statute and a guilty plea, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the [offender\xe2\x80\x99s] prior crime . . . did or did not involve,\xe2\x80\x9d say, violence.  <em>Chambers</em>, <em>supra, </em>at ___ (slip op., at 3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus in <em>James, </em>referring to <em>Taylor, </em>we made clear that courts must use the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical method\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>to determine whether a conviction for \xe2\x80\x9cattempted burglary\xe2\x80\x9d was a conviction for a crime that, in ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s language, \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  That method required the court to \xe2\x80\x9cexamine, not the unsuccessful burglary the defendant attempted on a particular occasion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chambers</em>, <em>supra, </em>at (slip op., at 3) (discussing <em>James</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 204\xe2\x80\x93206).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also noted that the categorical method is not always easy to apply.  That is because sometimes a separately numbered subsection of a criminal statute will refer to several different crimes, each described separately.  And it can happen that some of these crimes involve violence while others do not.  A single Massachusetts statute section entitled \xe2\x80\x9cBreaking and Entering at Night,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, criminalizes breaking into a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding, ship, vessel or vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.\xc2\xa0266, \xc2\xa716 (West 2006).  In such an instance, we have said, a court must determine whether an offender\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction was for the violent, rather than the nonviolent, break-ins that this single five-word phrase describes (<em>e.g.,</em> breaking into a building rather than into a vessel), by examining \xe2\x80\x9cthe indictment or information and jury instructions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 602, or, if a guilty plea is at issue, by examining the plea agreement, plea colloquy or \xe2\x80\x9csome comparable judicial record\xe2\x80\x9d of the factual basis for the plea.  <em>Shepard</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/13/index.html">544 U. S. 13</a>, 26 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that we should interpret the subsection of the \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d statute before us as requiring use of this same \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  He says that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, read naturally as in <em>Taylor,</em> refers to a generic kind of crime, not a crime as committed on a particular occasion.  He adds that here, as in <em>Taylor</em>,<em> </em>such a reading avoids the practical difficulty of determining the nature of prior conduct from what may be a brief paper record, perhaps noting only a statutory section number and a guilty plea; or, if there is a more extensive record, combing through that record for evidence of underlying conduct.   Also, the categorical approach, since it covers only criminal statutes with a relevant monetary threshold, not only provides assurance of a finding on the point, but also assures that the defendant had an opportunity to present evidence about the amount of loss.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, we conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9cfraud and deceit\xe2\x80\x9d provision before us calls for a \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance-specific,\xe2\x80\x9d not a \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical,\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation.  The \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d statute of which it is a part differs in general from ACCA, the statute at issue in <em>Taylor.  </em>And the \xe2\x80\x9cfraud and deceit\xe2\x80\x9d provision differs specifically from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider, first, ACCA in general.  That statute defines the \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d felonies it covers to include \xe2\x80\x9cburglary, arson, or extortion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccrime[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element\xe2\x80\x9d the use or threatened use of force.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7924(e)(2)\n(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii).  This language refers directly to generic crimes.  The statute, however, contains other, more ambiguous language, covering \xe2\x80\x9ccrime[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>involv[e] conduct</em> that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).  While this language poses greater interpretive difficulty, the Court held that it too refers to crimes as generically defined.  <em>James</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 202.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now compare the \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d statute before us.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).  We concede that it resembles ACCA in certain respects.  The \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d statute lists several of its \xe2\x80\x9coffenses\xe2\x80\x9d in language that must refer to generic crimes.  Subparagraph (A), for example, lists \xe2\x80\x9cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Estrada-Espinoza </em>v. <em>Mukasey</em>, 546 F.\xc2\xa03d 1147, 1152 (CA9 2008) (en banc) (applying the categorical approach to \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Singh</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 383 F.\xc2\xa03d 144, 164 (CA3 2004) (same); <em>Santos</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 436 F.\xc2\xa03d 323, 324 (CA2 2005) <em>(per curiam) </em>(same).  Subparagraph (B) lists \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Gousse</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 339 F.\xc2\xa03d 91, 95\xe2\x80\x9396 (CA2 2003) (applying categorical approach); <em>Fernandez</em> v. <em>Mukasey</em>, 544 F.\xc2\xa03d 862, 871\xe2\x80\x93872 (CA7 2008) (same); <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Blackman</em>, 236 F.\xc2\xa03d 130, 136 (CA3 2001) (same).  And subparagraph (C) lists \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in firearms or destructive devices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Other sections refer specifically to an \xe2\x80\x9coffense described in\xe2\x80\x9d a particular section of the Federal Criminal Code.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, subparagraphs (E), (H), (I), (J), (L).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, however, the \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d statute differs from ACCA in that it lists certain other \xe2\x80\x9coffenses\xe2\x80\x9d using language that almost certainly does not refer to generic crimes but refers to specific circumstances.  For example, subparagraph (P), after referring to \xe2\x80\x9can offense\xe2\x80\x9d that amounts to \xe2\x80\x9cfalsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering a passport,\xe2\x80\x9d adds, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>except in the case of a first offense for which the alien \xe2\x80\xa6 committed the offense for the purpose of assisting . . . the alien\xe2\x80\x99s spouse, child, or parent \xe2\x80\xa6 to violate a provision of this chapter</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added). <em> </em>The language about (for example) \xe2\x80\x9cforging \xe2\x80\xa6 passport[s]\xe2\x80\x9d may well refer to a generic crime, but the italicized exception cannot possibly refer to a generic crime.  That is because there is no such generic crime; there is no criminal statute that contains any such exception.  Thus if the provision is to have any meaning at all, the exception must refer to the particular circumstances<em> </em>in which an offender committed the crime on a particular occasion. See also subparagraph (N) (similar exception).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute has other provisions that contain qualifying language that certainly seems to call for circumstance-specific application.  Subparagraph (K)(ii), for example, lists \xe2\x80\x9coffense[s] . . . described in section 2421, 2422, or 2423 of title 18 (relating to transportation for the purpose of prostitution) <em>if committed for commercial advantage</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  Of the three specifically listed criminal statutory sections only one subsection (namely, \xc2\xa72423(d)) says anything about <em>commercial advantage. </em> Thus, unless the \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial advantage\xe2\x80\x9d language calls for circumstance-specific application, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s explicit references to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72421 and 2422 would be pointless.  But see <em>Gertsenshteyn</em> v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice</em>, 544 F.\xc2\xa03d 137, 144\xe2\x80\x93145 (CA2 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subparagraph (M)(ii) provides yet another example.  It refers to an offense \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) <em>in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  There is no offense \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in section 7201 of title 26\xe2\x80\x9d that has a specific loss amount<em> </em>as an element.  Again, unless the \xe2\x80\x9crevenue loss\xe2\x80\x9d language calls for circumstance-specific application, the tax-evasion provision would be pointless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that the \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d statute, unlike ACCA, contains some language that refers to generic crimes and some language that almost certainly refers to the specific circumstances in which a crime was committed.  The question before us then is to which category subparagraph (M)(i) belongs.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subparagraph (M)(i) refers to \xe2\x80\x9can offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit <em>in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  The language of the provision is consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.  The words \xe2\x80\x9cin which\xe2\x80\x9d (which modify \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d) can refer to the conduct involved \xe2\x80\x9c<em>in</em>\xe2\x80\x9d the commission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements <em>of</em> the offense.  Moreover, subparagraph (M)(i) appears just prior to subparagraph (M)(ii), the internal revenue provision we have just discussed, and it is identical in structure to that provision. Where, as here, Congress uses similar statutory language and similar statutory structure in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpretations.  <em>IBP, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alvarez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/21/index.html">546 U. S. 21</a>, 34 (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, to apply a categorical approach here would leave subparagraph (M)(i) with little, if any, meaningful application.  We have found no widely applicable federal fraud statute that contains a relevant monetary loss threshold.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1344 (bank fraud), 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 666 (theft in federally funded programs), 1028 (fraud in connection with identification documents), 1029 (fraud in connection with access devices), 1030 (fraud in connection with computers), 1347 (health care fraud), and 1348 (securities fraud).  Petitioner has found only three federal fraud statutes that do so, and those three contain thresholds not of $10,000, but of $100,000 or $1 million, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7668 (theft by fraud of an artwork worth $100,000 or more), 1031(a) (contract fraud against the United States where the contract is worth at least $1 million), and 1039(d) (providing enhanced penalties for fraud in obtaining telephone records, where the scheme involves more than $100,000).  Why would Congress intend subparagraph (M)(i) to apply to only these three federal statutes, and then choose a monetary threshold that, on its face, would apply to other, nonexistent statutes as well?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize, as petitioner argues, that Congress might have intended subparagraph (M)(i) to apply almost exclusively to those who violate certain state fraud and deceit statutes.  So we have examined state law.  See Appendix C, <em>infra</em>.  We have found, however, that in 1996, when Congress added the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph (M)(i), see Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \xc2\xa7321(a)(7), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93628, 29 States had no major fraud or deceit statute with any relevant monetary threshold.  In 13 of the remaining 21 States, fraud and deceit statutes contain relevant monetary thresholds but with amounts significantly higher than $10,000, leaving only 8 States with statutes in respect to which subparagraph (M)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s $10,000 threshold, as categorically interpreted, would have full effect.  We do not believe Congress would have intended (M)(i) to apply in so limited and so haphazard a manner.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hayes</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311) (reaching similar conclusion for similar reason in respect to a statute referring to crimes involving \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner next points to 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71326, which criminalizes illegal entry after removal and imposes a higher maximum sentence when an alien\xe2\x80\x99s removal was \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71326(b)(2).  Petitioner says that a circumstance-specific approach to subparagraph (M)(i) could create potential constitutional problems in a subsequent criminal prosecution under that statute, because loss amount would not have been found beyond a reasonable doubt in the prior criminal proceeding.  The Government, however, stated in its brief and at oral argument that the later jury, during the illegal reentry trial, would have to find loss amount beyond a reasonable doubt, Brief for Respondent 49\xe2\x80\x9350; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39\xe2\x80\x9340, eliminating any constitutional concern.  Cf. <em>Hayes</em>, <em>supra, </em>at ___ (slip op., at 10).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that Congress did not intend subparagraph (M)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s monetary threshold to be applied categorically, <em>i.e.</em>, to only those fraud and deceit crimes generically defined to include that threshold.  Rather, the monetary threshold applies to the specific circumstances surrounding an offender\xe2\x80\x99s commission of a fraud and deceit crime on a specific occasion.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner, as an alternative argument, says that we should nonetheless borrow from <em>Taylor </em>what that case called a \xe2\x80\x9cmodified categorical approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  He says that, for reasons of fairness, we should insist that a jury verdict, or a judge-approved equivalent, embody a determination that the loss involved in a prior fraud or deceit conviction amounted to at least $10,000.  To determine whether that is so, petitioner says, the subsequent immigration court applying subparagraph (M)(i) should examine only charging documents,  jury instructions, and any special jury finding (if one has been requested).  If there was a trial but no jury, the subsequent court should examine the equivalent judge-made findings.  If there was a guilty plea (and no trial), the subsequent court should examine the written plea documents or the plea colloquy.  To authorize any broader examination of the prior proceedings, petitioner says, would impose an unreasonable administrative burden on immigration judges and would unfairly permit him to be deported on the basis of circumstances that were not before <em>judicially determined</em> to have been present and which he may not have had an opportunity, prior to conviction, to  dispute.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with petitioner that the statute foresees the use of fundamentally fair procedures, including procedures that give an alien a fair opportunity to dispute a Government claim that a prior conviction involved a fraud with the relevant loss to victims.  But we do not agree that fairness requires the evidentiary limitations he proposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, we have found nothing in prior law that so limits the immigration court.  <em>Taylor</em>,<em> James</em>, and<em> Shepard</em>,<em> </em>the cases that developed the evidentiary list to which petitioner points, developed that list for a very different purpose, namely that of determining which statutory phrase (contained within a statutory provision that covers several different generic crimes) covered a prior conviction.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5; <em>Taylor</em>, 495 U. S., at 602; <em>Shepard</em>, 544 U. S., at 26.  For another, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposal itself can prove impractical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a special verdict on a fact that (given our Part II determination) is not an element of the offense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, a deportation proceeding is a civil proceeding in which the Government does not have to prove its claim \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  At the same time the evidence that the Government offers must meet a \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(c)(3)(A).  And, as the Government points out, the \xe2\x80\x9closs\xe2\x80\x9d must \xe2\x80\x9cbe tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 44; see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Alaka</em> v. <em>Attorney General of United States</em>, 456 F.\xc2\xa03d 88, 107 (CA3 2006) (loss amount must be tethered to offense of conviction; amount cannot be based on acquitted or dismissed counts or general conduct); <em>Knutsen</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 429 F.\xc2\xa03d 733, 739\xe2\x80\x93740 (CA7 2005) (same).  And the Government adds that the \xe2\x80\x9csole purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cis to ascertain the nature of a prior conviction; it is not an invitation to relitigate the conviction itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 44 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Finally, the Board of Immigration Appeals, too, has recognized that immigration judges must assess findings made at sentencing \xe2\x80\x9cwith an eye to what losses are covered and to the burden of proof employed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Babaisakov</em>, 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 306, 319 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations, taken together, mean that petitioner and those in similar circumstances have at least one and possibly two opportunities to contest the amount of loss, the first at the earlier sentencing and the second at the deportation hearing itself.  They also mean that, since the Government must show the amount of loss by clear and convincing evidence, uncertainties caused by the passage of time are likely to count in the alien\xe2\x80\x99s favor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can find nothing unfair about the immigration judge\xe2\x80\x99s having here relied upon earlier sentencing-related material.  The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s own stipulation, produced for sentencing purposes, shows that the conviction involved losses considerably greater than $10,000.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s restitution order shows the same.  In the absence of any conflicting evidence (and petitioner mentions none), this evidence is clear and convincing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s prior federal conviction consequently falls within the scope of subparagraph (M)(i).  And we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p align="left"><right><em>It is so ordered.</em></right></p><em>\n<p align="left">APPENDIXES</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 101(a)(43) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as set forth in 8 U.
