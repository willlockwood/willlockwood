The ground upon which the injunction was sought was, generally speaking, inequality and discrimination in the assessment.  The bill alleged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="88">Page 147 U.

There was an allegation that the amount admitted in the original bill to be justly due for the taxes of 1888 had been paid, and then follow these averments, which are all there are, in respect to an admission of an amount due, payment, or tender:</p>\n<p>"And your orator further alleges that, having paid all the taxes for which it was liable for the year 1888, it now comes into court and offers to pay all the taxes which can justly and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="89">Page 147 U.

From the decision of the supreme court of the territory complainant has brought this appeal.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BREWER, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The decree dismissing the original and supplemental bills must be sustained.  As to the tax of 1888, the case stands upon the allegation that plaintiff\'s property was originally assessed at its full value, while other property was assessed seventy percent thereof; that it appealed to the board of equalization for a reduction, and that such tribunal reduced the valuation, but only to eighty-five, instead of seventy, percent.  It would seem that the mere statement of this was sufficient.  The law of New Mexico requires property to be assessed at its cash value.  Confessedly this plaintiff\'s property was assessed at fifteen percent below that value.  Surely, upon the mere fact that other property happened to be assessed at thirty percent below the value, when this did not come from any design or systematic effort on the part of the county officials, and when the plaintiff has had a hearing as to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="90">Page 147 U. S. 90</a></p><p> the correct valuation, on appeal before the board of equalization, the proper tribunal for review, it cannot be that it can come into a court of equity for an injunction, or have that decision of the board of equalization reviewed in this collateral way.  <em>Stanley v. Supervisors of Albany,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/121/535/case.html">121 U. S. 535</a></span>.</p>\n<p>With respect to the taxes of 1889, there was no payment or tender of payment of any amount.  Plaintiff seeks to avoid the necessity therefor by alleging that it is impossible to separate the legal from the illegal portions of the taxes -- an allegation which is manifestly untrue in view of the fact that it had no difficulty in making the separation in the taxes of 1888, the assessment for which was made in a similar way, and in view of the further fact that it must have known what property it had which was subject to taxation as well as its value, and therefore the rate of taxation being fixed by law, it could, of course, have known what amount was undoubtedly due.  The rule in respect to this matter is perfectly well settled in this Court.  In <em>State Railroad Tax Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/575/case.html">92 U. S. 575</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/575/case.html#616">92 U. S. 616</a></span>, it was fully considered.  In that case, it was said by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the Court:</p>\n<p>"It is a profitable thing for corporations or individuals whose taxes are very large to obtain a preliminary injunction as to all their taxes, contest the case through several years\' litigation, and, when in the end it is found that but a small part of the tax should be permanently enjoined, submit to pay the balance.  This is not equity.  It is in direct violation of the first principles of equity jurisdiction.  It is not sufficient to say in the bill that they are ready and willing to pay whatever may be found due.  They must first pay what is conceded to be due, or what can be seen to be due on the face of the bill, or be shown by affidavits, whether conceded or not, before the preliminary injunction should be granted.  The state is not to be thus tied up as to that of which there is no contest by lumping it with that which is really contested.  If the proper officer refuses to receive a part of the tax, it must be tendered, and tendered without the condition annexed of a receipt in full of all the taxes assessed."</p>\n<p>Many other cases to like effect might be cited.</p>\n<p>The decree will be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
