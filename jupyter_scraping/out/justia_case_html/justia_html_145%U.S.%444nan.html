JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The single question in this case is whether, under the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, \xc2\xa7 1, as corrected by the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, the material parts of which are copied in the margin, <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/145/444/case.html">*</a></span> a corporation incorporated in one state of the union and having a usual place of business in another state in which it has not been incorporated, may be sued in a circuity court of the United States held in the latter state by a citizen of a different state.</p>\n<p>This question, upon which there has been a diversity of opinion in the circuity courts, can be best determined by a review of the acts of Congress and of the decisions of this Court regarding the original jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States over suits between citizens of different states.</p>\n<p>In carrying out the provision of the Constitution which declares that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to controversies "between citizens of different states," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 145 U. S. 447</a></p><p> Congress, by the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, \xc2\xa7 11, conferred jurisdiction on the circuit court of suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, "between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state," and provided that</p>\n<p>"no civil suit shall be brought . . . against an inhabitant of the United States . . . in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the writ."</p>\n<p>1 Stat. 78, 79.</p>\n<p>The word "inhabitant" in that act was apparently used not in any larger meaning than "citizen," but to avoid the incongruity of speaking of a citizen of anything less than a state, when the intention was to cover not only a district which included a whole state, but also two districts in one state, like the districts of Maine and Massachusetts in the State of Massachusetts, and the districts of Virginia and Kentucky in the State of Virginia, established by \xc2\xa7 2 of the same act.  1 Stat. 73.  It was held by this Court from the beginning that an averment that a party resided within the state or the district in which the suit was brought was not sufficient to support the jurisdiction, because in the common use of words a resident might not be a citizen, and therefore it was not stated expressly and beyond ambiguity that he was a citizen of the state, which was the fact on which the jurisdiction depended under the provisions of the Constitution and of the Judiciary Act.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/3/382/case.html">Bingham v.

The same rule has been maintained to the present day, and has been held to be unaffected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, declaring that</p>\n<p>"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."</p>\n<p><em>Robertson v.

S. 121</a></span>.</p>\n<p>By the Act of May 4, 1858, c. 27, \xc2\xa7 1, it was enacted that, in a state containing more than one district, actions not local </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 145 U. S. 448</a></p><p> should "be brought in the district in which the defendant resides," or, "if there be two or more defendants residing in different districts in the same state," then in either district.  11 Stat. 272.  The whole purport and effect of that act was not to enlarge, but to restrict and distribute, jurisdiction.  It applied only to a state containing two or more districts, and directed suits against citizens of such a state to be brought in that district thereof in which they or either of them resided.  It did not subject defendants to any new liability to be sued out of the state of which they were citizens, but simply prescribed in which district of that state they might be sued.</p>\n<p>These provisions of the acts of 1789 and 1858 were substantially reenacted in sections 739 and 740 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p>The Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, \xc2\xa7 1, after giving the circuit courts jurisdiction of suits "in which there shall be a controversy between citizens of different states" and enlarging their jurisdiction in other respects, substantially reenacted the corresponding provision of the act of 1789 by providing that no civil suit should be brought "against any person . . . in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant or in which he shall be found" at the time of service, with certain exceptions not affecting the matter now under consideration.  18 Stat. 470.</p>\n<p>The act of 1887, both in its original form and as corrected in 1888, reenacts the rule that no civil suit shall be brought against any person in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, but omits the clause allowing a defendant to be sued in the district where he is found, and adds this clause:</p>\n<p>"But where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant."</p>\n<p>24 Stat. 552; 25 Stat. 434.  As has been adjudged by this Court, the last clause is by way of proviso to the next preceding clause, which forbids any suit to be brought in any other district than that whereof the defendant is an inhabitant, and the effect is that</p>\n<p>"where the jurisdiction is founded upon any of the causes mentioned in this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 145 U. S. 449</a></p><p> section except the citizenship of the parties, it must be brought in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded solely upon the fact that the parties are citizens of different states, the suit may be brought in the district in which either the plaintiff or the defendant resides."</p>\n<p><em>McCormick Co. v. Walthers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/41/case.html">134 U. S. 41</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/41/case.html#43">134 U.

S. 467</a></span>.</p>\n<p>As to natural persons, therefore, it cannot be doubted that the effect of this act, read in the light of earlier acts upon the same subject and of the judicial construction thereof, is that the phrase "district of the residence of" a person is equivalent to "district whereof he is an inhabitant," and cannot be construed as giving jurisdiction by reason of citizenship to a circuit court held in a state of which neither party is a citizen, but, on the contrary, restricts the jurisdiction to the district in which one of the parties resides within the state of which he is a citizen, and that this act, therefore, having taken away the alternative, permitted in the earlier acts, of suing a person in the district "in which he shall be found," requires any suit the jurisdiction of which is founded only on its being between citizens of different states to be brought in the state of which one is a citizen and in the district therein of which he is an inhabitant and resident.</p>\n<p>In the case of a corporation, the reasons are, to say the least, quite as strong for holding that it can sue and be sued only in the state and district in which it has been incorporated, or in the state of which the other party is a citizen.</p>\n<p>In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/519/case.html">Bank v.

S. 588</a></span>, Chief Justice Taney said:</p>\n<p>"It is very true that a corporation can have no legal existence out of the boundaries of the sovereignty by which it is created.  It exists only in contemplation of law and by force of the law, and where that law ceases to operate and is no longer obligatory, the corporation can have no existence.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 145 U. S. 450</a></p><p> It must dwell in the place of its creation, and cannot migrate to another sovereignty.  But although it must live and have its being in that state only, yet it does not by any means follow that its existence there will not be recognized in other places, and its residence in one state creates no insuperable objection to its power of contracting in another."</p>\n<p>This statement has been often reaffirmed by this Court, with some change of phrase but always retaining the idea that the legal existence, the home, the domicile, the habitat, the residence, the citizenship of the corporation can only be in the state by which it was created, although it may do business in other states whose laws permit it.</p>\n<p>In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/59/404/case.html">Lafayette Inc. Co. v. French,</a></span></em> 18 How. 404, in which an Indiana corporation was sued in Indiana upon a judgment recovered in an action against it in a state court of Ohio upon a contract made in that state, this Court, speaking by Mr. Justice Curtis and referring to <em>Bank of Augusts v. Earle,</em> said:  "This corporation, existing only by virtue of a law of Indiana, cannot be deemed to pass personally beyond the limits of that state," and held that it was bound by the judgment because it had been allowed by the State of Ohio to make contracts in that state only upon the reasonable and lawful condition of its agent, residing and making contracts there, being deemed its agent to receive service of process in suits upon such contracts, and therefore that such a judgment, recovered after such a notice, was "as valid as if the corporation had had its habitat within the state."  18 How.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/59/404/case.html#407">59 U.

It can have its legal home only at the place where it is located by or under the authority of its charter, but it may by its agents transact business anywhere, unless prohibited by its charter or excluded by local laws."</p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of the circuit court in that case, as well as in <em>New England Ins. Co. v. Woodworth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/138/case.html">111 U. S. 138</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/138/case.html#146">111 U. S. 146</a></span>, was maintained upon the ground that the defendant corporation, though incorporated in another state, yet, by reason of doing business in the state in which the suit was brought and having appointed an agent there as required by its laws, upon whom process against the company might be served, was found in that state within the meaning of the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, \xc2\xa7 1, then in force and hereinbefore cited.</p>\n<p>The statute now in question, as already observed, has repealed the permission to sue a defendant in a district in which he is found, and has peremptorily enacted that</p>\n<p>"where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant."</p>\n<p>In a case between natural persons, as has been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 145 U. S. 453</a></p><p> seen, this clause does not allow the suit to be brought in a state of which neither is a citizen.  If Congress, in framing this clause, did not have corporations in mind, there is no reason for giving the clause a looser and broader construction as to artificial persons who were not contemplated than as to natural persons who were.  If, as it is more reasonable to suppose, Congress did have corporations in mind, it must be presumed also to have had in mind the law, as long and uniformly declared by this Court, that within the meaning of the previous acts of Congress giving jurisdiction of suits between citizens of different states, a corporation could not be considered a citizen or a resident of a state in which it had not been incorporated.</p>\n<p>The Quincy Mining Company, a corporation of Michigan, having appeared specially for the purpose of taking the objection that it could not be sued in the Southern District of New York by a citizen of another state, there can be no question of waiver, such as has been recognized where a defendant has appeared generally in a suit between citizens of different states brought in the wrong district.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/21/699/case.html">Gracie v.

But no person shall be arrested in one district for trial in another in any civil action before a circuit or district court, and no civil suit shall be brought before either of said courts against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant."</p>\n<p>25 Stat. 434.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
