S. 331</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether a firm incurs an "injury" within the meaning of the antitrust laws when it loses sales to a competitor charging nonpredatory prices pursuant to a vertical, maximum price-fixing scheme.  We hold that such a firm does not suffer an "antitrust injury," and that it therefore cannot bring suit under \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, <em>as amended,</em> 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent USA Petroleum Company (USA) sued petitioner Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging the existence of a vertical, maximum price-fixing agreement prohibited by \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, <em>as amended,</em> 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1, an attempt to monopolize the local retail gasoline sales market in violation of \xc2\xa7 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2, and other misconduct not relevant here.  Petitioner ARCO is an integrated oil company that, <em>inter alia,</em> markets gasoline in the western United States.  It sells gasoline to consumers both directly through its own stations and indirectly through ARCO-brand dealers.  Respondent USA is an independent retail marketer of gasoline which, like other independents, buys gasoline from major petroleum companies for resale under its own brand name.  Respondent competes directly with ARCO dealers at the retail level.  Respondent\'s outlets typically are low-overhead, high-volume "discount" stations that charge less than stations selling equivalent quality gasoline under major brand names.</p>\n<p>In early 1982, petitioner ARCO adopted a new marketing strategy in order to compete more effectively with discount </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 495 U. S. 332</a></p><p> independents such as respondent. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Petitioner encouraged its dealers to match the retail gasoline prices offered by independents in various ways; petitioner made available to its dealers and distributors such short-term discounts as "temporary competitive allowances" and "temporary volume allowances," and it reduced its dealers\' costs by, for example, eliminating credit-card sales.  ARCO\'s strategy increased its sales and market share.</p>\n<p>In its amended complaint, respondent USA charged that ARCO engaged in "direct head-to-head competition with discounters" and "drastically lowered its prices and in other ways sought to appeal to price-conscious consumers."  First Amended Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd 19, App. 15.  Respondent asserted that petitioner conspired with retail service stations selling ARCO brand gasoline to fix prices at below-market levels:</p>\n<p>"Arco and its co-conspirators have organized a resale price maintenance scheme, as a direct result of which competition that would otherwise exist among ARCO-branded dealers has been eliminated by agreement, and the retail price of ARCO-branded gasoline has been fixed, stabilized and maintained at artificially low and uncompetitive levels."</p>\n<p>\xef\xbf\xbd 27, App. 17.  Respondent alleged that petitioner</p>\n<p>"has solicited its dealers and distributors to participate or acquiesce in the conspiracy and has used threats, intimidation and coercion to secure compliance with its terms."</p>\n<p>\xef\xbf\xbd 37, App., at 19.  According to respondent, this conspiracy drove many independent gasoline dealers in California out of business.  \xef\xbf\xbd 39, App. 20.  Count one of the amended complaint charged that petitioner\'s vertical, maximum price-fixing scheme constituted an agreement in restraint of trade, and thus violated \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act.  Count two, later withdrawn with prejudice by respondent, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="333">Page 495 U. S. 333</a></p><p> asserted that petitioner had engaged in an attempt to monopolize the retail gasoline market through predatory pricing in violation of \xc2\xa7 2 of the Sherman Act. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court granted summary judgment for ARCO on the \xc2\xa7 1 claim.  The court stated that,</p>\n<p>"[e]ven assuming that [respondent USA] can establish a vertical conspiracy to maintain low prices, [respondent] cannot satisfy the \'antitrust injury\' requirement of Clayton Act \xc2\xa7 4 without showing such prices to be predatory."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. 3b.  The court then concluded that respondent could make no such showing of predatory pricing, because, given petitioner\'s market share and the ease of entry into the market, petitioner was in no position to exercise market power.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  859 F.2d 687 (1988).  Acknowledging that its decision was in conflict with the approach of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in several recent cases, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] <em>see id.</em> at 697, n. 15, the Ninth Circuit nonetheless held that injuries resulting from vertical, nonpredatory, maximum price-fixing agreements could constitute "antitrust injury" for purposes of a private suit under \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act.  The court reasoned that any form of price-fixing contravenes Congress\' intent that</p>\n<p>"market forces alone determine what goods and services are offered, at what price these goods and services </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 495 U. S. 334</a></p><p> are sold, and whether particular sellers succeed or fail."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 693.  The court believed that the key inquiry in determining whether respondent suffered an "antitrust injury" was whether its losses "resulted from a disruption . . . in the . . . market caused by the . . . antitrust violation."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court concluded that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n the present case, the inquiry seems straightforward:  USA\'s claimed injuries were the direct result, and indeed, under the allegations we accept as true, the intended objective, of ARCO\'s price-fixing scheme.  According to USA, the purpose of ARCO\'s price-fixing is to disrupt the market of retail gasoline sales, and that disruption is the source of USA\'s injuries."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 490 U.S. 1097 (1989).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>A private plaintiff may not recover damages under \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act merely by showing "injury causally linked to an illegal presence in the market."  <em>Brunswick Corp. v.

In addition, respondent maintains that any loss flowing from a <em>per se</em> violation of \xc2\xa7 1 automatically satisfies the antitrust injury requirement.  We reject both contentions, and hold that respondent has failed to meet the antitrust injury test in this case.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Albrecht v. Herald Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/145/case.html">390 U. S. 145</a></span> (1968), we found that a vertical, maximum price-fixing scheme was unlawful <em>per se</em> under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act because it threatened to inhibit vigorous competition by the dealers bound by it and because it threatened to become a minimum price-fixing scheme. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  That case concerned a newspaper distributor who sought to charge his customers more than the suggested retail price advertised by the publisher.  After the publisher attempted to discipline the distributor by hiring another carrier to take away some of the distributor\'s customers, the distributor brought suit under \xc2\xa7 1.  The Court found that</p>\n<p>"the combination formed by the [publisher] in this case to force [the distributor] to maintain a specified price for the resale of newspapers which he had purchased from [the publisher] constituted, without more, an illegal restraint of trade under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/145/case.html#153">390 U. S. 153</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In holding such a maximum-price vertical agreement illegal, we analyzed the manner in which it might restrain competition by dealers.  First, we noted that such a scheme,</p>\n<p>"by substituting the perhaps erroneous judgment of a seller for the forces of the competitive market, may severely intrude upon the ability of buyers to compete and survive in that market."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/145/case.html#152">390 U.

But in <em>Albrecht,</em> we held such an agreement <em>per se</em> unlawful because of its potential effects on dealers and consumers, not because of its effect on <em>competitors.</em>  Respondent\'s asserted injury as a competitor does not resemble any of the potential dangers described in <em>Albrecht.</em> [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  For example, if a vertical agreement fixes "[m]aximum prices . . . too low for the dealer to furnish services" desired by consumers, or in such a way as to channel business to large distributors, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/145/case.html#152">390 U.

Indeed, the gravamen of respondent\'s complaint -- that the price-fixing scheme between petitioner and its dealers enabled those dealers to increase their sales -- amounts to an assertion that the dangers with which we were concerned in <em>Albrecht</em> have <em>not</em> materialized in the instant case.  In sum, respondent has not suffered "<em>antitrust</em> injury," since its losses do not flow from the aspects of vertical, maximum price-fixing that render it illegal.</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that, even if it was not harmed by any of the anticompetitive effects identified in <em>Albrecht,</em> it nonetheless suffered antitrust injury because of the low prices produced by the vertical restraint.  We disagree.  When a firm, or even a group of firms adhering to a vertical agreement, lowers prices but maintains them above predatory levels, the business lost by rivals cannot be viewed as an "anticompetitive" consequence of the claimed violation.

Respondent notes that the two sections of the Act are quite different.  Price-fixing violates \xc2\xa7 1, for example, even if a single firm\'s decision to price at the same level would not create \xc2\xa7 2 liability.  <em>See generally Copperweld Corp. v.

In a \xc2\xa7 1 case, the price agreement itself is illegal, and respondent contends that all losses flowing from such an agreement must, by definition, constitute "antitrust injuries."

In sum, respondent maintains that it has suffered antitrust injury even if petitioner\'s pricing was not predatory under \xc2\xa7 2 of the Sherman Act.\n</em></p>\n<p>We reject respondent\'s argument.  Although a vertical, maximum price-fixing agreement is unlawful under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, it does not cause a competitor antitrust injury unless it results in predatory pricing.

Low prices benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and, so long as they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten competition.  Hence, they cannot give rise to antitrust injury.</p>\n<p>We have adhered to this principle regardless of the type of antitrust claim involved.  In <em>Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., supra,</em> for example, we found that a plaintiff competitor had not shown antitrust injury, and thus could not challenge a merger that was assumed to be illegal under \xc2\xa7 7 of the Clayton Act, even though the merged company threatened to engage in vigorous price competition that would reduce the plaintiff\'s profits.  We observed that nonpredatory price competition for increased market share, as reflected by prices that are below "market price" or even below the costs of a firm\'s rivals, "is not activity forbidden by the antitrust laws."  479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/104/case.html#116">479 U.

We opined nevertheless that,\n</em></p>\n<p>"if [the plaintiffs] were injured, it was not \'by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws:\'  while [the plaintiffs\'] loss occurred \'by reason of\' the unlawful acquisitions, it did not occur \'by reason of\' that which made the acquisitions unlawful."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/477/case.html#488">429 U.

To be sure, the source of the price competition in the instant case was an agreement allegedly unlawful under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, rather than a merger in violation of \xc2\xa7 7 of the Clayton Act.  But that difference is not salient.

The antitrust injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from an competition-<em>reducing</em> aspect or effect of the defendant\'s behavior.  The need for this showing is at least as great under the <em>per se</em> rule as under the rule of reason.  Indeed, insofar as the <em>per se</em> rule permits the prohibition of efficient practices in the name of simplicity, the need for the antitrust injury requirement is underscored.</p>\n<p>"[P]rocompetitive or efficiency-enhancing aspects of practices that nominally violate the antitrust laws may cause serious harm to individuals, but this kind of harm is the essence of competition, and should play no role in the definition of antitrust damages."</p>\n<p>Page, The Scope of Liability for Antitrust Violations, 37 Stan.L.Rev. 1445, 1460 (1985).

If such a scheme causes the anticompetitive consequences detailed in <em>Albrecht,</em> consumers and the manufacturers\' own dealers may bring suit.  The</p>\n<p>"existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement diminishes the justification for allowing a more remote party . . . to perform the office of a private attorney general."</p>\n<p><em>Associated General Contractors,</em> 459 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/519/case.html#542">459 U.

A competitor is not injured by the <em>anticompetitive</em> effects of vertical, maximum price-fixing, <em>see supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/328/case.html#336">495 U.

A competitor will not bring suit to protect the dealer against a maximum price that is set too low, inasmuch as the competitor would <em>benefit</em> from such a situation.  Instead, a competitor will be motivated to bring suit only when the vertical restraint promotes interbrand competition between the competitor and the dealer subject to the restraint.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F13" name="T13">n</a> 13, <em>supra.</em>  In short, a competitor will be injured, and hence motivated to sue, only when a vertical, maximum price-fixing arrangement has a <em>procompetitive</em> impact on the market.

The manufacturer acts not out of altruism, of course, but out of a desire to increase its own sales -- whereas the dealer\'s incentive, like that of any monopolist, is to reduce output and increase price.  If an exclusive dealership is the most efficient means of distribution, the public is not served by forcing the manufacturer to abandon this method and resort to self-distribution or competing distributors.  Vertical, maximum price-fixing thus may have procompetitive interbrand effects even if it is <em>per se</em> illegal because of its potential effects on dealers and consumers.  <em>See Albrecht v.

But much, if not all, of its reasoning about what constitutes injury actionable by a competitor would apply even if the alleged conspiracy had been joined by other major oil companies doing business in California, as well as their retail outlets. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The Court undermines the enforceability of a substantive price-fixing violation with a flawed construction of \xc2\xa7 4, erroneously assuming that the level of a price fixed by a \xc2\xa7 1 conspiracy is relevant to legality, and that all vertical arrangements conform to a single model.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because so much of the Court\'s analysis turns on its characterization of USA\'s cause of action, it is appropriate to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="347">Page 495 U. S. 347</a></p><p> begin with a more complete description of USA\'s theory.  As the case comes to us on review of summary judgment, we assume the truth of USA\'s allegation that ARCO conspired with its retail dealers to fix the price of gas at specific ARCO stations that compete directly with USA stations.  It is conceded that this price-fixing conspiracy is a <em>per se</em> violation of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>USA\'s theory can be expressed in the following hypothetical example:  In a free market, ARCO\'s advertised gas might command a price of $1.00 per gallon, while USA\'s unadvertised gas might sell for a penny less, with retailers of both brands making an adequate profit.  If, however, the ARCO stations reduce their price by a penny or two, they might divert enough business from USA stations to force them gradually to withdraw from the market. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The fixed price would be lower than the price that would obtain in a free market, but not so low as to be "predatory" in the sense that a single actor could not lawfully charge it under 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2 or \xc2\xa7 13a. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>This theory rests on the premise that the resources of the conspirators, combined and coordinated, are sufficient to sustain below-normal profits in selected localities long enough to force USA to shift its capital to markets where it can receive a normal return on its investment. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Thus, during the initial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="348">Page 495 U. S. 348</a></p><p> period of competitive struggle between the conspirators and the independents, consumers will presumably benefit from artificially low prices.  If the alleged campaign is successful, however -- and, as the case comes to us, we must assume it will be -- in the long run, there will be less competition, or potential competition, from independents such as USA, and the character of the market will be different than if the conspiracy had never taken place.  USA alleges that, in fact, the independent market already has suffered significant losses. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>ARCO\'s alleged conspiracy is a naked price restraint in violation of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1.

This is so because the Court assumes that a predatory price is illegal.  The direct relationship between the illegality and the harm is what makes the competitor\'s short-term loss "antitrust injury."  The fact that the illegality in the case before us today stems from the illegal conspiracy, rather than the predatory character of the price, does not change the analysis of "that which makes defendants\' acts unlawful." [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Thus, notwithstanding any temporary benefit to consumers, the unlawful pricing practice that is harmful in the long run to competition causes "antitrust injury" for which a competitor may seek damages.

This reasoning applies with equal force to a rule that provides conspirators with a defense if their agreed-upon prices are nonpredatory, but no defense if their prices fall below the elusive line that defines predatory pricing. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  By assuming that the level of a price is relevant to the inquiry in a \xc2\xa7 1 conspiracy case, the Court sets sail on the "sea of doubt" that Judge Taft condemned in his classic opinion in the <em>Addyston Pipe and Steel</em> case:</p>\n<p>"It is true that there are some cases in which the courts, mistaking, as we conceive, the proper limits of the relaxation of the rules for determining the unreasonableness of restraints of trade, have set sail on a sea of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="355">Page 495 U.

In a thinly veiled circumscription of the substantive reach of \xc2\xa7 1, the Court simply interprets "antitrust injury" under \xc2\xa7 4 so that it excludes challenges by any competitor alleging a vertical conspiracy:</p>\n<p>"[A] vertical price-fixing scheme may facilitate predatory pricing. . . .  [b]ut, because a firm always is able to challenge directly a rival\'s pricing as predatory, there is no reason to dispense with the antitrust injury requirement in an action by a competitor against a vertical agreement."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/328/case.html#339">495 U.

[<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  This focus on the vertical character of the agreement is misleading, because it incorrectly assumes that there is a sharp distinction between vertical and horizontal arrangements, and because it assumes that all vertical arrangements affect competition in the same way.</p>\n<p>The characterization of ARCO\'s price-fixing arrangement as "vertical" does not limit its potential consequences to a neat category of injuries.  A horizontal conspiracy among ARCO retailers, administered by, for example, trade association executives instead of executives of their common supplier, would generate exactly the same anticompetitive consequences.  ARCO and its retail dealers all share an interest in excluding independents like USA from the market.  The fact </p><p><a class="page-number" name="356">Page 495 U.

That is true though the District Court found that, in negotiating and entering into the first agreements, each appellee, other than Masonite, acted independently of the others, negotiated only with Masonite, desired the agreement regardless of the action that might be taken by any of the others, did not require as a condition of its acceptance that Masonite make such an agreement with any of the others, and had no discussions with any of the others. . . .

The fixing of prices by one member of a group, pursuant to express delegation, acquiescence, or understanding, is just as illegal as the fixing of prices by direct, joint action.  <em>Id.</em> [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]"</p>\n<p>Differences between vertical and horizontal agreements may support an argument that the former are more reasonable, and therefore more likely to be upheld as lawful, than the latter.

[<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  For example, a price agreement that is ancillary to an exclusive distributorship might protect consumers from an attempt by the distributor to exploit its limited monopoly.  However, a conclusion that such an agreement would not cause any antitrust injury lends no support to the Court\'s holding that an illegal price arrangement designed to drive a competitor out of business is immune from challenge by its intended victim.

This is true with respect to both maximum and minimum pricing arrangements.</p>\n<p>Professor Sullivan recognized that producers fixing maximum prices "are not acting from undiluted altruism," but </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 495 U.

He described the broad policy reasons to prohibit collusive pricing:</p>\n<p>"The policy which insists on individual decisions about price thus has at its source more than a preference for the independence of the small businessman (though that is surely there) and more than a preference for the lower prices which such a policy will usually yield to consumers (though that too is strongly present).  Also at work is the theoretical conviction that the most general function of the competitive process, the allocation and reallocation of resources in a rational yet automatic manner, can be carried out only if independence by each trader is scrupulously required.  Created out of the confluence of these parallel strivings, the policy has a breadth which makes it as forbidding to maximum price arrangements as to the more common ones which forestall price decreases."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 212.</p>\n<p>In carving out this exception to the enforcement of \xc2\xa7 1, the Court has chosen to second-guess the wisdom of our <em>per se</em> rules and to embark on the questionable enterprise of parsing illegal conspiracies.

However, in its zeal to narrow antitrust injury, the Court assumes that all vertical maximum price-fixing arrangements mimic the circumstances present or discussed in <em>Albrecht,</em> in which there was monopoly power at both the production and exclusive distributorship stages.  This approach is incorrect.  For example, in <em>Albrecht</em> itself, the Court identified possible injury to consumers as one basis for its <em>per se</em> rule, even though there was no evidence of actual consumer injury in that case.  390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/145/case.html#152">390 U. S. 152</a></span>-153.  Furthermore, the <em>Albrecht</em> Court did not treat <em>Albrecht</em> himself as a "dealer" in the conspiracy, but essentially as a "competitor" targeted by the price-fixing conspiracy between Herald Company and the new dealers that were hired "to force petitioner to conform to the advertised retail price" by selling newspapers in his territory at lower, fixed prices.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/145/case.html#149">390 U. S. 149</a></span>-150, and n. 6.  Although <em>Albrecht</em> was a <em>potential</em> Herald dealer -- and thus not strictly a "dealer" or a "competitor" in the Court\'s use of those terms -- what is critical is that he had standing to bring a \xc2\xa7 1 action as the victim of a vertical conspiracy to underprice his sales.  Finally, the Court contradicts its own contrived model when it admits that vertical maximum price-fixing schemes may facilitate predatory pricing for which a competitor could suffer "antitrust injury" in violation of \xc2\xa7 2.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/328/case.html#339">495 U.

Concerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk.  It deprives the marketplace of the independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.  In any conspiracy, two or more entities that previously pursued their own interests separately are combining to act as one for their common benefit.  This not only reduces the diverse directions in which economic power is aimed, but suddenly increases the economic power moving in one particular direction.  Of course, such mergings of resources may well lead to efficiencies that benefit consumers, but their anticompetitive potential is sufficient to warrant scrutiny even in the absence of incipient monopoly."</p>\n<p><em>Copperweld Corp. v.
