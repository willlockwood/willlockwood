Petitioner Hoffman, the bankruptcy trustee in two unrelated Chapter 7 proceedings, filed separate adversarial proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court.  One was a "turnover" proceeding under \xc2\xa7 542(b) against respondent Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance to recover Medicaid payments owed for services rendered by a bankrupt convalescence home.  The other, filed against respondent Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, sought under \xc2\xa7 547(b) to avoid the payment of state taxes, interest, and penalties as a preference, and to recover an amount already paid.  Respondents moved to dismiss both actions as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  The Bankruptcy Court denied the motions on the ground that Congress, in enacting \xc2\xa7 106(c), had abrogated the States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity from actions under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 542(b) and 547(b), which contain the "trigger" words enumerated in \xc2\xa7 106(c)(1), and that Congress had authority to do so under the Bankruptcy Clause of the Constitution.

On behalf of Willington, he filed an adversarial proceeding in United States Bankruptcy Court -- a "turnover" proceeding under 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 542(b) -- against respondent Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance.  Petitioner sought to recover $64,010.24 in payments owed to Willington for services it had rendered during March, 1983, under its Medicaid contract with Connecticut.  Willington closed in April, 1983.

Zera owed the State of Connecticut unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest, and, in the month prior to Zera\'s filing for bankruptcy, the Revenue Department had issued a tax warrant resulting in a payment of $2,100.62.

In each case, the Bankruptcy Court denied the motions to dismiss, reasoning that Congress, in \xc2\xa7 106(c), had abrogated the States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity from actions under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 542(b) and 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and that Congress had authority to do so under the Bankruptcy Clause of the United States Constitution, Art.

The District Court reversed without reaching the issue of congressional authority.  72 B.R. 1002 (Conn.1987).  The court held that \xc2\xa7 106(c), when read with the other provisions of \xc2\xa7 106, did not unequivocally abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="100">Page 492 U. S. 100</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court.  850 F.2d 50 (1988).  The Court of Appeals concluded that the plain language of \xc2\xa7 106(c) abrogates sovereign immunity "only to the extent necessary for the bankruptcy court to determine a state\'s rights in the debtor\'s estate."  <em>Id.</em> at 55.  The section does not, according to the Court of Appeals, abrogate a State\'s Eleventh Amendment immunity from recovery of an avoided preferential transfer of money or from a turnover proceeding.  The Court of Appeals specifically rejected petitioner\'s reliance on the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 106(c) because that expression of congressional intent was not contained in the language of the statute, as required by <em>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html">473 U. S. 234</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html#242">473 U. S. 242</a></span> (1985).  Because the actions brought by petitioner were not within the scope of \xc2\xa7 106(c), the Court held that they were barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p>The Second Circuit\'s decision conflicts with the decisions of the Third Circuit in <em>Vazquez v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare,</em> 788 F.2d 130, 133, <em>cert. denied,</em> 479 U.S. 936 (1986), and the Seventh Circuit in <em>McVey Trucking, Inc. v. Secretary of State of Illinois,</em> 812 F.2d 311, 326-327, <em>cert. denied,</em> 484 U.S. 895 (1987).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 488 U.S. 1003 (1989), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p>Section 106 provides as follows:</p>\n<p>"(a) A governmental unit is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which such governmental unit\'s claim arose."</p>\n<p>"(b) There shall be offset against an allowed claim or interest of a governmental unit any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate."</p>\n<p>"(c) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity -- "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 492 U. S. 101</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"(1) a provision of this title that contains \'creditor,\' \'entity,\' or \'governmental unit\' applies to governmental units; and"</p>\n<p>"(2) a determination by the court of an issue arising under such a provision binds governmental units."</p>\n<p>11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 106.</p>\n<p>Neither \xc2\xa7 106(a) nor \xc2\xa7 106(b) provides a basis for petitioner\'s actions here, since respondents did not file a claim in either Chapter 7 proceeding.  Instead, petitioner relies on \xc2\xa7 106(c), which, he asserts, subjects "governmental units," which includes States, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 101(26), to all provisions of the Bankruptcy Code containing any of the "trigger" words in \xc2\xa7 106(c)(1).  Both the turnover provision, \xc2\xa7 542(b) and the preference provision, \xc2\xa7 547(b) contain trigger words -- "an entity" is required to pay to the trustee a debt that is the property of the estate, and a trustee can under appropriate circumstances avoid the transfer of property to "a creditor."  Therefore, petitioner reasons, those provisions apply to respondents "notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity," including Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n<p>We disagree.  As we have repeatedly stated, to abrogate the States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court, which the parties do not dispute would otherwise bar these actions, Congress must make its intention "unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."  <em>Atascadero State Hospital v.

In our view, \xc2\xa7 106(c) does not satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p>Initially, the narrow scope of the waivers of sovereign immunity in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 106(a) and (b) makes it unlikely that Congress adopted in \xc2\xa7 106(c) the broad abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity for which petitioner argues.  The language of \xc2\xa7 106(a) carefully limits the waiver of sovereign immunity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 492 U. S. 102</a></p><p> under that provision, requiring that the claim against the governmental unit arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the governmental unit\'s claim.  Subsection (b) likewise provides for a narrow waiver of sovereign immunity, with the amount of the offset limited to the value of the governmental unit\'s allowed claim.  Under petitioner\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 106(c), however, the only limit is the number of provisions of the Bankruptcy Code containing one of the trigger words.  With this "limit," \xc2\xa7 106(c) would apply in a scattershot fashion to over 100 Code provisions.</p>\n<p>We believe that \xc2\xa7 106(c)(2) operates as a further limitation on the applicability of \xc2\xa7 106(c), narrowing the type of relief to which the section applies.  Section 106(c)(2) is joined with subsection (c)(1) by the conjunction "and."  It provides that a "determination" by the bankruptcy court of an "issue" "binds governmental units."  This language differs significantly from the wording of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 106(a) and (b), both of which use the word "claim," defined in the Bankruptcy Code as including a "right to payment."  <em>See</em> 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 101(4)(A).  Nothing in \xc2\xa7 106(c) provides a similar express authorization for monetary recovery from the States.</p>\n<p>The language of \xc2\xa7 106(c)(2) is more indicative of declaratory and injunctive relief than of monetary recovery.  The clause echoes the wording of sections of the Code such as \xc2\xa7 505, which provides that "the court may determine the amount or legality of any tax," 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 505(a)(1), a determination of an issue that obviously should bind the governmental unit, but that does not require a monetary recovery from a State.  We therefore construe \xc2\xa7 106(c) as not authorizing monetary recovery from the States.  Under this construction of \xc2\xa7 106 (c), a State that files no proof of claim would be bound, like other creditors, by discharge of debts in bankruptcy, including unpaid taxes, <em>see Neavear v. Schweiker,</em> 674 F.2d 1201, 1204 (CA7 1982); <em>cf. Gwilliam v. United States,</em> 519 F.2d 407, 410 (CA9 1975), but would not be subjected to monetary recovery. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 492 U. S. 103</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We are not persuaded by the suggestion of petitioner\'s <em>amicus</em> that the use of the word "determine" in the jurisdictional provision of the Code, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 157(b)(1), is to the contrary.  Brief for INSLAW, Inc., as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 1011.  That provision authorizes bankruptcy judges to determine "cases" and "proceedings," not issues, and provides that the judge may "enter appropriate orders and judgments," not merely bind the governmental unit by its determinations.  Moreover, the construction we give to \xc2\xa7 106(c) does not render irrelevant the language of the section that it applies "notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity."  The section applies to the Federal Government as well, <em>see</em> 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 101(26) (defining "governmental unit" as including the "United States"), and the language in \xc2\xa7 106(c) waives the sovereign immunity of the Federal Government, so that the Federal Government is bound by determinations of issues by the bankruptcy courts even when it did not appear and subject itself to the jurisdiction of such courts.  <em>See, e.g., Neavear, supra,</em> at 1204.</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends that the language of the sections containing the trigger words supplies the necessary authorization for monetary recovery from the States.  This interpretation, however, ignores entirely the limiting language of \xc2\xa7 106(c)(2).  Indeed, \xc2\xa7 106(c), as interpreted by petitioner, would have exactly the same effect if subsection (c)(2) had been totally omitted.

The Government suggests that these statements should be construed as referring only to cases in which the debtor retains a possessory or ownership interest in the property that the trustee seeks to recover, Brief for United States 20, and cites as an example this Court\'s decision in <em>United States v.

These arguments are not based in the text of the statute, and so, too, are not helpful in determining whether the command of <em>Atascadero</em> is satisfied.  <em>See</em> 491 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/223/case.html#230">491 U.

Therefore, petitioner\'s actions in United States Bankruptcy Court under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 542(b) and 547(b) of the Code are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  Since we hold that Congress did not abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity by enacting \xc2\xa7 106 (c), we need not address whether it had the authority to do so under its bankruptcy power.  <em>Cf.

Scanlon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html">473 U.

Because Congress clearly expressed its intent to authorize a bankruptcy court to issue a money judgment against a State that has not filed a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding, and because Congress has the authority under the Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate the States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Section 106(c) states that, "notwithstanding <em>any</em> assertion of sovereign immunity," any Code provision containing one of the trigger words -- "creditor," "entity," or "governmental unit" -- applies to the States, and that "a determination by the court of an issue arising under such a provision binds [the States]" (emphasis added).  The drafters of \xc2\xa7 106(c) were fully aware of "the requirement in case law that an express waiver of sovereign immunity is required in order to be effective."  124 Cong.Rec. 32394 (1978) (statement of Rep. Edwards); <em>id.</em> at 33993 (statement of Sen. DeConcini); <em>see Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/279/case.html">411 U.

They therefore carefully abrogated the States\' sovereign immunity in three steps.  First, they eliminated "any assertion of sovereign immunity."  \xc2\xa7 106(c).  Second, they included States within the trigger words used elsewhere in the Code.  \xc2\xa7 106(c)(1).  Third, they provided that States would be bound by the orders of the bankruptcy court.  \xc2\xa7 106(c)(2).  What the plurality sees as redundancy in subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) is thus more reasonably understood as evidence of the importance Congress attached to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="107">Page 492 U. S. 107</a></p><p> ensuring that the abrogation of sovereign immunity was express. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>By its terms, \xc2\xa7 106(c) makes no distinction between Code provisions that contain trigger words and permit only injunctive and declaratory relief and Code provisions that contain trigger words and permit money judgments.  Nevertheless, by placing heavy emphasis on the word "determination" in \xc2\xa7 106(c)(2), the plurality concludes that \xc2\xa7 106(c), in its entirety, is "more indicative of declaratory and injunctive relief than of monetary recovery."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/96/case.html#102">492 U. S. 102</a></span>.  The plurality justifies this conclusion by accepting an analogy to the use of the word "determine" in a Code provision dealing with taxes, \xc2\xa7 505(a)(1), while rejecting an equally compelling analogy to the use of the word "determine" in the Code\'s jurisdictional provision, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 157(b)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. V).  But instead of trying to force meaning into the word "determination" through competing analogies to other Code provisions, we should give decisive weight to the explicit language abrogating sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>The plurality correctly points out that the abrogation of sovereign immunity in \xc2\xa7 106(c) should not be read to overwhelm </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 492 U. S. 108</a></p><p> the narrow scope of the voluntary waiver set forth in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 106(a) and (b).  But the plurality\'s conclusion that \xc2\xa7 106(c) must therefore refer only to declarative and injunctive relief rests on the mistaken assumption that, without such a narrowing interpretation, "the <em>only</em> limit is the number of provisions in the Bankruptcy Code containing one of the trigger words."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/96/case.html#102">492 U. S. 102</a></span> (emphasis added).  The plurality then raises the specter that "\xc2\xa7 106(c) would apply in a scattershot fashion to over 100 Code provisions," <em>ibid.,</em> offering virtually endless opportunities for money judgments against the States.</p>\n<p>Nothing could be further from the truth, for most of the Code provisions containing trigger words do not contemplate money judgments.  Some provide States, in their role as creditors or entities, with rights against the debtor. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Others limit relief against "creditors," "entities," or "governmental units" to declaratory or injunctive relief. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Only a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 492 U. S. 109</a></p><p> handful of the triggered sections clearly contemplate money judgments <em>against</em> a "creditor," "entity," or "governmental unit."  These include the Code provisions at issue in this case, <em>i.e.,</em> the provision giving a trustee the power to avoid preferential payments made to "creditors," \xc2\xa7 547, and the provision requiring "entities" to turn over property and money belonging to the debtor.  \xc2\xa7 542. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Thus, rather than reading \xc2\xa7 106(c) in isolation as the plurality does, the provision should be read in light of the Code provisions containing the trigger words "creditor," "entity," and "governmental unit."  Only in this way is it possible to appreciate the limited extent to which Congress sought to abrogate the States\' sovereign immunity in \xc2\xa7 106(c).  <em>See Kelly v. Robinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/36/case.html">479 U. S. 36</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/36/case.html#43">479 U. S. 43</a></span> (1986) (Code should be read as an integrated whole).</p>\n<p>By expressly including States within the terms "creditor" and "entity," Congress intended States generally to be treated the same as ordinary "creditors" and "entities," who are subject to money judgments in a relatively small number of Code provisions.  The effect of today\'s decision is to exempt States from these provisions, which are crucial to the efficacy of the Code.  The plurality therefore ignores Congress\' careful choice of language and turns States into preferred </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 492 U. S. 110</a></p><p> actors. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  By allowing a trustee to recapture payments made to creditors 90 days before a bankruptcy petition is filed, the preference provision prevents anxious creditors from grabbing payments from an insolvent debtor, and hence getting more than their fair share.  After today, however, any State owed money by a debtor with financial problems will have a strong incentive to collect whatever it can, as fast as it can, even if doing so pushes the debtor into bankruptcy.  Ordinary creditors will soon realize that States can receive more than their fair share; the very existence of this governmental power will cause these other creditors, in turn, to increase pressure on the debtor.  <em>See McVey Trucking, Inc. v. Secretary of State of Illinois,</em> 812 F.2d 311, 328 (CA7), <em>cert. denied,</em> 484 U.S. 895 (1987). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The turnover provision is designed to prevent third parties from keeping property of the debtor or from refusing to make payments owed to the debtor, thereby aiding the reorganization of the debtor\'s affairs </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 492 U. S. 111</a></p><p> or the orderly and equitable distribution of the estate.  <em>See United States v.

Exempting States from this provision, as well as from the preference provision, undermines these important policy goals of the Code.</p>\n<p>My conclusion that Congress intended \xc2\xa7 106(c) to abrogate the States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity against money judgments requires me to decide whether Congress has the authority under the Bankruptcy Clause to do so.

In 1973, five years before the Code was enacted, the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States proposed a broad </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 492 U. S. 112</a></p><p> waiver of sovereign immunity under which every provision of the proposed bankruptcy bill would apply to the States.  That provision was not enacted into law, apparently because of concerns that Congress did not have the constitutional power to abrogate completely the States\' sovereign immunity.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, p. 317 (1977); S.Rep. No. 95-989, p. 29 (1978).  Instead, the initial legislation drafted by Congress limited the waiver of sovereign immunity to compulsory counterclaims and offsets, the provisions that now appear in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 106(a) and 106(b).  Section 106(c), added after the bill that became the Bankruptcy Code was reported by the Senate and House Committees, restored to a large extent the power of the bankruptcy courts over States that had first been proposed in 1973.  Whereas the waiver contained in the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws\' proposal would have subjected the States to suit under every provision of the Code, the application of \xc2\xa7 106(c) was limited to those Code provisions containing the statutory trigger words.  The House and Senate sponsors explained in floor statements:</p>\n<p>"The provision is included to comply with the requirement in case law that an express waiver of sovereign immunity is required in order to be effective.  Section 106(c) codifies <em>In re Gwilliam,</em> 519 F.2d 407 (9th Cir., 1975), and <em>In re Dolard,</em> 519 F.2d 282 (9th Cir., 1975), permitting the bankruptcy court to determine the amount and dischargeability of tax liabilities owing by the debtor or the estate prior to or during a bankruptcy case, whether or not the governmental unit to which such taxes are owed files a proof of claim. . . .  [S]ubsection (c) is not limited to those issues, but permits the bankruptcy court to bind governmental units on other matters as well.  For example, section 106(c) permits a trustee or debtor in possession to assert avoiding powers under title 11 against a governmental unit; contrary language in the House report to H.R. 8200 is thereby overruled "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 492 U. S. 113</a></p><p></p>\n<p>124 Cong.Rec. 32394 (1978) (statement of Rep. Edwards); <em>id.</em> at 33993 (statement of Sen. DeConcini).</p>\n<p>The sponsors later added:</p>\n<p>"Section 547(b)(2) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the House bill and rejects an alternative contained in the Senate amendment relating to the avoidance of a preferential transfer that is payment of a tax claim owing to a governmental unit.  As provided, section 106(c) of the House amendment overrules contrary language in the House report with the result that the Government is subject to avoidance of preferential transfers."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 32400 (statement of Rep. Edwards); <em>id.</em> at 34000 (statement of Sen. DeConcini).</p>\n<p>Although the primary object of \xc2\xa7 106(c) was to provide the bankruptcy court with authority to determine the amount and dischargeability of tax liabilities even if a claim has not been filed, the legislative history thus indicates that the provision was also intended to cover "other matters as well," including specifically the avoidance of preferential transfers.  There was no suggestion that this authority did not include the power to order the return of real property and the payment of money damages, or that the issues that the bankruptcy court could determine under \xc2\xa7 106(c) were limited to whether prospective or declaratory relief was appropriate.</p>\n<p>The fact that paragraph (c) was added to the bill after paragraphs (a) and (b) had been reported out of Committee also explains why those paragraphs were not rewritten to eliminate any possible redundancy in the section.  Given this history, it is apparent that the initial phrase in paragraph (c) ("[e]xcept as provided in subsections (a) and (b)") constituted a declaration that the new subsection provided an additional mechanism by which the bankruptcy courts could bind States and did not derogate from the power granted under the other two subsections. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 492 U. S. 114</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is no question that \xc2\xa7 106(c) effects a waiver of sovereign immunity.  The statute, which applies to the Federal Government, the States, and municipalities alike, <em>see</em> 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 101(21), states in the clearest possible terms that provisions of the Code using any of the trigger words apply to governmental units "notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity," and the legislative history supports that reading.  It is well settled that, when the Federal Government waives its sovereign immunity, the scope of that waiver is construed liberally to effect its remedial purposes.  <em>See Block v.

I would therefore hold that the determinations that a bankruptcy court may make under \xc2\xa7 106(c) include a determination that a State must pay money damages under a Code provision containing one of the trigger words.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
