Unlike Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U.S., 128, this habeas corpus proceeding in the federal courts does not challenge purported error in a court martial trial prior to exhaustion of military remedies. Rather the question is whether the doctrine of exhaustion of military remedies applies where the question is whether the court martial authority acts outside its jurisdiction. Cf.
