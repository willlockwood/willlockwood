Ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds underlying segments of the Missouri, Madison, and Clark Fork Rivers.  Five hydroelectric dams on the Upper Missouri River are along the Great Falls reach, including on the three tallest waterfalls; and PPL\xe2\x80\x99s two other dams on that river are in canyons on the Stubbs Ferry stretch.  These, together with two dams located in steep canyons on the Madison River, are called the Missouri-Madison project.  The Thompson Falls project is a facility on the Clark Fork River.  Both projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  PPL\xe2\x80\x99s facilities have existed for many decades, some for over a century.  Until recently, Montana, though aware of the projects\xe2\x80\x99 existence, sought no rent for use of the riverbeds.  Instead, the understanding of PPL and the United States is that PPL has paid rents to the United States.  In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren filed a federal suit, claiming that PPL\xe2\x80\x99s facilities were on riverbeds that were state owned and part of Montana\xe2\x80\x99s school trust lands.  The State joined the suit and, for the first time, sought rents from PPL for its use of the riverbeds.  That case was dismissed, and PPL and other power companies filed a state-court suit, claiming that Montana was barred from seeking compensation for PPL\xe2\x80\x99s riverbed use.  Montana counterclaimed, contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use.  The trial court granted Montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes of determining riverbed title and ordered PPL to pay Montana $41 million in rent for riverbed use between 2000 and 2007.  The Montana Supreme Court affirmed.  Adopting a liberal construction of the navigability test, it discounted this Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach of considering the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of determining whether a State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments at the time of statehood.  Instead, the Montana court declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavigability, since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.  Based on evidence of present-day, recreational use of the Madison River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of law at the time of statehood.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The Montana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that Montana owns and may charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm legal understanding of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s rules of navigability for title under the equal-footing doctrine.

Bowlby, \n\n152 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, has federal constitutional significance under the equal-footing doctrine.  Pursuant to that doctrine, upon its date of statehood, a State gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then navigable.  It may allocate and govern those lands according to state law subject only to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 power \xe2\x80\x9cto control such waters for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Oregon, \n\n295 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  The United States retains title vested in it before statehood to land beneath waters not then navigable.  To be navigable for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine, rivers must be \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9cthey are used, or are susceptible of being used, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563.  This formulation has been used to determine questions of waterbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.  See United States v. Utah, \n\n283 U.\xc2\xa0S. 64\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0The Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the question of river segments and portage.  To determine riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine, this Court considers the river on a segment-by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the river, under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable or not.  See, e.g., Utah, supra, at 77.  The State Supreme Court erred in discounting this well-settled approach.  A key justification for sovereign ownership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow private riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that could interfere with the public\xe2\x80\x99s right to use the waters as a highway for commerce.  Because commerce could not have occurred on segments nonnavigable at the time of statehood, there is no reason to deem those segments owned by the State under the equal-footing doctrine.  Practical considerations also support segmentation.  Physical conditions affecting navigability vary over the length of a river and provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end points for disputed segments.  A segment approach is also consistent with the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed title.  Montana cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when the state courts managed to apportion the underlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their value and PPL\xe2\x80\x99s corresponding rents.  The State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that the segment-by-segment approach does not apply to short interruptions of navigability is not supported by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Utah decision.  Even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer, navigable reach, it is doubtful that the segments in this case would meet that standard.  Applying its \xe2\x80\x9cshort interruptions\xe2\x80\x9d approach, the State Supreme Court found the Great Falls reach navigable because it could be managed by way of land route portage, as done by Lewis and Clark. But a portage of even one day would demonstrate the need to bypass a nonnavigable river segment.  Thus, the State Supreme Court was wrong to conclude, with respect to the Great Falls reach and other disputed stretches, that portages were insufficient to defeat a navigability finding.  In most cases, they are, because they require transportation over land rather than over the water.  This is the case at least as to the Great Falls reach.  In reaching a contrary conclusion, the State Supreme Court misapplied The Montello, 20 Wall. 430.  There, portage was considered in determining whether a river was part of a channel of interstate commerce for federal regulatory purposes.  The Montello does not control the outcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title context apply.  Portages may defeat navigability for title purposes, and do so with respect to the Great Falls reach.  Montana does not dispute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach, and the trial court noted the waterfalls had never been navigated. The Great Falls reach, at least from the head of the first waterfall to the foot of the last, is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.  There is also a significant likelihood that some of the other river stretches in dispute fail this federal navigability test.  The ultimate decision as to these other disputed river stretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the Montana courts on remand, which should assess the relevant evidence in light of the principles discussed here.

Navigability must be assessed as of the time of statehood, and it concerns a river\xe2\x80\x99s usefulness for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98trade and travel.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Utah, 283 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75\xe2\x80\x9376.

Id., at 76.  Evidence of recreational use and poststatehood evidence may bear on susceptibility of commercial use at the time of statehood.  See id., at 82\xe2\x80\x9383.  In order for present-day use to have a bearing on navigability at statehood, (1)\xc2\xa0the watercraft must be meaningfully similar to those in customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood, and (2)\xc2\xa0the river\xe2\x80\x99s poststatehood condition may not be materially different from its physical condition at statehood.

Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, which is the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of riverbed title, the scope of the public trust over waters within the State\xe2\x80\x99s borders is a matter of state law, subject to federal regulatory power.

The question is whether discrete, identifiable segments of these rivers in Montana were nonnavigable, as federal law defines that concept for purposes of determining whether the State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments, when the State entered the Union in 1889.  Montana contends that the rivers must be found navigable at the disputed locations.  From this premise, the State asserts that in 1889 it gained title to the disputed riverbeds under the constitutional equal-footing doctrine.  Based on its title claims, Montana sought compensation from PPL Montana, LLC, a power company, for its use of the riverbeds for hydroelectric projects.  The Montana courts granted summary judgment on title to Montana, awarding it $41 million in rent for the riverbeds for the period from 2000 to 2007 alone.

While one usually thinks of the Missouri River as flowing generally south, as indeed it does beginning in North Dakota, the Upper Missouri in Montana flows north from its principal headwaters at Three Forks, which is located about 4,000 feet above sea level in the Rocky Mountain area of southwestern Montana.  It descends through scenic mountain terrain including the deep gorge at the Gates of the Mountains; turns eastward through the Great Falls reach, cascading over a roughly 10-mile stretch of cataracts and rapids over which the river drops more than 400 feet; and courses swiftly to Fort Benton, a 19th-century fur trading post, before progressing farther east into North Dakota and on to the Great Plains.  19 Encyclopedia Americana, supra, at 270; 8 New Encyclopaedia Britannica 190 (15th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Encyclopaedia Britannica); 2 Columbia Gazetteer of the World 2452 (2d ed. 2008) (here- inafter Columbia Gazetteer); F.

Named by Lewis and Clark for then-Secretary of State James Madison, the Madison River courses west out of the Northern Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Montana in what is now Yellowstone National Park, then runs north and merges with the Jefferson and Gallatin Rivers at Three Forks, Montana, to form the Upper Missouri.

The river flows northward for about 40 miles; turns northwest for a stretch; then turns abruptly northeast for a short stint, by which time it has descended nearly 2,500 feet in altitude.  It then resumes a northwestward course until it empties into Lake Pend Oreille in northern Idaho, out of which flows a tributary to the Columbia River of the Pacific Northwest.

See Shively v. Bowlby, \n\n152 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n13 (1894)\n.  A distinction was made in England between waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide (royal rivers) and nontidal waters (public highways).  With respect to royal rivers, the Crown was presumed to hold title to the riverbed and soil, but the public retained the right of passage and the right to fish in the stream.  With respect to public highways, as the name suggests, the public also retained the right of water passage; but title to the riverbed and soil, as a general matter, was held in private ownership.  Riparian landowners shared title, with each owning from his side to the center thread of the stream, as well as the exclusive right to fish there.  See Idaho v. Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe of Idaho, \n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 261, \n285 (1997)\n (summarizing J. Angell, A Treatise on the Common Law in Relation to Water-Courses 14\xe2\x80\x9318 (1824)); 3 J.

Some state courts came early to the conclusion that a State holds presumptive title to navigable waters whether or not the waters are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide.  See, e.g., Carson v. Blazer, 2 Binn. 475 (Pa. 1810); Executors of Cates v. Wadlington, 12 S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0L. 580 (1822); Wilson v. Forbes, 13 N.\xc2\xa0C. 30 (1828); Bullock v. Wilson, 2 Port. 436 (Ala. 1835); Elder v. Burrus, 25 Tenn. 358 (1845).  The tidal rule of \xe2\x80\x9cnavigability\xe2\x80\x9d for sovereign ownership of riverbeds, while perhaps appropriate for England\xe2\x80\x99s dominant coastal geography, was ill suited to the United States with its vast number of major inland rivers upon which navigation could be sustained.  See L. Houck, Law of Navigable Rivers 26\xe2\x80\x9327, 31\xe2\x80\x9335 (1868); Packer v. Bird, \n\n137 U.\xc2\xa0S. 661\n\xe2\x80\x93669 (1891).  By the late 19th century, the Court had recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthe now prevailing doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d of state sovereign \xe2\x80\x9ctitle in the soil of rivers really navigable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shively, supra, at 31; see Barney v. Keokuk, \n\n94 U.\xc2\xa0S. 324, \n336 (1877)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIn this country, as a general thing, all waters are deemed navigable which are really so\xe2\x80\x9d).  This title rule became known as \xe2\x80\x9cnavigability in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe rule for state riverbed title assumed federal constitutional significance under the equal-footing doctrine.  In 1842, the Court declared that for the 13 original States, the people of each State, based on principles of sovereignty, \xe2\x80\x9chold the absolute right to all their navigable waters and the soils under them,\xe2\x80\x9d subject only to rights surrendered and powers granted by the Constitution to the Federal Government.  Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410 (1842).  In a series of 19th-century cases, the Court determined that the same principle applied to States later admitted to the Union, because the States in the Union are coequal sovereigns under the Constitution.  See, e.g., Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How.  212, 228\xe2\x80\x93229 (1845); Knight v. United States Land Assn., \n\n142 U.\xc2\xa0S. 161, \n183 (1891)\n; Shively, supra, at 26\xe2\x80\x9331; see United States v. Texas, \n\n339 U.\xc2\xa0S. 707, \n716 (1950)\n.  These precedents are the basis for the equal-footing doctrine, under which a State\xe2\x80\x99s title to these lands was \xe2\x80\x9cconferred not by Congress but by the Constitution itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v. Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel Co., \n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 363, \n374 (1977)\n.  It follows that any ensuing questions of navigability for de- termining state riverbed title are governed by federal law.  See, e.g., United States v. Utah, \n\n283 U.\xc2\xa0S. 64, \n75 (1931)\n; United States v. Oregon, \n\n295 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n14 (1935)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe title consequences of the equal-footing doctrine can be stated in summary form: Upon statehood, the State gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then navigable (or tidally influenced, see Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Mississippi, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 469 (1988)\n, although that is not relevant in this case).  It may allocate and govern those lands according to state law subject only to \xe2\x80\x9cthe paramount power of the United States to control such waters for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oregon, supra, at 14; see Montana v. United States, \n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 544, \n551 (1981)\n; United States v. Holt State Bank, \n\n270 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49, \n54 (1926)\n.  The United States retains any title vested in it before statehood to any land beneath waters not then navigable (and not tidally influenced), to be transferred or licensed if and as it chooses.  See Utah, supra, at 75; Oregon, supra, at 14.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tReturning to the \xe2\x80\x9cnavigability in fact\xe2\x80\x9d rule, the Court has explained the elements of this test.  A basic formulation of the rule was set forth in The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557 (1871), a case concerning federal power to regulate navigation:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThose rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers in law which are navigable in fact.  And they are navigable in fact when they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 563.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Daniel Ball formulation has been invoked in considering the navigability of waters for purposes of assessing federal regulatory authority under the Constitution, and the application of specific federal statutes, as to the waters and their beds.  See, e.g., ibid.; The Montello, 20 Wall. 430, 439 (1874); United States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., \n\n311 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377\n, and n. 21 (1940) (Federal Power Act); Rapanos v. United States, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 715\n\xe2\x80\x93731 (2006) (plurality opinion) (Clean Water Act); id., at 761 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (same).  It has been used as well to determine questions of title to water beds under the equal-footing doctrine.  See Utah, supra, at 76; Oklahoma v. Texas, \n\n258 U.\xc2\xa0S. 574, \n586 (1922)\n; Holt State Bank, supra, at 56.  It should be noted, however, that the test for navigability is not applied in the same way in these distinct types of cases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAmong the differences in application are the following.  For state title under the equal-footing doctrine, naviga- bility is determined at the time of statehood, see Utah, supra, at 75, and based on the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural and ordinary con- dition\xe2\x80\x9d of the water, see Oklahoma, supra, at 591.  In contrast, admiralty jurisdiction extends to water routes made navigable even if not formerly so, see, e.g., Ex parte Boyer, \n\n109 U.\xc2\xa0S. 629\n\xe2\x80\x93632 (1884) (artificial canal); and federal regulatory authority encompasses waters that only recently have become navigable, see, e.g., Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n\n223 U.\xc2\xa0S. 605\n\xe2\x80\x93635 (1912), were once navigable but are no longer, see Economy Light &amp; Power Co. v.

In United States v. Utah, for example, the Court noted,\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cthe controversy relates only to the sections of the rivers which are described in the complaint, and the Master has limited his findings and conclusions as to navigability accordingly.  The propriety of this course, in view of the physical characteristics of the streams, is apparent.  Even where the navigability of a river, speaking generally, is a matter of common knowledge, and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken, it may yet be a question, to be determined upon evidence, how far navigability extends.\xe2\x80\x9d  283 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 77.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe Court went on to conclude, after reciting and assessing the evidence, that the Colorado River was navigable for its first roughly 4-mile stretch, nonnavigable for the next roughly 36-mile stretch, and navigable for its remaining 149 miles.  Id., at 73\xe2\x80\x9374, 79\xe2\x80\x9381, 89.  The Court noted the importance of determining \xe2\x80\x9cthe exact point at which navigability may be deemed to end.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 90.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, in Brewer-Elliott Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. United States, \n\n260 U.\xc2\xa0S. 77, \n85 (1922)\n, the Court examined the segment of the Arkansas River that ran along the Osage Indian Reservation, assessing whether the Arkansas River was \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable in fact at the locus in quo.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court concluded that the United States originally, and the Osages as its grantees, unequivocally held title to the riverbeds because the Arkansas River \xe2\x80\x9cis and was not navigable at the place where the river bed lots, here in controversy, are.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 86.  The Court found the segment of river along the reservation to be nonnavigable even though a segment of the river that began further downstream was navigable.  Ibid.  See also Oklahoma, supra, at 583, 584, 587\xe2\x80\x93588, 589\xe2\x80\x93591 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9chow far up the streams navigability extended was not known\xe2\x80\x9d; assessing separately the segments of the Red River above and below its confluence with the Washita River within Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s borders; and concluding that neither segment, and hence \xe2\x80\x9cno part of the river within Oklahoma,\xe2\x80\x9d was navigable).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Montana Supreme Court discounted the segment-by-segment approach of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases, calling it  \xe2\x80\x9ca piecemeal classification of navigability\xe2\x80\x94with some stretches declared navigable, and others declared non-navigable.\xe2\x80\x9d  355 Mont., at 440\xe2\x80\x93442, 229 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 448\xe2\x80\x93449.  This was error.  The segment-by-segment approach to navigability for title is well settled, and it should not be disregarded.  A key justification for sovereign ownership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow private riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that could interfere with the public\xe2\x80\x99s right to use the waters as a highway for commerce.  While the Federal Government and States retain regulatory power to protect public navigation, allocation to the State of the beds underlying navigable rivers reduces the possibility of conflict between private and public interests.  See Utah, supra, at 82\xe2\x80\x9383; Packer, 137 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 667.  By contrast, segments that are nonnavigable at the time of statehood are those over which commerce could not then occur.  Thus, there is no reason that these segments also should be deemed owned by the State under the equal-footing doctrine.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPractical considerations also support segmentation.  Physical conditions that affect navigability often vary significantly over the length of a river.  This is particularly true with longer rivers, which can traverse vastly different terrain and the flow of which can be affected by varying local climates.  The Missouri River provides an excellent example: Between its headwaters and mouth, it runs for over 2,000 miles out of steep mountains, through canyons and upon rocky beds, over waterfalls and rapids, and across sandy plains, capturing runoff from snow melt and farmland rains alike.  These shifts in physical conditions provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end points for the segment in question.  Topographical and geographical indicators may assist.  See, e.g., Utah, supra, at 77\xe2\x80\x9380 (gradient changes); Oklahoma, 258 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 589 (location of tributary providing additional flow).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA segment approach to riverbed title allocation under the equal-footing doctrine is consistent with the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed title.  For centuries, where title to the riverbed was not in the sovereign, the common-law rule for allocating riverbed title among riparian landowners involved apportionment defined both by segment (each landowner owns bed and soil along the length of his land adjacent) and thread (each landowner owns bed and soil to the center of the stream).  See J. Angell, A Treatise on the Law of Watercourses 18 (6th ed. 1869); Tyler v. Wilkinson, 24 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 472, 474 (No. 14,312) (CC RI 1827) (Story, J.).  Montana, moreover, cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when the state courts managed to divide up and apportion the underlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their value and the corresponding rents owed by PPL.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Montana Supreme Court, relying upon Utah, de- cided that the segment-by-segment approach is inapplicable here because it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not apply to \xe2\x80\x98short interruption[s] of navigability in a stream otherwise navigable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  355 Mont., at 442, 229 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 449 (quoting Utah, 283 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 77).  This was mistaken.  In Utah, this Court noted in pass- ing that the facts of the case concerned \xe2\x80\x9clong reaches with particular characteristics of navigability or non-navigability\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cshort interruption[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 77.  The Court in Utah did not say the case would have a different outcome if a \xe2\x80\x9cshort interruption\xe2\x80\x9d were concerned.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if the law might find some nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer, navigable reach for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine, it is doubtful that any of the segments in this case would meet that standard, and one\xe2\x80\x94the Great Falls reach\xe2\x80\x94certainly would not.  As an initial matter, the kinds of considerations that would define a de minimis exception to the segment-by-segment approach would be those related to principles of ownership and title, such as inadministrability of parcels of exceedingly small size, or worthlessness of the parcels due to overdivision.  See Heller, The Tragedy of the Anticommons, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 621, 682\xe2\x80\x93684 (1998) (explaining that dividing prop- erty into square-inch parcels, could, absent countervail- ing legal mechanisms, \xe2\x80\x9cparalyze the alienability of scarce resources .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or diminish their value too drastically\xe2\x80\x9d).  An analysis of segmentation must be sensibly applied.  A comparison of the nonnavigable segment\xe2\x80\x99s length to the overall length of the stream, for instance, would be simply irrelevant to the issue at hand.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA number of the segments at issue here are both discrete, as defined by physical features characteristic of navigability or nonnavigability, and substantial, as a matter of administrability for title purposes.  This is best illustrated by the Great Falls reach, which is 17 miles long and has distinct drops including five waterfalls and continuous rapids in between.  There is plenty of reason to doubt that reach\xe2\x80\x99s navigability based on the presence of the series of falls.  There is also reason to think that title to that segment of bed would not be worthless or inadministrable.  Indeed, the State sought and was awarded rent in the amount of $41 million for PPL\xe2\x80\x99s various hydroelectric facilities attached to the riverbeds, half of which are along the Great Falls reach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying its \xe2\x80\x9cshort interruptions\xe2\x80\x9d approach, the Montana Supreme Court decided that the Great Falls reach was navigable because it could be managed by way of land route portage.  355 Mont., at 440, 442, 229 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 447, 449.  The court noted in particular the portage of Lewis and Clark\xe2\x80\x99s expedition.  Ibid.  Yet that very portage reveals the problem with the Montana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  Leaving behind their larger boats, Lewis and Clark transported their supplies and some small canoes about 18 miles over land, which took at least 11 days and probably more.  See Lewis and Clark Journals 126\xe2\x80\x93152; 9 Journals of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition 173; Dear Brother 109.  Even if portage were to take travelers only one day, its significance is the same: it demonstrates the need to bypass the river segment, all because that part of the river is nonnavigable.  Thus, the Montana Supreme Court was wrong to state, with respect to the Great Falls reach and other stretches of the rivers in question, that portages \xe2\x80\x9care not sufficient to defeat a finding of navigability.\xe2\x80\x9d  355 Mont., at 438, 229 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 446.  In most cases, they are, because they require transportation over land rather than over the water.  This is such a case, at least as to the Great Falls reach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn reaching its conclusion that the necessity of portage does not undermine navigability, the Montana Supreme Court misapplied this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in The Montello, 20 Wall. 430.  See 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 446.  The consideration of portage in The Montello was for a different purpose.  The Court did not seek to determine whether the river in question was navigable for title purposes but instead whether it was navigable for purposes of determining whether boats upon it could be regulated by the Federal Government.  20 Wall., at 439, 445.  The primary focus in The Montello was not upon navigability in fact but upon whether the river was a \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable water of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 439, 443.  The latter inquiry is doctrinally distinct.  It turns upon whether the river \xe2\x80\x9cforms by itself, or by its connection with other waters, a continued highway over which commerce is, or may be, carried with other States or foreign countries in the customary modes in which such commerce is conducted by water.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 439 (citing The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557).  It is language similar to \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued highway\xe2\x80\x9d that Montana urges the Court to import into the title context in lieu of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s established segmentation approach.  Brief for Respondent 42\xe2\x80\x9343, n.\xc2\xa016.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Montello reasonably concluded that the portages required in that case did not prevent the river from being part of a channel of interstate commerce.  Portages continued that channel because goods could be successfully transported interstate, in part upon the waters in question.  This provided sufficient basis to regulate steamboats at places where those boats could and did, in fact, navigate portions of the river.  20 Wall., at 445.  Here, by contrast, the question regards ownership of the bed under river segments that the Montana Supreme Court, by calling them \xe2\x80\x9cinterruptions in the navigation,\xe2\x80\x9d 355 Mont., at 442, 229 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 449, acknowledges were nonnavigable.  The reasoning and the inquiry of The Montello does not control the outcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title context apply.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHaving clarified that portages may defeat navigability for title purposes, and do so with respect to the Great Falls reach, the Court sees no evidence in the record that could demonstrate that the Great Falls reach was navigable.  Montana does not dispute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach.  Indeed, the State admits \xe2\x80\x9cthe falls themselves were not passable by boat at statehood.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 10.  And the trial court noted the falls had never been navigated.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 137.  Based on these statements, this Court now con- cludes, contrary to the Montana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, that the 17-mile Great Falls reach, at least from the head of the first waterfall to the foot of the last, is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court also determines, based on evidence in the record, that there is a significant likelihood that some of the other river stretches in dispute also fail the federal test of navigability for the purpose of determining title.  For example, as to the disputed segment of the Clark Fork River, the Montana Supreme Court incorrectly stated the sole evidence for nonnavigability \xe2\x80\x9cconsists of conclusory statements .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. without any specific factual support.\xe2\x80\x9d  355 Mont., at 440, 229 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 448.  In fact, PPL introduced a report of the U.\xc2\xa0S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1891, two years after Montana\xe2\x80\x99s date of statehood, documenting that the portion of the Clark Fork river between Missoula and Lake Pend Oreille (which includes the location of PPL\xe2\x80\x99s Thompson Falls facility) had a fall of about 1,100 feet in 250 miles and \xe2\x80\x9cis a mountain torrential stream, full of rocks, rapids, and falls, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. utterly unnavigable, and in- capable of being made navigable except at an enormous cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 H.\xc2\xa0R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3250; see App. 379\xe2\x80\x93380 (Docket No.\xc2\xa0169).  The report based its conclusions on various failed attempts to navigate the river.  It found the Thompson Falls \xe2\x80\x9ca complete obstruction to navigation\xe2\x80\x9d and the river around that area \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly rapid, rough, and full of rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 H.\xc2\xa0R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3251.  This was consistent with a 1910 Federal District Court decree.  The decree adjudicated a title dispute between two private parties over the riverbed near and under Thompson Falls and declared the river at that place \xe2\x80\x9cwas and is a non-navigable stream incapable of carrying the products of the country in the usual manner of water transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Steele v. Donlan, Equity No.\xc2\xa0950 (CC D Mont., July 19, 1910), p.\xc2\xa01; see App. 380\xe2\x80\x93381 (Docket No.\xc2\xa0169).  While the ultimate decision as to this and the other disputed river stretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the Montana courts upon remand, the relevant evidence should be assessed in light of the principles discussed in this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter of law in its reliance upon the evidence of present-day, primarily recreational use of the Madison River.  Error is not inherent in a court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of such evidence, but the evidence must be confined to that which shows the river could sustain the kinds of commercial use that, as a realistic matter, might have occurred at the time of statehood.  Navigability must be assessed as of the time of statehood, and it concerns the river\xe2\x80\x99s usefulness for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98trade and travel,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rather than for other purposes.  See Utah, 283 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75\xe2\x80\x9376.  Mere use by initial explorers or trappers, who may have dragged their boats in or alongside the river despite its nonnavigability in order to avoid getting lost, or to provide water for their horses and themselves, is not itself enough.  See Oregon, 295 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (evidence that \xe2\x80\x9ctrappers appear to have waded or walked\xe2\x80\x9d through the river, dragging their boats rather than floating them, had \xe2\x80\x9cno bearing on navigability\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTrue, river segments are navigable not only if they \xe2\x80\x9c[were] used,\xe2\x80\x9d but also if they \xe2\x80\x9c[were] susceptible of being used,\xe2\x80\x9d as highways of commerce at the time of statehood.  Utah, supra, at 76 (internal quotation marks omitted). Evidence of recreational use, depending on its nature, may bear upon susceptibility of commercial use at the time of statehood.  See Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 416 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]ersonal or private use by boats demonstrates the availability of the stream for the simpler types of commercial navigation\xe2\x80\x9d); Utah, 283 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 82 (fact that actual use has \xe2\x80\x9cbeen more of a private nature than of a public, commercial sort .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cannot be regarded as controlling\xe2\x80\x9d).

At a minimum, therefore, the party seeking to use present-day evidence for title purposes must show: (1)\xc2\xa0the watercraft are meaningfully similar to those in customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood; and (2)\xc2\xa0the river\xe2\x80\x99s poststatehood condition is not materially different from its physical con- dition at statehood.  See also Oregon, supra, at 18 (find- ing that scientific and historical evidence showed that the physical condition of particular water bodies had not varied substantially since statehood in a way that might affect navigation).  If modern watercraft permit navigability where the historical watercraft would not, or if the river has changed in ways that substantially improve its navigability, then the evidence of present-day use has little or no bearing on navigability at statehood.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Montana Supreme Court opinion offered no indication that it made these necessary findings.

The affidavit of PPL\xe2\x80\x99s expert in fluvial geomorphology\xe2\x80\x94the study of river-related landforms\xe2\x80\x94at least suggests that as a result of PPL\xe2\x80\x99s dams, the river has become \xe2\x80\x9cless torrential\xe2\x80\x9d in high flow periods and less shallow in low flow periods.

Further, contrary to the Montana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, the expert\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit was not mere evidence of change in \xe2\x80\x9cseasonal variations\xe2\x80\x9d of water depth.  355 Mont., at 440, 229 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 448.  It provided meaningful evidence that the river\xe2\x80\x99s conditions had changed since statehood in ways that made present-day navigation of the river easier in all seasons than it was at the relevant time.  While the Montana court was correct that a river need not be susceptible of navigation at every point during the year, neither can that susceptibility be so brief that it is not a commercial reality.  Against this background, the present-day recreational use of the river did not bear on navigability for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine.  The Montana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance upon the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of present-day, recreational use, at least without further inquiry, was wrong as a matter of law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe above analysis is sufficient to require reversal of the grant of summary judgment to Montana.  Therefore, the Court declines to decide whether the Montana Supreme Court further erred as to the burden of proof regarding navigability.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs a final contention, the State of Montana suggests that denying the State title to the riverbeds here in dispute will undermine the public trust doctrine, which concerns public access to the waters above those beds for purposes of navigation, fishing, and other recreational uses.  Brief for Respondent 20, 24\xe2\x80\x9326.  This suggestion underscores the State\xe2\x80\x99s misapprehension of the equal footing and public trust doctrines.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe public trust doctrine is of ancient origin.  Its roots trace to Roman civil law and its principles can be found in the English common law on public navigation and fishing rights over tidal lands and in the state laws of this country.  See Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 284\xe2\x80\x93286; Illinois Central R.\xc2\xa0Co. v. Illinois, \n\n146 U.\xc2\xa0S. 387, \n458 (1892)\n; D. Slade, Putting the Public Trust Doctrine to Work 3\xe2\x80\x938, 15\xe2\x80\x9324 (1990); see, e.g., National Audubon Soc. v. Superior Court of Alpine Cty., 33 Cal. 3d 419, 433\xe2\x80\x93441, 658 P.\xc2\xa02d 709, 718\xe2\x80\x93724 (1983); Arnold v. Mundy, 6 N. J. L. 1, 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (1821).  Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, however, which is the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of riverbed title, the public trust doctrine remains a matter of state law, see Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene, supra, at 285 (Illinois Central, a Supreme Court public trust case, was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98necessarily a statement of Illinois law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); Appleby v. City of New York, \n\n271 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364, \n395 (1926)\n (same), subject as well to the federal power to regulate vessels and navigation under the Commerce Clause and admiralty power.  While equal-footing cases have noted that the State takes title to the navigable waters and their beds in trust for the public, see Shively, 152 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 49, 15\xe2\x80\x9317, 24, 46, the contours of that public trust do not depend upon the Constitution.  Under accepted principles of federalism, the States retain residual power to determine the scope of the public trust over waters within their borders, while federal law determines riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the litigation history of this case shows, Montana filed its claim for riverbed rent over a century after the first of the dams was built upon the riverbeds.  Montana had not sought compensation before then, despite its full awareness of PPL\xe2\x80\x99s hydroelectric projects and despite the State\xe2\x80\x99s own participation in the projects\xe2\x80\x99 federal licensing process.  While this Court does not reach the question, it may be that by virtue of the State\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty, neither laches nor estoppel could apply in a strict sense to bar the State\xe2\x80\x99s much belated claim.  Still, the reliance by PPL and its predecessors in title upon the State\xe2\x80\x99s long failure to assert title is some evidence to support the conclusion that the river segments were nonnavigable for purposes of the equal-footing doctrine.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Montana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that Montana owns and may charge for use of riverbeds across the State was based upon an infirm legal understanding of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s rules of navigability for title under the equal-footing doctrine.  As the Court said in Brewer-Elliott, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for a State by courts or legislature, in dealing with the general subject of beds or streams, to adopt a retroactive rule for determining navigability which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would enlarge what actually passed to the State, at the time of her admission, under the constitutional rule of equality here invoked.\xe2\x80\x9d  260 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 88.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe judgment of the Montana Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
