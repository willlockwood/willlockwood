Petitioners brought this state-court action claiming, <em>inter alia,</em> that the taking of their properties would violate the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d restriction in the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Takings Clause.  The trial court granted a permanent restraining order prohibiting the taking of the some of the properties, but denying relief as to others.  Relying on cases such as <em>Hawaii Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Midkiff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/229/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/229/index.html">467 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Though the city could not take petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 land simply to confer a private benefit on a particular private party, see, <em>e.g., Midkiff,</em> 467 U. S., at 245, the takings at issue here would be executed pursuant to a carefully considered development plan, which was not adopted \xe2\x80\x9cto benefit a particular class of identifiable individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>Moreover, while the city is not planning to open the condemned land\xe2\x80\x94at least not in its entirety\xe2\x80\x94to use by the general public, this \xe2\x80\x9cCourt long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the \xe2\x80\xa6 public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 244.  Rather, it has embraced the broader and more natural interpretation of public use as \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Fallbrook Irrigation Dist</em>. v. <em>Bradley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/164/112/index.html">164 U. S. 112</a>, 158\xe2\x80\x93164.  Without exception, the Court has defined that concept broadly, reflecting its longstanding policy of deference to legislative judgments as to what public needs justify the use of the takings power.  <em>Berman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/26/index.html"></a><a href="/us/348/26/index.html">348 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The city\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the area at issue was sufficiently distressed to justify a program of economic rejuvenation is entitled to deference.  The city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue.  As with other exercises in urban planning and development, the city is trying to coordinate a variety of commercial, residential, and recreational land uses, with the hope that they will form a whole greater than the sum of its parts.  To effectuate this plan, the city has invoked a state statute that specifically authorizes the use of eminent domain to promote economic development.  Given the plan\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive character, the thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and the limited scope of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review in such cases, it is appropriate here, as it was in <em>Berman</em>, to resolve the challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal basis, but rather in light of the entire plan.  Because that plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the Fifth Amendment.  P.\xc2\xa013.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 proposal that the Court adopt a new bright-line rule that economic development does not qualify as a public use is supported by neither precedent nor logic.  Promoting economic development is a traditional and long accepted governmental function, and there is no principled way of distinguishing it from the other public purposes the Court has recognized.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Berman, </em>348 U. S., at 24.  Also rejected is petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that for takings of this kind the Court should require a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable certainty\xe2\x80\x9d that the expected public benefits will actually accrue.  Such a rule would represent an even greater departure from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Midkiff</em>, 467 U. S., at 242.  The disadvantages of a heightened form of review are especially pronounced in this type of case, where orderly implementation of a comprehensive plan requires all interested parties\xe2\x80\x99 legal rights to be established before new construction can commence.  The Court declines to second-guess the wisdom of the means the city has selected to effectuate its plan.  <em>Berman</em>, 348 U. S., at 26.

In assembling the land needed for this project, the city\xe2\x80\x99s development agent has purchased property from willing sellers and proposes to use the power of eminent domain to acquire the remainder of the property from unwilling owners in exchange for just compensation.  The question presented is whether the city\xe2\x80\x99s proposed disposition of this property qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The city of New London (hereinafter City) sits at the junction of the Thames River and the Long Island Sound in southeastern Connecticut.  Decades of economic decline led a state agency in 1990 to designate the City a \xe2\x80\x9cdistressed municipality.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 1996, the Federal Government closed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which had been located in the Fort Trumbull area of the City and had employed over 1,500 people.  In 1998, the City\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment rate was nearly double that of the State, and its population of just under 24,000 residents was at its lowest since 1920.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These conditions prompted state and local officials to target New London, and particularly its Fort Trumbull area, for economic revitalization.  To this end, respondent New London Development Corporation (NLDC), a private nonprofit entity established some years earlier to assist the City in planning economic development, was reactivated.  In January 1998, the State authorized a $5.35 million bond issue to support the NLDC\xe2\x80\x99s planning activities and a $10 million bond issue toward the creation of a Fort Trumbull State Park.  In February, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. announced that it would build a $300 million research facility on a site immediately adjacent to Fort Trumbull; local planners hoped that Pfizer would draw new business to the area, thereby serving as a catalyst to the area\xe2\x80\x99s rejuvenation.  After receiving initial approval from the city council, the NLDC continued its planning activities and held a series of neighborhood meetings to educate the public about the process.  In May, the city council authorized the NLDC to formally submit its plans to the relevant state agencies for review.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Upon obtaining state-level approval, the NLDC finalized an integrated development plan focused on 90 acres of the Fort Trumbull area.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fort Trumbull area is situated on a peninsula that juts into the Thames River.  The area comprises approximately 115 privately owned properties, as well as the 32 acres of land formerly occupied by the naval facility (Trumbull State Park now occupies 18 of those 32 acres). The development plan encompasses seven parcels.  Parcel 1 is designated for a waterfront conference hotel at the center of a \xe2\x80\x9csmall urban village\xe2\x80\x9d that will include restaurants and shopping.  This parcel will also have marinas for both recreational and commercial uses.  A pedestrian \xe2\x80\x9criverwalk\xe2\x80\x9d will originate here and continue down the coast, connecting the waterfront areas of the development.  Parcel 2 will be the site of approximately 80 new residences organized into an urban neighborhood and linked by public walkway to the remainder of the development, including the state park.  This parcel also includes space reserved for a new U. S. Coast Guard Museum.  Parcel 3, which is located immediately north of the Pfizer facility, will contain at least 90,000 square feet of research and development office space.  Parcel 4A is a 2.4-acre site that will be used either to support the adjacent state park, by providing parking or retail services for visitors, or to support the nearby marina.  Parcel 4B will include a renovated marina, as well as the final stretch of the riverwalk.  Parcels 5, 6, and 7 will provide land for office and retail space, parking, and water-dependent commercial uses.  1 App. 109\xe2\x80\x93113.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The NLDC intended the development plan to capitalize on the arrival of the Pfizer facility and the new commerce it was expected to attract.  In addition to creating jobs, generating tax revenue, and helping to \xe2\x80\x9cbuild momentum for the revitalization of downtown New London,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 92, the plan was also designed to make the City more attractive and to create leisure and recreational opportunities on the waterfront and in the park.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The city council approved the plan in January 2000, and designated the NLDC as its development agent in charge of implementation.  See Conn. Gen. Stat. \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93188 (2005).  The city council also authorized the NLDC to purchase property or to acquire property by exercising eminent domain in the City\xe2\x80\x99s name.  \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93193.  The NLDC successfully negotiated the purchase of most of the real estate in the 90-acre area, but its negotiations with petitioners failed.  As a consequence, in November 2000, the NLDC initiated the condemnation proceedings that gave rise to this case.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Susette Kelo has lived in the Fort Trumbull area since 1997.  She has made extensive improvements to her house, which she prizes for its water view.  Petitioner Wilhelmina Dery was born in her Fort Trumbull house in 1918 and has lived there her entire life.  Her husband Charles (also a petitioner) has lived in the house since they married some 60 years ago.  In all, the nine petitioners own 15 properties in Fort Trumbull\xe2\x80\x944 in parcel 3 of the development plan and 11 in parcel 4A.  Ten of the parcels are occupied by the owner or a family member; the other five are held as investment properties.  There is no allegation that any of these properties is blighted or otherwise in poor condition; rather, they were condemned only because they happen to be located in the development area.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 2000, petitioners brought this action in the New London Superior Court.  They claimed, among other things, that the taking of their properties would violate the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d restriction in the Fifth Amendment.  After a 7-day bench trial, the Superior Court granted a permanent restraining order prohibiting the taking of the properties located in parcel 4A (park or marina support).  It, however, denied petitioners relief as to the properties located in parcel 3 (office space).  2 App. to Pet. for Cert. 343\xe2\x80\x93350.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the Superior Court ruled, both sides took appeals to the Supreme Court of Connecticut.  That court held, over a dissent, that all of the City\xe2\x80\x99s proposed takings were valid.  It began by upholding the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the takings were authorized by chapter 132, the State\xe2\x80\x99s municipal development statute.  See Conn. Gen. Stat. \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93186 <em>et seq</em>. (2005).  That statute expresses a legislative determination that the taking of land, even developed land, as part of an economic development project is a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d and in the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  268 Conn., at 18\xe2\x80\x9328, 843 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 515\xe2\x80\x93521.  Next, relying on cases such as <em>Hawaii Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Midkiff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/229/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/229/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/229/index.html">467 U. S. 229</a> (1984), and <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Parker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/26/index.html"></a><a href="/us/348/26/index.html"></a><a href="/us/348/26/index.html">348 U. S. 26</a> (1954), the court held that such economic development qualified as a valid public use under both the Federal and State Constitutions.  268 Conn., at 40, 843 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 527.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, adhering to its precedents, the court went on to determine, first, whether the takings of the particular properties at issue were \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to achieving the City\xe2\x80\x99s intended public use, <em>id.</em>, at 82, 843 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 552\xe2\x80\x93553, and, second, whether the takings were for \xe2\x80\x9creasonably foreseeable needs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 93, 843 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 558\xe2\x80\x93559.  The court upheld the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings as to parcel 3, but reversed the trial court as to parcel 4A, agreeing with the City that the intended use of this land was sufficiently definite and had been given \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attention\xe2\x80\x9d during the planning process.  <em>Id.</em>, at 120\xe2\x80\x93121, 843 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 574.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three dissenting justices would have imposed a \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d standard of judicial review for takings justified by economic development.  Although they agreed that the plan was intended to serve a valid public use, they would have found all the takings unconstitutional because the City had failed to adduce \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that the economic benefits of the plan would in fact come to pass.  <em>Id.</em>, at 144, 146, 843 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 587, 588 (Zarella, J., joined by Sullivan, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Katz, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to determine whether a city\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take property for the purpose of economic development satisfies the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d requirement of the Fifth Amendment.  542 U. S. ___ (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two polar propositions are perfectly clear.  On the one hand, it has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the property of <em>A</em> for the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party <em>B</em>, even though <em>A </em>is paid just compensation.  On the other hand, it is equally clear that a State may transfer property from one private party to another if future \xe2\x80\x9cuse by the public\xe2\x80\x9d is the purpose of the taking; the condemnation of land for a railroad with common-carrier duties is a familiar example.  Neither of these propositions, however, determines the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the first proposition, the City would no doubt be forbidden from taking petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 land for the purpose of conferring a private benefit on a particular private party.  See <em>Midkiff,</em> 467 U. S., at 245 (\xe2\x80\x9cA purely private taking could not withstand the scrutiny of the public use requirement; it would serve no legitimate purpose of government and would thus be void\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em> v. <em>Nebraska,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/164/403/index.html">164 U. S. 403</a> (1896).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Nor would the City be allowed to take property under the mere pretext of a public purpose, when its actual purpose was to bestow a private benefit.  The takings before us, however, would be executed pursuant to a \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully considered\xe2\x80\x9d development plan.  268 Conn., at 54, 843 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 536.  The trial judge and all the members of the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed that there was no evidence of an illegitimate purpose in this case.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Therefore, as was true of the statute challenged in <em>Midkiff,</em> 467 U. S., at 245, the City\xe2\x80\x99s development plan was not adopted \xe2\x80\x9cto benefit a particular class of identifiable individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, this is not a case in which the City is planning to open the condemned land\xe2\x80\x94at least not in its entirety\xe2\x80\x94to use by the general public.  Nor will the private lessees of the land in any sense be required to operate like common carriers, making their services available to all comers.  But although such a projected use would be sufficient to satisfy the public use requirement, this \xe2\x80\x9cCourt long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the general public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 244.  Indeed, while many state courts in the mid-19th century endorsed \xe2\x80\x9cuse by the public\xe2\x80\x9d as the proper definition of public use, that narrow view steadily eroded over time.  Not only was the \xe2\x80\x9cuse by the public\xe2\x80\x9d test difficult to administer (<em>e.g.</em>, what proportion of the public need have access to the property? at what price?),[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] but it proved to be impractical given the diverse and always evolving needs of society.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Accordingly, when this Court began applying the Fifth Amendment to the States at the close of the 19th century, it embraced the broader and more natural interpretation of public use as \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Fallbrook Irrigation Dist</em>. v. <em>Bradley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/164/112/index.html">164 U. S. 112</a>, 158\xe2\x80\x93164 (1896).  Thus, in a case upholding a mining company\xe2\x80\x99s use of an aerial bucket line to transport ore over property it did not own, Justice Holmes\xe2\x80\x99 opinion for the Court stressed \xe2\x80\x9cthe inadequacy of use by the general public as a universal test.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickley</em> v. <em>Highland Boy Gold Mining Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/200/527/index.html"></a><a href="/us/200/527/index.html"></a><a href="/us/200/527/index.html"></a><a href="/us/200/527/index.html">200 U. S. 527</a>, 531 (1906).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  We have repeatedly and consistently rejected that narrow test ever since.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The disposition of this case therefore turns on the question whether the City\xe2\x80\x99s development plan serves a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Without exception, our cases have defined that concept broadly, reflecting our longstanding policy of deference to legislative judgments in this field.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Berman</em> v. <em>Parker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/26/index.html"></a><a href="/us/348/26/index.html"></a><a href="/us/348/26/index.html">348 U.

Our earliest cases in particular embodied a strong theme of federalism, emphasizing the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat respect\xe2\x80\x9d that we owe to state legislatures and state courts in discerning local public needs.  See <em>Hairston </em>v. <em>Danville &amp; Western R.</em> <em>Co</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/208/598/index.html">208 U.

The City has carefully formulated an economic development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including\xe2\x80\x94but by no means limited to\xe2\x80\x94new jobs and increased tax revenue.  As with other exercises in urban planning and development,[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] the City is endeavoring to coordinate a variety of commercial, residential, and recreational uses of land, with the hope that they will form a whole greater than the sum of its parts.  To effectuate this plan, the City has invoked a state statute that specifically authorizes the use of eminent domain to promote economic development.  Given the comprehensive character of the plan, the thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and the limited scope of our review, it is appropriate for us, as it was in <em>Berman</em>, to resolve the challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal basis, but rather in light of the entire plan.  Because that plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To avoid this result, petitioners urge us to adopt a new bright-line rule that economic development does not qualify as a public use.  Putting aside the unpersuasive suggestion that the City\xe2\x80\x99s plan will provide only purely economic benefits, neither precedent nor logic supports petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 proposal.  Promoting economic development is a traditional and long accepted function of government.  There is, moreover, no principled way of distinguishing economic development from the other public purposes that we have recognized.  In our cases upholding takings that facilitated agriculture and mining, for example, we emphasized the importance of those industries to the welfare of the States in question, see, <em>e.g., Strickley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/200/527/index.html"></a><a href="/us/200/527/index.html"></a><a href="/us/200/527/index.html"></a><a href="/us/200/527/index.html">200 U. S. 527</a>; in <em>Berman, </em>we endorsed the purpose of transforming a blighted area into a \xe2\x80\x9cwell-balanced\xe2\x80\x9d community through redevelopment, 348 U. S., at 33;[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] in <em>Midkiff</em>, we upheld the interest in breaking up a land oligopoly that \xe2\x80\x9ccreated artificial deterrents to the normal functioning of the State\xe2\x80\x99s residential land market,\xe2\x80\x9d 467 U.

S., at 1014\xe2\x80\x931015.  It would be incongruous to hold that the City\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the economic benefits to be derived from the development of the Fort Trumbull area has less of a public character than any of those other interests. Clearly, there is no basis for exempting economic development from our traditionally broad understanding of public purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners contend that using eminent domain for economic development impermissibly blurs the boundary between public and private takings.  Again, our cases foreclose this objection.  Quite simply, the government\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of a public purpose will often benefit individual private parties.  For example, in <em>Midkiff</em>, the forced transfer of property conferred a direct and significant benefit on those lessees who were previously unable to purchase their homes.  In <em>Monsanto</em>, we recognized that the \xe2\x80\x9cmost direct beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x9d of the data-sharing provisions were the subsequent pesticide applicants, but benefiting them in this way was necessary to promoting competition in the pesticide market.  467 U. S., at 1014.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The owner of the department store in <em>Berman </em>objected to \xe2\x80\x9ctaking from one businessman for the benefit of another businessman,\xe2\x80\x9d 348 U. S., at 33, referring to the fact that under the redevelopment plan land would be leased or sold to private developers for redevelopment.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Our rejection of that contention has particular relevance to the instant case: \xe2\x80\x9cThe public end may be as well or better served through an agency of private enterprise than through a department of government\xe2\x80\x94or so the Congress might conclude.  We cannot say that public ownership is the sole method of promoting the public purposes of community redevelopment projects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 34.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is further argued that without a bright-line rule nothing would stop a city from transferring citizen <em>A</em>\xe2\x80\x99s property to citizen <em>B </em>for the sole reason that citizen <em>B </em>will put the property to a more productive use and thus pay more taxes.  Such a one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this case.  While such an unusual exercise of government power would certainly raise a suspicion that a private purpose was afoot,[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] the hypothetical cases posited by petitioners can be confronted if and when they arise.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  They do not warrant the crafting of an artificial restriction on the concept of public use.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alternatively, petitioners maintain that for takings of this kind we should require a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable certainty\xe2\x80\x9d that the expected public benefits will actually accrue.  Such a rule, however, would represent an even greater departure from our precedent.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is legitimate and its means are not irrational, our cases make clear that empirical debates over the wisdom of takings\xe2\x80\x94no less than debates over the wisdom of other kinds of socioeconomic legislation\xe2\x80\x94are not to be carried out in the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Midkiff,</em> 467 U. S., at 242.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Indeed, earlier this Term we explained why similar practical concerns (among others) undermined the use of the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula in our regulatory takings doctrine.  See <em>Lingle </em>v.<em> Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em>, 544 U.

The disadvantages of a heightened form of review are especially pronounced in this type of case.  Orderly implementation of a comprehensive redevelopment plan obviously requires that the legal rights of all interested parties be established before new construction can be commenced.  A constitutional rule that required postponement of the judicial approval of every condemnation until the likelihood of success of the plan had been assured would unquestionably impose a significant impediment to the successful consummation of many such plans.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just as we decline to second-guess the City\xe2\x80\x99s considered judgments about the efficacy of its development plan, we also decline to second-guess the City\xe2\x80\x99s determinations as to what lands it needs to acquire in order to effectuate the project.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for the courts to oversee the choice of the boundary line nor to sit in review on the size of a particular project area.  Once the question of the public purpose has been decided, the amount and character of land to be taken for the project and the need for a particular tract to complete the integrated plan rests in the discretion of the legislative branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Berman</em>, 348 U.

Indeed, many States already impose \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d requirements that are stricter than the federal baseline.  Some of these requirements have been established as a matter of state constitutional law,[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] while others are expressed in state eminent domain statutes that carefully limit the grounds upon which takings may be exercised.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  As the submissions of the parties and their <em>amici </em>make clear, the necessity and wisdom of using eminent domain to promote economic development are certainly matters of legitimate public debate.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority, however, extends only to determining whether the City\xe2\x80\x99s proposed condemnations are for a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

S. Const., Amdt. 5., as long as it is \xe2\x80\x9crationally related to a conceivable public purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hawaii Housing Authority</em> v. <em>Midkiff,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/229/index.html">467 U. S. 229</a>, 241 (1984); see also <em>Berman</em> v. <em>Parker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/26/index.html">348 U. S. 26</a> (1954).  This deferential standard of review echoes the rational-basis test used to review economic regulation under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>FCC</em> v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/307/index.html">508 U. S. 307</a>, 313\xe2\x80\x93314 (1993);<em> Williamson</em> v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/483/index.html">348 U. S. 483</a> (1955).  The determination that a rational-basis standard of review is appropriate does not, however, alter the fact that transfers intended to confer benefits on particular, favored private entities, and with only incidental or pretextual public benefits, are forbidden by the Public Use Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A court applying rational-basis review under the Public Use Clause should strike down a taking that, by a clear showing, is intended to favor a particular private party, with only incidental or pretextual public benefits, just as a court applying rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause must strike down a government classification that is clearly intended to injure a particular class of private parties, with only incidental or pretextual public justifications.  See <em>Cleburne</em> v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/432/index.html">473 U.

As the trial court in this case was correct to observe, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the purpose [of a taking] is economic development and that development is to be carried out by private parties or private parties will be benefited, the court must decide if the stated public purpose\xe2\x80\x94economic advantage to a city sorely in need of it\xe2\x80\x94is only incidental to the benefits that will be confined on private parties of a development plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 App. to Pet. for Cert. 263.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A court confronted with a plausible accusation of impermissible favoritism to private parties should treat the objection as a serious one and review the record to see if it has merit, though with the presumption that the government\xe2\x80\x99s actions were reasonable and intended to serve a public purpose.  Here, the trial court conducted a careful and extensive inquiry into \xe2\x80\x9cwhether, in fact, the development plan is of primary benefit to \xe2\x80\xa6 the developer [<em>i.e.</em>, Corcoran Jennison], and private businesses which may eventually locate in the plan area [<em>e.g.</em>, Pfizer], and in that regard, only of incidental benefit to the city.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 App. to Pet. for Cert. 261.  The trial court considered testimony from government officials and corporate officers; <em>id</em>., at 266\xe2\x80\x93271; documentary evidence of communications between these parties, <em>ibid</em>.; respondents\xe2\x80\x99 awareness of New London\xe2\x80\x99s depressed economic condition and evidence corroborating the validity of this concern, <em>id</em>., at 272\xe2\x80\x93273, 278\xe2\x80\x93279; the substantial commitment of public funds by the State to the development project before most of the private beneficiaries were known, <em>id</em>., at 276; evidence that respondents reviewed a variety of development plans and chose a private developer from a group of applicants rather than picking out a particular transferee beforehand, <em>id</em>., at 273, 278; and the fact that the other private beneficiaries of the project are still unknown because the office space proposed to be built has not yet been rented, <em>id</em>., at 278.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court concluded, based on these findings, that benefiting Pfizer was not \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary motivation or effect of this development plan\xe2\x80\x9d; instead, \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary motivation for [respondents] was to take advantage of Pfizer\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 276.  Likewise, the trial court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is nothing in the record to indicate that \xe2\x80\xa6 [respondents] were motivated by a desire to aid [other] particular private entities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 278.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Even the dissenting justices on the Connecticut Supreme Court agreed that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 development plan was intended to revitalize the local economy, not to serve the interests of Pfizer, Corcoran Jennison, or any other private party.  268 Conn. 1, 159, 843 A.\xc2\xa02d 500, 595 (2004) (Zarella, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  This case, then, survives the meaningful rational basis review that in my view is required under the Public Use Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners and their <em>amici</em> argue that any taking justified by the promotion of economic development must be treated by the courts as <em>per se</em> invalid, or at least presumptively invalid.  Petitioners overstate the need for such a rule, however, by making the incorrect assumption that review under <em>Berman</em> and <em>Midkiff</em> imposes no meaningful judicial limits on the government\xe2\x80\x99s power to condemn any property it likes.  A broad <em>per se</em> rule or a strong presumption of invalidity, furthermore, would prohibit a large number of government takings that have the purpose and expected effect of conferring substantial benefits on the public at large and so do not offend the Public Use Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My agreement with the Court that a presumption of invalidity is not warranted for economic development takings in general, or for the particular takings at issue in this case, does not foreclose the possibility that a more stringent standard of review than that announced in <em>Berman</em> and <em>Midkiff</em> might be appropriate for a more narrowly drawn category of takings.  There may be private transfers in which the risk of undetected impermissible favoritism of private parties is so acute that a presumption (rebuttable or otherwise) of invalidity is warranted under the Public Use Clause.  Cf. <em>Eastern Enterprises</em> v. <em>Apfel, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/524/498/index.html">524 U. S. 498</a>, 549\xe2\x80\x93550 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part) (heightened scrutiny for retroactive legislation under the Due Process Clause).  This demanding level of scrutiny, however, is not required simply because the purpose of the taking is economic development.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not the occasion for conjecture as to what sort of cases might justify a more demanding standard, but it is appropriate to underscore aspects of the instant case that convince me no departure from <em>Berman</em> and <em>Midkiff</em> is appropriate here.  This taking occurred in the context of a comprehensive development plan meant to address a serious city-wide depression, and the projected economic benefits of the project cannot be characterized as <em>de minimus</em>.  The identity of most of the private beneficiaries were unknown at the time the city formulated its plans.  The city complied with elaborate procedural requirements that facilitate review of the record and inquiry into the city\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.  In sum, while there may be categories of cases in which the transfers are so suspicious, or the procedures employed so prone to abuse, or the purported benefits are so trivial or implausible, that courts should presume an impermissible private purpose, no such circumstances are present in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, I join in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961892">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nO\'CONNOR, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nKELO V.

To reason, as the Court does, that the incidental public benefits resulting from the subsequent ordinary use of private property render economic development takings \xe2\x80\x9cfor public use\xe2\x80\x9d is to wash out any distinction between private and public use of property\xe2\x80\x94and thereby effectively to delete the words \xe2\x80\x9cfor public use\xe2\x80\x9d from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

She was born in the house in 1918; her husband, petitioner Charles Dery, moved into the house when they married in 1946.

Two months later, New London\xe2\x80\x99s city council gave initial approval for the New London Development Corporation (NLDC) to prepare the development plan at issue here.  The NLDC is a private, nonprofit corporation whose mission is to assist the city council in economic development planning.  It is not elected by popular vote, and its directors and employees are privately appointed.  Consistent with its mandate, the NLDC generated an ambitious plan for redeveloping 90 acres of Fort Trumbull in order to \xe2\x80\x9ccomplement the facility that Pfizer was planning to build, create jobs, increase tax and other revenues, encourage public access to and use of the city\xe2\x80\x99s waterfront, and eventually \xe2\x80\x98build momentum\xe2\x80\x99 for the revitalization of the rest of the city.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 5.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners own properties in two of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s seven parcels\xe2\x80\x94Parcel 3 and Parcel 4A.

Petitioners maintain that the Fifth Amendment prohibits the NLDC from condemning their properties for the sake of an economic development plan.  Petitioners are not hold-outs; they do not seek increased compensation, and none is opposed to new development in the area.  Theirs is an objection in principle: They claim that the NLDC\xe2\x80\x99s proposed use for their confiscated property is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d one for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.  While the government may take their homes to build a road or a railroad or to eliminate a property use that harms the public, say petitioners, it cannot take their property for the private use of other owners simply because the new owners may make more productive use of the property.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \xe2\x80\x9cprivate property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  When interpreting the Constitution, we begin with the unremarkable presumption that every word in the document has independent meaning, \xe2\x80\x9cthat no word was unnecessarily used, or needlessly added.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wright</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/302/583/index.html">302 U.

The public use requirement, in turn, imposes a more basic limitation, circumscribing the very scope of the eminent domain power: Government may compel an individual to forfeit her property for the <em>public\xe2\x80\x99s </em>use, but not for the benefit of another private person.  This requirement promotes fairness as well as security.

We give considerable deference to legislatures\xe2\x80\x99 determinations about what governmental activities will advantage the public.  But were the political branches the sole arbiters of the public-private distinction, the Public Use Clause would amount to little more than hortatory fluff.  An external, judicial check on how the public use requirement is interpreted, however limited, is necessary if this constraint on government power is to retain any meaning.  See <em>Cincinnati</em> v. <em>Vester</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/281/439/index.html">281 U. S. 439</a>, 446 (1930) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well established that \xe2\x80\xa6 the question [of] what is a public use is a judicial one\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases have generally identified three categories of takings that comply with the public use requirement, though it is in the nature of things that the boundaries between these categories are not always firm.  Two are relatively straightforward and uncontroversial.  First, the sovereign may transfer private property to public ownership\xe2\x80\x94such as for a road, a hospital, or a military base.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Old Dominion Land Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/269/55/index.html">269 U. S. 55</a> (1925); <em>Rindge Co.</em> v. <em>County of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/700/index.html">262 U. S. 700</a> (1923).  Second, the sovereign may transfer private property to private parties, often common carriers, who make the property available for the public\xe2\x80\x99s use\xe2\x80\x94such as with a railroad, a public utility, or a stadium.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</em> v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/407/index.html">503 U. S. 407</a> (1992); <em>Mt. Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Co.</em> v. <em>Alabama Interstate Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/240/30/index.html">240 U. S. 30</a> (1916).  But \xe2\x80\x9cpublic ownership\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cuse-by-the-public\xe2\x80\x9d are sometimes too constricting and impractical ways to define the scope of the Public Use Clause.  Thus we have allowed that, in certain circumstances and to meet certain exigencies, takings that serve a public purpose also satisfy the Constitution even if the property is destined for subsequent private use.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Berman</em> v. <em>Parker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/26/index.html">348 U. S. 26</a> (1954); <em>Hawaii Housing Authority</em> v. <em>Midkiff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/229/index.html">467 U. S. 229</a> (1984).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case returns us for the first time in over 20 years to the hard question of when a purportedly \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d taking meets the public use requirement.  It presents an issue of first impression: Are economic development takings constitutional?  I would hold that they are not.  We are guided by two precedents about the taking of real property by eminent domain.  In <em>Berman</em>, we upheld takings within a blighted neighborhood of Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.  The neighborhood had so deteriorated that, for example, 64.3% of its dwellings were beyond repair.  348 U. S., at 30.  It had become burdened with \xe2\x80\x9covercrowding of dwellings,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clack of adequate streets and alleys,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clack of light and air.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 34.  Congress had determined that the neighborhood had become \xe2\x80\x9cinjurious to the public health, safety, morals, and welfare\xe2\x80\x9d and that it was necessary to \xe2\x80\x9celiminat[e] all such injurious conditions by employing all means necessary and appropriate for the purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d including eminent domain.  <em>Id</em>., at 28.  Mr. Berman\xe2\x80\x99s department store was not itself blighted.  Having approved of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to eliminate the harm to the public emanating from the blighted neighborhood, however, we did not second-guess its decision to treat the neighborhood as a whole rather than lot-by-lot.  <em>Id</em>., at\n34\xe2\x80\x9335; see also <em>Midkiff</em>, 467 U. S., at 244 (\xe2\x80\x9cit is only the taking\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, and not its mechanics, that must pass scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d).</f></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Midkiff</em>, we upheld a land condemnation scheme in Hawaii whereby title in real property was taken from lessors and transferred to lessees.  At that time, the State and Federal Governments owned nearly 49% of the State\xe2\x80\x99s land, and another 47% was in the hands of only 72 private landowners.  Concentration of land ownership was so dramatic that on the State\xe2\x80\x99s most urbanized island, Oahu, 22 landowners owned 72.5% of the fee simple titles.  <em>Id.</em>, at 232.  The Hawaii Legislature had concluded that the oligopoly in land ownership was \xe2\x80\x9cskewing the State\xe2\x80\x99s residential fee simple market, inflating land prices, and injuring the public tranquility and welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore enacted a condemnation scheme for redistributing title.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In those decisions, we emphasized the importance of deferring to legislative judgments about public purpose.  Because courts are ill-equipped to evaluate the efficacy of proposed legislative initiatives, we rejected as unworkable the idea of courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deciding on what is and is not a governmental function and \xe2\x80\xa6 invalidating legislation on the basis of their view on that question at the moment of decision, a practice which has proved impracticable in other fields.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 240\xe2\x80\x93241 (quoting <em>United States ex rel.

S. 546</a>, 552 (1946)); see <em>Berman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 32 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he legislature, not the judiciary, is the main guardian of the public needs to be served by social legislation\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Lingle</em> v. <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A., Inc.</em>, 544 U. S. __ (2005).  Likewise, we recognized our inability to evaluate whether, in a given case, eminent domain is a necessary means by which to pursue the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s ends.  <em>Midkiff</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 242; <em>Berman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 103.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet for all the emphasis on deference, <em>Berman</em> and <em>Midkiff</em> hewed to a bedrock principle without which our public use jurisprudence would collapse: \xe2\x80\x9cA purely private taking could not withstand the scrutiny of the public use requirement; it would serve no legitimate purpose of government and would thus be void.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Midkiff</em>, 467 U. S., at 245; <em>id</em>., at 241 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have repeatedly stated that \xe2\x80\x98one person\xe2\x80\x99s property may not be taken for the benefit of another private person without a justifying public purpose, even though compensation be paid\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>Consolidated Gas Util. Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/300/55/index.html">300 U. S. 55</a>, 80 (1937))); see also <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em> v. <em>Nebraska</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/164/403/index.html">164 U. S. 403</a>, 417 (1896).  To protect that principle, those decisions reserved \xe2\x80\x9ca role for courts to play in reviewing a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of what constitutes a public use \xe2\x80\xa6 [though] the Court in <em>Berman</em> made clear that it is \xe2\x80\x98an extremely narrow\xe2\x80\x99 one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Midkiff</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 240 (quoting <em>Berman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 32).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings in <em>Berman</em> and <em>Midkiff</em> were true to the principle underlying the Public Use Clause.  In both those cases, the extraordinary, precondemnation use of the targeted property inflicted affirmative harm on society\xe2\x80\x94in <em>Berman</em> through blight resulting from extreme poverty and in <em>Midkiff</em> through oligopoly resulting from extreme wealth.  And in both cases, the relevant legislative body had found that eliminating the existing property use was necessary to remedy the harm.  <em>Berman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329; <em>Midkiff</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 232.  Thus a public purpose was realized when the harmful use was eliminated.  Because each taking <em>directly </em>achieved a public benefit, it did not matter that the property was turned over to private use.  Here, in contrast, New London does not claim that Susette Kelo\xe2\x80\x99s and Wilhelmina Dery\xe2\x80\x99s well-maintained homes are the source of any social harm.  Indeed, it could not so claim without adopting the absurd argument that any single-family home that might be razed to make way for an apartment building, or any church that might be replaced with a retail store, or any small business that might be more lucrative if it were instead part of a national franchise, is inherently harmful to society and thus within the government\xe2\x80\x99s power to condemn.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In moving away from our decisions sanctioning the condemnation of harmful property use, the Court today significantly expands the meaning of public use.  It holds that the sovereign may take private property currently put to ordinary private use, and give it over for new, ordinary private use, so long as the new use is predicted to generate some secondary benefit for the public\xe2\x80\x94such as increased tax revenue, more jobs, maybe even aesthetic pleasure.  But nearly any lawful use of real private property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to the public.  Thus, if predicted (or even guaranteed) positive side-effects are enough to render transfer from one private party to another constitutional, then the words \xe2\x80\x9cfor public use\xe2\x80\x9d do not realistically exclude <em>any</em> takings, and thus do not exert any constraint on the eminent domain power.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a sense in which this troubling result follows from errant language in <em>Berman</em> and <em>Midkiff</em>.  In discussing whether takings within a blighted neighborhood were for a public use, <em>Berman</em> began by observing: \xe2\x80\x9cWe deal, in other words, with what traditionally has been known as the police power.\xe2\x80\x9d  348 U. S., at 32.  From there it declared that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce the object is within the authority of Congress, the right to realize it through the exercise of eminent domain is clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 33.  Following up, we said in <em>Midkiff</em> that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he \xe2\x80\x98public use\xe2\x80\x99 requirement is coterminous with the scope of a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s police powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U. S., at 240.  This language was unnecessary to the specific holdings of those decisions.  <em>Berman</em> and <em>Midkiff</em> simply did not put such language to the constitutional test, because the takings in those cases were within the police power but also for \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d for the reasons I have described.  The case before us now demonstrates why, when deciding if a taking\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is constitutional, the police power and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d cannot always be equated.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court protests that it does not sanction the bare transfer from A to B for B\xe2\x80\x99s benefit.  It suggests two limitations on what can be taken after today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  First, it maintains a role for courts in ferreting out takings whose sole purpose is to bestow a benefit on the private transferee\xe2\x80\x94without detailing how courts are to conduct that complicated inquiry.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  For his part, Justice Kennedy suggests that courts may divine illicit purpose by a careful review of the record and the process by which a legislature arrived at the decision to take\xe2\x80\x94without specifying what courts should look for in a case with different facts, how they will know if they have found it, and what to do if they do not.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (concurring opinion).  Whatever the details of Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s as-yet-undisclosed test, it is difficult to envision anyone but the \xe2\x80\x9cstupid staff[er]\xe2\x80\x9d failing it.  See <em>Lucas</em> v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/1003/index.html">505 U. S. 1003</a>, 1025\xe2\x80\x931026, n.\xc2\xa012 (1992).  The trouble with economic development takings is that private benefit and incidental public benefit are, by definition, merged and mutually reinforcing.  In this case, for example, any boon for Pfizer or the plan\xe2\x80\x99s developer is difficult to disaggregate from the promised public gains in taxes and jobs.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 275\xe2\x80\x93277.  </f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if there were a practical way to isolate the motives behind a given taking, the gesture toward a purpose test is theoretically flawed.  If it is true that incidental public benefits from new private use are enough to ensure the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in a taking, why should it matter, as far as the Fifth Amendment is concerned, what inspired the taking in the first place?  How much the government does or does not desire to benefit a favored private party has no bearing on whether an economic development taking will or will not generate secondary benefit for the public.  And whatever the reason for a given condemnation, the effect is the same from the constitutional perspective\xe2\x80\x94private property is forcibly relinquished to new private ownership.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A second proposed limitation is implicit in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  The logic of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is that eminent domain may only be used to upgrade\xe2\x80\x94not downgrade\xe2\x80\x94property.  At best this makes the Public Use Clause redundant with the Due Process Clause, which already prohibits irrational government action.  See<em> Lingle</em>, 544 U. S. __.  The Court rightfully admits, however, that the judiciary cannot get bogged down in predictive judgments about whether the public will actually be better off after a property transfer.  In any event, this constraint has no realistic import.  For who among us can say she already makes the most productive or attractive possible use of her property?  The specter of condemnation hangs over all property.  Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.  Cf. <em>Bugryn</em> v. <em>Bristol</em>, 63 Conn. App. 98, 774 A.\xc2\xa02d 1042 (2001) (taking the homes and farm of four owners in their 70\xe2\x80\x99s and 80\xe2\x80\x99s and giving it to an \xe2\x80\x9cindustrial park\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>99 Cents Only Stores</em> v. <em>Lancaster Redevelopment Authority</em>, 237 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1123 (CD Cal. 2001) (attempted taking of 99 Cents store to replace with a Costco); <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council</em> v. <em>Detroit</em>, 410 Mich. 616, 304 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 455 (1981) (taking a working-class, immigrant community in Detroit and giving it to a General Motors assembly plant), overruled by <em>County of Wayne</em> v. <em>Hathcock</em>, 471 Mich. 415, 684 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 765 (2004); Brief for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4\xe2\x80\x9311 (describing takings of religious institutions\xe2\x80\x99 properties); Institute for Justice, D. Berliner, Public Power, Private Gain: A Five-Year, State-by-State Report Examining the Abuse of Eminent Domain (2003) (collecting accounts of economic development takings).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also puts special emphasis on facts peculiar to this case: The NLDC\xe2\x80\x99s plan is the product of a relatively careful deliberative process; it proposes to use eminent domain for a multipart, integrated plan rather than for isolated property transfer; it promises an array of incidental benefits (even aesthetic ones), not just increased tax revenue; it comes on the heels of a legislative determination that New London is a depressed municipality.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>ante</em>, at 16 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this case\xe2\x80\x9d).  Justice Kennedy, too, takes great comfort in these facts.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (concurring opinion).  But none has legal significance to blunt the force of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  If legislative prognostications about the secondary public benefits of a new use can legitimate a taking, there is nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule or in Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s gloss on that rule to prohibit property transfers generated with less care, that are less comprehensive, that happen to result from less elaborate process, whose only projected advantage is the incidence of higher taxes, or that hope to transform an already prosperous city into an even more prosperous one.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, in a coda, the Court suggests that property owners should turn to the States, who may or may not choose to impose appropriate limits on economic development takings.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  This is an abdication of our responsibility.  States play many important functions in our system of dual sovereignty, but compensating for our refusal to enforce properly the Federal Constitution (and a provision meant to curtail state action, no less) is not among them.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was possible after <em>Berman</em> and <em>Midkiff</em> to imagine unconstitutional transfers from A to B.  Those decisions endorsed government intervention when private property use had veered to such an extreme that the public was suffering as a consequence.  Today nearly all real property is susceptible to condemnation on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory.  In the prescient words of a dissenter from the infamous decision in <em>Poletown</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ow that we have authorized local legislative bodies to decide that a different commercial or industrial use of property will produce greater public benefits than its present use, no homeowner\xe2\x80\x99s, merchant\xe2\x80\x99s or manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s property, however productive or valuable to its owner, is immune from condemnation for the benefit of other private interests that will put it to a \xe2\x80\x98higher\xe2\x80\x99 use.\xe2\x80\x9d  410 Mich., at 644\xe2\x80\x93645, 304 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 464 (opinion of Fitzgerald, J.).  This is why economic development takings \xe2\x80\x9cseriously jeopardiz[e] the security of all private property ownership.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 645, 304 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 465 (Ryan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random.  The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.  As for the victims, the government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more.  The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]hat alone is a <em>just</em> government,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote James Madison, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich <em>impartially</em> secures to every man, whatever is his <em>own</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  For the National Gazette, Property, (Mar. 29, 1792), reprinted in 14 Papers of James Madison 266 (R.

If such \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic development\xe2\x80\x9d takings are for a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use,\xe2\x80\x9d any taking is, and the Court has erased the Public Use Clause from our Constitution, as Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor powerfully argues in dissent.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 8\xe2\x80\x9313.  I do not believe that this Court can eliminate liberties expressly enumerated in the Constitution and therefore join her dissenting opinion.  Regrettably, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s error runs deeper than this.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is simply the latest in a string of our cases construing the Public Use Clause to be a virtual nullity, without the slightest nod to its original meaning.  In my view, the Public Use Clause, originally understood, is a meaningful limit on the government\xe2\x80\x99s eminent domain power.  Our cases have strayed from the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s original meaning, and I would reconsider them.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifth Amendment provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb, nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process, of law; <em>nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p align="left">\nIt is the last of these liberties, the Takings Clause, that is at issue in this case.  In my view, it is \xe2\x80\x9cimperative that the Court maintain absolute fidelity to\xe2\x80\x9d the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s express limit on the power of the government over the individual, no less than with every other liberty expressly enumerated in the Fifth Amendment or the Bill of Rights more generally.  <em>Shepard</em> v. <em>United States, </em>544 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 2) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though one component of the protection provided by the Takings Clause is that the government can take private property only if it provides \xe2\x80\x9cjust compensation\xe2\x80\x9d for the taking, the Takings Clause also prohibits the government from taking property except \xe2\x80\x9cfor public use.\xe2\x80\x9d  Were it otherwise, the Takings Clause would either be meaningless or empty.  If the Public Use Clause served no function other than to state that the government may take property through its eminent domain power\xe2\x80\x94for public or private uses\xe2\x80\x94then it would be surplusage.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting); see also <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison,</em> 1 Cranch 137, 174 (1803) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Myers</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/index.html">272 U. S. 52</a>, 151 (1926).  Alternatively, the Clause could distinguish those takings that require compensation from those that do not.  That interpretation, however, \xe2\x80\x9cwould permit private property to be taken or appropriated for private use without any compensation whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cole</em> v. <em>La Grange,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/113/1/index.html">113 U. S. 1</a>, 8 (1885) (interpreting same language in the Missouri Public Use Clause).  In other words, the Clause would require the government to compensate for takings done \xe2\x80\x9cfor public use,\xe2\x80\x9d leaving it free to take property for purely private uses without the payment of compensation.  This would contradict a bedrock principle well established by the time of the founding: that all takings required the payment of compensation.  1 Blackstone 135; 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 275 (1827) (hereinafter Kent); J. Madison, for the National Property Gazette, (Mar. 27, 1792), in 14 Papers of James Madison 266, 267 (R. Rutland et\xc2\xa0al. eds. 1983) (arguing that no property \xe2\x80\x9cshall be taken <em>directly</em> even for public use without indemnification to the owner\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Public Use Clause, like the Just Compensation Clause, is therefore an express limit on the government\xe2\x80\x99s power of eminent domain.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most natural reading of the Clause is that it allows the government to take property only if the government owns, or the public has a legal right to use, the property, as opposed to taking it for any public purpose or necessity whatsoever.  At the time of the founding, dictionaries primarily defined the noun \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he act of employing any thing to any purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 2194 (4th ed. 1773) (hereinafter Johnson).  The term \xe2\x80\x9cuse,\xe2\x80\x9d moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cis from the Latin <em>utor</em>, which means \xe2\x80\x98to use, make use of, avail one\xe2\x80\x99s self of, employ, apply, enjoy, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Lewis, Law of Eminent Domain \xc2\xa7165, p. 224, n.\xc2\xa04 (1888) (hereinafter Lewis).  When the government takes property and gives it to a private individual, and the public has no right to use the property, it strains language to say that the public is \xe2\x80\x9cemploying\xe2\x80\x9d the property, regardless of the incidental benefits that might accrue to the public from the private use.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use,\xe2\x80\x9d then, means that either the government or its citizens as a whole must actually \xe2\x80\x9cemploy\xe2\x80\x9d the taken property.  See <em>id.</em>, at 223 (reviewing founding-era dictionaries).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Granted, another sense of the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d was broader in meaning, extending to \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onvenience\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chelp,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[q]ualities that make a thing proper for any purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Johnson 2194.  Nevertheless, read in context, the term \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d possesses the narrower meaning.  Elsewhere, the Constitution twice employs the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse,\xe2\x80\x9d both times in its narrower sense.  Claeys, Public-Use Limitations and Natural Property Rights, 2004 Mich. St. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 877, 897 (hereinafter Public Use Limitations).  Article 1, \xc2\xa710 provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning the Treasury itself will control the taxes, not use it to any beneficial end.  And Article I, \xc2\xa78 grants Congress power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here again, \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cemployed to raise and support Armies,\xe2\x80\x9d not anything directed to achieving any military end.  The same word in the Public Use Clause should be interpreted to have the same meaning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tellingly, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d contrasts with the very different phrase \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral Welfare\xe2\x80\x9d used elsewhere in the Constitution.  See <em>ibid.</em>  (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall have Power To \xe2\x80\xa6 provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); preamble (Constitution established \xe2\x80\x9cto promote the general Welfare\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Framers would have used some such broader term if they had meant the Public Use Clause to have a similarly sweeping scope.  Other founding-era documents made the contrast between these two usages still more explicit.  See Sales, Classical Republicanism and the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPublic Use\xe2\x80\x9d Requirement, 49 Duke L.\xc2\xa0J. 339, 368 (2000) (hereinafter Sales) (noting contrast between, on the one hand, the term \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d used by 6 of the first 13 States and, on the other, the terms \xe2\x80\x9cpublic exigencies\xe2\x80\x9d employed in the Massachusetts Bill of Rights and the Northwest Ordinance, and the term \xe2\x80\x9cpublic necessity\xe2\x80\x9d used in the Vermont Constitution of 1786).  The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text, in short, suggests that the Takings Clause authorizes the taking of property only if the public has a right to employ it, not if the public realizes any conceivable benefit from the taking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s common-law background reinforces this understanding.  The common law provided an express method of eliminating uses of land that adversely impacted the public welfare: nuisance law.  Blackstone and Kent, for instance, both carefully distinguished the law of nuisance from the power of eminent domain.  Compare 1 Blackstone 135 (noting government\xe2\x80\x99s power to take private property with compensation), with 3 <em>id.</em>, at 216 (noting action to remedy \xe2\x80\x9c<em>public</em> \xe2\x80\xa6nuisances, which affect the public and are an annoyance to <em>all</em> the king\xe2\x80\x99s subjects\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 2 Kent 274\xe2\x80\x93276 (distinguishing the two).  Blackstone rejected the idea that private property could be taken solely for purposes of any public benefit.  \xe2\x80\x9cSo great \xe2\x80\xa6 is the regard of the law for private property,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it will not authorize the least violation of it; no, not even for the general good of the whole community.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Blackstone 135.  He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIf a new road \xe2\x80\xa6 were to be made through the grounds of a private person, it might perhaps be extensively beneficial to the public; but the law permits no man, or set of men, to do this without the consent of the owner of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Only \xe2\x80\x9cby giving [the landowner] full indemnification\xe2\x80\x9d could the government take property, and even then \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he public [was] now considered as an individual, treating with an individual for an exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  When the public took property, in other words, it took it as an individual buying property from another typically would: for one\xe2\x80\x99s own use.  The Public Use Clause, in short, embodied the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 understanding that property is a natural, fundamental right, prohibiting the government from \xe2\x80\x9ctak[ing] <em>property</em> from A. and giv[ing] it to B.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Calder</em> v. <em>Bull,</em> 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798); see also <em>Wilkinson</em> v. <em>Leland,</em> 2 Pet. 627, 658 (1829); <em>Vanhorne\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em> v. <em>Dorrance,</em> 2 Dall. 304, 311 (CC Pa. 1795).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The public purpose interpretation of the Public Use Clause also unnecessarily duplicates a similar inquiry required by the Necessary and Proper Clause.  The Takings Clause is a prohibition, not a grant of power: The Constitution does not expressly grant the Federal Government the power to take property for any public purpose whatsoever.  Instead, the Government may take property only when necessary and proper to the exercise of an expressly enumerated power.  See <em>Kohl</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/91/367/index.html">91 U. S. 367</a>, 371\xe2\x80\x93372 (1876) (noting Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to take property \xe2\x80\x9cneeded for forts, armories, and arsenals, for navy-yards and light-houses, for custom-houses, post-offices, and court-houses, and for other public uses\xe2\x80\x9d).  For a law to be within the Necessary and Proper Clause, as I have elsewhere explained, it must bear an \xe2\x80\x9cobvious, simple, and direct relation\xe2\x80\x9d to an exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated powers, <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/541/600/index.html">541 U. S. 600</a>, 613 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), and it must not \xe2\x80\x9csubvert basic principles of\xe2\x80\x9d constitutional design, <em>Gonzales </em>v.<em> Raich, ante, </em>at __ (Thomas, J., dissenting).  In other words, a taking is permissible under the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it serves a valid public purpose.  Interpreting the Public Use Clause likewise to limit the government to take property only for sufficiently public purposes replicates this inquiry.  If this is all the Clause means, it is, once again, surplusage.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.  The Clause is thus most naturally read to concern whether the property is used by the public or the government, not whether the purpose of the taking is legitimately public.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Early American eminent domain practice largely bears out this understanding of the Public Use Clause.  This practice concerns state limits on eminent domain power, not the Fifth Amendment, since it was not until the late 19th century that the Federal Government began to use the power of eminent domain, and since the Takings Clause did not even arguably limit state power until after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Note, The Public Use Limitation on Eminent Domain: An Advance Requiem, 58 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 599, 599\xe2\x80\x93600, and nn.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934 (1949); <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan</em> v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore,</em> 7 Pet. 243, 250\xe2\x80\x93251 (1833) (holding the Takings Clause inapplicable to the States of its own force).  Nevertheless, several early state constitutions at the time of the founding likewise limited the power of eminent domain to \xe2\x80\x9cpublic uses.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Sales 367\xe2\x80\x93369, and n. 137 (emphasis deleted).  Their practices therefore shed light on the original meaning of the same words contained in the Public Use Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0States employed the eminent domain power to provide quintessentially public goods, such as public roads, toll roads, ferries, canals, railroads, and public parks.  Lewis \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7166, 168\xe2\x80\x93171, 175, at 227\xe2\x80\x93228, 234\xe2\x80\x93241, 243.  Though use of the eminent domain power was sparse at the time of the founding, many States did have so-called Mill Acts, which authorized the owners of grist mills operated by water power to flood upstream lands with the payment of compensation to the upstream landowner.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7178, at 245\xe2\x80\x93246; <em>Head</em> v. <em>Amoskeag Mfg. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/113/9/index.html">113 U. S. 9</a>, 16\xe2\x80\x9319, and n. (1885).  Those early grist mills \xe2\x80\x9cwere regulated by law and compelled to serve the public for a stipulated toll and in regular order,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore were actually used by the public.  Lewis \xc2\xa7178, at 246, and n.\xc2\xa03; see also <em>Head</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  They were common carriers\xe2\x80\x94quasi-public entities.  These were \xe2\x80\x9cpublic uses\xe2\x80\x9d in the fullest sense of the word, because the public could legally use and benefit from them equally.  See Public Use Limitations 903 (common-carrier status traditionally afforded to \xe2\x80\x9cprivate beneficiaries of a state franchise or another form of state monopoly, or to companies that operated in conditions of natural monopoly\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, some early state legislatures tested the limits of their state-law eminent domain power.  Some States enacted statutes allowing the taking of property for the purpose of building private roads.  See Lewis \xc2\xa7167, at 230.  These statutes were mixed; some required the private landowner to keep the road open to the public, and others did not.  See <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7167, at 230\xe2\x80\x93234.  Later in the 19th century, moreover, the Mill Acts were employed to grant rights to private manufacturing plants, in addition to grist mills that had common-carrier duties.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> M. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law 1780\xe2\x80\x931860, pp. 51\xe2\x80\x9352 (1977).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These early uses of the eminent domain power are often cited as evidence for the broad \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation of the Public Use Clause, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa08 (majority opinion); Brief for Respondents 30; Brief for American Planning Assn. et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> at 6\xe2\x80\x937, but in fact the constitutionality of these exercises of eminent domain power under state public use restrictions was a hotly contested question in state courts throughout the 19th and into the 20th century.  Some courts construed those clauses to authorize takings for public purposes, but others adhered to the natural meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  As noted above, the earliest Mill Acts were applied to entities with duties to remain open to the public, and their later extension is not deeply probative of whether that subsequent practice is consistent with the original meaning of the Public Use Clause.  See <em>McIntyre</em> v. <em>Ohio Elections Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/334/index.html">514 U. S. 334</a>, 370 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  At the time of the founding, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]usiness corporations were only beginning to upset the old corporate model, in which the raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc4\x99tre of chartered associations was their service to the public,\xe2\x80\x9d Horwitz, <em>supra</em>, at 49\xe2\x80\x9350, so it was natural to those who framed the first Public Use Clauses to think of mills as inherently public entities.  The disagreement among state courts, and state legislatures\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to circumvent public use limits on their eminent domain power, cannot obscure that the Public Use Clause is most naturally read to authorize takings for public use only if the government or the public actually uses the taken property.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our current Public Use Clause jurisprudence, as the Court notes, has rejected this natural reading of the Clause.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  The Court adopted its modern reading blindly, with little discussion of the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s history and original meaning, in two distinct lines of cases: first, in cases adopting the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation of the Clause, and second, in cases deferring to legislatures\xe2\x80\x99 judgments regarding what constitutes a valid public purpose.  Those questionable cases converged in the boundlessly broad and deferential conception of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d adopted by this Court in <em>Berman</em> v. <em>Parker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/26/index.html"></a><a href="/us/348/26/index.html">348 U.

The weakness of those two lines of cases, and consequently <em>Berman </em>and <em>Midkiff</em>, fatally undermines the doctrinal foundations of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s questionable application of these cases is further proof that the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d standard is not susceptible of principled application.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance by rote on this standard is ill advised and should be reconsidered.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court notes, the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation of the Public Use Clause stems from <em>Fallbrook Irrigation Dist.</em> v. <em>Bradley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/164/112/index.html">164 U. S. 112</a>, 161\xe2\x80\x93162 (1896).  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  The issue in <em>Bradley</em> was whether a condemnation for purposes of constructing an irrigation ditch was for a public use.  164 U. S., at 161.  This was a public use, Justice Peckham declared for the Court, because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o irrigate and thus to bring into possible cultivation these large masses of otherwise worthless lands would seem to be a public purpose and a matter of public interest, not confined to landowners, or even to any one section of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  That broad statement was dictum, for the law under review also provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll landowners in the district have the right to a proportionate share of the water.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 162.  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d did<em> </em>have the right to use the irrigation ditch because all similarly situated<em> </em>members of the public\xe2\x80\x94those who owned lands irrigated by the ditch\xe2\x80\x93had a right to use it.  The Court cited no authority for its dictum, and did not discuss either the Public Use Clause\xe2\x80\x99s original meaning or the numerous authorities that had adopted the \xe2\x80\x9cactual use\xe2\x80\x9d test (though it at least acknowledged the conflict of authority in state courts, see <em>id.</em>, at 158; <em>supra</em>, at 9, and n. 2).  Instead, the Court reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he use must be regarded as a public use, or else it would seem to follow that no general scheme of irrigation can be formed or carried into effect.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bradley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 160\xe2\x80\x93161.  This is no statement of constitutional principle: Whatever the utility of irrigation districts or the merits of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that another rule would be \xe2\x80\x9cimpractical given the diverse and always evolving needs of society,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, the Constitution does not embody those policy preferences any more than it \xe2\x80\x9cenact[s] Mr. Herbert Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s Social Statics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lochner</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/index.html">198 U.

S. 361</a> (1905) (Peckham, J., for the Court), this Court relied on little more than a citation to <em>Bradley</em> in upholding another condemnation for the purpose of laying an irrigation ditch.  198 U. S., at 369\xe2\x80\x93370.  As in <em>Bradley</em>, use of the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d test was unnecessary to the result the Court reached.  The government condemned the irrigation ditch for the purpose of ensuring access to water in which \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther land owners adjoining the defendant in error \xe2\x80\xa6 might share,\xe2\x80\x9d 198 U. S., at 370, and therefore <em>Clark </em>also involved a condemnation for the purpose of ensuring access to a resource to which similarly situated members of the public had a legal right of access.  Likewise, in <em>Strickley</em> v. <em>Highland Boy Gold Mining Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/200/527/index.html">200 U. S. 527</a> (1906), the Court upheld a condemnation establishing an aerial right-of-way for a bucket line operated by a mining company, relying on little more than <em>Clark</em>, see <em>Strickley, supra, </em>at 531.  This case, too, could have been disposed of on the narrower ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff [was] a carrier for itself and others,\xe2\x80\x9d 200 U. S.,  at 531\xe2\x80\x93532, and therefore that the bucket line was legally open to the public.  Instead, the Court unnecessarily rested its decision on the \xe2\x80\x9cinadequacy of use by the general public as a universal test.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 531.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases quickly incorporated the public purpose standard set forth in <em>Clark </em>and <em>Strickley </em>by barren citation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Rindge Co.</em> v. <em>County of Los Angeles,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/700/index.html">262 U. S. 700</a>, 707 (1923); <em>Block</em> v. <em>Hirsh,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/256/135/index.html">256 U. S. 135</a>, 155 (1921); <em>Mt. Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Co.</em> v. <em>Alabama Interstate Power Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/240/30/index.html">240 U.

Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/160/668/index.html">160 U. S. 668</a> (1896), involved the question whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to condemn certain private land for the purpose of building battlefield memorials at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was for a public use.  <em>Id.</em>, at 679\xe2\x80\x93680.  Since the Federal Government was to use the lands in question, <em>id.</em>, at 682, there is no doubt that it was a public use under any reasonable standard.  Nonetheless, the Court, speaking through Justice Peckham, declared that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the legislature has declared the use or purpose to be a public one, its judgment will be respected by the courts, unless the use be palpably without reasonable foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 680.  As it had with the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d dictum in <em>Bradley</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Court quickly incorporated this dictum into its Public Use Clause cases with little discussion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States ex rel. TVA</em> v. <em>Welch,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/546/index.html">327 U. S. 546</a>, 552 (1946); <em>Old Dominion Land Co.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/269/55/index.html">269 U. S. 55</a>, 66 (1925).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no justification, however, for affording almost insurmountable deference to legislative conclusions that a use serves a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use.\xe2\x80\x9d  To begin with, a court owes no deference to a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s judgment concerning the quintessentially legal question of whether the government owns, or the public has a legal right to use, the taken property.  Even under the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation, moreover, it is most implausible that the Framers intended to defer to legislatures as to what satisfies the Public Use Clause, uniquely among all the express provisions of the Bill of Rights.  We would not defer to a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the various circumstances that establish, for example, when a search of a home would be reasonable, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Payton</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/573/index.html">445 U. S. 573</a>, 589\xe2\x80\x93590 (1980), or when a convicted double-murderer may be shackled during a sentencing proceeding without on-the-record findings, see <em>Deck</em> v. <em>Missouri,</em> 544 U. S. ___ (2005), or when state law creates a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Castle Rock</em> v.<em> Gonzales, post, </em>at __; <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges</em> v. <em>Roth,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/index.html">408 U. S. 564</a>, 576 (1972); <em>Goldberg</em> v. <em>Kelly,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/254/index.html">397 U. S. 254</a>, 262\xe2\x80\x93263 (1970).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still worse, it is backwards to adopt a searching standard of constitutional review for nontraditional property interests, such as welfare benefits, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Goldberg</em>, <em>supra</em>, while deferring to the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s determination as to what constitutes a public use when it exercises the power of eminent domain, and thereby invades individuals\xe2\x80\x99 traditional rights in real property.  The Court has elsewhere recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthe overriding respect for the sanctity of the home that has been embedded in our traditions since the origins of the Republic,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Payton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 601, when the issue is only whether the government may search a home.  Yet today the Court tells us that we are not to \xe2\x80\x9csecond-guess the City\xe2\x80\x99s considered judgments,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18, when the issue is, instead, whether the government may take the infinitely more intrusive step of tearing down petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 homes.  Something has gone seriously awry with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Constitution.  Though citizens are safe from the government in their homes, the homes themselves are not.    Once one accepts, as the Court at least nominally does, <em>ante</em>, at 6, that the Public Use Clause is a limit on the eminent domain power of the Federal Government and the States, there is no justification for the almost complete deference it grants to legislatures as to what satisfies it.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These two misguided lines of precedent converged in <em>Berman</em> v. <em>Parker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/26/index.html"></a><a href="/us/348/26/index.html">348 U. S. 26</a> (1954), and <em>Hawaii Housing Authority</em> v. <em>Midkiff,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/229/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/229/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/229/index.html">467 U. S. 229</a> (1984).  Relying on those lines of cases, the Court in <em>Berman </em>and <em>Midkiff </em>upheld condemnations for the purposes of slum clearance and land redistribution, respectively.  \xe2\x80\x9cSubject to specific constitutional limitations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Berman </em>proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the legislature has spoken, the public interest has been declared in terms well-nigh conclusive.  In such cases the legislature, not the judiciary, is the main guardian of the public needs to be served by social legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  348 U. S., at 32.   That reasoning was question begging, since the question to be decided was whether the \xe2\x80\x9cspecific constitutional limitation\xe2\x80\x9d of the Public Use Clause prevented the taking of the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s (concededly \xe2\x80\x9cnonblighted\xe2\x80\x9d) department store.  <em>Id.</em>, at 31, 34.  <em>Berman</em> also appeared to reason that any exercise by Congress of an enumerated power (in this case, its plenary power over the District of Columbia) was <em>per se</em> a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d under the Fifth Amendment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 33.  But the very point of the Public Use Clause is to limit that power.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More fundamentally, <em>Berman </em>and <em>Midkiff </em>erred by equating the eminent domain power with the police power of States.  See <em>Midkiff, </em>467 U. S., at 240 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98public use\xe2\x80\x99 requirement is \xe2\x80\xa6 coterminous with the scope of a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s police powers\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Berman, </em>348 U. S., at 32.  Traditional uses of that regulatory power, such as the power to abate a nuisance, required no compensation whatsoever, see <em>Mugler</em> v. <em>Kansas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/123/623/index.html">123 U. S. 623</a>, 668\xe2\x80\x93669 (1887), in sharp contrast to the takings power, which has always required compensation, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, and n. 1.  The question whether the State can take property using the power of eminent domain is therefore distinct from the question whether it can regulate property pursuant to the police power.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lucas</em> v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/1003/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/1003/index.html">505 U. S. 1003</a>, 1014 (1992); <em>Mugler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 668\xe2\x80\x93669.  In <em>Berman</em>, for example, if the slums at issue were truly \xe2\x80\x9cblighted,\xe2\x80\x9d then state nuisance law, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936; <em>Lucas, supra</em>, at 1029, not the power of eminent domain, would provide the appropriate remedy.  To construe the Public Use Clause to overlap with the States\xe2\x80\x99 police power conflates these two categories.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d test applied by <em>Berman </em>and <em>Midkiff</em> also cannot be applied in principled manner.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we depart from the natural import of the term \xe2\x80\x98public use,\xe2\x80\x99 and substitute for the simple idea of a public possession and occupation, that of public utility, public interest, common benefit, general advantage or convenience \xe2\x80\xa6 we are afloat without any certain principle to guide us.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bloodgood </em>v. <em>Mohawk &amp; Hudson R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 18 Wend. 9, 60\xe2\x80\x9361 (NY 1837) (opinion of Tracy, Sen.).  Once one permits takings for public purposes in addition to public uses, no coherent principle limits what could constitute a valid public use\xe2\x80\x93at least, none beyond Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s (entirely proper) appeal to the text of the Constitution itself.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 8\xe2\x80\x9313 (dissenting opinion).  I share the Court\xe2\x80\x99s skepticism about a public use standard that requires courts to second-guess the policy wisdom of public works projects.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9319.  The \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d standard this Court has adopted, however, demands the use of such judgment, for the Court concedes that the Public Use Clause would forbid a purely private taking.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  It is difficult to imagine how a court could find that a taking was purely private except by determining that the taking did not, in fact, rationally advance the public interest.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting) (noting the complicated inquiry the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test requires).  The Court is therefore wrong to criticize the \xe2\x80\x9cactual use\xe2\x80\x9d test as \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to administer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  It is far easier to analyze whether the government owns or the public has a legal right to use the taken property than to ask whether the taking has a \xe2\x80\x9cpurely private purpose\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x93unless the Court means to eliminate public use scrutiny of takings entirely.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  Obliterating a provision of the Constitution, of course, guarantees that it will not be misapplied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, I would revisit our Public Use Clause cases and consider returning to the original meaning of the Public Use Clause: that the government may take property only if it actually uses or gives the public a legal right to use the property.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The consequences of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision are not difficult to predict, and promise to be harmful.  So-called \xe2\x80\x9curban renewal\xe2\x80\x9d programs provide some compensation for the properties they take, but no compensation is possible for the subjective value of these lands to the individuals displaced and the indignity inflicted by uprooting them from their homes.  Allowing the government to take property solely for public purposes is bad enough, but extending the concept of public purpose to encompass any economically beneficial goal guarantees that these losses will fall disproportionately on poor communities.  Those communities are not only systematically less likely to put their lands to the highest and best social use, but are also the least politically powerful.  If ever there were justification for intrusive judicial review of constitutional provisions that protect \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete and insular minorities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Carolene Products Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/144/index.html">304 U. S. 144</a>, 152, n. 4 (1938), surely that principle would apply with great force to the powerless groups and individuals the Public Use Clause protects.  The deferential standard this Court has adopted for the Public Use Clause is therefore deeply perverse.  It encourages \xe2\x80\x9cthose citizens with dis-\nproportionate influence and power in the political pro-\ncess, including large corporations and development\nfirms\xe2\x80\x9d to victimize the weak.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those incentives have made the legacy of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d test an unhappy one.  In the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s, no doubt emboldened in part by the expansive understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d this Court adopted in <em>Berman</em>, cities \xe2\x80\x9crushed to draw plans\xe2\x80\x9d for downtown development.  B. Frieden &amp; L. Sagalayn, Downtown, Inc. How America Rebuilds Cities 17 (1989).  \xe2\x80\x9cOf all the families displaced by urban renewal from 1949 through 1963, 63 percent of those whose race was known were nonwhite, and of these families, 56 percent of nonwhites and 38 percent of whites had incomes low enough to qualify for public housing, which, however, was seldom available to them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 28.  Public works projects in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s and 1960\xe2\x80\x99s destroyed predominantly minority communities in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Baltimore, Maryland.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  In 1981, urban planners in Detroit, Michigan, uprooted the largely \xe2\x80\x9clower-income and elderly\xe2\x80\x9d Poletown neighborhood for the benefit of the General Motors Corporation.  J. Wylie, Poletown: Community Betrayed 58 (1989).  Urban renewal projects have long been associated with the displacement of blacks; \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n cities across the country, urban renewal came to be known as \xe2\x80\x98Negro removal.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Pritchett, The \xe2\x80\x9cPublic Menace\xe2\x80\x9d of Blight: Urban Renewal and the Private Uses of Eminent Domain, 21 Yale L. &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y Rev. 1, 47 (2003).  Over 97 percent of the individuals forcibly removed from their homes by the \xe2\x80\x9cslum-clearance\xe2\x80\x9d project upheld by this Court in <em>Berman </em>were black.  348 U. S., at 30.  Regrettably, the predictable consequence of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision will be to exacerbate these effects.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court relies almost exclusively on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior cases to derive today\xe2\x80\x99s far-reaching, and dangerous, result.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9312.  But the principles this Court should employ to dispose of this case are found in the Public Use Clause itself, not in Justice Peckham\xe2\x80\x99s high opinion of reclamation laws, see <em>supra</em>, at 11.  When faced with a clash of constitutional principle and a line of unreasoned cases wholly divorced from the text, history, and structure of our founding document, we should not hesitate to resolve the tension in favor of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s original meaning.  For the reasons I have given, and for the reasons given in Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, the conflict of principle raised by this boundless use of the eminent domain power should be resolved in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  I would reverse the judgment of the Connecticut Supreme Court.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Some state constitutions at the time of the founding lacked just compensation clauses and took property even without providing compensation.
