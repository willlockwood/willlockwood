She then removed with the negroes to Burlington, in the state of New-Jersey, designing, as it was suggested, to avoid the operation of the act, for the gradual abolition of slavery; but no proof was offered, that she had ever intended to settle in Pennsylvania. The negroes absconding from Mrs. Chambr e, came to Philadelphia; and now they asserted their freedom, under the 10th section of the act, which declares all unregistered negroes and mulattoes to be free, \'except (inter alia) the domestic slaves attending upon persons passing through; or sojourning in this state, and not becoming resident therein: provided such domestic slaves be not aliened, or sold to any inhabitant, nor retained in this state longer than six months.\' 1 vol.
