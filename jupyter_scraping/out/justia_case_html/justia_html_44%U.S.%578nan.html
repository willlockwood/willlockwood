S. 587</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McLEAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This action was brought in the Circuit Court for the District of Illinois on a bond given by Prescott, with the other defendants as his sureties, for his faithful performance of the duties of Receiver of Public Moneys at Chicago, in the State of Illinois.  The defense pleaded was that the sum not paid over by the defendant, Prescott, and for which the action was brought, had been feloniously stolen, taken, and carried away from his possession by some person or persons unknown to him, and without any fault or negligence on his part, and he avers that he used ordinary care and diligence in keeping said money and preventing it from being stolen.</p>\n<p>To this plea the plaintiffs filed a general demurrer, and on the argument of the demurrer the opinions of the judges were opposed on the question whether</p>\n<p>"the felonious taking and carrying away the public moneys in the custody of a receiver of public moneys, without any fault or negligence in his part, discharged him and his sureties, and may be set up as a defense to an action on his official bond."</p>\n<p>And this point is now before this Court, it having been certified to us under the act of Congress.</p>\n<p>On the part of the defendant it is contended that the defendant, Prescott, was a depositary for hire and that unless his liability was enlarged by the special contract to keep safely, he is only subject to the liabilities imposed by law upon such a depositary; that the special contract does not enlarge his liability.</p>\n<p>This is not a case of bailment, and consequently the law of bailment does not apply to it.  The liability of the defendant Prescott arises out of his official bond and principles which are founded upon </p><p><a class="page-number" name="588">Page 44 U. S. 588</a></p><p> public policy.  The conditions of the bond are that the said Prescott has "truly and faithfully executed and discharged, and shall truly and faithfully continue to execute and discharge, all the duties of said office" of receiver of public moneys at Chicago</p>\n<p>"according to the laws of the United States, and moreover has well, truly, and faithfully and shall well, truly, and faithfully keep safely, without loaning or using, all the public moneys collected by him or otherwise at any time placed in his possession and custody till the same had been or should be ordered by the proper department or officer of the government to be transferred or paid out, and when such orders for transfer or payment had been or should be received, had faithfully and promptly made and would faithfully and promptly make the same as directed"</p>\n<p>&amp;c.</p>\n<p>The condition of the bond has been broken, as the defendant, Prescott, failed to pay over the money received by him, when required to do so, and the question is whether he shall be exonerated from the condition of his bond on the ground that the money had been stolen from him?</p>\n<p>The objection to this defense is that it is not within the condition of the bond, and this would seem to be conclusive.  The contract was entered into on his part, and there is no allegation of failure on the part of the government; how then can Prescott be discharged from his bond?  He knew the extent of his obligation when he entered into it, and he has realized the fruits of this obligation by the enjoyment of the office.  Shall he be discharged from liability contrary to his own express undertaking?  There is no principle on which such a defense can be sustained.  The obligation to keep safely the public money is absolute, without any condition, express or implied, and nothing but the payment of it when required can discharge the bond.</p>\n<p>The case of <em>Foster v. Essex Bank,</em> 17 Mass. 479, was a mere naked bailment, and of course does not apply in principle to this case.  The deposit in that case was for the accommodation of the depositor and without any advantage to the bank, as the court said,</p>\n<p>"which can tend to increase its liability.  No control whatever of the chest, or of the gold contained in it, was left with the bank or its officers.  It would have been a breach of trust to have opened the chest or to inspect its contents."</p>\n<p>Public policy requires that every depositary of the public money should be held to a strict accountability.  Not only that he should exercise the highest degree of vigilance, but that "he should keep safely" the moneys which come to his hands.  Any relaxation of this condition would open the door to frauds, which might be practiced with impunity.  A depositary would have nothing more to do than to lay his plans and arrange his proofs so as to establish his loss without laches on his part.  Let such a principle be applied to our postmasters, collectors of the customs, receivers of public </p><p><a class="page-number" name="589">Page 44 U. S. 589</a></p><p> moneys, and others who receive more or less of the public funds, and what losses might not be anticipated by the public?  No such principle has been recognized or admitted as a legal defense.  And it is believed the instances are few, if indeed any can be found, where any relief has been given in such cases by the interposition of Congress.</p>\n<p>As every depositary receives the office with a full knowledge of its responsibilities, he cannot, in case of loss, complain of hardship.  He must stand by his bond and meet the hazards which he voluntarily incurs.</p>\n<p>The question certified to us is answered that the defendant Prescott and his sureties are not discharged from the bond by a felonious stealing of the money without any fault or negligence on the part of the depositary, and consequently that no such defense to the bond can be made.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
