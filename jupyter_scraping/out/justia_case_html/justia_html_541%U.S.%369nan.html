S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71658(a).  Petitioners, African-American former employees of respondent, filed a class action alleging violations of \xc2\xa71981, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  Respondent sought summary judgment, claiming that the applicable state 2-year statute of limitations barred their claims, but the District Court held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 wrongful discharge, refusal to transfer, and hostile work environment claims arose under the 1991 Act and therefore are governed by \xc2\xa71658.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, concluding that \xc2\xa71658 does not apply to a cause of action based on a post-1990 amendment to a pre-existing statute.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action are governed by \xc2\xa71658.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71658 is ambiguous, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent must be ascertained by looking beyond the section\xe2\x80\x99s bare text to the context in which it was enacted and the purposes it was designed to accomplish.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Before \xc2\xa71658\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to pass a uniform limitations statute for federal causes of action had created a void that spawned a vast amount of litigation.  The settled practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations generated a host of issues, such as which of the forum State\xe2\x80\x99s statutes was the most appropriate, whether the forum State\xe2\x80\x99s law or that of the situs of the injury controlled, and when a statute of limitations could be tolled.  Congress was keenly aware of these problems, and a central purpose of \xc2\xa71658 was to minimize the need for borrowing.  That purpose would not be served if \xc2\xa71658 were interpreted to reach only entirely new sections of the United States Code.  An amendment to an existing statute is no less an \xe2\x80\x9cAct of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d than a new, stand-alone statute.  What matters is the new rights of action and corresponding liabilities created by the enactment.  Thus, a cause of action \xe2\x80\x9caris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted\xe2\x80\x9d after December 1, 1990\xe2\x80\x94and therefore is governed by \xc2\xa71658\xe2\x80\x99s 4-year statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x94if the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment.  This construction best serves Congress\xe2\x80\x99 interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations, while protecting litigants\xe2\x80\x99 settled expectations by applying only to causes of actions not available until after December 1, 1990.  It also is consistent with the common usage of \xe2\x80\x9carise\xe2\x80\x9d and with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretations of \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.

The 1991 Act overturned this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a>, 171, which held that racial harassment relating to employment conditions was not actionable under \xc2\xa71981.  The Act redefined \xc2\xa71981\xe2\x80\x99s key \xe2\x80\x9cmake and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x9d language to include the \xe2\x80\x9ctermination of contracts and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71981(b).  In <em>Rivers</em> v. <em>Roadway Express, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/298/index.html">511 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981 does not contain a statute of limitations.  We held in <em>Goodman</em> v. <em>Lukens Steel Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/656/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/656/index.html">482 U. S. 656</a>, 660 (1987), that federal courts should apply \xe2\x80\x9cthe most appropriate or analogous state statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d to claims based on asserted violations of \xc2\xa71981.  Three years after our decision in <em>Goodman</em>, Congress enacted a catchall 4-year statute of limitations for actions arising under federal statutes enacted after December 1, 1990.   28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71658.  The question in this case is whether petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action, which allege violations of \xc2\xa71981, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), 105 Stat. 1071, are governed by \xc2\xa71658 or by the personal injury statute of limitations of the forum State.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are African-American former employees of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Chicago manufacturing division.  On November 26, 1994, petitioners filed this class action alleging violations of their rights under \xc2\xa71981, as amended by the 1991 Act.  Specifically, the three classes of plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to a racially hostile work environment, given an inferior employee status, and wrongfully terminated or denied a transfer in connection with the closing of the Chicago plant.  Respondent sought summary judgment on the ground that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims are barred by the applicable Illinois statute of limitations because they arose more than two years before the complaint was filed.  Petitioners responded that their claims are governed by \xc2\xa71658, which provides: \xe2\x80\x9cExcept as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71658(a).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Section 1658 was enacted on December 1, 1990.  Thus, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims are subject to the 4-year statute of limitations if they arose under an Act of Congress enacted after that date.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The original version of the statute now codified at Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71977, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981, was enacted as \xc2\xa71 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27.  It was amended in minor respects in 1870 and recodified in 1874, see <em>Runyon</em> v. <em>McCrary,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/160/index.html">427 U. S. 160</a>, 168\xe2\x80\x93169, n. 8 (1976), but its basic coverage did not change prior to 1991.  As first enacted, \xc2\xa71981 provided in relevant part that \xe2\x80\x9call persons [within the jurisdiction of the United States] shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts \xe2\x80\xa6 as is enjoyed by white citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  14 Stat. 27.  We held in <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a> (1989), that the statutory right \xe2\x80\x9cto make and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x9d did not protect against harassing conduct that occurred after the formation of the contract.  Under that holding, it is clear that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 hostile work environment, wrongful discharge, and refusal to transfer claims do not state violations of the original version of \xc2\xa71981.  In 1991, however, Congress responded to <em>Patterson</em> by adding a new subsection to \xc2\xa71981 that defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cmake and enforce contacts\xe2\x80\x9d to include the \xe2\x80\x9ctermination of contracts and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981(b).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It is undisputed that petitioners have alleged violations of the amended statute.  The critical question, then, is whether petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action \xe2\x80\x9car[ose] under\xe2\x80\x9d the 1991 Act or under \xc2\xa71981 as originally enacted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court determined that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 wrongful termination, refusal to discharge, and hostile work environment claims arose under the 1991 Act and therefore are governed by \xc2\xa71658.  <em>Adams</em> v. <em>R.\xc2\xa0R. Donnelley &amp; Sons</em>, 149 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 459 (ND Ill. 2001).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In its view, the plain text of \xc2\xa71658 compels the conclusion that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever Congress, after December 1990, passes legislation that creates a new cause of action, the catch-all statute of limitations applies to that cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 464.  The 1991 amendment to \xc2\xa71981 falls within that category, the court reasoned, because it opened the door to claims of postcontract discrimination that, under <em>Patterson</em>, could not have been brought under \xc2\xa71981 as enacted.  149 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 464.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court certified its ruling for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71292(b), and the Court of Appeals reversed.  305 F.\xc2\xa03d 717 (CA7 2002).  It concluded that \xc2\xa71658 \xe2\x80\x9capplies only when an act of Congress creates a wholly new cause of action, one that does not depend on the continued existence of a statutory cause of action previously enacted and kept in force by the amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 726.  The 1991 amendment does not satisfy that test, the court explained, because the text of \xc2\xa71981(b) \xe2\x80\x9csimply cannot stand on its own\xe2\x80\x9d; instead, it merely redefines a term in the original statute without altering the text that \xe2\x80\x9cprovides the basic right of recovery for an individual whose constitutional rights have been violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 727.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that \xc2\xa71658 does not apply to a cause of action based on a post-1990 amendment to a pre-existing statute is consistent with decisions from the Third and Eighth Circuits.  See <em>Zubi</em> v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em>, 219 F.\xc2\xa03d 220, 224 (CA3 2000); <em>Madison</em> v. <em>IBP, Inc.</em>, 257 F. 3d 780, 798 (CA8 2001).  Conversely, the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and Tenth Circuits have held that \xc2\xa71658 applies \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever Congress, after December 1990, passes legislation that creates a new cause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d whether or not the legislation amends a pre-existing statute.  <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Allstate Insurance Co.</em>, 300 F.\xc2\xa03d 1183, 1190 (CA10 2002); accord, <em>Anthony</em> v. <em>BTR Automotive Sealing System, Inc.</em>, 339 F.\xc2\xa03d 506, 514 (CA6 2003).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict in the Circuits, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/1030/index.html">538 U. S. 1030</a> (2003), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, supported by the United States as <em>amicus curiae,</em> argue that reversal is required by the \xe2\x80\x9cplain language\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71658, which prescribes a 4-year statute of limitations for \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action[s] arising under an Act of Congress enacted after\xe2\x80\x9d December 1, 1990.  They point out that the 1991 Act is, by its own terms, an \xe2\x80\x9cAct\xe2\x80\x9d of Congress that was \xe2\x80\x9cenacted\xe2\x80\x9d after December 1, 1990.  See Pub. L. 102\xe2\x80\x93166, 105 Stat. 1071.  Moreover, citing our interpretations of the term \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d in other federal statutes and in Article III of the Constitution, petitioners maintain that their causes of action arose under the 1991 Act.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent concedes that the 1991 Act qualifies as an \xe2\x80\x9cAct of Congress enacted\xe2\x80\x9d after 1991, but argues that the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d is not so clear.  We agree.  Although our expositions of the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d concept in other contexts are helpful in interpreting the term as it is used in \xc2\xa71658, they do not point the way to one obvious answer.  For example, Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s statement that a case arises under federal law for purposes of Article III jurisdiction whenever federal law \xe2\x80\x9cforms an ingredient of the original cause,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Osborn</em> v. <em>Bank of United States,</em> 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824), supports petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 amendment to \xc2\xa71981, because the 1991 Act clearly \xe2\x80\x9cforms an ingredient\xe2\x80\x9d of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  But the same could be said of the original version of \xc2\xa71981.  Thus, reliance on <em>Osborn</em> would suggest that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action arose under the pre-1991 version of \xc2\xa71981 as well as under<em> </em>the 1991 Act, just as a cause of action may arise under both state and federal law.  As the Court of Appeals observed, however, \xc2\xa71658 does not expressly \xe2\x80\x9caddress the eventuality when a cause of action \xe2\x80\x98arises under\xe2\x80\x99 two different \xe2\x80\x98Acts,\xe2\x80\x99 one enacted before and one enacted after the effective date of \xc2\xa71658.\xe2\x80\x9d  305 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 724.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that we should look not at Article III, but at how Congress has used the term \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d in federal legislation.  They point in particular to the statutes in Title 28 that define the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  We have interpreted those statutes to mean that a claim arises under federal law if federal law provides a necessary element of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim for relief.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Petitioners recognize that we have construed the term more broadly in other statutes,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] but argue that the placement of \xc2\xa71658 in Title 28 suggests that Congress meant to invoke our interpretation of the neighboring jurisdictional rules.  We hesitate to place too much significance on the location of a statute in the United States Code.  But even if we accepted the proposition that Congress intended the term \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d to have the same meaning in \xc2\xa71658 as in other sections of Title 28, it would not follow that the text is unambiguous.  We have said that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he most familiar definition of the statutory \xe2\x80\x98arising under\xe2\x80\x99 limitation\xe2\x80\x9d is the statement by Justice Holmes that a suit \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98arises under the law that creates the cause of action,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. </em>v. <em>Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/index.html">463 U. S. 1</a>, 8\xe2\x80\x939 (1983) (quoting <em>American Well Works Co.</em> v. <em>Layne &amp; Bowler Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/241/257/index.html">241 U. S. 257</a>, 260 (1916)).  On one hand, that statement could support petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 Act, which created a statutory right that did not previously exist.  On the other hand, it also could support respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action arose under the original version of \xc2\xa71981, which contains the operative language setting forth the elements of their claims.  Justice Holmes\xe2\x80\x99 formulation even could support the view that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims arose under both versions of the statute.  Cf. <em>T. B. Harms Co.</em> v. <em>Eliscu</em>, 339 F.\xc2\xa02d 823, 827 (CA2 1964) (Friendly, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt has come to be realized that Mr. Justice Holmes\xe2\x80\x99 formula is more useful for inclusion than for the exclusion for which it was intended\xe2\x80\x9d).  In order to ascertain Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent, therefore, we must look beyond the bare text of \xc2\xa71658 to the context in which it was enacted and the purposes it was designed to accomplish.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y.</em> v. <em>Tomanio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/478/index.html">446 U. S. 478</a>, 483 (1980), we observed that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to enact a uniform statute of limitations applicable to federal causes of action created a \xe2\x80\x9cvoid which is commonplace in federal statutory law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Over the years that void has spawned a vast amount of litigation.  Prior to the enactment of \xc2\xa71658, the \xe2\x80\x9csettled practice was to adopt a local time limitation as federal law if it [was] not inconsistent with federal law or policy to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Garcia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/index.html"></a><a href="/us/471/261/index.html">471 U. S. 261</a>, 266\xe2\x80\x93267 (1985).  Such \xe2\x80\x9c[l]imitation borrowing,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Tomanio,</em> 446 U. S., at 484, generated a host of issues that required resolution on a statute-by-statute basis.  For example, it often was difficult to determine which of the forum State\xe2\x80\x99s statutes of limitations was the most appropriate to apply to the federal claim.  We wrestled with that issue in <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Garcia</em>, in which we considered which state statute provided the most appropriate limitation principle for claims arising under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  471 U. S., at 268, 276\xe2\x80\x93279 (resolving split of authority over whether the closest state analogue to an action brought under \xc2\xa71983 was an action for tortious injury to the rights of another, an action on an unwritten contract, or an action for a liability on a statute).  Before reaching that question, however, we first had to determine whether the characterization of a \xc2\xa71983 claim for statute of limitations purposes was an issue of state or federal law and whether all such claims should be characterized in the same way.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Two years later, in <em>Goodman</em> v. <em>Lukens Steel Co.</em>, we answered the same three questions for claims arising under \xc2\xa71981.  482 U. S., at 660, 661\xe2\x80\x93662.  Both decisions provoked dissent[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and further litigation.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The practice of borrowing state statutes of limitation also forced courts to address the \xe2\x80\x9cfrequently present problem of a conflict of laws in determining which State statute [was] controlling, the law of the forum or that of the situs of the injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 619, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 4\xe2\x80\x936 (1955) (discussing problems caused by borrowing state statutes of limitations for antitrust claims).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Even when courts were able to identify the appropriate state statute, limitation borrowing resulted in uncertainty for both plaintiffs and defendants, as a plaintiff alleging a federal claim in State A would find herself barred by the local statute of limitations while a plaintiff raising precisely the same claim in State B would be permitted to proceed.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Interstate variances of that sort could be especially confounding in class actions because they often posed problems for joint resolution.  See Memorandum from R. Marcus, Assoc. Reporter to Workload Subcommittee (Sept. 1, 1989), reprinted in App. to Vol. 1 Federal Courts Study Committee, Working Papers and Subcommittee Reports (1990), Doc. No. 5, p.\xc2\xa010 (hereinafter Marcus Memorandum).  Courts also were forced to grapple with questions such as whether federal or state law governed when an action was \xe2\x80\x9ccommenced,\xe2\x80\x9d or when service of process had to be effectuated.  See <em>Sentry Corp.</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 802 F.\xc2\xa02d 229 (CA7 1986) (addressing those issues in the wake of our decision in <em>Wilson</em>).  And the absence of a uniform federal limitations period complicated the development of federal law on the question when, or under what circumstances, a statute of limitations could be tolled.  See 802 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 234\xe2\x80\x93242<em> </em>(discussing conflicting authority on whether tolling was a matter of state or federal law); <em>Board of Regents</em> v. <em>Tomanio</em>, 446 U.

The House Report accompanying the final bill confirms that Congress was keenly aware of the problems associated with the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations, and that a central purpose of \xc2\xa71658 was to minimize the occasions for that practice.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The history that led to the enactment of \xc2\xa71658 strongly supports an interpretation that fills more rather than less of the void that has created so much unnecessary work for federal judges.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The interpretation favored by respondent and the Court of Appeals subverts that goal by restricting \xc2\xa71658 to cases in which the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action is based solely on a post-1990 statute that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98establishes a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  305 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 727 (quoting <em>Zubi</em> v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em>, 219 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 222).  On that view, \xc2\xa71658 would apply only to a small fraction of post-1990 enactments.  Congress routinely creates new rights of action by amending existing statutes, and \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ltering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously undefined, is a common way of amending statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rivers</em> v. <em>Roadway Express, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/298/index.html">511 U. S. 298</a>, 308 (1994).  Nothing in the text or history of \xc2\xa71658 supports an interpretation that would limit its reach to entirely new sections of the United States Code.  An amendment to an existing statute is no less an \xe2\x80\x9cAct of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d than a new, stand-alone statute.  What matters is the substantive effect of an enactment\xe2\x80\x94the creation of new rights of action and corresponding liabilities\xe2\x80\x94not the format in which it appears in the Code.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reasoned that \xc2\xa71658 must be given a narrow scope lest it disrupt litigants\xe2\x80\x99 settled expectations.  The court observed that Congress refused to make \xc2\xa71658 retroactive because, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98with respect to many statutes that have no explicit limitations provision, the relevant limitations period has long since been resolved by judicial decision,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98retroactively imposing a four year statute of limitations on legislation that the courts have previously ruled is subject to a six month limitations period in one [State], and a ten year period in another, would threaten to disrupt the settled expectations of \xe2\x80\xa6 many parties.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  305 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 725 (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 101\xe2\x80\x93734, p.\xc2\xa024 (1990)).  Concerns about settled expectations provide a valid reason to reject an interpretation of \xc2\xa71658 under which any new amendment to federal law would suffice to trigger the 4-year statute of limitations, regardless of whether the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim would have been available\xe2\x80\x94and subject to a state statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x94prior to December 1, 1990.  Such concerns do not, however, carry any weight against the reading of \xc2\xa71658 adopted by the District Court and urged by petitioners, under which the catchall limitations period applies only to causes of action that <em>were not available</em> until after \xc2\xa71658 was enacted.  If a cause of action did not exist prior to 1990, potential litigants could not have formed settled expectations as to the relevant statute of limitations that would then be disrupted by application of \xc2\xa71658.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that a cause of action \xe2\x80\x9caris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted\xe2\x80\x9d after December 1, 1990\xe2\x80\x94and therefore is governed by \xc2\xa71658\xe2\x80\x99s 4-year statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x94if the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment.  That construction best serves Congress\xe2\x80\x99 interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations while at the same time protecting settled interests.  It spares federal judges and litigants the need to identify the appropriate state statute of limitations to apply to new claims but leaves in place the \xe2\x80\x9cborrowed\xe2\x80\x9d limitations periods for preexisting causes of action, with respect to which the difficult work already has been done.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interpreting \xc2\xa71658 to apply whenever a post-1990 enactment creates a new right to maintain an action also is consistent with the common usage of the word \xe2\x80\x9carise\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9ccome into being; originate\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] or \xe2\x80\x9cspring up.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Finally, that construction is consistent with our interpretations of the term \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  By contrast, nothing in our case law supports an interpretation as narrow as that endorsed by the Court of Appeals, under which \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d means something akin to \xe2\x80\x9cbased solely upon.\xe2\x80\x9d  We should avoid reading \xc2\xa71658 in such a way as to give the familiar statutory language a meaning foreign to every other context in which it is used.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 hostile work environment, wrongful termination, and failure-to-transfer claims \xe2\x80\x9car[ose] under\xe2\x80\x9d the 1991 Act in the sense that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 causes of action were made possible by that Act.  <em>Patterson</em> held that \xe2\x80\x9cracial harassment relating to the conditions of employment is <em>not actionable</em> under \xc2\xa71981.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 U. S., at 171 (emphasis added).  The 1991 Act overturned <em>Patterson</em> by defining the key \xe2\x80\x9cmake and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x9d language in \xc2\xa71981 to include the \xe2\x80\x9ctermination of contracts and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981(b).  In <em>Rivers</em> v. <em>Roadway Express, Inc.,</em> we recognized that the 1991 amendment \xe2\x80\x9cenlarged the category of conduct that is subject to \xc2\xa71981 liability,\xe2\x80\x9d 511 U. S., at 303, and we therefore held that the amendment does not apply \xe2\x80\x9cto a case that arose before it was enacted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 300.  Our reasoning in <em>Rivers</em> supports the conclusion that the 1991 Act fully qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9can Act of Congress enacted after [December 1, 1990]\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa71658.  Because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 hostile work environment, wrongful termination, and failure-to-transfer claims did not allege a violation of the pre-1990 version of \xc2\xa71981 but did allege violations of the amended statute, those claims \xe2\x80\x9car[ose] under\xe2\x80\x9d the amendment to \xc2\xa71981 contained in the 1991 Act.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While that conclusion seems eminently clear in this case,[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] respondent has posited various hypothetical cases in which it might be difficult to determine whether a particular claim arose under the amended or the unamended version of a statute.  Similarly, the Court of Appeals reasoned that applying \xc2\xa71658 to post-1990 amendments could be problematic in some cases because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the line between an amendment that modifies an existing right and one that creates a new right is often difficult to draw.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  305 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 725 (quoting <em>Zubi</em> v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em>, 219 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 224).  We are not persuaded that any \xe2\x80\x9cguess work,\xe2\x80\x9d 305 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 725, is required to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the relevant statute as it stood prior to December 1, 1990, or whether her claims necessarily depend on a subsequent amendment.  Courts routinely make such determinations when dealing with amendments (such as the 1991 amendment to \xc2\xa71981) that do not apply retroactively.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  In any event, such hypothetical problems pale in comparison with the difficulties that federal courts faced for decades in trying to answer all the questions raised by borrowing appropriate limitations rules from state statutes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In 2002, Congress amended \xc2\xa71658 to add a separate provision (subsection (b)) specifying the statute of limitations for certain securities law claims.

Such analysis is hardly beyond the judicial ken: Courts must answer precisely the same question when deciding whether an amendment may be applied retrospectively.
