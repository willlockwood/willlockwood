Petitioners, South Carolina residents, sued respondents for violating the federal Driver\xe2\x80\x99s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA) by obtaining, disclosing, and using petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 personal information from motor vehicle records for bulk solicitation without their express consent.

The District Court held that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 letters were not solicitations and that the use of information fell within (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s litigation exception.

The DPPA\xe2\x80\x94responding to a threat from stalkers and criminals who could acquire state DMV information, and concerns over the States\xe2\x80\x99 common practice of selling such information to direct marketing and solicitation businesses\xe2\x80\x94bans disclosure, absent a driver\xe2\x80\x99s consent, of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal information,\xe2\x80\x9d e.g., names, addresses, or telephone numbers, as well as \xe2\x80\x9chighly restricted personal information,\xe2\x80\x9d e.g., photographs, social security numbers, and medical or disability information, \xc2\xa72725(4), unless 1 of 14 exemptions applies.

See New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 645\n.  Such a consistent interpretation is also required because (b)(4) is an exception to both the DPPA\xe2\x80\x99s general ban on disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal information\xe2\x80\x9d and the ban on release of \xe2\x80\x9chighly restricted personal information.\xe2\x80\x9d  An exception to a general policy statement is \xe2\x80\x9cusually read .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. narrowly in order to preserve the [provision\xe2\x80\x99s] primary operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Commissioner v. Clark, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 726\n.  Reading (b)(4) to permit disclosure of personal information when there is any connection between protected information and a potential legal dispute would substantially undermine the DPPA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of protecting a right to privacy in motor vehicle records.  Subsection (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d language must have a limit, and a logical and necessary conclusion is that an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation of prospective clients falls outside of that limit.

Solicitation \xe2\x80\x9cby a lawyer of remunerative employment is a business transaction,\xe2\x80\x9d Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., \n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447\n, and state bars treat solicitation as discrete professional conduct.  Excluding solicitation from the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d litigation draws support from (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s examples of permissible litigation uses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cservice of process, investigation in anticipation of litigation, and the execution or enforcement of judgments and orders\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which all involve an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s conduct as an officer of the court, not a commercial actor.  Similarly, \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation in anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d is best understood to allow background research to determine if there is a supportable theory for a complaint or a theory sufficient to avoid sanctions for filing a frivolous lawsuit, or to help locate witnesses for deposition or trial.

Permitting its use in solicitation is so substantial an intrusion on privacy it must not be assumed, without clear and explicit language, absent here, that Congress intended to exempt attorneys from DPPA liability in this regard.

Subsection (b)(12) implements an important objective of the DPPA\xe2\x80\x94to restrict disclosure of personal information in motor vehicle records to businesses for the purpose of direct marketing and solicitation.  Other exceptions should not be construed to interfere with this objective unless the text commands it.  Reading (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d phrase to include solicitation would permit an attorney to use personal information from the state DMV to send bulk solicitations to prospective clients without their express consent, thus creating significant tension between the DPPA\xe2\x80\x99s litigation and solicitation exceptions.

The DPPA supports drawing the line at solicitation.  Solicitation can aid an attorney in bringing a lawsuit or increasing its size, but the question is whether or not lawyers can use personal information protected under the DPPA for this purpose.  The mere fact that respondents complied with state bar rules governing solicitations also does not resolve whether they were entitled to access personal information from the state DMV database for that purpose.  In determining whether obtaining, using, or disclosing personal information is for the prohibited purpose of solicitation, the proper inquiry is whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was to solicit, which might be evident from the communication itself or from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s course of conduct.  When that is the predominant purpose, (b)(4) does not entitle attorneys to DPPA-protected information even when solicitation is to aggregate a class action.  Attorneys also have other alternatives to aggregate a class, including, e.g. soliciting plaintiffs through traditional and permitted advertising.  And they may obtain DPPA-protected information for a proper investigative use.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the Fourth Circuit held that the letters here were solicitations, it found the communications nonetheless exempt under (b)(4) because they were \xe2\x80\x9cinextricably intertwined\xe2\x80\x9d with permissible litigation purposes.  If however, the use of DPPA-protected personal information has the predominant purpose of solicitation, it would not be protected by (b)(4).

Disclosure of personal information is prohibited unless for a purpose permitted by an ex-ception listed in 1 of 14 statutory subsections.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72721(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(14).  This case involves the interpretation of one of those exceptions, subsection (b)(4).  The exception in (b)(4) permits obtaining personal information from a state DMV for use \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d judicial and administrative proceedings, including \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation in anticipation of litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72721(b)(4).

In June 2006, respondent attorneys were approached by car purchasers who complained about administrative fees charged by car dealerships in certain South Carolina counties, allegedly in violation of the MDDA.  The state statute prohibits motor vehicle dealers from engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cany action which is arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable and which causes damage to any of the parties or to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0C.

The attorney\xe2\x80\x99s letter to the DMV requested information regarding \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rivate purchases of new or used automobiles in Spartanburg County during the week of May 1\xe2\x80\x937, 2006, including the name, address, and telephone number of the buyer, dealership where purchased, type of vehicle purchased, and date of purchase.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 57.

On October 26, 2006, while the motions to dismiss were pending, respondents submitted a new FOIA request to the South Carolina DMV.  That request, again citing subsection (b)(4) of the DPPA, sought to locate additional car buyers who could serve as plaintiffs against the dealers who had moved to dismiss.  On October 31, 2006, respondents filed an amended complaint, which added four named plaintiffs and increased the number of defendant dealers from 51 to 324.

Later in January, respondents made three more FOIA requests to the South Carolina DMV seeking personal information concerning people who had purchased cars from an additional 31 dealerships, again citing the (b)(4) exception.  The South Carolina DMV granted all the requests.  On January 23, respondents mailed a second round of letters to car buyers whose personal information had been disclosed by the DMV.

The court denied leave to amend and held the named plaintiffs had standing to sue only those dealerships from which they had purchased automobiles and any alleged co-conspirators.

While his personal information had been disclosed to respondents because he was one of many buyers from a particular dealership, Maracich also happened to be the dealership\xe2\x80\x99s director of sales and marketing.  Petitioners Martha Weeks and John Tanner received letters from respondents in May 2007.  In response to the letter, Tanner called Richard Harpootlian, one of the respondent attorneys listed on the letter.

The second concern related to the States\xe2\x80\x99 common practice of selling personal information to businesses engaged in direct marketing and solicitation.

The Court of Appeals ruled that the conduct here was permissible under (b)(4); but, unlike the District Court, it did not address the alternative argument that the conduct was also permissible under (b)(1).

That language, in literal terms, could be interpreted to its broadest reach to include the personal information that respondents obtained here.  But if no limits are placed on the text of the exception, then all uses of personal information with a remote relation to litigation would be exempt under (b)(4).  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d is essentially \xe2\x80\x9cindeterminat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d because connections, like relations, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stop nowhere.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v.

So the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d provides little guidance without a limiting principle consistent with the structure of the statute and its other provisions.  See id., at 656 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe simply must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining [\xe2\x80\x98connection with\xe2\x80\x99], and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute\xe2\x80\x9d); see also California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v.

Unless commanded by the text, however, these exceptions ought not operate to the farthest reach of their linguistic possibilities if that result would contravene the statutory design.  Cf. Cowan v. Ernest Codelia, P.\xc2\xa0C., 149 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 67 (SDNY 2001) (rejecting an argument by defense counsel that obtaining from the DMV the home address of the assistant district attorney to send her a harassing letter was a permissible use \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d the ongoing criminal proceeding under (b)(4)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf (b)(4) were read to permit disclosure of personal information whenever any connection between the protected information and a potential legal dispute could be shown, it would undermine in a substantial way the DPPA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of protecting an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to privacy in his or her motor vehicle records.  The \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d language in (b)(4) must have a limit.  A logical and necessary conclusion is that an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation of prospective clients falls outside of that limit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe proposition that solicitation is a distinct form of conduct, separate from the conduct in connection with litigation permitted under (b)(4) is demonstrated: by the words of the statute itself; by formal rules issued by bar organizations and governing boards; and by state statutes and regulations that govern and direct attorneys with reference to their duties in litigation, to their clients, and to the public.  As this opinion explains in more detail, the statute itself, in (b)(12), treats bulk solicitation absent consent as a discrete act that the statute prohibits.  And the limited examples of permissible litigation purposes provided in (b)(4) are distinct from the ordinary commercial purpose of solicitation.  Canons of ethics used by bar associations treat solicitation as a discrete act, an act subject to specific regulation.  And state statutes, including statutes of the State of South Carolina, treat solicitation as a discrete subject for regulation and governance of the profession.  It would contradict the idea that solicitation is defined conduct apart from litigation to treat it as simply another aspect of the litigation duties set out in (b)(4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn attorney\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation of new clients is distinct from other aspects of the legal profession.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no less true than trite that lawyers must operate in a three-fold capacity, as self-employed businessmen as it were, as trusted agents of their clients, and as assistants to the court in search of a just solution to disputes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cohen v.

Rule Prof. Conduct 7.3 (Supp. 2012).  That, indeed, was true here.  Respondents were required by the South Carolina rules of ethics to include certain language in their solicitation letters and to file copies with the South Carolina Office of Disciplinary Counsel.  See S.\xc2\xa0C. Rule Prof. Conduct 7.3.  Given the difference between an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s commercial solicitation of clients and his duties as an officer of the court, the proper reading of (b)(4) is that solicitation falls outside of the litigation exception.  And when (b)(4) is interpreted not to give attorneys the privilege of using protected personal information to propose a commercial transaction, the statute is limited by terms and categories that have meaning in the regular course of professional practice.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe exclusion of solicitation from the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d litigation draws further support from the examples of permissible litigation uses in (b)(4).  The familiar canon of noscitur a sociis, the interpretive rule that \xe2\x80\x9cwords and people are known by their companions,\xe2\x80\x9d Gutierrez v.

These uses involve an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s conduct when acting in the capacity as an officer of the court, not as a commercial actor.  The listed examples are steps that ensure the integrity and efficiency of an existing or imminent legal proceeding.  This may include contacting persons who are already involved in the litigation or who are necessary parties or witnesses.  These steps are different from the ordinary business purpose of solicitation.  Here, as will be the case for most solicitations, the attorneys acted without court authorization or supervision and cast a wide net, sending letters to over 30,000 car purchasers to let them know the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 names and the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 interest in performing legal services for them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe examples in (b)(4) confirm, and are all consistent with, protecting the professional responsibilities that counsel, or the court, must discharge in the proper conduct of litigation.  These are quite distinct from the separate subject, the separate professional conduct, of soliciting clients.  The examples suggest that the litigation exception has a limited scope to permit the use of highly restricted personal information when it serves an integral purpose in a particular legal proceeding.  In light of the types of conduct permitted by the subsection, the \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d language should not be read to include commercial solicitations by an attorney.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation in anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d is best understood to allow background research to determine whether there is a supportable theory for a complaint, a theory sufficient to avoid sanctions for filing a frivolous lawsuit, or to locate witnesses for deposition or trial testimony.  An interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation\xe2\x80\x9d to include commercial solicitation of new clients would expand the language in a way inconsistent with the limited uses given as examples in the statutory text.  It must be noted also that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d is not a standalone phrase.  It modifies, and necessarily narrows, the word \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  To use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d without that qualification is to extend the meaning of the statute far beyond its text.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn additional reason to hold that (b)(4) does not permit solicitation of clients is because the exception allows use of the most sensitive kind of information, including medical and disability history and Social Security numbers.  To permit this highly personal information to be used in solicitation is so substantial an intrusion on privacy it must not be assumed, without language more clear and explicit, that Congress intended to exempt attorneys from DPPA liability in this regard.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSubsection (b)(4) is one of only four exceptions in the statute that permit disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9chighly restricted personal information,\xe2\x80\x9d including a person\xe2\x80\x99s image, Social Security number, and medical and disability information.  See \xc2\xa72721(a)(2); \xc2\xa72725(4).  The other three exceptions that permit access to highly restricted personal information include: use by the government, including law enforcement, see \xc2\xa72721(b)(1); use by an insurer in claim investigation and antifraud activities, see \xc2\xa72721(b)(6); and use by an employer to obtain or verify information as required by law, see \xc2\xa72721(b)(9).  None of these exceptions are written to authorize private individuals to acquire the most restricted personal information in bulk merely to propose a commercial transaction for their own financial benefit.  If (b)(4) permitted access to highly restricted personal information for an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s own commercial ends with- out governmental authorization or without consent of the holder of the driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, the result would be so sig- nificant a departure from these other exceptions that it counsels against adopting this interpretation of the statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile the (b)(4) exception allows this sensitive information to be used for investigation in anticipation of litigation and in the litigation itself, there is no indication Congress wanted to provide attorneys with a special concession to obtain medical information and Social Security numbers for the purpose of soliciting new business.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLimiting the reach of (b)(4) to foreclose solicitation of clients also respects the statutory design of the DPPA.  The use of protected personal information for the purpose of bulk solicitation is addressed explicitly by the text of (b)(12).  Congress was aware that personal information from motor vehicle records could be used for solicitation, and it permitted it in circumstances that it defined, with the specific safeguard of consent by the person contacted.  So the absence of the term \xe2\x80\x9csolicitation\xe2\x80\x9d in (b)(4) is telling.  Subsection (b)(12) allows solicitation only of those persons who have given express consent to have their names and addresses disclosed for this purpose.  If (b)(4) were to be interpreted to allow solicitation without consent, then the structure of the Act, and the purpose of (b)(12), would be compromised to a serious degree.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is necessary and required that an interpretation of a phrase of uncertain reach is not confined to a single sentence when the text of the whole statute gives instruction as to its meaning.

Heirs of Boisdor\xc3\xa9, 8 How. 113, 122 (1849))).  The \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d language of (b)(4) therefore must be construed within the context of the DPPA as a whole, including its other exceptions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is not to say, as petitioners contend, that this is a straightforward application of the specific (qualified solicitation permission in (b)(12)) controlling the general (the undefined reach of \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation in anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d in (b)(4)).  As between the two exceptions at issue here, it is not clear that one is always more specific than the other.  For while (b)(12) is more specific with respect to solicitation, (b)(4) is more specific with respect to litigation.  The DPPA\xe2\x80\x99s 14 permissible use exceptions, moreover, are not in all contexts mutually exclusive.  The better reading is that each exception addresses different conduct which may, on occasion, overlap.  For example, certain uses of personal information by a court may be exempt either under (b)(1) or (b)(4).  If conduct falls within the explicit or unambiguous scope of one exception, all other potentially applicable exceptions need not be satisfied.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo the question is not which of the two exceptions controls but whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct falls within the litigation exception at all.  As to this question, petitioners are correct that the existence of the separate provision governing solicitation provides necessary context for defining the scope of (b)(4).  As discussed above, the text of (b)(4) indicates that the exception is best read not to include solicitation as a use \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d litigation.  But even if there were any doubt on this point, the statutory design of the DPPA as a whole, including the (b)(12) exception governing solicitations, provides additional instruction for construing this provision.  For this reason, it is relevant that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems with specific solutions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v.

The DPPA was enacted in part to respond to the States\xe2\x80\x99 common practice of selling personal information to businesses that used it for marketing and solicitations.  See Condon, 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 143 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress found that many States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sell this personal information to individuals and businesses\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 148 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe motor vehicle information which the States have historically sold is used by insurers, manufacturers, direct marketers, and others engaged in interstate commerce to contact drivers with customized solicitations\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress chose to protect individual privacy by requiring a state DMV to obtain the license holder\xe2\x80\x99s express consent before permitting the disclosure, acquisition, and use of personal information for bulk solicitation.  The importance of the consent requirement is highlighted by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision in 1999 to change the statutory mechanism that allowed individuals protected by the Act to opt out to one requiring them to opt in.  See id., at 144\xe2\x80\x93145; see also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7350(c)\xe2\x80\x93(e), \n\n113Stat.\n1025.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDirect marketing and solicitation present a particular concern not only because these activities are of the ordinary commercial sort but also because contacting an individual is an affront to privacy even beyond the fact that a large number of persons have access to the personal information.  The DPPA\xe2\x80\x99s (b)(5) exception illustrates this concern by permitting disclosure of personal information for use in research activities \xe2\x80\x9cso long as the personal information is not published, redisclosed, or used to contact individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72721(b)(5).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause (b)(12) represents Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to target the problem of bulk solicitation with the requirement of express consent, other exceptions should not be construed to interfere with this statutory mechanism unless the text commands it.  This is not to suggest that (b)(12) is an overriding rule that controls all other exceptions.  It would not be necessary to consider (b)(12) if another statutory exception applied to the relevant conduct.  The relevance of (b)(12), however, is that it can be used as additional evidence of the DPPA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory design to interpret exceptions whose breadth and application are uncertain.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d litigation in the (b)(4) exception, as a matter of normal usage and common understanding, does not encompass an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s commercial use of DPPA-protected personal information to solicit new clients.  This and the other reasons given above lead to the conclusion that it would be incorrect to interpret the text of this exception to include an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s commercial solicitation as a use \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d litigation.  And, unlike (b)(12), the (b)(4) exception does not require obtaining an individual\xe2\x80\x99s express consent before disclosing and using personal information contained in state motor vehicle records.  If the \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d language of (b)(4) were read broadly to include solicitation, an attorney could acquire personal information from the state DMV to send bulk solicitations to prospective clients without their express consent.  This would create significant tension in the DPPA between the litigation and solicitation exceptions.  That inconsistency and the concomitant undermining of the statutory design are avoided by interpreting (b)(4) so it does not authorize the use of personal information for the purpose of soliciting clients.  See A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 180 (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of a text should be interpreted in a way that renders them compatible, not contradictory.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Subsection (b)(6) allows an insurer and certain other parties to obtain DMV information for use \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. underwriting.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72721(b)(6).  If that phrase extended to solicitation, then personal information protected by the DPPA could be used to solicit new customers for underwriting without their consent.  It is most doubtful that Congress intended to exempt insurers from the consent requirement for bulk solicitations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe DPPA, in subsection (b)(10), permits disclosure and use of personal information \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d the operation of private toll roads.  If the phrase were interpreted to extend to all solicitations without consent, then the owner of a private toll road could send targeted mass advertisings or direct marketing letters by using the protected personal information obtained from state motor vehicle records.  This, too, would take away much of the force and effect of the (b)(12) restriction on bulk solicitation without the express consent of the person contacted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen Congress did intend the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d to permit conduct otherwise subject to the express consent requirement in (b)(12), it did so in explicit terms.  An illustration can be found in the interplay between (b)(2) and (b)(12) of the DPPA.  As has been noted, (b)(12) prohibits disclosure of protected personal information for the purpose of sending bulk distribution of surveys without the express consent of the recipients.  Subsection (b)(2), however, permits disclosure of personal information \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or use in connection with matters of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. motor vehicle market research activities, including survey research.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72721(b)(2).  So what the DPPA prohibits in (b)(12) it explicitly allows in (b)(2), but it does so by repeating the same word, \xe2\x80\x9csurvey,\xe2\x80\x9d in the text of both provisions.  If the \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d language alone were sufficient to include \xe2\x80\x9csurveys\xe2\x80\x9d within (b)(2), the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csurvey research\xe2\x80\x9d would be mere surplusage.  Instead, the explicit reference to \xe2\x80\x9csurvey\xe2\x80\x9d in (b)(2) was necessary to make clear that Congress had created an exception to the (b)(12)\xe2\x80\x99s consent requirement for one particular type of survey.  When it comes to the prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9csolicitations\xe2\x80\x9d in (b)(12), however, that word is not repeated in the text of (b)(4).  This leads to the inference that Congress did not intend (b)(4) to include \xe2\x80\x9csolicitations\xe2\x80\x9d and thus to override the express consent requirement of (b)(12).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondents concede that (b)(4) does not permit attorneys to use personal information acquired from a state DMV to find new business in the absence of any connection to a particular transaction, occurrence, or defect.  They contend, however, that a line can be drawn between mere trolling for clients (which is not permitted) and solicitation tied to a specific legal dispute (which, respondents argue, is permitted).  While some solicitations may have a close relationship with existing proceedings, there is no principled way to classify some solicitations as acceptable and others as unacceptable for the purpose of (b)(4).  Even if solicitation were permitted only after a lawyer has a client or filed a lawsuit, attorneys would be able to circumvent this limitation with ease by the simple device of filing a placeholder lawsuit.  All an attorney would need is one friend or family member as his client before being able to gain access to DPPA-protected personal information to solicit persons to fill in as plaintiffs.  Solicitation of new plaintiffs to keep defendants in a lawsuit that would otherwise be dismissed for lack of standing is no different in substance from solicitation to initiate a lawsuit.  Here, at any rate, the state court found that plaintiffs had standing to sue the dealerships from which they had purchased automobiles and any alleged co-conspirators.  See 675 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 287, n.\xc2\xa03.  This can undermine the argument that solicitation of additional plaintiffs was somehow necessary for the lawsuit to continue.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDrawing the line between solicitations related to an existing proceeding and those that are not is not a tenable distinction.  The proper solution is to draw the line at solicitation itself.  The structure of the DPPA supports this distinction.  If solicitation were deemed a permissible purpose under (b)(4), even when limited to a particular lawsuit, tension would remain between the (b)(12) solicitation exception, which requires express consent, and the (b)(4) litigation exception, which does not.  The two statutory provisions are consistent if solicitation is excluded from the activity permitted in (b)(4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course solicitation can aid an attorney in bringing a lawsuit or in increasing its size.  The question, however, is whether or not lawyers can use personal information protected under the DPPA for this purpose.  Petitioners and other state residents have no real choice but to disclose their personal information to the state DMV, including highly restricted personal information.  The use of that information by private actors to send direct commercial solicitations without the license holder\xe2\x80\x99s consent is a substantial intrusion on the individual privacy the Act protects.  For the reasons already discussed, a proper interpretation of a use \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d litigation under (b)(4) in light of the DPPA\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure does not include solicitation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe fact that an attorney complies with state bar rules governing solicitations also does not resolve whether he is entitled to access the state DMV database for that purpose under the DPPA.  There is no provision of South Carolina law that either permits or requires attorneys to use DPPA-protected information to solicit potential clients.  Even if such a provision existed, under the Supremacy Clause, it would not protect respondents from DPPA liability unless their conduct fell within one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA person is liable under the DPPA if he \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly obtains, discloses or uses personal information, from a motor vehicle record, for a purpose not permitted\xe2\x80\x9d by one of the statutory exceptions.  \xc2\xa72724(a).  In determining whether obtaining, using, or disclosing the personal information is for the prohibited purpose of solicitation, the proper inquiry is whether the defendant had the predominant purpose to solicit.  Because, in some cases, a communication sent with DPPA-protected information may serve more than one objective, a court must discern whether solicitation is its predominant purpose.  That purpose might be evident from the communication itself.  In other instances the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s whole course of conduct will be relevant in determining whether solicitation was the predominant purpose of the act alleged to be wrongful.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tClose cases may arise.  Where a communication seeks to provide class notice or locate a witness, for example, the fact that the attorney provides contact information for a reply likely would not make the communication an improper solicitation.  And the fact that a letter follows the state bar rules governing attorney solicitations, although relevant, will not be dispositive.  For example, if the predominant purpose of a letter was not to solicit a new client, but rather to ask a witness investigatory questions or to secure her testimony at trial, adherence to state bar solicitation rules would not subject the sender to DPPA liability.  Subsequent conduct, in some cases, may show that solicitation in fact was the predominant purpose of an earlier act; and, of course, even if an initial request was proper, a later use may be a violation.  Where a reason- able observer could discern that the predominant purpose of obtaining, using, or disclosing protected personal information was to initiate or propose a business trans- action with a prospective client, (b)(4) does not exempt the solicitation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondents contend that even if solicitation of clients is impermissible as a general rule, solicitation to aggregate a class action suit is permitted under (b)(4).  Where the predominant purpose is solicitation, however, (b)(4) does not entitle attorneys to obtain and use DPPA-protected information.  To the extent the solicitation of plaintiffs can help attorneys bring a larger class action, there are alternatives that do not sacrifice an individual\xe2\x80\x99s privacy in his or her motor vehicle records.  An attorney, pursuant to a court order, could send class notice.  Class notice may prompt a class member to join the lawsuit, but it also serves the important purpose of protecting the rights of absent class members and ensures that any decision will be binding on the class.  Class notice sent on the instruction of the court also does not raise the same concerns that attorneys are acting only in their own commercial interest.  But respondents here did not obtain or use the protected personal information to send class no- tices or comply with a court order.  The letters made no mention of ethical obligations to outstanding group members or the consequences of not joining the suit.  As the Court of Appeals noted, respondents \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to indicate to recipients that they may already be de facto clients of the Lawyers, that is, persons whose interests were already protected by the senders.\xe2\x80\x9d  675 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 293.  Had respondents received a court order, they might have been able to rely on the explicit language in (b)(4) permitting uses of information \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to an order of a Federal, State, or local court.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72721(b)(4).  But because respondents had no court order authorizing their conduct, this opinion need not address whether it would be proper for a court to order attorneys to obtain DPPA-protected personal information to solicit plaintiffs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAttorneys are free to solicit plaintiffs through traditional and permitted advertising without obtaining personal information from a state DMV.  Here, the attorneys could also have complied with (b)(12) and limited their solicitation to those individuals who had expressly consented, or respondents could have requested consent through the DPPA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver procedure.  See \xc2\xa72721(d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of these and other alternatives, attorneys are not without the necessary means to aggregate a class of plaintiffs.  What they may not do, however, is to acquire highly restricted personal information from state DMV records to send bulk solicitations without express consent from the targeted recipients.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is not to suggest that attorneys may not obtain DPPA-protected personal information for a proper investigatory purpose.  Where respondents obtained petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 personal information to discern the extent of the alleged misconduct or identify particular defendants, those FOIA requests appear permissible under (b)(4) as \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation in anticipation of litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Solicitation of new business, however, is not \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of (b)(4).  And acquiring petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 personal information for a legitimate investigatory purpose does not entitle respondents to then use that same information to send direct solicitations.  Each distinct disclosure or use of personal information acquired from a state DMV must be permitted by the DPPA.

If the statute were to operate otherwise, obtaining personal information for one permissible use would entitle attorneys to use that same information at a later date for any other purpose.

As explained above, however, if the use of DPPA-protected personal information has the predominant purpose of solicitation, that use is not protected by (b)(4).  A remand is necessary for application of the proper standard because the Court of Appeals could conclude, in light of the content of the communications, taken with other evidence in the record, that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 letters had the predominant purpose to solicit clients.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn remand, the Court of Appeals should determine whether the record shows that the communications sought, or were used, to develop the factual basis of the Herron complaint, locate witnesses, identify additional defendants, or perform any other investigative function related to the litigation.

As to civil liability, the amount of damages sought in the complaint is based on the number of persons, over 30,000 individuals, whose personal and highly sensitive information was disclosed and who were solicited.  Whether the civil damages provision in \xc2\xa72724, after a careful and proper interpretation, would permit an award in this amount, and if so whether principles of due process and other doctrines that protect against excessive awards would come into play, is not an issue argued or presented in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this framework, there is no work for the rule of lenity to do.

In connection with that litigation, the lawyers obtained from South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) information identifying buyers who may have been charged unlawful fees and dealers who may have conspired to exact those fees.  The lawyers subsequently sent letters to the identified buyers inquiring whether they had been charged administrative fees, informing them of the litigation, and inviting them to join as plaintiffs.  The courts below determined that the lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 requests for the information and their use of it fell squarely within the litigation exception to the Driver\xe2\x80\x99s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA), \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72721(b)(4), and that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on solicitation, \xc2\xa72721(b)(12), did not override the litigation exception.

This Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, exposing respondents not only to astronomical liquidated damages, \xc2\xa72724(b)(1), but to criminal fines as well, \xc2\xa72723(a), is scarcely what Congress ordered in enacting the DPPA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent-lawyers obtained and used DMV information for \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation in anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d and for communications \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d a civil action.

So read, \xc2\xa72721(b)(4) permitted the lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.

Congress sought to close what it saw as a loophole caused by state laws allowing requesters to gain access to personal information without a legitimate purpose.  Addressing that problem, Congress established a \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory scheme that restricts the States\xe2\x80\x99 ability to disclose a driver\xe2\x80\x99s personal information without the driver\xe2\x80\x99s consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe DPPA generally prohibits any state DMV from \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly disclos[ing] or otherwise mak[ing] available to any person\xe2\x80\x9d personal information about any individual.  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72721(a).

Code Ann. \xc2\xa756\xe2\x80\x9315\xe2\x80\x9310 et\xc2\xa0seq. (2006 and Supp. 2011).  Respondent-lawyers were approached by a number of recent car purchasers who complained that they had been charged unlawful fees.  On behalf of the car purchasers, the lawyers filed a complaint alleging that the car dealerships had violated state law.  The initial complaint identified four purchasers as named plaintiffs and 51 dealers as defendants; the pleading was soon amended to name eight plaintiffs and, as defendants, 324 dealers.  675 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 285.  The complaint invoked the MDDA\xe2\x80\x99s representative action provision, which allows an individual to act as a private attorney general bringing suit \xe2\x80\x9cfor the benefit of the whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa756\xe2\x80\x9315\xe2\x80\x93110(2).  Ultimately, the Herron litigation yielded a declaratory judgment that the dealers had indeed violated state law.  Subsequent settlements gained monetary relief for over 30,000 overcharged car purchasers.  The state court found that the Herron plaintiffs, \xe2\x80\x9cas private attorneys general, [had] represented the public interest in attempting to regulate allegedly unfair practices by motor vehicle dealers and therefore represent all those affected by such practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 253\xe2\x80\x93254.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent-lawyers obtained and used information from the state DMV both shortly before filing suit and during the pendency of the state-court litigation.  Before filing suit, they asked the DMV for information about recent car purchases in six South Carolina counties.  These requests explained that respondent-lawyers represented a group of \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs who have complained of certain conduct as a result of their transactions with car dealers,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the lawyers were \xe2\x80\x9cattempting to determine if this [conduct was] a common practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  675 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 284 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter the lawsuit was filed, respondent-lawyers obtained the names of persons who had purchased cars from the dealers they had identified as defendants and mailed letters to those purchasers.  Ante, at 4.  These dispatches are the actions that, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, render respondent- lawyers potentially liable for violating the DPPA.  To determine whether the DPPA authorized the respondent-lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 uses of DMV information, I first consider the posture of the Herron litigation at the time of the mailings to car purchasers.  The complaint filed by respondent-lawyers on behalf of the car purchasers alleged that the dealers were involved in a conspiracy to charge unlawful fees.  App. 138\xe2\x80\x93139.  In a competitive market, the lawyers urged, such conduct can succeed only when done in concert with other dealers; otherwise, consumers would take their business elsewhere.  Meanwhile, the dealers moved to dismiss the conspiracy claim and argued there was no party with standing to sue those dealers who had not sold a car to a named plaintiff.

Id., at 212.  At a subsequent hearing, the state court clarified that respondent-lawyers could \xe2\x80\x9cgo forward with eight people [the named plaintiffs]\xe2\x80\x9d and the court would consider the standing issue raised in the dealers\xe2\x80\x99 motion to  dismiss \xe2\x80\x9cwhen all the discovery is in and it comes to dis- positive motions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record in No. 7:09\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x931651\xe2\x80\x93HMH (D SC), Doc. 78\xe2\x80\x939, p. 50.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The state court\xe2\x80\x99s initial ruling, in other words, was that the complaint filed by respondent-lawyers was sufficient under state law to mount a concrete dispute between their clients and all the overcharging dealers, and to enable the lawyers to proceed to discovery.

The letters included a card asking recipients to respond by stating the type  of car they had purchased, the name of the dealer and date of purchase, whether they had been charged the allegedly unlawful fee and, if so, the amount of the fee, and whether they were interested in participating in the lawsuit.

Solicitation, the Court says, is not permissible under (b)(4) even if it targets a specific civil proceeding.  The Court offers two primary arguments for this conclusion.  First, the Court contends, a bar on solicitation must be read into (b)(4) lest that provision permit all uses \xe2\x80\x9cwith a remote relation to litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9.  Second, the Court asserts, its interpretation is necessary to respect the \xe2\x80\x9cstructure and purpose of the DPPA\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d of subsection (b)(12).  Ante, at 9, 17.  Neither argument is persuasive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI agree with the Court that the words \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d must be contained within reasonable bounds.  But the Court immediately jumps from this premise to the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9can attorney\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation of prospective clients falls outside of [any reasonable] limit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311; ante, at 11, 13 (solicitation, a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete act\xe2\x80\x9d prohibited by the statute, allows no exception for conduct \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The leap is startling.  In prior decisions, when the Court has sought a limiting principle for similar statutory language, it has done so to prevent the application of a statute to matters with \xe2\x80\x9conly a tenuous, remote, or peripheral connection\xe2\x80\x9d to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s core purpose.  New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 645, \n661 (1995)\n (quoting District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 125, \n130, n. \n1 (1992)\n).  The focus, in other words, has been on the degree of connection between the concerns central to the law and the disputed application of the measure.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority\xe2\x80\x99s focus on solicitation, however, tells us almost nothing about the degree of connection between the use of DMV information and a civil proceeding.  It matters not to the Court whether a solicitation is of vital importance to an ongoing proceeding or far removed from any proceeding which may or may not be brought.  A rule barring any communication for which solicitation is a predominant purpose bears no logical relationship to the \xc2\xa72721(b)(4) phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the majority\xe2\x80\x99s concentration on solicitation is uninformative on the degree of connection to a civil proceeding needed for uses of DMV information that do not involve solicitation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority\xe2\x80\x99s sojourn away from \xc2\xa72721(b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s text in search of a limiting principle is unwarranted.  A limit to the scope of (b)(4) can be readily identified by attending to the phrasing of the provision and its focus on a \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress used similar language in the obstruction of justice statute, which criminalizes various attempts to interfere with a \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512.  The Court had no difficulty identifying a limiting principle in this term; it held that the statute applies only to persons who \xe2\x80\x9chave in contemplation any particular official proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 696, \n708 (2005)\n.  By the same token, (b)(4) is best interpreted to permit only uses tied to a concrete, particular proceeding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d provides further support for this interpretation.  The phrase is hardly unique to (b)(4); it is commonly used to refer to the time at which the work-product privilege attaches to an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s work for a client and the time at which a party has a duty to preserve material evidence.  See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(3) (\xe2\x80\x9cdocuments and other tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d are not discoverable); Silvestri v. General Motors Corp., 271 F.\xc2\xa03d 583, 592 (CA4 2001) (plaintiff had \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to preserve material evidence in anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Both now and when the DPPA was enacted, courts have understood this phrase to require a concrete dispute between parties, and to exclude the abstract possibility of a hypothetical lawsuit.  See, e.g., National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co., 967 F.\xc2\xa02d 980, 984 (CA4 1992) (the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral possibility of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d is not enough; a document is prepared in anticipation of litigation when there is \xe2\x80\x9can actual claim or a potential claim following an actual event or series of events that reasonably could result in litigation\xe2\x80\x9d); Gould Inc. v. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting Co., 825 F.\xc2\xa02d 676, 680 (CA2 1987) (application of Rule 26(b)(3) \xe2\x80\x9cdepends upon the existence of a real, rather than speculative, concern\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUsage of the same words in other prescriptions indicates that (b)(4) is indeed limited by its text.  A hypothetical case without identified adverse parties is not encompassed by (b)(4).

This is a canard.  No court would hold such a case a genuine controversy.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical bears not even a remote resemblance to the facts of this case.  The state court here denied the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the conspiracy claim on standing grounds.  Supra, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  See also ante, at 5 (describing the state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that the named plaintiffs had standing to sue the \xe2\x80\x9cdealerships from which they had purchased automobiles and any alleged co-conspirators\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case is squarely within the metes and bounds of (b)(4).  The letters advanced the concrete interests of the respondent-lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 clients within a pending adversarial civil proceeding in state court.  Just as the letters at issue in this case would be in contemplation of a particular \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512, and would be \xe2\x80\x9cin anticipation of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d as Rule 26(b)(3) employs that term, they fall within the very same language as it appears in \xc2\xa72721(b)(4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s second argument is no more convincing.  A severe limit must be read into (b)(4), the Court urges, to respect the structure of the statute.  Specifically, the Court spotlights that another permissible use, (b)(12), allows \xe2\x80\x9cbulk distribution for surveys, marketing or solicitations,\xe2\x80\x9d but only to individuals who have consented to allow use of their information for this purpose.  Petitioners here devoted much of their briefing to arguing that (b)(12) is somehow more \xe2\x80\x9cspecific\xe2\x80\x9d than (b)(4), see Brief for Petitioners 18\xe2\x80\x9331; Reply Brief 3\xe2\x80\x9312, but the Court rightly rejects that reasoning.  Ante, at 16.  Neither provision is more specific than the other; the two simply cover different subjects.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWithout the specific-governs-the-general canon, the case for using (b)(12) to interpret (b)(4) evaporates.  The Court suggests there would be \xe2\x80\x9ctension\xe2\x80\x9d between the two provisions if a use of DMV information were permitted by (b)(4) but not permitted by (b)(12).  Ante, at 21.  Every permissible use of DMV information, however, is permitted by some\xe2\x80\x94often just one\xe2\x80\x94of the 14 enumerated exceptions and not permitted by others.  The DPPA surely does not convey that every time a person obtains DMV information in accord with one exception, that exception comes into conflict with other exceptions under which the information could not be obtained.  Indeed, it is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that creates tension, by taking a use that would be permissible under (b)(4)\xe2\x80\x94and therefore permissible under the DPPA\xe2\x80\x94and importing into it a restriction delineated in an entirely different exception.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf applied generally to \xc2\xa72721(b), the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach would frustrate the evident congressional purpose to provide a set of separate exceptions, any one of which makes permissible the uses therein.  Consider a consulting company hired by a State to conduct research into motor vehicle safety.  Depending on the particulars of the research project, the company might seek to obtain DMV information under the uses listed in (b)(1), (2), (5), (12), or (14).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  These exceptions entail different requirements, so the project might well fit within one or two of them but not the others.  It would be ludicrous to treat the fact that the project did not fit within one exception as establishing that the project should not be allowed under any other exception.  Construing the DPPA in that manner would render the statute totally unworkable.  The majority does not take that outlandish position with respect to all the exceptions.  Ante, at 16.  Instead, without any congressional instruction to do so, the Court reads (b)(12)\xe2\x80\x94the 12th on a list of 14 permissible uses\xe2\x80\x94as so central a part of the DPPA that it alone narrows the scope of other  exceptions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the most sensible reading of \xc2\xa72721(b)(4), see supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, the uses of DMV information at issue here would be permissible.  The dispositive question should be: Is the use tied to a concrete civil action between identified parties that is ongoing or impending?  Even if the statute could be viewed as ambiguous, there is ample reason to adopt that straightforward reading.  The alternative reading embraced by the Court generates uncertainty regarding the scope of other uses enumerated in \xc2\xa72721(b); creates difficult line-drawing problems; and imposes criminal and draconian civil liability, at odds with the principle of lenity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading clouds other uses the DPPA permits.  According to the Court, the exceptions in \xc2\xa72721(b) should be construed so as not to \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere\xe2\x80\x9d with (b)(12), which \xe2\x80\x9cimplements an important objective of the DPPA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Therefore, (b)(12) is \xe2\x80\x9crelevan[t]\xe2\x80\x9d in interpreting those \xe2\x80\x9cexceptions whose breadth and application are uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18.  Little light is cast on which enumerated exceptions fit that description.  Subsection (b)(4) fits, the Court asserts, but (b)(1) apparently does not.  See ibid.  But what makes (b)(1) clear, while (b)(4) is uncertain?  The Court provides no answer, not even a clue.  Lower courts will be left to puzzle over when (b)(12) comes to the fore, rendering impermissible uses that otherwise fit within another exception.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court sows further confusion by narrowly construing the four exceptions that permit disclosure of information the DPPA ranks as \xe2\x80\x9chighly restricted personal information.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72721(a)(2); see ante, at 14.  These exceptions apply to uses by the government, (b)(1); court opera- tions, (b)(4); use by insurance companies, entities perva- sively regulated by the States, (b)(6); and commercial driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses, which are regulated by the Federal Government and administered by the States, (b)(9).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA common thread unites the four categories: All involve the functioning or oversight of state governments on matters important to the State and persons within the State\xe2\x80\x99s governance.  For uses of this genre, the need for the information can be especially high, and the likelihood of misuse, especially low.  Congress therefore took care to authorize broad access to DMV information for uses these exceptions allow.  I would read \xc2\xa72721(b) as according  the States ample leeway to use and authorize use of their own DMV information in these areas of traditional state authority.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is hard to grasp and will be difficult to apply.  The Court first suggests that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he proper solution is to draw the line at solicitation itself,\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cexclud[e] [solicitation] from the activity permitted in (b)(4).\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 21.  Backing away from this clear, if erroneous, solution, the Court settles on an inquiry into \xe2\x80\x9cwhether obtaining, using, or disclosing the personal information .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. had the predominant purpose to solicit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 22.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s cryptic discussion of its \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant purpose\xe2\x80\x9d test inspires little confidence.  See ibid.

In truth, however, the line between a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s function as an officer of the court and her notice to, and solicitation of, new clients may be indistinct.  See infra, at 17, n.\xc2\xa010.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider an attorney whose client has been the victim of a hit-and-run.  The victim recalls the license plate of another car at the scene, which was also hit by the offending driver.  In order to investigate her client\xe2\x80\x99s case, and to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a supportable theory for a complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14, a responsible attorney would contact this second victim, who may be able to provide useful information about the incident.  But the second victim is also a potential plaintiff in her own right.  A communication might therefore be viewed by the state bar as falling within the rules for solicitation.  See S.\xc2\xa0C. Rule of Professional Conduct 7.3(d) (2012) (solicitation rule applies to communications between an attorney and \xe2\x80\x9ca prospective client known to be in need of legal services in a particular matter\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Under today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the attorney will be in an impossible position.  Her duties to her client\xe2\x80\x94and to the court to conduct a reasonable investigation before filing a lawsuit\xe2\x80\x94instruct her to contact the potential witness.  To avoid running afoul of the state bar\xe2\x80\x99s rules, however, she may need to label any communication with the witness as a solicitation.  But if she does that, today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling would expose her to liability under the DPPA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis example is not so far removed from the facts of this case.  Petitioners conceded, both in their briefs and at oral argument, that the DPPA would have permitted respondents to contact the purchasers of cars to ask them whether they paid the unlawful fees.  Brief for Petitioner 48; Tr. of Oral Arg. 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  Indeed, such an investigation was critical to pursuit and resolution of the Herron litigation.  See supra, at 5.  But in this case, as in the hypothetical case just posed, investigating the facts involved contacting people who might potentially become parties.  And professional rules regarding solicitation may well apply to such communications.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tReality thus belies the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pretense that a bright line separates solicitation from other aspects of a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s role as officer of the court.  Perhaps aware that, in many cases, the line will be hazy or hard to find, the Court resorts to inapposite comparisons. The Court notes, for example, that it would be impermissible for a lawyer to use information obtained from the DMV to send out advertisements for \xe2\x80\x9ca book he wrote.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 24.  But no one would confuse bookselling with investigation in anticipation of litigation; such a use would be impermissible under any reading of (b)(4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition will require lower courts to parse whether every communication using DMV information in the course of litigation has solicitation as a \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 22.  The holding in Maracich\xe2\x80\x99s case, I fear, will, at a minimum, impede the efficient administration of state-court litigation and may well prove infeasible.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Cf.

In truth, the letters served both as an investigative tool and as an invitation to car purchasers to join the Herron suit.  How is the factfinder to determine which purpose was predominant?  Toss a coin when the trier finds the answer is: \xe2\x80\x9csix of one, half dozen of the other\xe2\x80\x9d?  As the Court of Appeals recognized, the use here, although qualifying as a solicitation, \xe2\x80\x9cwas inextricably intertwined with investigation and prosecution of the Herron litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  675 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 300.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the rule of lenity requires that we resolve any residual ambiguity in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  Petitioners sought $2,500 in statutory damages for every letter mailed\xe2\x80\x94a total of some $200 million\xe2\x80\x94and punitive damages to boot.  Brief for Respondents 15.  Such damages cannot possibly represent a legislative judgment regarding average actual damage.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is wrong to suggest that the rule of lenity does not apply to governmental penalties so long as they are payable to private individuals and labeled \xe2\x80\x9cliquidated damages,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal fines.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, the DPPA, which appears in Title 18 of the United States Code, imposes criminal liability for a knowing violation of its provisions.  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72723(a).  Because this is a civil case, I need not consider what defenses respondent-lawyers might have were they criminally prosecuted.

The DPPA has been in effect for over 15 years, and yet the Court points to no judicial decision interpreting the statute in the way it does today.  We should hesitate to adopt a novel interpretation of a federal statute that subjects parties to crushing liability.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.\xe2\x80\x9d  McBoyle v.
