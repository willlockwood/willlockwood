JUSTICE LAMAR delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff holds a patent dated December 12, 1902.  It was issued to her as a member of the Creek Nation when the tribal lands were divided in pursuance of the same general policy as that discussed in <em>Choate v. Trapp, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/224/665/case.html">224 U. S. 665</a></span>.  There were, however, a few differences.  The tax exemption covered only the homestead of forty acres, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="681">Page 224 U. S. 681</a></p><p> and there was a restriction on alienability for twenty-one years.  The patent, instead of being "framed in conformity with the agreement," as in the case of the Choctaws and Chickasaws, bore on its face a provision that the land should be nontaxable; the language of the agreement incorporated in the Act of Congress being that</p>\n<p>"each citizen shall select from his allotment forty acres of land . . . as a homestead, which shall be and remain nontaxable, inalienable, and free from any encumbrance whatever for 21 years from the date of the deed therefor, and a separate deed shall be issued to each allottee for his homestead, in which this condition shall appear."</p>\n<p>These differences are not material.  The right of plaintiff to the exemption granted by Congress is protected by the Constitution on principles stated and applied in <em>Choate v. Trapp.</em>  The judgment dismissing her complaint is therefore reversed, and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with that opinion.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
