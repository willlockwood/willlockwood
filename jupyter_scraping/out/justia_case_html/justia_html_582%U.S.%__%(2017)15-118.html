The three questions presented concern whether the parents of the victim of that shooting may assert claims for damages against the agent under <i>Bivens</i> v. <i>Six Unknown Fed.

See <i>Wood</i> v. <i>Moss</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12).  On June 7, 2010, Sergio Adri\xc3\xa1n Hern\xc3\xa1ndez G\xc3\xbcereca, a 15-year-old Mexican national, was with a group of friends in the cement culvert that separates El Paso, Texas, from Ciudad Juarez, Mex-ico.  Now all but dry, the culvert once contained the watersof the Rio Grande River.  The international boundary runs down the middle of the culvert, and at the top of the embankment on the United States side is a fence.  According to the complaint, Hern\xc3\xa1ndez and his friends were playing a game in which they ran up the embankment on the United States side, touched the fence, and then ran back down.  At some point, Border Patrol Agent Jesus Mesa, Jr., arrived on the scene by bicycle and detained one of Hern\xc3\xa1ndez\xe2\x80\x99s friends in United States territory as the friend ran down the embankment.  Hern\xc3\xa1ndez ran across the international boundary into Mexican territory and stood by a pillar that supports a railroad bridge spanning the culvert.  While in United States territory, Mesa then fired at least two shots across the border at Hern\xc3\xa1ndez.  One shot struck Hern\xc3\xa1ndez in the face and killed him.  According to the complaint, Hern\xc3\xa1ndez was unarmed and unthreatening at the time.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Department of Justice investigated the incident.  The Department concluded that the shooting \xe2\x80\x9coccurred while smugglers attempting an illegal border crossing hurled rocks from close range at a [Customs and Border Patrol] agent who was attempting to detain a suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dept. of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, Federal Officials Close Investigation Into the Death of Sergio Hernandez-Guereca (Apr. 27, 2012), online at http://www.justice.gov\xc2\xa0/opa\xc2\xa0/pr\xc2\xa0/federal-officials-close-investigation-death-sergio-hernandez-guereca (as last visited June 23, 2017).  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]n these particular facts,\xe2\x80\x9d the Department determined, \xe2\x80\x9cthe agent did not act inconsistently with [Customs and Border Patrol] policy or training regarding use of force.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Department also declined to bring federal civil rights charges against Mesa.  In the Department\xe2\x80\x99s view, there was insufficient evidence that Mesa \xe2\x80\x9cacted willfully and with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids,\xe2\x80\x9d and, in any event, Hern\xc3\xa1ndez \xe2\x80\x9cwas neither within the borders of the United States nor present on U.\xc2\xa0S. property, as required for jurisdiction to exist under the applicable federal civil rights statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Department expressed regret for the loss of life in the incident and pledged \xe2\x80\x9cto work with the Mexican government within existing mechanisms and agreements to prevent future incidents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners\xe2\x80\x94Hern\xc3\xa1ndez\xe2\x80\x99s parents\xe2\x80\x94brought suit.  Among other claims, petitioners brought claims against Mesa for damages under <i>Bivens</i>, alleging that Mesa violated Hern\xc3\xa1ndez\xe2\x80\x99s rights under the Fourth and\n \nFifth Amendments.  The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas granted Mesa\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The panel held that Hern\xc3\xa1ndez lacked any\n \nFourth Amendment rights under the circumstances, but that the shooting violated his\n \nFifth Amendment rights.  <i>Hernandez </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 757 F.\xc2\xa03d 249, 267, 272 (2014); <i>id.,</i> at 280\xe2\x80\x93281 (Dennis, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 281 (DeMoss, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The panel also found \xe2\x80\x9cno reason to hesitate in extending <i>Bivens</i> to this new context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 275.  And the panel held that Mesa was not entitled to qualified immunity, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o reasonable officer would have understood Agent Mesa\xe2\x80\x99s alleged conduct to be lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 279.  Judge DeMoss dissented in part, arguing that Hern\xc3\xa1ndez lacked any\n \nFifth Amendment rights under the circumstances.  <i>Id.,</i> at 281\xe2\x80\x93282.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99claims against Mesa.  The en banc Court of Appeals first held that petitioners had failed to state a claim for a violation of the\n \nFourth Amendment because Hern\xc3\xa1ndez was \xe2\x80\x9ca Mexican citizen who had no \xe2\x80\x98significant voluntary connection\xe2\x80\x99 to the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwas on Mexican soil at the time he was shot.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hernandez</i> v.<i> United States</i>, 785 F.\xc2\xa03d 117, 119 (CA5 2015) (<i>per curiam</i>) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Verdugo-Urquidez</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259,\n271 (1990)\n).  As to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim under the\n \nFifth Amendment, the en banc Court of Appeals was \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat divided on the question of whether Agent Mesa\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated the\n \nFifth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d but was \xe2\x80\x9cunanimous\xe2\x80\x9d in concluding that Mesa was entitled to qualified immunity.  785 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 120.  The en banc Court of Appeals explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o case law in 2010, when this episode occurred, reasonably warned Agent Mesa\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe general prohibition of excessive force applies where the person injured by a U.\xc2\xa0S. official standing on U.\xc2\xa0S. soil is an alien who had no significant voluntary connection to, and was not in, the United States when the incident occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Because the en banc Court of Appeals resolved petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims on other grounds, it \xe2\x80\x9cdid not consider whether, even if a constitutional claim had been stated, a tort remedy should be crafted under <i>Bivens</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 121, n.\xc2\xa01 (Jones, J., concurring).  Ten judges filed or joined five separate concurring opinions.  <i>Id.,</i> at 121\xe2\x80\x93143.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court granted certiorari.  580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).  The Court now vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remands for further proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court turns first to the <i>Bivens</i> question, which is \xe2\x80\x9cantecedent\xe2\x80\x9d to the other questions presented.  <i>Wood</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  In <i>Bivens</i>, this Court \xe2\x80\x9crecognized for the first time an implied right of action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Correctional Services Corp.</i> v. <i>Malesko</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61,\n66 (2001)\n.  A <i>Bivens</i> remedy is not available, however, where there are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carlson</i> v. <i>Green</i>,\n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 14,\n18 (1980)\n (quoting <i>Bivens</i>, 403 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 396).  In the decision recently announced in <i>Ziglar </i>v.<i> Abbasi</i>, <i>ante</i>,<i> </i>p. ___, this Courthas clarified what constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial facto[r] counselling hesitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314, 17\xe2\x80\x9323.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explains, \xe2\x80\x9cmust concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals here, of course, has not had the opportunity to consider how the reasoning and analysis in <i>Abbasi</i> may bear on this case.  And the parties have not had the opportunity to brief and argue its significance.  In these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Court of Appeals, rather than this Court, to address the <i>Bivens</i> question in the first instance.  This Court, after all, is one \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of review, not of first view.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Expressions Hair Design</i> v. <i>Schneiderman</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 10) (quoting <i>Nautilus, Inc.</i> v. <i>Biosig Instruments, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 14)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With respect to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99\n \nFourth Amendment claim, the en banc Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address the <i>Bivens</i> question because it concluded that Hern\xc3\xa1ndez lacked any\n \nFourth Amendment rights under the circumstances.  This approach\xe2\x80\x94disposing of a <i>Bivens</i> claim by resolving the constitutional question, while assuming the existence of a <i>Bivens</i> remedy\xe2\x80\x94is appropriate in many cases.  This Court has taken that approach on occasion.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Wood</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11).  The\n \nFourth Amendment question in this case, however, is sensitive and may have consequences that are far reaching.  It would be imprudent for this Court to resolve that issue when, in light of the intervening guidance provided in <i>Abbasi</i>, doing so may be unnecessary to resolve this particular case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With respect to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99\n \nFifth Amendment claim, the en banc Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address the <i>Bivens</i> question because it held that Mesa was entitled to qualified immunity.  In reaching that conclusion, the en banc Court of Appeals relied on the fact that Hern\xc3\xa1ndez was \xe2\x80\x9can alien who had no significant voluntary connection to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  785 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 120.  It is undisputed, however, that Hern\xc3\xa1ndez\xe2\x80\x99s nationality and the extent of his ties to the United States were unknown to Mesa at the time of the shooting.  The en banc Court of Appeals therefore erred in granting qualified immunity based on those facts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctrine of qualified immunity shields officials from civil liability so long as their conduct \xe2\x80\x98does not violate clearly established .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mullenix</i> v. <i>Luna</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935) (quoting <i>Pearson</i> v. <i>Callahan</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223,\n231 (2009)\n).  The \xe2\x80\x9cdispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Saucier</i> v. <i>Katz</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194,\n202 (2001)\n.  The qualified immunity analysis thus is limited to \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts that were knowable to the defendant officers\xe2\x80\x9d at the time they engaged in the conduct in question.  <i>White </i>v. <i>Pauly</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 3).  Facts an officer learns after the incident ends\xe2\x80\x94whether those facts would support granting immunity or denying it\xe2\x80\x94are not relevant.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Mesa and the Government contend that Mesa is entitled to qualified immunity even if Mesa was uncertain about Hern\xc3\xa1ndez\xe2\x80\x99s nationality and his ties to the United States at the time of the shooting.  The Government also argues that, in any event, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim is cognizable only under the\n \nFourth Amendment, and not under the\n \nFifth Amendment.  This Court declines to address these arguments in the first instance.  The Court of Appeals may address them, if necessary, on remand.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The facts alleged in the complaint depict a disturbing incident resulting in a heartbreaking loss of life.  Whether petitioners may recover damages for that loss in this suit depends on questions that are best answered by the Court of Appeals in the first instance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3752805">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 15\xe2\x80\x93118</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">JESUS C.

Hern\xc3\xa1ndez and some of his friends had been running back and forth across a Rio Grande River culvert that straddles the border between the United States and Mexico.  When Mesa shot him, Hern\xc3\xa1ndez had returned to, and was on, the Mexican side of the culvert.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals, affirming the District Court, held (among other things) that Hern\xc3\xa1ndez had no\n \nFourth Amendment rights because he was not a citizen of the United States, he was \xe2\x80\x9con Mexican soil at the time he was shot,\xe2\x80\x9d and he \xe2\x80\x9chad no \xe2\x80\x98significant voluntary connection\xe2\x80\x99 to the United States.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 785 F. 3d 117, 119 (2015) (<i>per curiam</i>) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Verdugo-Urquidez</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259,\n271 (1990)\n).  I would reverse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99\n \nFourth Amendment holding.  And, in my view, that reversal would ordinarily bring with it the right to bring an action for damages under <i>Bivens</i> v. <i>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</i>,\n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388 (1971)\n.  See <i>Wood</i> v. <i>Moss</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11) (<i>Bivens</i> actions lie for\n \nFourth Amendment violations); <i>Tennessee</i> v. <i>Garner</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n11 (1985)\n (officer\xe2\x80\x99s application of lethal force when there is no immediate threat to self or others violates the\n \nFourth Amendment).  See also <i>Ziglar</i> v. <i>Abbasi</i>,<i> ante</i>, p. 1 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I recognize that Hern\xc3\xa1ndez was on the Mexican side of the culvert when he was shot.  But, we have written in a case involving the suspension of habeas corpus that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>de jure</i> sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d is not and never has been \xe2\x80\x9cthe only relevant consideration in determining the geographic reach of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Boumediene</i> v. <i>Bush</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 723,\n764 (2008)\n.  We have added that our precedents make clear that \xe2\x80\x9cquestions of extraterritoriality turn on objective factors and practical concerns, not formalism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also <i>id.</i>, at 759\xe2\x80\x93762.  Those factors and concerns here convince me that Hern\xc3\xa1ndez was protected by the\n \nFourth Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the defendant is a federal officer.  He knowingly shot from United States territory into the culvert.  He did not know at the time whether he was shooting at a citizen of the United States or Mexico, nor has he asserted that he knew on which side of the boundary line the bullet would land.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the culvert itself has special border-related physical features.  It does not itself contain any physical features of a border.  Rather, fences and border crossing posts are not in the culvert itself but lie on either side.  Those of Mexico are on the southern side of the culvert; those of the United States are on the northern side.  The culvert (where the shooting took place) lies between the two fences, and consists of a concrete-lined empty space that is typically 270 feet wide.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, history makes clear that nontechnically speaking, the culvert is the border; and more technically speaking, it is at the least a special border-related area (sometimes known as a \xe2\x80\x9climitrophe\xe2\x80\x9d area, see <i>infra</i>,<i> </i>at 4).  Originally, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the boundary should run \xe2\x80\x9cup the middle\xe2\x80\x9d of the Rio Grande River \xe2\x80\x9cfollowing the deepest channel.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Art.\xc2\xa0V, July 4, 1848,\n\n9Stat.\n926.  It also provided that \xe2\x80\x9cnavigation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be free .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the vessels and citizens of both countries.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0VII, <i>id.,</i> at 928.  Subsequently the river jumped its banks, setting a new course, and provoking serious disputes about the border\xe2\x80\x99s location.  See S. Liss, A Century of Disagreement: The Chamizal Conflict 1864\xe2\x80\x931964, p. 15 (1965) (the river\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cravages .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. irreparably destroyed any semblance of a discernable United States boundary line in the Ciudad Juarez-El Paso area\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s, however, the United States and Mexico negotiated a new boundary.  The two nations working together would \xe2\x80\x9crelocat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the river channel.

That \xe2\x80\x9cchannel\xe2\x80\x9d is the culvert now before us.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, a jointly organized international boundary commission built, and now administers, the culvert.  Once created, the Commission arranged for surveys, acquired rights of way, and built and paved the massive culvert structure.  See Appendix, fig. 1, <i>infra</i> (typical cross-section of the proposed concrete \xe2\x80\x9cculvert\xe2\x80\x9d); see also International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico, Preliminary Plan (July 25, 1963), Annex to Chamizal Convention, 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0T., following p. 36.  The United States contributed approximately $45 million of the total cost.  See Compliance With Convention on the Chamizal, S. Rep. No. 868, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1963); Act To Facilitate Compliance With the Convention Between United States and United Mexican States, \xc2\xa78,\n\n78Stat.\n186.  The United States and Mexico have jointly agreed to maintain the Rio Grande and jointly to maintain the \xe2\x80\x9climitrophe\xe2\x80\x9d areas.  Treaty To Resolve Pending Boundary Differences and Maintain the Rio Grande and Colorado River as the International Boundary, Art. IV, Nov. 23, 1970, 23 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0T. 390, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 7313 (Rio Grande and Colorado River Treaty).  Today an International Boundary and Water Commission, with representatives of both nations, exercises its \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over \xe2\x80\x9climitrophe parts of the Rio Grande.\xe2\x80\x9d  Treaty of Feb. 3, 1944, Art. 2,\n\n59Stat.\n1224.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fifth, international law recognizes special duties and obligations that nations may have in respect to \xe2\x80\x9climitrophe\xe2\x80\x9d areas.  Traditionally, boundaries consisted of rivers, mountain ranges, and other areas that themselves had depth as well as length.  Lord Curzon of Kedleston, Frontiers 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (2d ed. 1908).  It was not until the late 19th century that effective national boundaries came to consist of an engineer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cimaginary line,\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps thousands of miles long, but having \xe2\x80\x9cno width.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reeves, International Boundaries, 38 Am. J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 533, 544 (1944); see also 1 Oppenheim\xe2\x80\x99s International Law 661, n. 1 (R. Jennings &amp; A. Watts eds., 9th ed. 1992).  Modern precision may help avoid conflicts among nations, see, <i>e.g., </i>Rio Grande and Colorado River Treaty, preamble, 23 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0T., at 373, but it has also produced boundary areas\xe2\x80\x94of the sort we have described\xe2\x80\x94which are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98subject to a special legal, political and economic regime of internal and international law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Andrassy, Les Relations Internationales de Voisinage, in The Hague Academy of Int\xe2\x80\x99l Law, 1951 Recuiel des Cours 131 (quoting Paul de Lapradelle, La Frontiere 14 (1928)).  Those areas are subject to a special obligation of co-operation and good neighborliness, V. Lowe, International Law 151 (2007) (describing the \xe2\x80\x9cregime of <i>voisinage</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes \xe2\x80\x9cjointly administered infrastructure facilities .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. co-operation between neighboring police forces .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. bilingual road signs, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shared access to common resources,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like); cf. United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Art. 111(8), Dec. 10, 1982, 1833 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 396 (requiring compensation for loss arising from the erroneous exercise of a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s right of hot pursuit), as well as express duties of joint administration that adjoining states undertake by treaty. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sixth, <i>not</i> to apply the\n \nFourth Amendment to the culvert would produce serious anomalies.  Cf. <i>Verdugo-Urquidez</i>, 494<i> </i>U.\xc2\xa0S., at 278 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach creates a protective difference depending upon whether Hern\xc3\xa1ndez had been hit just before or just after he crossed an imaginary mathematical borderline running through the culvert\xe2\x80\x99s middle.  But nothing else would have changed.  The behavior of the United States Border Patrol agent, along with every other relevant feature of this case, would have remained the same.  Given the near irrelevance of that midculvert line (as compared with the rest of the culvert) for most border-related purposes, as well as almost any other purpose, that result would seem anomalous.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, the anomalies would multiply.  Numerous bridges span the culvert, linking El Paso and Ciudad Juarez.  See Chamizal Convention, Arts. 8\xe2\x80\x9310, 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0T., at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  \xe2\x80\x9cAcross this boundary thousands of Americans and Mexicans pass daily, as casually as one living inland crosses a county line.\xe2\x80\x9d  Liss, <i>supra,</i> at 4; Semuels, Crossing the Mexican-American Border, Every Day, The Atlantic, Jan. 25, 2016, online at https://www.theatlantic.com/ business/archive/2016\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa001\xc2\xa0/crossing-the-mexican-american-border-every-day/426678/; Brief for Border Scholars as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (Fifty-five percent of households in the sister cities cross the border to comparison shop for everyday goods and Mexican shoppers spend $445 million each year in El Paso businesses).  It does not make much sense to distinguish for\n \nFourth Amendment purposes among these many thousands of individuals on the basis of an invisible line of which none of them is aware.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These six sets of considerations taken together provide more than enough reason for treating the entire culvert as having sufficient involvement with, and connection to, the United States to subject the culvert to\n \nFourth Amendment protections.  I would consequently conclude that the\n \nFourth Amendment applies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, I note that neither court below reached the question whether <i>Bivens</i> applies to this case, likely because Mesa did not move to dismiss on that basis.  I would decide the\n \nFourth Amendment question before us and remand the case for consideration of the <i>Bivens</i> and qualified immunity questions.  See <i>Ziglar</i> v. <i>Abbasi</i>, <i>ante</i>, p. 1; but see <i>ante</i>, p. 1 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-H1">APPENDIX</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><b>Figure 1.</b>  International Boundary and Water Commis-sion, United States and Mexico, Relocation of Rio Grande, El Paso, Texas\xe2\x80\x93Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Preliminary Plan (July 25, 1963), Annex to Chamizal Convention, 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0T., following p. 36, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S.
