MARTINEZ et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x931371.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 19, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 28, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings), a school within the University of California public-school system, extends official recognition to student groups through its \xe2\x80\x9cRegistered Student Organization\xe2\x80\x9d (RSO) program.  Several benefits attend this school-approved status, including the use of school funds, facilities, and channels of communication, as well as Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 name and logo.  In exchange for recognition, RSOs must abide by certain conditions.  Critical here, all RSOs must comply with the school\xe2\x80\x99s Nondiscrimination Policy, which tracks state law barring discrimination on a number of bases, including religion and sexual orientation. Hastings interprets this policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers: RSOs must allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions, regardless of her status or beliefs.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the beginning of the 2004\xe2\x80\x932005 academic year, the leaders of an existing Christian RSO formed petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS) by affiliating with a national Christian association that charters student chapters at law schools throughout the country.  These chapters must adopt bylaws that, <em>inter alia</em>, require members and officers to sign a \xe2\x80\x9cStatement of Faith\xe2\x80\x9d and to conduct their lives in accord with prescribed principles.  Among those tenets is the belief that sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man and a woman.  CLS interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in \xe2\x80\x9cunrepentant homosexual conduct\xe2\x80\x9d or holds religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.  Hastings rejected CLS\xe2\x80\x99s application for RSO status on the ground that the group\xe2\x80\x99s bylaws did not comply with Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 open-access policy because they excluded students based on religion and sexual orientation. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CLS filed this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to grant the group RSO status violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for Hastings.  The court held that the all-comers condition on access to a limited public forum was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and therefore did not violate CLS\xe2\x80\x99s right to free speech.  Nor, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, did Hastings impermissibly impair CLS\xe2\x80\x99s right to expressive association: Hastings did not order CLS to admit any student, nor did the school proscribe any speech; Hastings merely placed conditions on the use of school facilities and funds<em>.</em>  The court also rejected CLS\xe2\x80\x99s free exercise argument, stating that the Nondiscrimination Policy did not single out religious beliefs, but rather was neutral and of general applicability.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that the all-comers condition on RSO recognition was reasonable and viewpoint neutral.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Court considers only whether a public institution\xe2\x80\x99s conditioning access to a student-organization forum on compliance with an all-comers policy violates the Constitution.  CLS urges the Court to review, instead, the Nondiscrimination Policy as written\xe2\x80\x94prohibiting discrimination on enumerated bases, including religion and sexual orientation.  The policy\xe2\x80\x99s written terms, CLS contends, target solely those groups that organize around religious beliefs or that disapprove of particular sexual behavior, and leave other associations free to limit membership to persons committed to the group\xe2\x80\x99s ideology.  This argument flatly contradicts the joint stipulation of facts the parties submitted at the summary-judgment stage, which specified: \xe2\x80\x9cHastings requires that [RSOs] allow any student to participate, \xe2\x80\xa6 regardless of [her] status or beliefs.  For example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus cannot bar students holding Republican political beliefs \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court has long recognized that parties are bound by, and cannot contradict, their stipulations.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System</em> v. <em>Southworth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/217/index.html">529 U. S. 217</a>, 226.  The Court therefore rejects CLS\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to escape from the stipulation and shift its target to Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy as written.  Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the RSO forum; it therefore does not transgress First Amendment limitations.  Pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9331. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s limited public forum decisions supply the appropriate framework for assessing both CLS\xe2\x80\x99s free-speech and expressive-association claims; those decisions recognize that a governmental entity, in regulating property in its charge, may impose restrictions on speech that are reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum and viewpoint neutral, <em>e.g., Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a>, 829.  CLS urges the Court to apply to its expressive-association claim a different line of cases\xe2\x80\x94decisions in which the Court has rigorously reviewed restrictions on associational freedom in the context of public accommodations, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Roberts</em> v. <em>United States Jaycees</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/609/index.html">468 U. S. 609</a>, 623.  But, because CLS\xe2\x80\x99s expressive-association and free-speech arguments merge\xe2\x80\x94<em>who</em> speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons, colors <em>what</em> concept is conveyed\xe2\x80\x94it makes little sense to treat the claims as discrete.  Instead, three observations lead the Court to analyze CLS\xe2\x80\x99s arguments under limited-public-forum precedents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums, as compared to other environments,<em> </em>apply with equal force to expressive association occurring in a limited public forum.  Speech and expressive-association rights are closely linked.  See <em>id.,</em> at 622.  When these intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a speech restriction to survive constitutional review under the limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of expressive association.  Second, the strict scrutiny the Court has applied in some settings to laws that burden expressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining characteristic of limited public forums\xe2\x80\x94the State\xe2\x80\x99s authority to \xe2\x80\x9creserv[e] [them] for certain groups.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger</em>, 515 U. S., at 829.  Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum category, for CLS may exclude any person for any reason if it forgoes the benefits of official recognition.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s expressive-association decisions, in contrast, involved regulations that <em>compelled</em> a group to include unwanted members, with no choice to opt out.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Boy Scouts of America </em>v. <em>Dale</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/640/index.html">530 U. S. 640</a>, 648.  Application of the less-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition.  Pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0In three cases, this Court held that public universities had unconstitutionally singled out student groups for disfavored treatment because of their points of view.  See <em>Healy</em> v. <em>James</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/169/index.html">408 U. S. 169</a>;<em> Widmar</em> v. <em>Vincent</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/index.html">454 U. S. 263</a>; and <em>Rosenberger.  </em>Most recently and comprehensively, in <em>Rosenberger</em>, the Court held that a university generally may not withhold benefits from student groups because of their religious outlook.  \xe2\x80\x9cOnce it has opened a limited [public] forum,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court emphasized, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\xe2\x80\x9d  515 U. S. at 829.  It may \xe2\x80\x9cnot exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum, \xe2\x80\xa6 nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of \xe2\x80\xa6 viewpoint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Pp. 17\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 all-comers policy is reasonable, taking into account the RSO forum\xe2\x80\x99s function and \xe2\x80\x9call the surrounding circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cornelius</em> v. <em>NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/index.html">473 U. S. 788</a>, 809.  Pp. 19\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry is shaped by the educational context in which it arises: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Amendment rights must be analyzed in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Widmar</em>, 454 U. S., at 268, n.\xc2\xa05.  This Court is the final arbiter of whether a public university has exceeded constitutional constraints.  The Court has, however, cautioned courts to resist \xe2\x80\x9csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational policy for those of \xe2\x80\xa6 school authorities,\xe2\x80\x9d for judges lack the on-the-ground expertise and experience of school administrators.  <em>Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty.</em> v. <em>Rowley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/176/index.html">458 U. S. 176</a>, 206.  Because schools enjoy \xe2\x80\x9ca significant measure of authority over the type of officially recognized activities in which their students participate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66)</em> v. <em>Mergens</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/226/index.html">496 U. S. 226</a>, 240, the Court approaches its task here mindful that Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 decisions about the character of its student-group program are due decent respect.  Pp. 19\xe2\x80\x9321. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all-comers policy are reasonable in light of the RSO forum\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.  First, the policy ensures that the leadership, educational, and social opportunities afforded by RSOs are available to all students.  RSOs are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees; the policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.  Second, the policy helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSO\xe2\x80\x99s motivation for membership restrictions.  CLS\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that Hastings permit exclusion because of <em>belief</em> but forbid discrimination due to <em>status </em>would impose on Hastings the daunting task of trying to determine whether a student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb.  Third, Hastings reasonably adheres to the view that its policy, to the extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs, encourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among students.  Fourth, the policy incorporates state-law discrimination proscriptions, thereby conveying Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 decision to decline to subsidize conduct disapproved by the State.  So long as a public school does not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to advance state-law goals stands on firm footing.  Pp. 21\xe2\x80\x9324. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy is all the more creditworthy in light of the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial alternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student] communication to take place.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Perry Ed. Assn.</em> v. <em>Perry Local Educators\xe2\x80\x99 Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/index.html">460 U. S. 37</a>, 53.  Hastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct meetings and the use of chalkboards and certain bulletin boards to advertise events.  Although CLS could not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of communication, the advent of electronic media and social-networking sites lessens the importance of those channels.  Private groups, such as fraternities and sororities, commonly maintain a presence at universities without official school affiliation.  CLS was similarly situated: It hosted a variety of activities the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and the number of students attending those meetings and events doubled.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe variety and type of alternative modes of access present here,\xe2\x80\x9d in short, \xe2\x80\x9ccompare favorably with those in other [limited public] forum cases where [the Court has] upheld restrictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  Pp. 24\xe2\x80\x9325. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0CLS\xe2\x80\x99s arguments that the all-comers policy is not reasonable are unavailing.  CLS contends that there can be no diversity of viewpoints in a forum when groups are not permitted to form around viewpoints, but this argument confuses CLS\xe2\x80\x99s preferred policy with constitutional limitation\xe2\x80\x94the <em>advisability</em> of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy does not control its <em>permissibility</em>.  A State\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on access to a limited public forum, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cornelius</em>, 473 U. S., at 808.  CLS\xe2\x80\x99s contention that Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy will facilitate hostile takeovers of RSOs by student saboteurs bent on subverting a group\xe2\x80\x99s mission is more hypothetical than real; there is no history or prospect of RSO-hijackings at Hastings.  Cf. <em>National Endowment for Arts</em> v. <em>Finley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/569/index.html">524 U. S. 569</a>, 584.  Finally, CLS\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that Hastings lacks any legitimate interest in urging religious groups not to favor co-religionists erroneously focuses on the benefits the group must forgo, while ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out.  Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a group\xe2\x80\x99s desire to exclude and students\xe2\x80\x99 demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the sand permitting <em>all </em>organizations to express what they wish but <em>no </em>group to discriminate in membership.

Pp. 28\xe2\x80\x9331. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The policy draws no distinction between groups based on their message or perspective; its requirement that <em>all</em> student groups accept <em>all</em> comers is textbook viewpoint neutral.  Pp.\xc2\xa028\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Conceding that the policy is nominally neutral, CLS asserts that it systematically\xe2\x80\x94and impermissibly\xe2\x80\x94burdens most heavily those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus mainstream.  This argument fails because \xe2\x80\x9c[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ward</em> v. <em>Rock Against Racism</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/781/index.html">491 U. S. 781</a>, 791.  Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 requirement that RSOs accept all comers, the Court is satisfied, is \xe2\x80\x9cjustified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the regulated speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 791.  It targets the <em>act</em> of rejecting would-be group members without reference to the reasons motivating that behavior.

See <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a> (1995); <em>Widmar</em> v. <em>Vincent</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/index.html">454 U. S. 263</a> (1981); <em>Healy</em> v. <em>James</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/169/index.html">408 U. S. 169</a> (1972).  This case concerns a novel question regarding student activities at public universities: May a public law school condition its official recognition of a student group\xe2\x80\x94and the attendant use of school funds and facilities\xe2\x80\x94on the organization\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to open eligibility for membership and leadership to all students?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the view of petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS), an accept-all-comers policy impairs its First Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion by prompting it, on pain of relinquishing the advantages of recognition, to accept members who do not share the organization\xe2\x80\x99s core beliefs about religion and sexual orientation.  From the perspective of respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings or the Law School), CLS seeks special dispensation from an across-the-board open-access requirement designed to further the reasonable educational purposes underpinning the school\xe2\x80\x99s student-organization program.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject CLS\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment challenge.  Compliance with Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 all-comers policy, we conclude, is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the student-organization forum.  In requiring CLS\xe2\x80\x94in common with all other student organizations\xe2\x80\x94to choose between welcoming all students and forgoing the benefits of official recognition, we hold, Hastings did not transgress constitutional limitations.  CLS, it bears emphasis, seeks not parity with other organizations, but a preferential exemption from Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy.  The First Amendment shields CLS against state prohibition of the organization\xe2\x80\x99s expressive activity, however exclusionary that activity may be.  But CLS enjoys no constitutional right to state subvention of its selectivity.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Founded in 1878, Hastings was the first law school in the University of California public-school system.

At the beginning of the academic year, the leaders of a predecessor Christian organization\xe2\x80\x94which had been an RSO at Hastings for a decade\xe2\x80\x94formed CLS by affiliating with the national Christian Legal Society (CLS-National).  <em>Id.,</em> at 222\xe2\x80\x93223, 225.  CLS-National, an association of Christian lawyers and law students, charters student chapters at law schools throughout the country.  <em>Id.,</em> at 225.  CLS chapters must adopt bylaws that, <em>inter alia</em>, require members and officers to sign a \xe2\x80\x9cStatement of Faith\xe2\x80\x9d and to conduct their lives in accord with prescribed principles.  <em>Id.,</em> at 225\xe2\x80\x93226; App. to Pet. for Cert. 101a.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Among those tenets is the belief that sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man and a woman; CLS thus interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in \xe2\x80\x9cunrepentant homosexual conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 226.  CLS also excludes students who hold religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.  <em>Id.,</em> at 227.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On September 17, 2004, CLS submitted to Hastings an application for RSO status, accompanied by all required documents, including the set of bylaws mandated by CLS-National.  <em>Id.,</em> at 227\xe2\x80\x93228.  Several days later, the Law School rejected the application; CLS\xe2\x80\x99s bylaws, Hastings explained, did not comply with the Nondiscrimination Policy because CLS barred students based on religion and sexual orientation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 228.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CLS formally requested an exemption from the Nondiscrimination Policy, <em>id.,</em> at 281, but Hastings declined to grant one.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]o be one of our student-recognized organizations,\xe2\x80\x9d Hastings reiterated, \xe2\x80\x9cCLS must open its membership to all students irrespective of their religious beliefs or sexual orientation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 294.  If CLS instead chose to operate outside the RSO program, Hastings stated, the school \xe2\x80\x9cwould be pleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for its meetings and activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  CLS would also have access to chalkboards and generally available campus bulletin boards to announce its events.  <em>Id.,</em> at 219, 233.

It did, however, operate independently during the 2004\xe2\x80\x932005 academic year.  CLS held weekly Bible-study meetings and invited Hastings students to Good Friday and Easter Sunday church services.  <em>Id.,</em> at 229.  It also hosted a beach barbeque, Thanksgiving dinner, campus lecture on the Christian faith and the legal practice, several fellowship dinners, an end-of-year banquet, and other informal social activities.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 22, 2004, CLS filed suit against various Hastings officers and administrators under 42 U.

Its complaint alleged that Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to grant the organization RSO status violated CLS\xe2\x80\x99s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion.

First, in a progression of cases, this Court has employed forum analysis to determine when a governmental entity, in regulating property in its charge, may place limitations on speech.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Recognizing a State\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x9cto preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cornelius</em> v. <em>NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed.

S. 788</a>, 800 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court has permitted restrictions on access to a limited public forum, like the RSO program here, with this key caveat: Any access barrier must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Rosenberger</em>, 515 U.

In the context of public accommodations, we have subjected restrictions on that freedom to close scrutiny; such restrictions are permitted only if they serve \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling state interests\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9cunrelated to the suppression of ideas\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94interests that cannot be advanced \xe2\x80\x9cthrough \xe2\x80\xa6 significantly less restrictive [means].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Roberts</em> v. <em>United States Jaycees</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/609/index.html">468 U.

Insisting that an organization embrace unwelcome members, we have therefore concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly and immediately affects associational rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dale</em>, 530 U.

See Brief for Petitioner 35 (expressive association in this case is \xe2\x80\x9cthe functional equivalent of speech itself\xe2\x80\x9d).  It therefore makes little sense to treat CLS\xe2\x80\x99s speech and association claims as discrete.  See <em>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing</em> v. <em>Berkeley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/290/index.html">454 U. S. 290</a>, 300 (1981).  Instead, three observations lead us to conclude that our limited-public-forum precedents supply the appropriate framework for assessing both CLS\xe2\x80\x99s speech and association rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the same considerations that have led us to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums as compared to other environments, see <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, and n. 11,<em> </em>apply with equal force to expressive association occurring in limited public forums.  As just noted, speech and expressive-association rights are closely linked.  See <em>Roberts</em>, 468 U. S., at 622 (Associational freedom is \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d).  When these intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a restriction on speech to survive constitutional review under our limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of expressive association.  Accord Brief for State Universities and State University Systems as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  That result would be all the more anomalous in this case, for CLS suggests that its expressive-association claim plays a part auxiliary to speech\xe2\x80\x99s starring role.  See Brief for Petitioner 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, and closely related, the strict scrutiny we have applied in some settings to laws that burden expressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining characteristic of limited public forums\xe2\x80\x94the State may \xe2\x80\x9creserv[e] [them] for certain groups.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger</em>, 515 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, Volokh, Freedom of Expressive Association and Government Subsidies, 58 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1919, 1940 (2006).  The same ground rules must govern both speech and association challenges in the limited-public-forum context, lest strict scrutiny trump a public university\xe2\x80\x99s ability to \xe2\x80\x9cconfin[e] a [speech] forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger</em>, 515 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Dale</em>, 530 U. S., at 648 (regulation \xe2\x80\x9cforc[ed] [the Boy Scouts] to accept members it [did] not desire\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Roberts</em>, 468 U.

Application of the less-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition.  Cf. <em>Norwood</em> v. <em>Harrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/455/index.html">413 U.

We turn to the merits of the instant dispute, therefore, with the limited-public-forum decisions as our guide.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As earlier pointed out, <em>supra</em>, at 1, 12\xe2\x80\x9313, we do not write on a blank slate; we have three times before considered clashes between public universities and student groups seeking official recognition or its attendant benefits.  First, in <em>Healy</em>, a state college denied school affiliation to a student group that wished to form a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).  408 U. S., at 170.  Characterizing SDS\xe2\x80\x99s mission as violent and disruptive, and finding the organization\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy repugnant, the college completely banned the SDS chapter from campus; in its effort to sever all channels of communication between students and the group, university officials went so far as to disband a meeting of SDS members in a campus coffee shop.  <em>Id.,</em> at 174\xe2\x80\x93176.  The college, we noted, could require \xe2\x80\x9cthat a group seeking official recognition affirm in advance its willingness to adhere to reasonable campus law,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9creasonable standards respecting conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 193.  But a public educational institution exceeds constitutional bounds, we held, when it \xe2\x80\x9crestrict[s] speech or association simply because it finds the views expressed by [a] group to be abhorrent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 187\xe2\x80\x93188.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We later relied on <em>Healy </em>in <em>Widmar</em>.  In that case, a public university, in an effort to avoid state support for religion, had closed its facilities to a registered student group that sought to use university space for religious worship and discussion.  454 U. S., at 264\xe2\x80\x93265.  \xe2\x80\x9cA university\xe2\x80\x99s mission is education,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed, \xe2\x80\x9cand decisions of this Court have never denied a university\xe2\x80\x99s authority to impose reasonable regulations compatible with that mission upon the use of its campus and facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 268, n.\xc2\xa05.  But because the university singled out religious organizations for disadvantageous treatment, we subjected the university\xe2\x80\x99s regulation to strict scrutiny.  <em>Id., </em>at 269\xe2\x80\x93270.  The school\xe2\x80\x99s interest \xe2\x80\x9cin maintaining strict separation of church and State,\xe2\x80\x9d we held, was not \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently compelling to justify \xe2\x80\xa6 [viewpoint] discrimination against \xe2\x80\xa6 religious speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 270, 276 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most recently and comprehensively, in <em>Rosenberger</em>, we reiterated that a university generally may not withhold benefits from student groups because of their religious outlook.  The officially recognized student group in <em>Rosenberger</em> was denied student-activity-fee funding to distribute a newspaper because the publication discussed issues from a Christian perspective.  515 U. S., at 825\xe2\x80\x93827.  By \xe2\x80\x9cselect[ing] for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints,\xe2\x80\x9d we held, the university had engaged in \xe2\x80\x9cviewpoint discrimination, which is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum\xe2\x80\x99s limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 831, 830.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In all three cases, we ruled that student groups had been unconstitutionally singled out because of their points of view.  \xe2\x80\x9cOnce it has opened a limited [public] forum,\xe2\x80\x9d we emphasized, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 829.  The constitutional constraints on the boundaries the State may set bear repetition here: \xe2\x80\x9cThe State may not exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum, \xe2\x80\xa6 nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of \xe2\x80\xa6 viewpoint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

S., at 171, mindful that Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 decisions about the character of its student-group program are due decent respect.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With appropriate regard for school administrators\xe2\x80\x99 judgment, we review the justifications Hastings offers in defense of its all-comers requirement.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  First, the open-access policy \xe2\x80\x9censures that the leadership, educational, and social opportunities afforded by [RSOs] are available to all students.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Hastings 32; see Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 11.  Just as \xe2\x80\x9cHastings does not allow its professors to host classes open only to those students with a certain status or belief,\xe2\x80\x9d so the Law School may decide, reasonably in our view, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the \xe2\x80\xa6 educational experience is best promoted when all participants in the forum must provide equal access to all students.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Hastings 32.  RSOs,\nwe count it significant, are eligible for financial assist-\nance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees, see <em>supra</em>, at 3; the all-comers policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the all-comers requirement helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSO\xe2\x80\x99s motivation for membership restrictions.  To bring the RSO program within CLS\xe2\x80\x99s view of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s limits, CLS proposes that Hastings permit exclusion because of <em>belief</em> but forbid discrimination due to <em>status</em>.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18.  But that proposal would impose on Hastings a daunting labor.  How should the Law School go about determining whether a student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb?  If a hypothetical Male-Superiority Club barred a female student from running for its presidency, for example, how could the Law School tell whether the group rejected her bid because of her sex or because, by seeking to lead the club, she manifested a lack of belief in its fundamental philosophy?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case itself is instructive in this regard.  CLS contends that it does not exclude individuals because of sexual orientation, but rather \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of a conjunction of conduct and the belief that the conduct is not wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 35\xe2\x80\x9336 (emphasis deleted).  Our decisions have declined to distinguish between status and conduct in this context.  See <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/558/index.html">539 U. S. 558</a>, 575 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen homosexual <em>conduct</em> is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual <em>persons</em> to discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>id.,</em> at 583 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhile it is true that the law applies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that is closely correlated with being homosexual.

Assn.</em>, 460 U. S., at 53.  If restrictions on access to a limited public forum are viewpoint discriminatory, the ability of a group to exist outside the forum would not cure the constitutional shortcoming.  But when access barriers are viewpoint neutral, our decisions have counted it significant that other available avenues for the group to exercise its First Amendment rights lessen the burden created by those barriers.  See <em>ibid.</em>; <em>Cornelius</em>, 473 U. S., at 809; <em>Greer</em> v. <em>Spock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/index.html">424 U. S. 828</a>, 839 (1976); <em>Pell</em>, 417 U.

App. 232\xe2\x80\x93233.  Although CLS could not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of communication, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, the advent of electronic media and social-networking sites reduces the importance of those channels.  See App. 114\xe2\x80\x93115 (CLS maintained a Yahoo! message group to disseminate information to students.); <em>Christian Legal Society</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, 453 F.\xc2\xa03d 853, 874 (CA7 2006) (Wood, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cMost universities and colleges, and most college-aged students, communicate through email, websites, and hosts like MySpace\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

It is beyond dissenter\xe2\x80\x99s license, we note again, see <em>supra</em>, at 21, n.\xc2\xa017, constantly to maintain that nonrecognition of a student organization is equivalent to prohibiting its members from speaking.</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CLS nevertheless deems Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 all-comers policy \xe2\x80\x9cfrankly absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 49.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no diversity of viewpoints in a forum,\xe2\x80\x9d it asserts, \xe2\x80\x9cif groups are not permitted to form around viewpoints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 50; accord <em>post</em>, at 25 (Alito, J., dissenting).  This catchphrase confuses CLS\xe2\x80\x99s preferred policy with constitutional limitation\xe2\x80\x94the <em>advisability</em> of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy does not control its <em>permissibility</em>.  See <em>Wood</em> v. <em>Strickland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/308/index.html">420 U. S. 308</a>, 326 (1975).  Instead, we have repeatedly stressed that a State\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on access to a limited public forum \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cornelius</em>, 473 U.

This supposition strikes us as more hypothetical than real.  CLS points to no history or prospect of RSO-hijackings at Hastings.  Cf. <em>National Endowment for Arts</em> v. <em>Finley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/569/index.html">524 U. S. 569</a>, 584 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e are reluctant \xe2\x80\xa6 to invalidate legislation on the basis of its hypothetical application to situations not before the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Students tend to self-sort and presumably will not endeavor en masse to join\xe2\x80\x94let alone seek leadership positions in\xe2\x80\x94groups pursuing missions wholly at odds with their personal beliefs.  And if a rogue student intent on sabotaging an organization\xe2\x80\x99s objectives nevertheless attempted a takeover, the members of that group would not likely elect her as an officer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RSOs, moreover, in harmony with the all-comers policy, may condition eligibility for membership and leadership on attendance, the payment of dues, or other neutral requirements designed to ensure that students join because of their commitment to a group\xe2\x80\x99s vitality, not its demise.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4, n. 2.  Several RSOs at Hastings limit their membership rolls and officer slates in just this way.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> App. 192 (members must \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ay their dues on a timely basis\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cattend meetings regularly\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id., </em>at 173 (members must complete an application and pay dues; \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny active member who misses a semester of regularly scheduled meetings shall be dropped from rolls\xe2\x80\x9d); App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a (\xe2\x80\x9cOnly Hastings students who have held membership in this organization for a minimum of one semester shall be eligible to be an officer.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hastings, furthermore, could reasonably expect more from its law students than the disruptive behavior CLS hypothesizes\xe2\x80\x94and to build this expectation into its educational approach.  A reasonable policy need not anticipate and preemptively close off every opportunity for avoidance or manipulation.  If students begin to exploit an all-comers policy by hijacking organizations to distort or destroy their missions, Hastings presumably would revisit and revise its policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (counsel for Hastings); Brief for Hastings 38.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, CLS asserts (and the dissent repeats, <em>post</em>, at 29) that<em> </em>the Law School lacks any legitimate interest\xe2\x80\x94let alone one reasonably related to the RSO forum\xe2\x80\x99s purposes\xe2\x80\x94in urging \xe2\x80\x9creligious groups not to favor co-religionists for purposes of their religious activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 43; <em>id.</em>, at 50.  CLS\xe2\x80\x99s analytical error lies in focusing on the benefits it must forgo while ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out: Exclusion, after all, has two sides.  Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a group\xe2\x80\x99s desire to exclude and students\xe2\x80\x99 demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the sand permitting <em>all</em> organizations to express what they wish but <em>no</em> group to discriminate in membership.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We next consider whether Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although this aspect of limited-public-forum analysis has been the constitutional sticking point in our prior decisions, as earlier recounted, <em>supra</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9319, we need not dwell on it here.

I join its opinion without reservation.  Because the dissent has volunteered an argument that the school\xe2\x80\x99s general Nondiscrimination Policy would be \xe2\x80\x9cplainly\xe2\x80\x9d unconstitutional if applied to this case, <em>post</em>, at 18 (opinion of Alito, J.), a brief response\nis appropriate.  In my view, both policies are plainly\nlegitimate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Hastings College of Law\xe2\x80\x99s (Hastings) Nondiscrimination Policy contains boilerplate language used by institutions and workplaces across the country: It prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfu[l]\xe2\x80\x9d discrimination \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 220.  Petitioner, the Hastings chapter of the Christian Legal Society (CLS), refused to comply.  As the Court explains, <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, CLS was unwilling to admit members unless they affirmed their belief in certain Christian doctrines and refrained from \xe2\x80\x9cparticipation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 146.  CLS, in short, wanted to receive the school\xe2\x80\x99s formal recognition\xe2\x80\x94and the benefits that attend formal recognition\xe2\x80\x94while continuing to exclude gay and non-Christian students (as well as, it seems, students who advocate for gay rights).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, by refusing to grant CLS an exemption from the Nondiscrimination Policy, Hastings violated CLS\xe2\x80\x99s rights, for by proscribing unlawful discrimination on the basis of religion, the policy discriminates unlawfully on the basis of religion.  There are numerous reasons why this counterintuitive theory is unsound.  Although the First Amendment may protect CLS\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory practices off campus, it does not require a public university to validate or support them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As written, the Nondiscrimination Policy is content and viewpoint neutral.  It does not reflect a judgment by school officials about the substance of any student group\xe2\x80\x99s speech.  Nor does it exclude any would-be groups on the basis of their convictions.  Indeed, it does not regulate expression or belief at all.  The policy is \xe2\x80\x9cdirected at the organization\xe2\x80\x99s activities rather than its philosophy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Healy</em> v. <em>James</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/169/index.html">408 U. S. 169</a>, 188 (1972).  Those who hold religious beliefs are not \xe2\x80\x9csingled out,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 19 (Alito, J., dissenting); those who engage in discriminatory <em>conduct</em> based on someone else\xe2\x80\x99s religious status and belief are singled out.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Regardless of whether they are the product of secular or spiritual feeling, hateful or benign motives, all acts of religious discrimination are equally covered.  The discriminator\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs are simply irrelevant.  There is, moreover, no evidence that the policy was adopted because of any reason related to the particular views that religious individuals or groups might have, much less because of a desire to suppress or distort those views.  The policy\xe2\x80\x99s religion clause was plainly meant to promote, not to undermine, religious freedom.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the policy may end up having greater consequence for religious groups\xe2\x80\x94whether and to what extent it will is far from clear <em>ex ante</em>\xe2\x80\x94inasmuch as they are more likely than their secular counterparts to wish to exclude students of particular faiths.  But there is likewise no evidence that the policy was intended to cause harm to religious groups, or that it has in practice caused significant harm to their operations.  And it is a basic tenet of First Amendment law that disparate impact does not, in itself, constitute viewpoint discrimination.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The dissent has thus given no reason to be skeptical of the basic\ndesign, function, or rationale of the Nondiscrimination Policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What the policy does reflect is a judgment that discrimination by school officials or organizations on the basis of certain factors, such as race and religion, is less tolerable than discrimination on the basis of other factors.  This approach may or may not be the wisest choice in the context of a Registered Student Organization (RSO) program.  But it is at least a reasonable choice.  Academic administrators routinely employ antidiscrimination rules to promote tolerance, understanding, and respect, and to safeguard students from invidious forms of discrimination, including sexual orientation discrimination.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Applied to the RSO context, these values can, in turn, advance numerous pedagogical objectives.  See <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is critical, in evaluating CLS\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the Nondiscrimination Policy, to keep in mind that an RSO program is a <em>limited </em>forum\xe2\x80\x94the boundaries of which may be <em>delimited </em>by the proprietor.  When a religious association, or a secular association, operates in a wholly public setting, it must be allowed broad freedom to control its membership and its message, even if its decisions cause offense to outsiders.  Profound constitutional problems would arise if the State of California tried to \xe2\x80\x9cdemand that all Christian groups admit members who believe that Jesus was merely human.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 27 (Alito, J., dissenting).  But the CLS chapter that brought this lawsuit does not want to be just a Christian group; it aspires to be a recognized student organization.  The Hastings College of Law is not a legislature.  And no state actor has demanded that anyone do anything outside the confines of a discrete, voluntary academic program.  Although it may be the case that to some \xe2\x80\x9cuniversity students, the campus is their world,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), it does not follow that the campus ought to be equated with the public square.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The campus is, in fact, a world apart from the public square in numerous respects, and religious organizations, as well as all other organizations, must abide by certain norms of conduct when they enter an academic community.  Public universities serve a distinctive role in a modern democratic society.  Like all specialized government entities, they must make countless decisions about how to allocate resources in pursuit of their role.  Some of those decisions will be controversial; many will have differential effects across populations; virtually all will entail value judgments of some kind.  As a general matter, courts should respect universities\xe2\x80\x99 judgments and let them manage their own affairs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The RSO forum is no different.  It is not an open commons that Hastings happens to maintain.  It is a mechanism through which Hastings confers certain benefits and pursues certain aspects of its educational mission.  Having exercised its discretion to establish an RSO program, a university must treat all participants evenhandedly.  But the university need not remain neutral\xe2\x80\x94indeed it could not remain neutral\xe2\x80\x94in determining which goals the program will serve and which rules are best suited to facilitate those goals.  These are not legal questions but policy questions; they are not for the Court but for the university to make.  When any given group refuses to comply with the rules, the RSO sponsor need not admit that group at the cost of undermining the program and the values reflected therein.  On many levels, a university administrator has a \xe2\x80\x9cgreater interest in the content of student activities than the police chief has in the content of a soapbox oration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Widmar</em> v. <em>Vincent</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/index.html">454 U. S. 263</a>, 280 (1981) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, petitioner excludes students who will not sign its Statement of Faith or who engage in \xe2\x80\x9cunrepentant homosexual conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 226.  The expressive association argument it presses, however, is hardly limited to these facts.  Other groups may exclude or mistreat Jews, blacks, and women\xe2\x80\x94or those who do not share their contempt for Jews, blacks, and women.  A free society must tolerate such groups.  It need not subsidize them, give them its official imprimatur, or grant them equal access to law school facilities.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent appears to accept that Hastings may prohibit discrimination on the basis of religious <em>status</em>, though it rejects the notion that Hastings may do the same for religious <em>belief</em>.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>post</em>, at 22, n.\xc2\xa05, 28.  If CLS sought to exclude a Muslim student in virtue of the fact that he \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x9d Muslim, the dissent suggests, there would be no problem in Hastings forbidding that.  But if CLS sought to exclude the same student in virtue of the fact that he subscribes to the Muslim faith, Hastings must stand idly by.  This proposition is not only unworkable in practice but also flawed in conception.  A person\xe2\x80\x99s religion often simultaneously constitutes or informs a status, an identity, a set of beliefs and practices, and much else besides.  (So does sexual orientation for that matter, see <em>ante</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323, notwithstanding the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view that a rule excluding those who engage in \xe2\x80\x9cunrepentant homosexual conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 226, does not discriminate on the basis of status or identity, <em>post</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.)  Our First Amendment doctrine has never required university administrators to undertake the impossible task of separating out belief-based from status-based religious discrimination.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Madsen</em> v. <em>Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health Center, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/753/index.html">512 U.

S. 169</a>, 187\xe2\x80\x93188 (1972).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a> (1995), the essential purpose of the limited forum was to facilitate the expression of differing views in the context of student publications.  The forum was limited because it was confined: first, to student-run groups; and second, to publications.  The forum was created in the long tradition of using newspapers and other publications to express differing views and also in the honored tradition of a university setting that stimulates the free exchange of ideas.  See <em>id.,</em> at 835 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the University setting, \xe2\x80\xa6 the State acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition\xe2\x80\x9d).  These considerations supported the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that, under the First Amendment, a limited forum for student-run publications did not permit the exclusion of a paper for the reason that it was devoted to expressing religious views.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Rosenberger</em> is distinguishable from the instant case in various respects.  Not least is that here the school policy in question is not content based either in its formulation or evident purpose; and were it shown to be otherwise, the case likely should have a different outcome.  Here, the policy applies equally to all groups and views.  And, given the stipulation of the parties, there is no basis for an allegation that the design or purpose of the rule was, by subterfuge, to discriminate based on viewpoint.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An objection might be that the all-comers policy, even if not so designed or intended, in fact makes it difficult for certain groups to express their views in a manner essential to their message.  A group that can limit membership to those who agree in full with its aims and purposes may be more effective in delivering its message or furthering its expressive objectives; and the Court has recognized that this interest can be protected against governmental interference or regulation.  See <em>Boy Scouts of America</em> v. <em>Dale</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/640/index.html">530 U. S. 640</a> (2000).  By allowing like-minded students to form groups around shared identities, a school creates room for self-expression and personal development.  See <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System</em> v. <em>Southworth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/217/index.html">529 U. S. 217</a>, 229 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe University\xe2\x80\x99s whole justification for [its student activity program] is that it springs from the initiative of the students, who alone give it purpose and content in the course of their extracurricular endeavors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the instant case, however, if the membership qualification were enforced, it would contradict a legitimate purpose for having created the limited forum in the first place.  Many educational institutions, including respondent Hastings College of Law, have recognized that the process of learning occurs both formally in a classroom setting and informally outside of it.  See <em>id.,</em> at 233.  Students may be shaped as profoundly by their peers as by their teachers.  Extracurricular activities, such as those in the Hastings \xe2\x80\x9cRegistered Student Organization\xe2\x80\x9d program, facilitate interactions between students, enabling them to explore new points of view, to develop interests and talents, and to nurture a growing sense of self.  See <em>Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty.</em> v. <em>Earls</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/822/index.html">536 U. S. 822</a>, 831, n.\xc2\xa04 (2002) (participation in extracurricular activities is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a significant contributor to the breadth and quality of the educational experience\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Hasting program is designed to allow all students to interact with their colleagues across a broad, seemingly unlimited range of ideas, views, and activities.  See <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</em> v. <em>Bakke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/265/index.html">438 U. S. 265</a>, 312, 313, n.\xc2\xa048 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] great deal of learning \xe2\x80\xa6 occurs through interactions among students \xe2\x80\xa6 who have a wide variety of interests, talents, and perspectives; and who are able, directly or indirectly, to learn from their differences and to stimulate one another to reexamine even their most deeply held assumptions about themselves and their world\xe2\x80\x9d (alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Law students come from many backgrounds and have but three years to meet each other and develop their skills.  They do so by participating in a community that teaches them how to create arguments in a convincing, rational, and respectful manner and to express doubt and disagreement in a professional way.  A law school furthers these objectives by allowing broad diversity in registered student organizations.  But these objectives may be better achieved if students can act cooperatively to learn from and teach each other through interactions in social and intellectual contexts.  A vibrant dialogue is not possible if students wall themselves off from opposing points of view.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The school\xe2\x80\x99s objectives thus might not be well served if, as a condition to membership or participation in a group, students were required to avow particular personal beliefs or to disclose private, off-campus behavior.  Students whose views are in the minority at the school would likely fare worse in that regime.  Indeed, were those sorts of requirements to become prevalent, it might undermine the principle that in a university community\xe2\x80\x94and in a law school community specifically\xe2\x80\x94speech is deemed persuasive based on its substance, not the identity of the speaker.  The era of loyalty oaths is behind us.  A school quite properly may conclude that allowing an oath or belief-affirming requirement, or an outside conduct requirement, could be divisive for student relations and inconsistent with the basic concept that a view\xe2\x80\x99s validity should be tested through free and open discussion.  The school\xe2\x80\x99s policy therefore represents a permissible effort to preserve the value of its forum.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to a circumstance, already noted, in which it could be demonstrated that a school has adopted or enforced its policy with the intent or purpose of discriminating or disadvantaging a group on account of its views, petitioner also would have a substantial case on the merits if it were shown that the all-comers policy was either designed or used to infiltrate the group or challenge its leadership in order to stifle its views.  But that has not been shown to be so likely or self-evident as a matter of group dynamics in this setting that the Court can declare the school policy void without more facts; and if there were a showing that in a particular case the purpose or effect of the policy was to stifle speech or make it ineffective, that, too, would present a case different from the one before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These observations are offered to support the analysis set forth in the opinion of the Court, which I join.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963353">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nCHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

S. 644</a>, 654\xe2\x80\x93655 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision rests on a very different principle: no freedom for expression that offends prevailing standards of political correctness in our country\xe2\x80\x99s institutions of higher learning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Hastings College of the Law, a state institution, permits student organizations to register with the law school and severely burdens speech by unregistered groups.  Hastings currently has more than 60 registered groups and, in all its history, has denied registration to exactly one: the Christian Legal Society (CLS).  CLS claims that Hastings refused to register the group because the law school administration disapproves of the group\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint and thus violated the group\xe2\x80\x99s free speech rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rejecting this argument, the Court finds that it has been Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy for 20 years that all registered organizations must admit <em>any</em> student who wishes to join.  Deferring broadly to the law school\xe2\x80\x99s judgment about the permissible limits of student debate, the Court concludes that this \xe2\x80\x9caccept-all-comers\xe2\x80\x9d policy, <em>ante</em>, at 1, is both viewpoint-neutral and consistent with Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 proclaimed policy of fostering a diversity of viewpoints among registered student groups.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of this case is deeply disappointing.  The Court does not address the constitutionality of the very different policy that Hastings invoked when it denied CLS\xe2\x80\x99s application for registration.  Nor does the Court address the constitutionality of the policy that Hastings now purports to follow.  And the Court ignores strong evidence that the accept-all-comers policy is not viewpoint neutral because it was announced as a pretext to justify viewpoint discrimination.  Brushing aside inconvenient precedent, the Court arms public educational institutions with a handy weapon for suppressing the speech of unpopular groups\xe2\x80\x94groups to which, as Hastings candidly puts it, these institutions \xe2\x80\x9cdo not wish to \xe2\x80\xa6 lend their name[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Hastings College of Law 11; see also <em>id.</em>, at 35.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court provides a misleading portrayal of this case.  As related by the Court, (1) Hastings, for the past 20 years, has required any student group seeking registration to admit any student who wishes to join, <em>ante</em>, at 5; (2) the effects of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to register CLS have been of questionable importance, see <em>ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325; and (3) this case is about CLS\xe2\x80\x99s desire to obtain \xe2\x80\x9ca state subsidy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15.  I begin by correcting the picture.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court bases all of its analysis on the proposition that the relevant Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy is the so-called accept-all-comers policy.  This frees the Court from the difficult task of defending the constitutionality of either the policy that Hastings actually\xe2\x80\x94and repeatedly\xe2\x80\x94invoked when it denied registration, <em>i.e.</em>, the school\xe2\x80\x99s written Nondiscrimination Policy, or the policy that Hastings belatedly unveiled when it filed its brief in this Court.  Overwhelming evidence, however, shows that Hastings denied CLS\xe2\x80\x99s application pursuant to the Nondiscrimination Policy and that the accept-all-comers policy was nowhere to be found until it was mentioned by a former dean in a deposition taken well after this case began.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The events that gave rise to this litigation began in 2004, when a small group of Hastings students sought to register a Hastings chapter of CLS, a national organization of Christian lawyers and law students.  All CLS members must sign a Statement of Faith affirming belief in fundamental Christian doctrines, including the belief that the Bible is \xe2\x80\x9cthe inspired Word of God.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 226.  In early 2004, the national organization adopted a resolution stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n view of the clear dictates of Scripture, unrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle is inconsistent with an affirmation of the Statement of Faith, and consequently may be regarded by CLS as disqualifying such an individual from CLS membership.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 146.  The resolution made it clear that \xe2\x80\x9ca sexually immoral lifestyle,\xe2\x80\x9d in CLS\xe2\x80\x99s view, includes engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cacts of sexual conduct outside of God\xe2\x80\x99s design for marriage between one man and one woman.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  It was shortly after this resolution was passed that the Hastings chapter of CLS applied to register with the law school.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hastings sponsors an active program of \xe2\x80\x9cregistered student organizations\xe2\x80\x9d (RSOs) pursuant to the law school\xe2\x80\x99s avowed responsibility to \xe2\x80\x9censure an opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints\xe2\x80\x9d and promote \xe2\x80\x9cthe highest standards of . . . freedom of expression,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a, 74a.  During the 2004\xe2\x80\x932005 school year, Hastings had more than 60 registered groups, including political groups (<em>e.g.</em>, the Hastings Democratic Caucus and the Hastings Republicans), religious groups (<em>e.g.</em>, the Hastings Jewish Law Students Association and the Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students), groups that promote social causes (<em>e.g.</em>, both pro-choice and pro-life groups), groups organized around racial or ethnic identity (<em>e.g.</em>, the Black Law Students Association, the Korean American Law Society, La Raza Law Students Association, and the Middle Eastern Law Students Association), and groups that focus on gender or sexuality (<em>e.g.</em>, the Clara Foltz Feminist Association and Students Raising Consciousness at Hastings).  See App. 236\xe2\x80\x93245; Brief for Petitioner 3\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not surprisingly many of these registered groups were and are dedicated to expressing a message.  For example, Silenced Right, a pro-life group, taught that \xe2\x80\x9call human life from the moment of conception until natural death is sacred and has inherent dignity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 244, while Law Students for Choice aimed to \xe2\x80\x9cdefend and expand reproductive rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 243.  The American Constitution Society sought \xe2\x80\x9cto counter . . . a narrow conservative vision\xe2\x80\x9d of American law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 236, and the UC Hastings Student Animal Defense Fund aimed \xe2\x80\x9cat protecting the lives and advancing the interests of animals through the legal system,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 245.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Groups that are granted registration are entitled to meet on university grounds and to access multiple channels for communicating with students and faculty\xe2\x80\x94including posting messages on designated bulletin boards, sending mass e-mails to the student body, distributing material through the Student Information Center, and participating in the annual student organizations fair.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a, 85a.  They may also apply for limited travel funds, <em>id</em>., at 7a, which appear to total about $4,000 to $5,000 per year, App. 217\xe2\x80\x94or less than $85 per registered group.  Most of the funds available to RSOs come from an annual student activity fee that every student must pay.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a\xe2\x80\x9393a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When CLS applied for registration, Judy Hansen Chapman, the Director of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 Office of Student Services, sent an e-mail to an officer of the chapter informing him that \xe2\x80\x9cCLS\xe2\x80\x99s bylaws did not appear to be compliant\xe2\x80\x9d with the Hastings Nondiscrimination Policy, App. 228, 277, a written policy that provides in pertinent part that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he University of California, Hastings College of the Law shall not discriminate unlawfully on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 220.  As far as the record reflects, Ms. Chapman made no mention of an accept-all-applicants policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few days later, three officers of the chapter met with Ms. Chapman, and she reiterated that the CLS bylaws did not comply with \xe2\x80\x9cthe religion and sexual orientation provisions of the Nondiscrimination Policy and that they would need to be amended in order for CLS to become a registered student organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 228.  About a week later, Hastings sent CLS a letter to the same effect.  <em>Id.</em>, at 228\xe2\x80\x93229, 293\xe2\x80\x93295.  On both of these occasions, it appears that not a word was said about an accept-all-comers\npolicy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When CLS refused to change its membership requirements, Hastings denied its request for registration\xe2\x80\x94thus making CLS the only student group whose application for registration has ever been rejected.  Brief in Opposition 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In October 2004, CLS brought this action under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 against the law school\xe2\x80\x99s dean and other school officials, claiming, among other things, that the law school, by enacting and enforcing the Nondiscrimination Policy, had violated CLS\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment right to freedom of speech.  App. 78.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 2005, Hastings filed an answer to CLS\xe2\x80\x99s first amended complaint and made an admission that is significant for present purposes.  In its complaint, CLS had alleged that the Nondiscrimination Policy discriminates against religious groups because it prohibits those groups \xe2\x80\x9cfrom selecting officers and members dedicated to a particular set of religious ideals or beliefs\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cpermits political, social and cultural student organizations to select officers and members dedicated to their organization\xe2\x80\x99s ideals and beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 79.  In response, Hastings admitted that its Nondiscrimination Policy \xe2\x80\x9cpermits political, social, and cultural student organizations to select officers and members who are dedicated to a particular set of ideals or beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 93.  The Court states that \xe2\x80\x9cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  But this admission in Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 answer shows that Hastings had not adopted this interpretation when its answer was filed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Within a few months, however, Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 position changed.  In July 2005, Mary Kay Kane, then the dean of the law school, was deposed, and she stated: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my view that in order to be a registered student organization you have to allow all of our students to be members and full participants if they want to.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 343.  In a declaration filed in October 2005, Ms. Chapman provided a more developed explanation, stating: \xe2\x80\x9cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy as requiring that student organizations wishing to register with Hastings allow any Hastings student to become a member and/or seek a leadership position in the organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 349.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hastings claims that this accept-all-comers policy has existed since 1990 but points to no evidence that the policy was ever put in writing or brought to the attention of members of the law school community prior to the dean\xe2\x80\x99s deposition.  Indeed, Hastings has adduced no evidence of the policy\xe2\x80\x99s existence before that date.  And while Dean Kane and Ms. Chapman stated, well after this litigation had begun, that Hastings had such a policy, neither they nor any other Hastings official has ever stated in a deposition, affidavit, or declaration when this policy took effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 effort to portray the accept-all-comers policy as merely an interpretation of the Nondiscrimination Policy runs into obvious difficulties.  First, the two policies are simply not the same: The Nondiscrimination Policy proscribes discrimination on a limited number of specified grounds, while the accept-all-comers policy outlaws all selectivity.  Second, the Nondiscrimination Policy applies to everything that Hastings does, and the law school does not follow an accept-all-comers policy in activities such as admitting students and hiring faculty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an effort to circumvent this problem, the Court writes that \xe2\x80\x9cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, <em>as it relates to the RSO program</em>, to mandate acceptance of all comers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (emphasis added).  This puts Hastings in the implausible position of maintaining that the Nondiscrimination Policy means one thing as applied to the RSO program and something quite different as applied to all of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 other activities.  But the Nondiscrimination Policy by its terms applies fully to all components of the law school, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding administration [and] faculty.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 220.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the record is replete with evidence that, at least until Dean Kane unveiled the accept-all-comers policy in July 2005, Hastings routinely registered student groups with bylaws limiting membership and leadership positions to those who agreed with the groups\xe2\x80\x99 viewpoints.  For example, the bylaws of the Hastings Democratic Caucus provided that \xe2\x80\x9cany full-time student at Hastings may become a member of HDC <em>so long as they do not exhibit a consistent disregard and lack of respect for the objective of the organization </em>as stated in Article 3, Section 1.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a (emphasis added).  The constitution of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America at Hastings provided that every member must \xe2\x80\x9cadhere to the objectives of the Student Chapter as well as the mission of ATLA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 110a.  A student could become a member of the Vietnamese American Law Society so long as the student did not \xe2\x80\x9cexhibit a consistent disregard and lack of respect for the objective of the organization,\xe2\x80\x9d which centers on a \xe2\x80\x9ccelebrat[ion] [of] Vietnamese culture.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 146a\xe2\x80\x93147a.  Silenced Right limited voting membership to students who \xe2\x80\x9care committed\xe2\x80\x9d to the group\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmission\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cspread[ing] the pro-life message.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 142a\xe2\x80\x93143a.  La Raza limited voting membership to \xe2\x80\x9cstudents of Raza background.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 192.  Since Hastings requires any student group applying for registration to submit a copy of its bylaws, see <em>id.</em>, at 249\xe2\x80\x93250, Hastings cannot claim that it was unaware of such provisions.  And as noted, CLS was denied registration precisely because Ms. Chapman reviewed its bylaws and found them unacceptable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are told that, when CLS pointed out these discrepancies during this litigation, Hastings took action to ensure that student groups were in fact complying with the law school\xe2\x80\x99s newly disclosed accept-all-comers policy.  For example, Hastings asked La Raza to revise its bylaws to allow all students to become voting members.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.  See also Brief for State of Michigan et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 2, n.\xc2\xa01 (relating anecdotally that Hastings recently notified the Hastings Democrats that \xe2\x80\x9cto maintain the Club\xe2\x80\x99s standing as a student organization,\xe2\x80\x9d it must \xe2\x80\x9copen its membership to all students, regardless of party affiliation\xe2\x80\x9d).  These belated remedial efforts suggest, if anything, that Hastings had no accept-all-comers policy until this litigation was well under way.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, when Hastings filed its brief in this Court, its policy, which had already evolved from a policy prohibiting certain specified forms of discrimination into an accept-all-comers policy, underwent yet another transformation.  Now, Hastings claims that it does not really have an accept-all-comers policy; it has an accept-<em>some</em>-comers policy.  Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 current policy, we are told, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not foreclose neutral and generally applicable membership requirements unrelated to \xe2\x80\x98status or beliefs.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Hastings College of Law 5.  Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 brief goes on to note with seeming approval that some registered groups have imposed \xe2\x80\x9ceven conduct requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Hastings, however, has not told us which \xe2\x80\x9cconduct requirements\xe2\x80\x9d are allowed and which are not\xe2\x80\x94although presumably requirements regarding sexual conduct fall into the latter category.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When this case was in the District Court, that court took care to address both the Nondiscrimination Policy and the accept-all-comers policy.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a\xe2\x80\x939a, 16a\xe2\x80\x9317a, 21a\xe2\x80\x9324a, 26a, 27a, 32a, 44a, 63a.  On appeal, however, a panel of the Ninth Circuit, like the Court today, totally ignored the Nondiscrimination Policy.  CLS\xe2\x80\x99s argument in the Ninth Circuit centered on the Nondiscrimination Policy, and CLS argued strenuously, as it had in the District Court, that prior to the former dean\xe2\x80\x99s deposition, numerous groups had been permitted to restrict membership to students who shared the groups\xe2\x80\x99 views.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit disposed of CLS\xe2\x80\x99s appeal with a two-sentence, not-precedential opinion that solely addressed the accept-all-comers policy.  <em>Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal.</em> v. <em>Kane</em>, 319 Fed. Appx. 645\xe2\x80\x93646 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the majority of this Court, the Ninth Circuit relied on the following Joint Stipulation, which the parties filed in December 2005, well after Dean Kane\xe2\x80\x99s deposition:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cHastings requires that registered student organizations allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions in the organization, regardless of their status or beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 221.</p>\n<p align="left">\nCiting the binding effect of stipulations, the majority sternly rejects what it terms \xe2\x80\x9cCLS\xe2\x80\x99s unseemly attempt to escape from the stipulation and shift its target to [the Nondiscrimination Policy].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree that the parties must be held to their Joint Stipulation, but the terms of the stipulation should be respected.  What was admitted in the Joint Stipulation filed in December 2005 is that Hastings had an accept-all-comers policy.  CLS did not stipulate that its application had been denied more than a year earlier pursuant to such a policy.  On the contrary, the Joint Stipulation notes that the reason repeatedly given by Hasting at that time was that the CLS bylaws did not comply with <em>the Nondiscrimination Policy</em>.  See App. 228\xe2\x80\x93229.  Indeed, the parties did not even stipulate that the accept-all-comers policy existed in the fall of 2004.  In addition, Hastings itself is now attempting to walk away from this stipulation by disclosing that its real policy is an accept-some-comers policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on the binding effect of stipulations contrasts sharply with its failure to recognize the binding effect of a party\xe2\x80\x99s admissions in an answer.  See <em>American Title Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Lacelaw Corp.</em>, 861 F.\xc2\xa02d 224, 226 (CA9 1988) (\xe2\x80\x9cFactual assertions in pleadings and pretrial orders, unless amended, are considered judicial admissions conclusively binding on the party who made them\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Bakersfield Westar Ambulance, Inc.</em> v. <em>Community First Bank</em>, 123 F.\xc2\xa03d 1243, 1248 (CA9 1997) (quoting <em>Lacelaw</em>, <em>supra</em>).  As noted above, Hastings admitted in its answer, which was filed prior to the former dean\xe2\x80\x99s deposition, that at least as of that time, the law school did not follow an accept-all-comers policy and instead allowed \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical, social, and cultural student organizations to select officers and members who are dedicated to a particular set of ideals or beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 93.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also distorts the record with respect to the effect on CLS of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 decision to deny registration.  The Court quotes a letter written by Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 general counsel in which she stated that Hastings \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would be pleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for its meetings and activities.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (quoting App. 294).  Later in its opinion, the Court reiterates that \xe2\x80\x9cHastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct meetings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 24, but the majority does not mention that this offer was subject to important qualifications.  As Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 attorney put it in the District Court, Hastings told CLS: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Hastings allows community groups to some degree to use its facilities, sometimes on a pay basis, I understand, if they\xe2\x80\x99re available after priority is given to registered organizations\xe2\x80\x99.  We offered that.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 442.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also fails to mention what happened when CLS attempted to take advantage of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 offer.  On August 19, 2005, the local CLS president sent an e-mail to Ms. Chapman requesting permission to set up an \xe2\x80\x9cadvice table\xe2\x80\x9d on a campus patio on August 23 and 24 so that members of CLS could speak with students at the beginning of the fall semester.  <em>Id.</em>, at 298.  This request\xe2\x80\x94merely to set up a table on a patio\xe2\x80\x94could hardly have interfered with any other use of the law school\xe2\x80\x99s premises or cost the school any money.  But although the request was labeled \xe2\x80\x9ctime sensitive,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, Ms. Chapman did not respond until the dates in question had passed, and she then advised the student that all further inquiries should be made through CLS\xe2\x80\x99s attorney.  <em>Id.</em>, at 297\xe2\x80\x93298.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September 2005, CLS tried again.  Through counsel, CLS sought to reserve a room on campus for a guest speaker who was scheduled to appear on a specified date.  <em>Id.</em>, at 302\xe2\x80\x93303.  Noting Ms. Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s tardy response on the prior occasion, the attorney asked to receive a response before the scheduled date, but once again no answer was given until after the date had passed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 300.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other statements in the majority opinion make it seem as if the denial of registration did not hurt CLS at all.  The Court notes that CLS was able to hold Bible-study meetings and other events.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough CLS could not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of communication,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court states, \xe2\x80\x9cthe advent of electronic media and social-networking sites reduces the importance of those channels.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the beginning of the 2005 school year, the Hastings CLS group had seven members, App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a, so there can be no suggestion that the group flourished.  And since one of CLS\xe2\x80\x99s principal claims is that it was subjected to discrimination based on its viewpoint, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on CLS\xe2\x80\x99s ability to endure that discrimination\xe2\x80\x94by using private facilities and means of communication\xe2\x80\x94is quite amazing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court does not customarily brush aside a claim of unlawful discrimination with the observation that the effects of the discrimination were really not so bad.  We have never before taken the view that a little viewpoint discrimination is acceptable.  Nor have we taken this approach in other discrimination cases.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I must comment on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on funding.  According to the majority, CLS is \xe2\x80\x9cseeking what is effectively a state subsidy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15, and the question presented in this case centers on the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of school funds,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1.  In fact, funding plays a very small role in this case.  Most of what CLS sought and was denied\xe2\x80\x94such as permission to set up a table on the law school patio\xe2\x80\x94would have been virtually cost free.  If every such activity is regarded as a matter of funding, the First Amendment rights of students at public universities will be at the mercy of the administration.  As CLS notes, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o university students, the campus is their world.  The right to meet on campus and use campus channels of communication is at least as important to university students as the right to gather on the town square and use local communication forums is to the citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 13.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To appreciate how far the Court has strayed, it is instructive to compare this case with <em>Healy</em> v. <em>James</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/169/index.html">408 U. S. 169</a> (1972), our only First Amendment precedent involving a public college\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to recognize a student group.  The group in <em>Healy</em> was a local chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).  When the students who applied for recognition of the chapter were asked by a college committee whether they would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98respond to issues of violence as other S.D.S. chapters have,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d their answer was that their \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98action would have to be dependent upon each issue.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 172\xe2\x80\x93173.  They similarly refused to provide a definitive answer when asked whether they would be willing to \xe2\x80\x9cuse any means possible\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve their aims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 173.  The president of the college refused to allow the group to be recognized, concluding that the philosophy of the SDS was \xe2\x80\x9cantithetical to the school\xe2\x80\x99s policies\xe2\x80\x9d and that it was doubtful that the local chapter was independent of the national organization, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98published aims and philosophy\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of which included \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98disruption and violence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 174\xe2\x80\x93175, and n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The effects of nonrecognition in <em>Healy</em> were largely the same as those present here.  The SDS was denied the use of campus facilities, as well as access to the customary means used for communication among the members of the college community.  <em>Id.</em>, at 176, 181\xe2\x80\x93182.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lower federal courts held that the First Amendment rights of the SDS chapter had not been violated, and when the case reached this Court, the college, much like today\xe2\x80\x99s majority, sought to minimize the effects of nonrecognition, arguing that the SDS members \xe2\x80\x9cstill may meet as a group off campus, that they still may distribute written material off campus, and that they still may meet together informally on campus \xe2\x80\xa6 as individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 182\xe2\x80\x93183.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court took a different view.  The Court held that the denial of recognition substantially burdened the students\xe2\x80\x99 right to freedom of association.  After observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he primary impediment to free association flowing from nonrecognition is the denial of use of campus facilities for meetings and other appropriate purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 181, the Court continued:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPetitioners\xe2\x80\x99 associational interests also were circumscribed by the denial of the use of campus bulletin boards and the school newspaper.  If an organization is to remain a viable entity in a campus community in which new students enter on a regular basis, it must possess the means of communicating with these students.  Moreover, the organization\xe2\x80\x99s ability to participate in the intellectual give and take of campus debate, and to pursue its stated purposes, is limited by denial of access to the customary media for communicating with the administration, faculty members, and other students.  Such impediments cannot be viewed as insubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 181\xe2\x80\x93182.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is striking that all of these same burdens are now borne by CLS.  CLS is prevented from using campus facilities\xe2\x80\x94unless at some future time Hastings chooses to provide a timely response to a CLS request and allow the group, as a favor or perhaps in exchange for a fee, to set up a table on the patio or to use a room that would otherwise be unoccupied.  And CLS, like the SDS in <em>Healy</em>, has been cut off from \xe2\x80\x9cthe customary media for communicating with the administration, faculty members, and other students.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 181\xe2\x80\x93182.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also telling that the <em>Healy</em> Court, unlike today\xe2\x80\x99s majority, refused to defer to the college president\xe2\x80\x99s judgment regarding the compatibility of \xe2\x80\x9csound educational policy\xe2\x80\x9d and free speech rights.  The same deference arguments that the majority now accepts were made in defense of the college president\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny recognition in <em>Healy</em>.  Respondents in that case emphasized that the college president, not the courts, had the responsibility of administering the institution and that the courts should allow him \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wide discretion \xe2\x80\xa6 in determining what actions are most compatible with its educational objectives.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents in <em>Healy</em> v. <em>James</em>, O. T. 1971, No. 71\xe2\x80\x93452, pp. 7\xe2\x80\x938.  A supporting <em>amicus</em> contended that college officials \xe2\x80\x9cmust be allowed a very broad discretion in formulating and implementing policies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Board of Trustees, California State Colleges 6.  Another argued that universities should be permitted to impose restrictions on speech that would not be tolerated elsewhere.  Brief for American Association of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Healy</em> Court would have none of this.  Unlike the Court today, the <em>Healy</em> Court emphatically rejected the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large.\xe2\x80\x9d  408 U. S., at 180.  And on one key question after another\xe2\x80\x94whether the local SDS chapter was independent of the national organization, whether the group posed a substantial threat of material disruption, and whether the students\xe2\x80\x99 responses to the committee\xe2\x80\x99s questions about violence and disruption signified a willingness to engage in such activities\xe2\x80\x94the Court drew\nits own conclusions, which differed from the college\npresident\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Healy</em> Court was true to the principle that when it comes to the interpretation and application of the right to free speech, we exercise our own independent judgment.  We do not defer to Congress on such matters, see <em>Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/115/index.html">492 U. S. 115</a>, 129 (1989), and there is no reason why we should bow to university administrators.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, I see only two possible distinctions between <em>Healy</em> and the present case.  The first is that <em>Healy</em> did not involve any funding, but as I have noted, funding plays only a small part in this case.  And if <em>Healy</em> would otherwise prevent Hastings from refusing to register CLS, I see no good reason why the potential availability of funding should enable Hastings to deny all of the other rights that go with registration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This leaves just one way of distinguishing <em>Healy</em>: the identity of the student group.  In <em>Healy</em>, the Court warned that the college president\xe2\x80\x99s views regarding the philosophy of the SDS could not \xe2\x80\x9cjustify the denial of First Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  408 U. S., at 187.  Here, too, disapproval of CLS cannot justify Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 actions.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court pays little attention to <em>Healy</em> and instead focuses solely on the question whether Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 registration policy represents a permissible regulation in a limited public forum.  While I think that <em>Healy</em> is largely controlling, I am content to address the constitutionality of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 actions under our limited public forum cases, which lead to exactly the same conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the forum consists of the RSO program.  Once a public university opens a limited public forum, it \xe2\x80\x9cmust respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a>, 829 (1995).  The university \xe2\x80\x9cmay not exclude speech where its distinction is not \xe2\x80\x98reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Cornelius</em> v. <em>NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/index.html">473 U. S. 788</a>, 806 (1985)).  And the university must maintain strict viewpoint neutrality.  <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System</em> v. <em>Southworth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/217/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/217/index.html">529 U. S. 217</a>, 234 (2000); <em>Rosenberger</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 829.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This requirement of viewpoint neutrality extends to the expression of religious viewpoints.  In an unbroken line of decisions analyzing private religious speech in limited public forums, we have made it perfectly clear that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]eligion is [a] viewpoint from which ideas are conveyed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Good News Club</em> v. <em>Milford Central School</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/98/index.html">533 U. S. 98</a>, 112, and n. 4 (2001).  See <em>Rosenberger</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 831; <em>Lamb\xe2\x80\x99s Chapel</em> v. <em>Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/384/index.html">508 U.

S. 263</a>, 277 (1981).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have applied this analysis in cases in which student speech was restricted because of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s religious viewpoint, and we have consistently concluded that such restrictions constitute viewpoint discrimination.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Rosenberger</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 845\xe2\x80\x93846; <em>Widmar</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 267, n.\xc2\xa05, 269, 277; see also <em>Good News Club</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 106\xe2\x80\x93107, 109\xe2\x80\x93110; <em>Lamb\xe2\x80\x99s Chapel</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 392\xe2\x80\x93393, 394.  We have also stressed that the rules applicable in a limited public forum are particularly important in the university setting, where \xe2\x80\x9cthe State acts against a background of tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 835.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Analyzed under this framework, Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to register CLS pursuant to its Nondiscrimination Policy plainly fails.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  As previously noted, when Hastings refused to register CLS, it claimed that the CLS bylaws impermissibly discriminated on the basis of religion and sexual orientation.  As interpreted by Hastings and applied\nto CLS, both of these grounds constituted viewpoint\ndiscrimination.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Religion</em>.  The First Amendment protects the right of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98expressive association\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to associate for the purpose of speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rumsfeld</em> v. <em>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/47/index.html">547 U. S. 47</a>, 68 (2006) (quoting <em>Boy Scouts of America</em> v. <em>Dale</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/640/index.html">530 U. S. 640</a>, 644 (2000)).  And the Court has recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes the group\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of expressive association if the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group\xe2\x80\x99s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dale</em>, <em>supra</em>, at<em> </em>648.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With one important exception, the Hastings Nondiscrimination Policy respected that right.  As Hastings stated in its answer, the Nondiscrimination Policy \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[ted] political, social, and cultural student organizations to select officers and members who are dedicated to a particular set of ideals or beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 93.  But the policy singled out one category of expressive associations for disfavored treatment: groups formed to express a religious message.  Only religious groups were required to admit students who did not share their views.  An environmentalist group was not required to admit students who rejected global warming.  An animal rights group was not obligated to accept students who supported the use of  animals to test cosmetics.  But CLS was required to admit avowed atheists.  This was patent viewpoint discrimination.  \xe2\x80\x9cBy the very terms of the [Nondiscrimination Policy], the University \xe2\x80\xa6 select[ed] for disfavored treatment those student [groups] with religious \xe2\x80\xa6 viewpoints.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rosenberger</em>, 515 U. S., at 831.  It is no wonder that the Court makes no attempt to defend the constitutionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the Court, Justice Stevens attempts a defense, contending that the Nondiscrimination Policy is viewpoint neutral.  But his arguments are squarely contrary to established precedent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens first argues that the Nondiscrimination Policy is viewpoint neutral because it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not regulate expression or belief at all\xe2\x80\x9d but instead regulates conduct.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2 (concurring opinion).  This Court has held, however, that the particular conduct at issue here constitutes a form of expression that is protected by the First Amendment.  It is now well established that the First Amendment shields the right of a group to engage in expressive association by limiting membership to persons whose admission does not significantly interfere with the group\xe2\x80\x99s ability to convey its views.

S. 1</a>, 13 (1988) (acknowledging that an \xe2\x80\x9cassociation might be able to show that it is organized for specific expressive purposes and that it will not be able to advocate its desired viewpoints nearly as effectively if it cannot confine its membership to those who share the same sex, for example, or the same religion\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Widmar</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 268\xe2\x80\x93269 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he First Amendment rights of speech and association extend to the campuses of state universities\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the opinion of the Court, which Justice Stevens joins, acknowledges this rule.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens also maintains that the Nondiscrimination Policy is viewpoint neutral because it prohibits all groups, both religious and secular, from engaging in religious speech.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3.  This argument is also contrary to established law.  In <em>Rosenberger</em>, the dissent, which Justice Stevens joined, made exactly this argument.  See 515 U. S., at 895\xe2\x80\x93896 (opinion of Souter, J.).  The Court disagreed, holding that a policy that treated secular speech more favorably than religious speech discriminated on the basis of viewpoint.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  515 U. S., at 831.  The Court reaffirmed this holding in <em>Good News Club</em>, 533 U. S., at 112, and n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the Nondiscrimination Policy permitted membership requirements that expressed a secular viewpoint.  See App. 93.  (For example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus and the Hastings Republicans were allowed to exclude members who disagreed with their parties\xe2\x80\x99 platforms.)  But religious groups were not permitted to express a religious viewpoint by limiting membership to students who shared their religious viewpoints.  Under established precedent, this was viewpoint discrimination.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It bears emphasis that permitting religious groups to limit membership to those who share the groups\xe2\x80\x99 beliefs would not have the effect of allowing other groups to discriminate on the basis of religion.  It would not mean, for example, that fraternities or sororities could exclude students on that basis.  As our cases have recognized, the right of expressive association permits a group to exclude an applicant for membership only if the admission of that person would \xe2\x80\x9caffec[t] in a significant way the group\xe2\x80\x99s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dale</em>, 530 U. S., at<em> </em>648.  Groups that do not engage in expressive association have no such right.  Similarly, groups that are dedicated to expressing a viewpoint on a secular topic (for example, a political or ideological viewpoint) would have no basis for limiting membership based on religion because the presence of members with diverse religious beliefs would have no effect on the group\xe2\x80\x99s ability to express its views.  But for religious groups, the situation is very different.  This point was put well by a coalition of Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Sikh groups: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course there is a strong interest in prohibiting religious discrimination where religion is irrelevant.  But it is fundamentally confused to apply a rule against religious discrimination to a religious association.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for American Islamic Congress et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sexual orientation</em>.  The Hastings Nondiscrimination Policy, as interpreted by the law school, also discriminated on the basis of viewpoint regarding sexual morality.  CLS has a particular viewpoint on this subject, namely, that sexual conduct outside marriage between a man and a woman is wrongful.  Hastings would not allow CLS to express this viewpoint by limiting membership to persons willing to express a sincere agreement with CLS\xe2\x80\x99s views.  By contrast, nothing in the Nondiscrimination Policy prohibited a group from expressing a contrary viewpoint by limiting membership to persons willing to endorse\nthat group\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs.  A Free Love Club could require members to affirm that they reject the traditional view of sexual morality to which CLS adheres.  It is hard to see\nhow this can be viewed as anything other than viewpoint discrimination. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 current policy, as announced for the first time in the brief filed in this Court, fares no better than the policy that the law school invoked when CLS\xe2\x80\x99s application was denied.  According to Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 brief, its new policy, contrary to the position taken by Hastings officials at an earlier point in this litigation, really does not require a student group to accept all comers.  Now, Hastings explains, its policy allows \xe2\x80\x9cneutral and generally applicable membership requirements unrelated to \xe2\x80\x98status or beliefs.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Hastings College of Law 5.  As examples of permissible membership requirements, Hastings mentions academic standing, writing ability, \xe2\x80\x9cdues, attendance, and <em>even conduct requirements</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems doubtful that Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 new policy permits registered groups to condition membership eligibility on whatever \xe2\x80\x9cconduct requirements\xe2\x80\x9d they may wish to impose.  If that is the school\xe2\x80\x99s current policy, it is hard to see why CLS may not be registered, for what CLS demands is that members foreswear \xe2\x80\x9cunrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 146.  That should qualify as a conduct requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If it does not, then what Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 new policy must mean is that registered groups may impose some, but not all, conduct requirements.  And if that is the case, it is incumbent on Hastings to explain which conduct requirements are acceptable, which are not, and why CLS\xe2\x80\x99s requirement is not allowed.  Hastings has made no effort to provide such an explanation.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I come now to the version of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy that the Court has chosen to address.  This is not the policy that Hastings invoked when CLS was denied registration.  Nor is it the policy that Hastings now proclaims\xe2\x80\x94and presumably implements.  It is a policy that, as far as the record establishes, was in force only from the time when it was first disclosed by the former dean in July 2005 until Hastings filed its brief in this Court in March 2010.  Why we should train our attention on this particular policy and not the other two is a puzzle.  But in any event, it is clear that the accept-all-comers policy is not reasonable in light of the purpose of the RSO forum, and it is impossible to say on the present record that it is viewpoint neutral.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once a state university opens a limited forum, it \xe2\x80\x9cmust respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger</em>, 515 U. S., at 829.  Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 regulations on the registration of student groups impose only two substantive limitations: A group seeking registration must have student members and must be non-commercial.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a\xe2\x80\x9383a, Hastings Board of Directors, Policies and Regulations Applying to College Activities, Organizations and Students \xc2\xa734.10 (June 22, 1990) (hereinafter Hastings Regulations).  Access to the forum is not limited to groups devoted to particular purposes.  The regulations provide that a group applying for registration must submit an official document including \xe2\x80\x9ca statement of <em>its purpose</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 83a (Hastings Regulations \xc2\xa734.10.A.1 (emphasis added)), but the regulations make no attempt to define the limits of acceptable purposes.  The regulations do not require a group seeking registration to show that it has a certain number of members or that its program is of interest to any particular number of Hastings students.  Nor do the regulations require that a group serve a need not met by existing groups.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulations also make it clear that the registration program is not meant to stifle unpopular speech.  They proclaim that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the responsibility of the Dean to ensure an ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 82a (Hastings Regulations \xc2\xa733.11).  They also emphatically disclaim any endorsement of or responsibility for views that student groups may express.  <em>Id</em>., at 85a (Hastings Regulations \xc2\xa734.10.D).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taken as a whole, the regulations plainly contemplate the creation of a forum within which Hastings students are free to form and obtain registration of essentially the same broad range of private groups that nonstudents may form off campus.  That is precisely what the parties in this case stipulated: The RSO forum \xe2\x80\x9cseeks to promote a diversity of viewpoints <em>among</em> registered student organizations, including viewpoints on religion and human sexuality.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 216 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The way in which the RSO forum actually developed corroborates this design.  As noted, Hastings had more than 60 RSOs in 2004\xe2\x80\x932005, each with its own independently devised purpose.  Some addressed serious social issues; others\xe2\x80\x94for example, the wine appreciation and ultimate Frisbee clubs\xe2\x80\x94were simply recreational.  Some organizations focused on a subject but did not claim to promote a particular viewpoint on that subject (for example, the Association of Communications, Sports &amp; Entertainment Law); others were defined, not by subject, but by viewpoint.  The forum did not have a single Party Politics Club; rather, it featured both the Hastings Democratic Caucus and the Hastings Republicans.  There was no Reproductive Issues Club; the forum included separate pro-choice and pro-life organizations.  Students did not see fit to create a Monotheistic Religions Club, but they have formed the Hastings Jewish Law Students Association and the Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students.  In short, the RSO forum, true to its design, has allowed Hastings students to replicate on campus a broad array of private, independent, noncommercial organizations that is very similar to those that nonstudents have formed in the outside world.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The accept-all-comers policy is antithetical to the design of the RSO forum for the same reason that a state-imposed accept-all-comers policy would violate the First Amendment rights of private groups if applied off campus.  As explained above, a group\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment right of expressive association is burdened by the \xe2\x80\x9cforced inclusion\xe2\x80\x9d of members whose presence would \xe2\x80\x9caffec[t] in a significant way the group\xe2\x80\x99s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dale</em>, 530 U. S., at 648.  The Court has therefore held that the government may not compel a group that engages in \xe2\x80\x9cexpressive association\xe2\x80\x9d to admit such a member unless the government has a compelling interest, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ibid</em>. (quoting <em>Roberts</em>, 468 U. S., at 623).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There can be no dispute that this standard would not permit a generally applicable law mandating that private religious groups admit members who do not share the groups\xe2\x80\x99 beliefs.  Religious groups like CLS obviously engage in expressive association, and no legitimate state interest could override the powerful effect that an accept-all-comers law would have on the ability of religious groups to express their views.  The State of California surely could not demand that all Christian groups admit members who believe that Jesus was merely human.  Jewish groups could not be required to admit anti-Semites and Holocaust deniers.  Muslim groups could not be forced to admit persons who are viewed as slandering Islam.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While there can be no question that the State of California could not impose such restrictions on all religious groups in the State, the Court now holds that Hastings, a state institution, may impose these very same requirements on students who wish to participate in a forum that is designed to foster the expression of diverse viewpoints.  The Court lists four justifications offered by Hastings in defense of the accept-all-comers policy and, deferring to the school\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, <em>ante</em>, at 21, the Court finds all those justifications satisfactory, <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9324.  If we carry\nout our responsibility to exercise our own independent judgment, however, we must conclude that the justifications offered by Hastings and accepted by the Court are insufficient.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court first says that the accept-all-comers policy is reasonable because it helps Hastings to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98leadership, educational, and social opportunities\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d are afforded to all students.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (quoting Brief for Respondent Hastings College of Law 32).  The RSO forum, however, is designed to achieve these laudable ends in a very different way\xe2\x80\x94by permitting groups of students, no matter how small, to form the groups they want.  In this way, the forum multiplies the opportunity for students to serve in leadership positions; it allows students to decide which educational opportunities they wish to pursue through participation in extracurricular activities; and it permits them to create the \xe2\x80\x9csocial opportunities\xe2\x80\x9d they desire by forming whatever groups they wish to create.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court approves the accept-all-comers policy because it is easier to enforce than the Nondiscrimination Policy that it replaced.  It would be \xe2\x80\x9ca daunting labor,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court warns, for Hastings to try to determine whether\na group excluded a member based on belief as opposed to status.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22; see also <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, n.\xc2\xa01 (opinion\nof Stevens, J.) (referring to the \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible task of\nseparating out belief-based from status-based religious\ndiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a strange argument, since the Nondiscrimination Policy prohibits discrimination on substantially the same grounds as the antidiscrimination provisions of many States,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] including California, and except for the inclusion of the prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation, the Nondiscrimination Policy also largely tracks federal antidiscrimination laws.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Moreover, Hastings now willingly accepts greater burdens under its latest policy, which apparently requires the school to distinguish between certain \xe2\x80\x9cconduct requirements\xe2\x80\x9d that are allowed and others that are not.  Nor is Hastings daunted by the labor of determining whether a club admissions exam legitimately tests knowledge or is a pretext for screening out students with disfavored beliefs.  Asked at oral argument whether CLS could require applicants to pass a test on the Bible, Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 attorney responded: \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were truly an objective knowledge test, it would be okay.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.  The long history of disputes about the meaning of Bible passages belies any suggestion that it would be an easy task to determine whether the grading of such a test was \xe2\x80\x9cobjective.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court argues that the accept-all-comers policy, by bringing together students with diverse views, encourages tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the development of conflict-resolution skills.  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  These are obviously commendable goals, but they are not undermined by permitting a religious group to restrict membership to persons who share the group\xe2\x80\x99s faith.  Many religious groups impose such restrictions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Agudath Israel of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 3 (\xe2\x80\x9c[B]ased upon millennia-old Jewish laws and traditions, Orthodox Jewish institutions \xe2\x80\xa6 regularly differentiate between Jews and non-Jews\xe2\x80\x9d).  Such practices are not manifestations of \xe2\x80\x9ccontempt\xe2\x80\x9d for members of other faiths.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 6 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (invoking groups that have \xe2\x80\x9ccontempt for Jews, blacks, and women\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor do they thwart the objectives that Hastings endorses.  Our country as a whole, no less than the Hastings College of Law, values tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the amicable resolution of conflicts.  But we seek to achieve those goals through \xe2\x80\x9c[a] confident pluralism that conduces to civil peace and advances democratic consensus-building,\xe2\x80\x9d not by abridging First Amendment rights.  Brief for Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 35.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the Court observes that Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 policy \xe2\x80\x9cincorporates\xe2\x80\x94in fact, subsumes\xe2\x80\x94state-law proscriptions on discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  Because the First Amendment obviously takes precedence over any state law, this would not justify the Hastings policy even if it were true\xe2\x80\x94but it is not.  The only Hastings policy considered by the Court\xe2\x80\x94the accept-all-comers policy\xe2\x80\x94goes far beyond any California antidiscrimination law.  Neither Hastings nor the Court claims that California law demands that state entities must accept all comers.  Hastings itself certainly does not follow this policy in hiring or student admissions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is it at all clear that California law requires Hastings to deny registration to a religious group that limits membership to students who share the group\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs.  Hastings cites no California court decision or administrative authority addressing this question.  Instead, Hastings points to a statute prohibiting discrimination on specified grounds, including religion or sexual orientation, \xe2\x80\x9cin any program or activity <em>conducted by</em>\xe2\x80\x9d certain postsecondary educational institutions.  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa766270 (West Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).  Hastings, however, does not conduct the activities of the student groups it registers.  Indeed, Hastings disclaims such responsibility, stating both in its regulations and its Handbook for Student Organizations that it \xe2\x80\x9c<em>does not sponsor</em> student organizations and therefore does not accept liability for activities of student organizations.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a (Hastings Regulations \xc2\xa734.10.D); App. 250.  In addition, as CLS notes, another provision of California law specifically exempts \xe2\x80\x9cany funds that are used directly or indirectly for the benefit of student organizations\xe2\x80\x9d from a ban on state funding of private groups that discriminate on any of the grounds listed in \xc2\xa766270.  See \xc2\xa792150 (West Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The authority to decide whether \xc2\xa766270 or any other provision of California law requires religious student groups at covered institutions to admit members who do not share the groups\xe2\x80\x99 religious views is of course a question of state law that we cannot resolve.  The materials that have been brought to our attention, however, provide little support for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggested interpretation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 accept-all-comers policy is not reasonable in light of the stipulated purpose of the RSO forum: to promote a diversity of viewpoints \xe2\x80\x9c<em>among</em>\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not within<em>\xe2\x80\x94</em>\xe2\x80\x9cregistered student organizations.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 216 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is also wrong in holding that the accept-all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral.  The Court proclaims that it would be \xe2\x80\x9chard to imagine a more viewpoint-neutral policy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 28, but<em> </em>I would not be so quick to jump to this conclusion.  Even if it is assumed that the policy is viewpoint neutral on its face,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] there is strong evidence in the record that the policy was announced as a pretext.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The adoption of a facially neutral policy for the purpose of suppressing the expression of a particular viewpoint is viewpoint discrimination.  See <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/527/index.html">458 U. S. 527</a>, 544 (1982) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] law neutral on its face still may be unconstitutional if motivated by a discriminatory purpose\xe2\x80\x9d).  A simple example illustrates this obvious point.  Suppose that a hated student group at a state university has never been able to attract more than 10 members.  Suppose that the university administration, for the purpose of preventing that group from using the school grounds for meetings, adopts a new rule under which the use of its facilities is restricted to groups with more than 25 members.  Although this rule would be neutral on its face, its adoption for a discriminatory reason would be illegal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, CLS has made a strong showing that Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 sudden adoption and selective application of its accept-all-comers policy was a pretext for the law school\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful denial of CLS\xe2\x80\x99s registration application under the Nondiscrimination Policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Shifting policies</em>.  When Hastings denied CLS\xe2\x80\x99s application in the fall of 2004, the only policy mentioned was the Nondiscrimination Policy.  In July 2005, the former dean suggested in a deposition that the law school actually followed the very different accept-all-comers policy.  In March of this year, Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 brief in this Court rolled out still a third policy.  As is recognized in the employment discrimination context, where issues of pretext regularly arise, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubstantial changes over time in [an] employer\xe2\x80\x99s proffered reason for its employment decision support a finding of pretext.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kobrin</em> v. <em>University of Minnesota</em>, 34 F.\xc2\xa03d 698, 703 (CA8 1994); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Aragon</em> v. <em>Republic Silver State Disposal Inc.</em>, 292 F.\xc2\xa03d 654, 661 (CA9 2002); <em>Cicero</em> v. <em>Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc.</em>, 280 F.\xc2\xa03d 579, 592 (CA6 2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Timing</em>.  The timing of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 revelation of its new policies closely tracks the law school\xe2\x80\x99s litigation posture.  When Hastings denied CLS registration, it cited only the Nondiscrimination Policy.  Later, after CLS alleged that the Nondiscrimination Policy discriminated against religious groups, Hastings unveiled its accept-all-comers policy.  Then, after we granted certiorari and CLS\xe2\x80\x99s opening brief challenged the constitutionality\xe2\x80\x94and the plausibility\xe2\x80\x94of the accept-all-comers policy, Hastings disclosed a new policy.  As is true in the employment context, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the justification for an adverse . . . action changes during litigation, that inconsistency raises an issue whether the proffered reason truly motivated the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cicero</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 592.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Lack of documentation.  </em>When an employer has a written policy and then relies on a rule for which there is no written documentation, that deviation may support an inference of pretext.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Diaz</em> v. <em>Eagle Produce Ltd. Partnership</em>, 521 F.\xc2\xa03d 1201, 1214 (CA9 2008); <em>Rudin</em> v. <em>Lincoln Land Community College</em>, 420 F.\xc2\xa03d 712, 727 (CA7 2005); <em>Machinchick</em> v. <em>PB Power, Inc.</em>, 398 F.\xc2\xa03d 345, 354, n.\xc2\xa029 (CA5 2005); <em>Russell</em> v. <em>TG Missouri Corp.</em>, 340 F.\xc2\xa03d 735, 746 (CA8 2003); <em>Mohammed</em> v. <em>Callaway</em>, 698 F.\xc2\xa02d 395, 399\xe2\x80\x93400, 401 (CA10 1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, Hastings claims that it has had an accept-all-comers policy since 1990, but it has not produced a single written document memorializing that policy.  Nor has it cited a single occasion prior to the dean\xe2\x80\x99s deposition when this putative policy was orally disclosed to either student groups interested in applying for registration or to the Office of Student Services, which was charged with reviewing the bylaws of applicant groups to ensure that they were in compliance with the law school\xe2\x80\x99s policies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Nonenforcement</em>.  Since it appears that no one was told about the accept-all-comers policy before July 2005, it is not surprising that the policy was not enforced.  The record is replete with evidence that Hastings made no effort to enforce the all-comers policy until after it was proclaimed by the former dean.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a (Hastings Democratic Caucus); <em>id.</em>, at 110a (Association of Trial Lawyers of America at Hastings); <em>id.</em>, at 146a\xe2\x80\x93147a (Vietnamese American Law Society); <em>id.</em>, at 142a\xe2\x80\x93143a (Silent Right); App. 192 (La Raza).  See generally <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  If the record here is not sufficient to permit a finding of pretext, then the law of pretext is dead.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x94understandably\xe2\x80\x94sidesteps this issue.  The Court states that the lower courts did not address the \xe2\x80\x9cargument that Hastings selectively enforces its all-comer policy,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] that \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court is not the proper forum to air the issue in the first instance,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n remand, the Ninth Circuit may consider CLS\xe2\x80\x99s pretext argument if, and to the extent, it is preserved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Court affirms the entry of summary judgment in favor of respondents, it is not clear how CLS will be able to ask the Ninth Circuit on remand to review its claim of pretext. And the argument that we should not address this issue of pretext because the Ninth Circuit did not do so is hard to take, given that the Ninth Circuit barely addressed anything, disposing of this case in precisely two sentences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither of those two sentences addressed the \xe2\x80\x9cnovel question,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1, to which the bulk of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is devoted, <em>i.e.</em>, whether the accept-all-comers policy is reasonable in light of the purposes of the RSO forum and is viewpoint neutral, see <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9331.  If it is appropriate for us to consider that issue, then the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s failure to address the issue of pretext should not stand in the way of review by this Court.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One final aspect of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision warrants comment.  In response to the argument that the accept-all-comers-policy would permit a small and unpopular group to be taken over by students who wish to silence its message, the Court states that the policy would permit a registered group to impose membership requirements \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to ensure that students join because of their commitment to a group\xe2\x80\x99s vitality, not its demise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 27.  With this concession, the Court tacitly recognizes that Hastings does not really have an accept-all-comers policy\xe2\x80\x94it has an accept-some-dissident-comers policy\xe2\x80\x94and the line between members who merely seek to change a group\xe2\x80\x99s message (who apparently must be admitted) and those who seek a group\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdemise\xe2\x80\x9d (who may be kept out) is hopelessly vague.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here is an example.  Not all Christian denominations agree with CLS\xe2\x80\x99s views on sexual morality and other matters.  During a recent year, CLS had seven members.  Suppose that 10 students who are members of denominations that disagree with CLS decided that CLS was misrepresenting true Christian doctrine.  Suppose that these students joined CLS, elected officers who shared their views, ended the group\xe2\x80\x99s affiliation with the national organization, and changed the group\xe2\x80\x99s message.  The new leadership would likely proclaim that the group was \xe2\x80\x9cvital\xe2\x80\x9d but rectified, while CLS, I assume, would take the view that the old group had suffered its \xe2\x80\x9cdemise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether a change represents reform or transformation may depend very much on the eye of the beholder.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy takes a similarly mistaken tack.  He contends that CLS \xe2\x80\x9cwould have a substantial case on the merits if it were shown that the all-comers policy was \xe2\x80\xa6 used to infiltrate the group or challenge its leadership in order to stifle its views,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 4 (concurring opinion), but he does not explain on what ground such a claim could succeed.  The Court holds that the accept-all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purposes of the RSO forum.  How could those characteristics be altered by a change in the membership of one of the forum\xe2\x80\x99s registered groups?  No explanation is apparent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, the Court refuses to acknowledge the consequences of its holding.  A true accept-all-comers policy permits small unpopular groups to be taken over by students who wish to change the views that the group expresses.  Rules requiring that members attend meetings, pay dues, and behave politely, see <em>ante</em>, at 27, would not eliminate this threat.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The possibility of such takeovers, however, is by no means the most important effect of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  There are religious groups that cannot in good conscience agree in their bylaws that they will admit persons who do not share their faith, and for these groups, the consequence of an accept-all-comers policy is marginalization.  See Brief for Evangelical Scholars (Officers and 24 Former Presidents of the Evangelical Theological Society) et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 19 (affirmance in this case \xe2\x80\x9cwill allow every public college and university in the United States to exclude all evangelical Christian organizations\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Agudath Israel of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 3, 8 (affirmance would \xe2\x80\x9cpoint a judicial dagger at the heart of the Orthodox Jewish community in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and permit that community to be relegated to the status of  \xe2\x80\x9ca second-class group\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 3 (affirmance \xe2\x80\x9ccould significantly affect the ability of [affiliated] student clubs and youth movements \xe2\x80\xa6 to prescribe requirements for their membership and leaders based on religious beliefs and commitments\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is where the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision leads.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83&amp;emsp*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that today\xe2\x80\x99s  decision is a serious setback for freedom of expression in this country.

I fear that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision marks a turn in that direction.  Even those who find CLS\xe2\x80\x99s views objectionable should be concerned about the way the group has been treated\xe2\x80\x94by Hastings, the Court of Appeals, and now this Court.

CLS\xe2\x80\x99s brief stated that \xe2\x80\x9cHastings allows other registered student organizations to require that their leaders and/or members agree with the organization\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs and purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant in No. 06\xe2\x80\x9315956 (CA9), pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315 (citing examples).

Responding to these arguments, the law school remarked that CLS \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly asserts that \xe2\x80\x98Hastings routinely recognizes student groups that limit membership or leadership on the basis of belief.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees in No. 06\xe2\x80\x9315956 (CA9), p.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court attempts to distinguish <em>Healy</em> on the ground that there the college \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly denied the student group official recognition <em>because of</em> the group\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa015.  The same, however, is true here.  CLS was denied recognition under the Nondiscrimination Policy because of the viewpoint that CLS sought to express through its membership requirements.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5; <em>infra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9323.  And there is strong evidence that Hastings abruptly shifted from the Nondiscrimination Policy to the accept-all-comers policy as a pretext for viewpoint discrimination.  See <em>infra</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9335.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0CLS sought a declaratory judgment that this policy is unconstitutional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.  See App. 80.  Particularly in light of Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 practice of changing its announced policies, these requests are not moot.  It is well settled that the voluntary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct does not moot a case in which the legality of that conduct is challenged.  See <em>City of Mesquite</em> v. <em>Aladdin\xe2\x80\x99s Castle, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/283/index.html">455 U.

Here, there is certainly a risk that Hastings will \xe2\x80\x9creturn to [its] old ways,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore CLS\xe2\x80\x99s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Nondiscrimination Policy are not moot.  If, as the Court assumes, the parties stipulated that the only relevant policy is the accept-all-comers policy, then the District Court should not have addressed the constitutionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy.  But the District Court approved both policies, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment.  That judgment remains binding on CLS, so it is only appropriate that CLS be permitted to challenge that determination now.  The question of the constitutionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy falls comfortably within the question presented, and CLS raised that issue in its brief.
