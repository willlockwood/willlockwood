The motion was founded upon the fourteenth section of the Bankrupt Law, which provides that the assignee in bankruptcy may prosecute and defend in his own name all suits at law and in equity pending at the time of the adjudication of bankruptcy, in which the bankrupt is a party, in the same manner and with the like effect as they might have been prosecuted or defendant by the bankrupt, and which makes a copy of the register\'s assignment, duly certified by the clerk of the proper court, conclusive evidence of the right of the assignee to use. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="665">Page 76 U.

It seems to require that Masterson, the assignee, be substituted as appellant for Herndon, the bankrupt, who may be said to be <em>civiliter mortuus,</em> precisely as an executor or administrator would be made party instead of an appellant actually deceased, and</p>\n<p><em>An order will be made accordingly.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
