JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Respondent applied for a patent on a "Method for Updating Alarm Limits."  The only novel feature of the method is a mathematical formula.  In <em>Gottschalk v. Benson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/63/case.html">409 U. S. 63</a></span>, we held that the discovery of a novel and useful mathematical formula may not be patented.  The question in this case is whether the identification of a limited category of useful, though conventional, post-solution applications of such a formula makes respondent\'s method eligible for patent protection.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>An "alarm limit" is a number.  During catalytic conversion processes, operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates are constantly monitored.  When any of these "process variables" exceeds a predetermined "alarm limit," an alarm may signal the presence of an abnormal condition indicating either inefficiency or perhaps danger.  Fixed alarm limits may be appropriate for a steady operation, but during transient operating situations, such as start-up, it may be necessary to "update" the alarm limits periodically.</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s patent application describes a method of updating alarm limits.  In essence, the method consists of three steps:  an initial step which merely measures the present value of the process variable (<em>e.g.,</em> the temperature); an intermediate step which uses an algorithm [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] to calculate an updated alarm limit value; and a final step in which the actual alarm limit is adjusted to the updated value. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The only difference </p><p><a class="page-number" name="586">Page 437 U. S. 586</a></p><p> between the conventional methods of changing alarm limits and that described in respondent\'s application rests in the second step -- the mathematical algorithm or formula.  Using the formula, an operator can calculate an updated alarm limit once he knows the original alarm base, the appropriate margin of safety, the time interval that should elapse between each updating, the current temperature (or other process variable), and the appropriate weighting factor to be used to average the original alarm base and the current temperature.</p>\n<p>The patent application does not purport to explain how to select the appropriate margin of safety, the weighting factor, or any of the other variables.  Nor does it purport to contain any disclosure relating to the chemical processes at work, the monitoring of process variables, or the means of setting off an alarm or adjusting an alarm system.  All that it provides is a formula for computing an updated alarm limit.  Although the computations can be made by pencil and paper calculations, the abstract of disclosure makes it clear that the formula is primarily useful for computerized calculations producing automatic adjustments in alarm settings. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The patent claims cover any use of respondent\'s formula for updating the value of an alarm limit on any process variable involved in a process comprising the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons.  Since there are numerous processes of that kind in the petrochemical and oil-refining industries, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the claims cover a broad range of potential uses of the method.  They do not, however, cover every conceivable application of the formula. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="587">Page 437 U. S. 587</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The patent examiner rejected the application.  He found that the mathematical formula constituted the only difference between respondent\'s claims and the prior art, and therefore a patent on this method "would, in practical effect, be a patent on the formula or mathematics itself." [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The examiner concluded that the claims did not describe a discovery that was eligible for patent protection.</p>\n<p>The Board of Appeals of the Patent and Trademark Office sustained the examiner\'s rejection.  The Board also concluded that the "point of novelty in [respondent\'s] claimed method" [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] lay in the formula or algorithm described in the claims, a subject matter that was unpatentable under <em>Benson, supra.</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed.  <em>In re Flook,</em> 559 F.2d 21.  It read <em>Benson</em> as applying only to claims that entirely preempt a mathematical formula or algorithm, and noted that respondent was only claiming on the use of his method to update alarm limits in a process comprising the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons.  The court reasoned that, since the mere solution of the algorithm would not constitute infringement of the claims, a patent on the method would not preempt the formula.</p>\n<p>The Acting Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, urging that the decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals will have a debilitating effect on the rapidly expanding computer "software" industry, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and will require him to process thousands of additional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="588">Page 437 U. S. 588</a></p><p> patent applications.  Because of the importance of the question, we granted certiorari, 434 U.S. 1033.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>This case turns entirely on the proper construction of \xc2\xa7 101 of the Patent Act, which describes the subject matter that is eligible for patent protection. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  It does not involve the familiar issues of novelty and obviousness that routinely arise under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 102 and 103 when the validity of a patent is challenged.  For the purpose of our analysis, we assume that respondent\'s formula is novel and useful, and that he discovered it.  We also assume, since respondent does not challenge the examiner\'s finding, that the formula is the only novel feature of respondent\'s method.  The question is whether the discovery of this feature makes an otherwise conventional method eligible for patent protection.</p>\n<p>The plain language of \xc2\xa7 101 does not answer the question.  It is true, as respondent argues, that his method is a "process" in the ordinary sense of the word. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  But that was also true of the algorithm, which described a method for converting binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary numerals, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="589">Page 437 U. S. 589</a></p><p> that was involved in <em>Gottschalk v. Benson.</em>  The holding that the discovery of that method could not be patented as a "process" forecloses a purely literal reading of \xc2\xa7 101. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Reasoning that an algorithm, or mathematical formula, is like a law of nature, <em>Benson</em> applied the established rule that a law of nature cannot be the subject of a patent.  Quoting from earlier cases, we said:</p>\n<p>"\'A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right.\'  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/55/156/case.html">Le Roy v. Tatham,</a></span></em> 14 How. 156,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/55/156/case.html#175">55 U. S. 175</a></span>.  Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work."</p>\n<p>409 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/63/case.html#67">409 U. S. 67</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The line between a patentable "process" and an unpatentable "principle" is not always clear.  Both are "conception[s] of the mind, seen only by [their] effects when being executed or performed."  <em>Tilghman v. Proctor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/102/707/case.html">102 U. S. 707</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/102/707/case.html#728">102 U. S. 728</a></span>.  In <em>Benson,</em> we concluded that the process application in fact sought to patent an idea, noting that</p>\n<p>"[t]he mathematical formula involved here has no substantial practical application except in connection with a digital computer, which means that, if the judgment below is affirmed, the patent would wholly preempt the mathematical formula and, in practical effect, would be a patent on the algorithm itself."</p>\n<p>409 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/63/case.html#71">409 U. S. 71</a></span>-72.</p>\n<p>Respondent correctly points out that this language does not apply to his claims. He does not seek to "wholly preempt the mathematical formula," since there are uses of his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="590">Page 437 U. S. 590</a></p><p> formula outside the petrochemical and oil refining industries that remain in the public domain.  And he argues that the presence of specific "post-solution" activity -- the adjustment of the alarm limit to the figure computed according to the formula -- distinguishes this case from <em>Benson</em> and makes his process patentable.  We cannot agree.</p>\n<p>The notion that post-solution activity, no matter how conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process exalts form over substance.  A competent draftsman could attach some form of post-solution activity to almost any mathematical formula; the Pythagorean theorem would not have been patentable, or partially patentable, because a patent application contained a final step indicating that the formula, when solved, could be usefully applied to existing surveying techniques. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The concept of patentable subject matter under \xc2\xa7 101 is not "like a nose of wax, which may be turned and twisted in any direction. . . ."  <em>White v. Dunbar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/47/case.html">119 U. S. 47</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/47/case.html#51">119 U. S. 51</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Yet it is equally clear that a process is not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical algorithm.  <em>See Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota  Ontario Paper Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/261/45/case.html">261 U. S. 45</a></span>; <em>Tilghman v.

Radio Corp. of America,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/86/case.html">306 U. S. 86</a></span>, the applicant sought a patent on a directional antenna system in which the wire arrangement was determined by the logical application of a mathematical formula.  Putting the question of patentability to one side as a preface to his analysis of the infringement issue, Mr. Justice Stone, writing for the Court, explained:</p>\n<p>"While a scientific truth, or the mathematical expression of it, is not patentable invention, a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/86/case.html#94">306 U.

S. 127</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/127/case.html#130">333 U. S. 130</a></span>, expresses a similar approach:</p>\n<p>"He who discovers a hitherto unknown phenomenon of nature has no claim to a monopoly of it which the law recognizes.  If there is to be invention from such a discovery, it must come from the application of the law of nature to a new and useful end."</p>\n<p><em>Mackay Radio</em> and <em>Funk Bros.</em> point to the proper analysis for this case:  the process itself, not merely the mathematical algorithm, must be new and useful.  Indeed, the novelty of the mathematical algorithm is not a determining factor at all.  Whether the algorithm was in fact known or unknown at the time of the claimed invention, as one of the "basic tools of scientific and technological work," <em>see Gottschalk v. Benson,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="592">Page 437 U. S. 592</a></p><p> 409 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/63/case.html#67">409 U. S. 67</a></span>, it is treated as though it were a familiar part of the prior art.</p>\n<p>This is also the teaching of our landmark decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/56/62/case.html">O\'Reilly v. Morse,</a></span></em> 15 How. 62.  In that case, the Court rejected Samuel Morse\'s broad claim covering any use of electromagnetism for printing intelligible signs, characters, or letters at a distance.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/56/62/case.html#112">56 U. S. 112</a></span>-121.  In reviewing earlier cases applying the rule that a scientific principle cannot be patented, the Court placed particular emphasis on the English case of <em>Neilson v. Harford,</em> Web.Pat.Cases 295, 371 (1844), which involved the circulation of heated air in a furnace system to increase its efficiency.  The English court rejected the argument that the patent merely covered the principle that furnace temperature could be increased by injecting hot air, instead of cold into the furnace.  That court\'s explanation of its decision was relied on by this Court in <em>Morse:</em></p>\n<p>"\'It is very difficult to distinguish it [the Neilson patent] from the specification of a patent for a principle, and this at first created in the minds of the court much difficulty; but after full consideration, we think that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle, but a machine, embodying a principle, and a very valuable one.  <em>We think the case must be considered as if the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it. . . .</em>\'"</p>\n<p>15 How. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/56/62/case.html#115">56 U. S. 115</a></span> (emphasis added). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  We think this case must also be considered as if the principle or mathematical formula were well known.</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that this approach improperly imports into \xc2\xa7 101 the considerations of "inventiveness" which are the proper concerns of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 102 and 103. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  This argument is based on two fundamental misconceptions. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="593">Page 437 U. S. 593</a></p><p></p>\n<p>First, respondent incorrectly assumes that, if a process application implements a principle in some specific fashion, it automatically falls within the patentable subject matter of \xc2\xa7 101 and the substantive patentability of the particular process can then be determined by the conditions of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 102 and 103.  This assumption is based on respondent\'s narrow reading of <em>Benson,</em> and is as untenable in the context of \xc2\xa7 101 as it is in the context of that case.  It would make the determination of patentable subject matter depend simply on the draftsman\'s art, and would ill serve the principles underlying the prohibition against patents for "ideas" or phenomena of nature.  The rule that the discovery of a law of nature cannot be patented rests not on the notion that natural phenomena are not processes, but rather on the more fundamental understanding that they are not the kind of "discoveries" that the statute was enacted to protect. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The obligation to determine what type of discovery is sought to be patented must precede the determination of whether that discovery is, in fact, new or obvious.</p>\n<p>Second, respondent assumes that the fatal objection to his application is the fact that one of its components -- the mathematical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="594">Page 437 U. S. 594</a></p><p> formula -- consists of unpatentable subject matter.  In countering this supposed objection, respondent relies on opinions by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals which reject the notion</p>\n<p>"that a claim may be dissected, the claim components searched in the prior art, and, if the only component found novel is outside the statutory classes of invention, the claim may be rejected under 35 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 101."</p>\n<p><em>In re Chatfield,</em> 545 F.2d 152, 15 (CCPA 1976). [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Our approach to respondent\'s application is, however, not at all inconsistent with the view that a patent claim must be considered as a whole. Respondent\'s process is unpatentable under \xc2\xa7 101 not because it contains a mathematical algorithm as one component, but because, once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention.  Even though a phenomenon of nature or mathematical formula may be well known, an inventive application of the principle may be patented.  Conversely, the discovery of such a phenomenon cannot support a patent unless there is some other inventive concept in its application.</p>\n<p>Here it is absolutely clear that respondent\'s application contains no claim of patentable invention.  The chemical processes involved in catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons are well known, as are the practice of monitoring the chemical process variables, the use of alarm limits to trigger alarms, the notion that alarm limit values must be recomputed and readjusted, and the use of computers for "automatic monitoring alarming." [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Respondent\'s application simply provides a new and presumably better method for calculating alarm limit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="595">Page 437 U. S. 595</a></p><p> values.  If we assume that that method was also known, as we must under the reasoning in <em>Morse,</em> then respondent\'s claim is, in effect, comparable to a claim that the formula 2\xef\xbf\xbdr can be usefully applied in determining the circumference of a wheel. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  As the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has explained,</p>\n<p>"if a claim is directed essentially to a method of calculating, using a mathematical formula, even if the solution is for a specific purpose, the claimed method is nonstatutory."</p>\n<p><em>In re Richman,</em> 563 F.2d 1026, 1030 (1977).</p>\n<p>To a large extent, our conclusion is based on reasoning derived from opinions written before the modern business of developing programs for computers was conceived.  The youth of the industry may explain the complete absence of precedent supporting patentability.  Neither the dearth of precedent nor this decision should therefore be interpreted as reflecting a judgment that patent protection of certain novel and useful computer programs will not promote the progress of science and the useful arts, or that such protection is undesirable as a matter of policy.  Difficult questions of policy concerning the kinds of programs that may be appropriate for patent protection and the form and duration of such protection can be answered by Congress on the basis of current empirical data not equally available to this tribunal. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="596">Page 437 U. S. 596</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is our duty to construe the patent statutes as they now read, in light of our prior precedents, and we must proceed cautiously when we are asked to extend patent rights into areas wholly unforeseen by Congress.  As MR. JUSTICE WHITE explained in writing for the Court in <em>Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Latram Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/518/case.html">406 U. S. 518</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/518/case.html#531">406 U. S. 531</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"[W]e should not expand patent rights by overruling or modifying our prior cases construing the patent statutes unless the argument for expansion of privilege is based on more than mere inference from ambiguous statutory language.  We would require a clear and certain signal from Congress before approving the position of a litigant who, as respondent here, argues that the beachhead of privilege is wider, and the area of public use narrower, than courts had previously thought.  No such signal legitimizes respondent\'s position in this litigation."</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is</p>\n<p>Reversed.</p>\n<p>|437 U.S. 584app|</p>\n<p><em>APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT\n</em></p>\n<p>Claim 1 of the patent describes the method as follows:</p>\n<p>"1. A method for updating the value of at least one alarm limit on at least one process variable involved in a process comprising the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons wherein said alarm limit has a current value of"</p>\n<p>"<em>Bo + K" </em></p>\n<p>"wherein Bo is the current alarm base and K is a predetermined alarm offset which comprises: "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="597">Page 437 U. S. 597</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"(1) Determining the present value of said process variable, said present value being defined as PVL;"</p>\n<p>"(2) Determining a new alarm base B1, using the following equation:"</p>\n<p>"<em>B1=Bo(1.0-F) + PVL(F)" </em></p>\n<p>"where F is a predetermined number greater than zero and less than 1.0;"</p>\n<p>"(3) Determining an updated alarm limit which is defined as B1 + K; and thereafter"</p>\n<p>"(4) Adjusting said alarm limit to said updated alarm limit value."</p>\n<p>App. 63A.</p>\n<p>In order to use respondent\'s method for computing a new limit, the operator must make four decisions.  Based on his knowledge of normal operating conditions, he first selects the original "alarm base" (Bo); if a temperature of 400 degrees is normal, that may be the alarm base.  He next decides on an appropriate margin of safety, perhaps 50 degrees; that is his "alarm offset" (K).  The sum of the alarm base and the alarm offset equals the alarm limit.  Then he decides on the time interval that will elapse between each updating; that interval has no effect on the computation, although it may, of course, be of great practical importance.  Finally, he selects a weighting factor (F), which may be any number between 99% and 1% <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/584/case.html">*</a></span> and which is used in the updating calculation.</p>\n<p>If the operator has decided in advance to use an original alarm base (Bo) of 400 degrees, a constant alarm offset (K) of 50 degrees, and a weighting factor (F) of 80%, the only additional information he needs in order to compute an updated alarm limit (UAV), is the present value of the process variable (PVL).  The computation of the updated alarm limit according to respondent\'s method involves these three steps:</p>\n<p>First, at the predetermined interval, the process variable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="598">Page 437 U. S. 598</a></p><p> is measured; if we assume the temperature is then 425 degrees, PVL will then equal 425.</p>\n<p>Second, the solution of respondent\'s novel formula will produce a new alarm base (B1) that will be a weighted average of the preceding alarm base (Bo) of 400 degrees and the current temperature (PIL) of 425.  It will be closer to one or the other, depending on the value of the weighting factor (F) selected by the operator.  If F is 80%, that percentage of 425 (340) plus 20% (1-F) of 400 (80) will produce a new alarm base of 420 degrees.</p>\n<p>Third, the alarm offset (K) of 50 degrees is then added to the new alarm base (B1) of 420 to produce the updated alarm limit (UAV) of 470.</p>\n<p>The process is repeated at the selected time intervals.  In each updating computation, the most recently calculated alarm base and the current measurement of the process variable will be substituted for the corresponding numbers in the original calculation, but the alarm offset and the weighting factor will remain constant.</p>\n<p>* More precisely, it is defined as a number greater than 0, but less than 1.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>We use the word "algorithm" in this case, as we did in <em>Gottschalk v.

This argument confuses the issue of patentable subject matter under \xc2\xa7 101 with that of obviousness under \xc2\xa7 103.  Whether or not respondent\'s formula can be characterized as "obvious," his process patent rests solely on the claim that his mathematical algorithm, when related to a computer program, will improve the existing process for updating alarm units.  Very simply, our holding today is that a claim for an improved method of calculation, even when tied to a specific end use, is unpatentable subject matter under \xc2\xa7 101.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>Articles assessing the merits and demerits of patent protection for computer programming are numerous.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Davis, Computer Programs and Subject Matter Patentability, 6 Rutgers J. of Computers and Law 1 (1977), and articles cited therein, at 2 n. 5.

There the Court upheld the validity of an improvement patent that made use of the law of gravity, which, by itself, was clearly unpatentable.  <em>See also, e.g., Tilghman v.

Section 101 is concerned only with subject matter patentability.  Whether a patent will actually issue depends upon the criteria of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 102 and 103, which include novelty and inventiveness, among many others.  It may well be that, under the criteria of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 102 and 103, no patent should issue on the process claimed in this case, because of anticipation, abandonment, obviousness, or for some other reason.  But, in my view, the claimed process clearly meets the standards of subject matter patentability of \xc2\xa7 101.</p>\n<p>In short, I agree with the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in this case, and with the carefully considered opinions of that court in other cases presenting the same basic issue.  <em>See In re Freeman,</em> 573 F.2d 1237; <em>In re Richman,</em> 563 F.2d 1026; <em>In re De Castelet,</em> 562 F.2d 1236; <em>In re Deutsch,</em> 553 F.2d 689; <em>In re Chatfield,</em> 545 F.2d 152.
