The Ninth Circuit set aside the latter conviction because it read \xe2\x80\x9cduring\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7844(h)(2) to include a requirement that the explosive be carried \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to\xe2\x80\x9d the underlying felony.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Since respondent was carrying explosives when he violated \xc2\xa71001, he was carrying them \xe2\x80\x9cduring\xe2\x80\x9d the commission of that felony.

Hidden in the trunk of his rental car were explosives that he intended to detonate at the Los Angeles International Airport.  After the ferry docked, respondent was questioned by a customs official, who instructed him to complete a customs declaration form; respondent did so, identifying himself on the form as a Canadian citizen (he is Algerian) named Benni Noris (his name is Ahmed Ressam).  Respondent was then directed to a secondary inspection station, where another official performed a search of his car.  The official discovered explosives and related items in the car\xe2\x80\x99s spare tire well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent was subsequently convicted of a number of crimes, including the felony of making a false statement to a United States customs official in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (Count 5) and carrying an explosive \xe2\x80\x9cduring the commission of\xe2\x80\x9d that felony in violation of \xc2\xa7844(h)(2) (1994 ed.) (Count 9).  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit set aside his conviction on Count 9 because it read the word \xe2\x80\x9cduring,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa7844(h)(2), to include a requirement that the explosive be carried \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to\xe2\x80\x9d the underlying felony.  474 F.\xc2\xa03d 597 (2007).  Because that construction of the statute conflicted with decisions of other Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  552 U. S. ___ (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most natural reading of the relevant statutory text provides a sufficient basis for reversal.  That text reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(1)\xe2\x80\x82uses fire or an explosive to commit any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(2)\xe2\x80\x82carries an explosive during the commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States,</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xe2\x80\x9cincluding a felony which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(h).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that the items hidden in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s car were \xe2\x80\x9cexplosives.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It is also undisputed that respondent was \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ying]\xe2\x80\x9d those explosives when he knowingly made false statements to a customs official, and that those statements violated \xc2\xa71001 (1994 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no need to consult dictionary definitions of the word \xe2\x80\x9cduring\xe2\x80\x9d in order to arrive at the conclusion that respondent engaged in the precise conduct described in \xc2\xa7844(h)(2) (1994 ed.).  The term \xe2\x80\x9cduring\xe2\x80\x9d denotes a temporal link; that is surely the most natural reading of the word as used in the statute.  Because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s carrying of the explosives was contemporaneous with his violation of \xc2\xa71001, he carried them \xe2\x80\x9cduring\xe2\x80\x9d that violation.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The history of the statute we construe today further supports our conclusion that Congress did not intend to require the Government to establish a relationship between the explosive carried and the underlying felony.  Congress originally enacted \xc2\xa7844(h)(2) as part of its \xe2\x80\x9cRegulation of Explosives\xe2\x80\x9d in Title XI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 957.  The provision was modeled after a portion of the Gun Control Act of 1968, \xc2\xa7102, 82 Stat. 1224, codified, as amended, at 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c) (2000 ed. and Supp. V).  The earlier statute mandated at least 1 and no more than 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment for any person who \xe2\x80\x9ccarries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) (1964 ed., Supp. IV).  Except for the word \xe2\x80\x9cexplosive\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7844(h)(2), instead of the word \xe2\x80\x9cfirearm\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(c)(2), the two provisions as originally enacted were identical.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1984, Congress redrafted the firearm statute; it increased the penalties attached to the provision and, most significantly for our purposes, deleted the word \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully\xe2\x80\x9d and inserted the words \xe2\x80\x9cand in relation to\xe2\x80\x9d immediately after the word \xe2\x80\x9cduring.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71005(a), 98 Stat. 2138.  Reviewing a conviction for an offense that was committed before the amendment but not decided on appeal until after its enactment, the Ninth Circuit held that the original version of the firearm statute had implicitly included the \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to\xe2\x80\x9d requirement that was expressly added while the case was pending on appeal.  As then-Judge Kennedy explained:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe statute as written when Stewart committed the offense provided in pertinent part that it was a crime to \xe2\x80\x98carr[y] a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) (1982).  In 1984, Congress revised section 924(c)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. The 1984 amendment \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0substituted for the word \xe2\x80\x98during\xe2\x80\x99 the phrase \xe2\x80\x98during <em>and in relation to.</em>\xe2\x80\x99  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7924(c) (West Supp. 1985) (emphasis added).  Our study of the legislative history of the amendment \xe2\x80\xa6 indicates the \xe2\x80\x98in relation to\xe2\x80\x99 language was not intended to create an element of the crime that did not previously exist, but rather was intended to make clear a condition already implicit in the statute.  The legislative history reveals that because the amendment eliminated the requirement that the firearm be carried unlawfully, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7924(c) (West Supp. 1985), the \xe2\x80\x98in relation to\xe2\x80\x99 language was added to allay explicitly the concern that a person could be prosecuted under section 924(c) for committing an entirely unrelated crime while in possession of a firearm.  Though the legislative history does not say so expressly, it strongly implies that the \xe2\x80\x98in relation to\xe2\x80\x99 language did not alter the scope of the statute \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> United States </em>v. <em>Stewart</em>, 779 F.\xc2\xa02d 538, 539\xe2\x80\x93540 (1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on that Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals in this case concluded that the explosives statute, like the firearm statute, implicitly included a requirement of a relationship between possession of the item in question and the underlying felony.  Whatever the merits of the argument that \xc2\xa7924(c) as originally enacted contained a relational requirement, the subsequent changes to both statutes convince us that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7844(h) as presently written is correct.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1988, Congress enacted the \xe2\x80\x9cExplosives Offenses Amendments,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa76474(b), 102 Stat. 4379, which modified the text of \xc2\xa7844(h).  Those amendments increased the penalties for violating the provision, \xc2\xa76474(b)(2), <em>id.,</em> at 4380; they also deleted the word \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76474(b)(1), <em>ibid.</em>  Unlike its earlier amendment to the firearm statute, however, Congress did not also insert the words \xe2\x80\x9cand in relation to\xe2\x80\x9d after the word \xe2\x80\x9cduring.\xe2\x80\x9d  While it is possible that this omission was inadvertent, that possibility seems remote given the stark difference that was thereby introduced into the otherwise similar texts of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7844(h) and 924(c).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the similarity of the original texts of the two statutes might have supported an inference that both included an implicit relationship requirement, their current difference virtually commands the opposite inference.  While the two provisions were initially identical, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 replacement of the word \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully\xe2\x80\x9d in the firearm statute with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cand in relation to,\xe2\x80\x9d coupled with the deletion of the word \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully\xe2\x80\x9d without any similar replacement in the explosives statute, convinces us that Congress did not intend to introduce a relational requirement into the explosives provision, but rather intended us to accept the more straightforward reading of \xc2\xa7844(h).  Since respondent was carrying explosives when he violated \xc2\xa71001, he was carrying them \xe2\x80\x9cduring\xe2\x80\x9d the commission of that felony.  The statute as presently written requires nothing further.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Both the Third and Fifth Circuits have declined to interpret \xc2\xa7844(h)(2) as requiring that the explosive be carried in relation to the underlying felony.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(h)(2).  The Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute as requiring a \xe2\x80\x9crelation\xe2\x80\x9d between the explosives-carrying and the felony (here, making a false statement to a customs officer), such that the explosives-carrying \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98facilitated\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\nor \xe2\x80\x9caided\xe2\x80\x9d the commission of the felony.  474 F.\xc2\xa03d 597, 604 (2007).  The Court interprets the statute to the contrary.  It holds that the statute requires no more than a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporal link\xe2\x80\x9d between the explosives-carrying and the felony, that is to say, the two need only have occurred at the same time.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3.  I cannot agree with either interpretation.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My problem with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is that it would permit conviction of any individual who legally carries explosives at the time that he engages in a totally unrelated felony.  \xe2\x80\x9cExplosives,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute tells us, includes not only obviously explosive material such as \xe2\x80\x9cgunpowders\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdynamite\xe2\x80\x9d but also any \xe2\x80\x9cchemical compounds\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmixture[s]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdevice[s]\xe2\x80\x9d whose \xe2\x80\x9cignition by fire, by friction, by concussion\xe2\x80\x9d or other means \xe2\x80\x9cmay cause an explosion.\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(j).  And that definition encompasses such commonplace materials as kerosene, gasoline, or certain fertilizers.  Moreover, the \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ying]\xe2\x80\x9d to which the statute refers includes carrying that is otherwise legal.  Further, the statute applies to the carrying of explosives during \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d federal felony, a category that ranges from murder to mail fraud.  See \xc2\xa71111 (2000 ed. and Supp. V); \xc2\xa71341 (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion brings within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope (and would impose an additional mandatory 10-year prison term upon), for example, a farmer lawfully transporting a load of fertilizer who intentionally mails an unauthorized lottery ticket to a friend, a hunter lawfully carrying gunpowder for shotgun shells who buys snacks with a counterfeit $20 bill, a truckdriver lawfully transporting diesel fuel who lies to a customs official about the value of presents he bought in Canada for his family, or an accountant who engaged in a 6-year-long conspiracy to commit tax evasion and who, one day during that conspiracy, bought gas for his lawnmower.  In such instances the lawful carrying of an \xe2\x80\x9cexplosive\xe2\x80\x9d has <em>nothing whatsoever</em> to do with the unlawful felonies. I cannot imagine why Congress would have wanted the presence of totally irrelevant, lawful behavior to trigger an additional 10-year mandatory prison term.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s language does not demand such an interpretation.  I agree with the majority that the word \xe2\x80\x9cduring\xe2\x80\x9d requires a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporal link.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 3.  But a statement that uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cduring\xe2\x80\x9d may or may not imply <em>other</em> limitations as well, depending upon the context in which the statement is made.  Thus, when I tell a friend from Puerto Rico, \xe2\x80\x9cI wear gloves during Washington\xe2\x80\x99s winter,\xe2\x80\x9d he does not think I mean baseball mitts.  Rather, I imply (and he understands) a relation or link between the gloves and the winter.  When I say to a group of lawyers, \xe2\x80\x9cI take notes during oral argument,\xe2\x80\x9d I imply (and they understand) that the notes bear a relation to the law being argued.  But when I say, \xe2\x80\x9cI called my brother during the day,\xe2\x80\x9d I do not imply any particular relation (other than a temporal relation) between the day and the phone call.  Context makes the difference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s context makes clear that the statutory statement does not cover a \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ying]\xe2\x80\x9d of explosives that is totally unrelated to the \xe2\x80\x9cfelony.\xe2\x80\x9d  The lengthy mandatory minimum sentence is evidence of what the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history separately indicates, namely that Congress sought to criminalize and impose harsh penalties in respect to the \xe2\x80\x9cintentional <em>misuse</em> of explosives,\xe2\x80\x9d see H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 91\xe2\x80\x931549, p.\xc2\xa038 (1970) (emphasis added) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).  A person who <em>lawfully</em> carries explosives while committing some other felony does not even arguably \xe2\x80\x9cmisuse\xe2\x80\x9d those explosives unless the carrying has something to do with the other felony.  Nor in the absence of some such relationship is there any obvious reason to impose an additional mandatory 10-year sentence on a person who <em>unlawfully</em> carries explosives while committing some other felony.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similar reasoning led the Ninth Circuit in 1985 to interpret a related statute, which punished the carrying of a <em>firearm</em> \xe2\x80\x9cduring\xe2\x80\x9d the commission of a federal felony, as requiring a significant relationship between the firearms-carrying and the other felony.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stewart</em>, 779 F.\xc2\xa02d 538.  Justice (then-Judge) Kennedy recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress did not intend to penalize one who happens to have a gun in his possession when he commits an entirely unrelated offense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 540 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, 580 F.\xc2\xa02d 360, 362 (CA9 1978)).  In my view, that same reasoning should apply when we interpret the explosives statute, which was originally modeled on the firearms statute.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 69 (the explosives statute \xe2\x80\x9ccarries over to the explosives area the stringent provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 relating to the use of firearms and the unlawful carrying of firearms to commit, or during the commission of a Federal felony\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I recognize that the language of the firearms statute now differs from the language of the explosives statute in an important way.  The firearms statute originally punished (with a 1-to-10-year sentence) a person who \xe2\x80\x9ccarries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any [federal] felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) (1964 ed., Supp. IV).  In 1984, Congress amended the firearms statute by providing a mandatory minimum punishment of five years and by striking the word \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71005(a), 98 Stat. 2138.  When it did so, Congress also added to the statute specific words of limitation, namely the words \xe2\x80\x9cand in relation to\xe2\x80\x9d (so that the statute covered any person who carried a firearm \xe2\x80\x9cduring and in relation to\xe2\x80\x9d the commission of a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The words \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to\xe2\x80\x9d do not appear in the explosives statute.  But neither did those words appear in the pre-1984 version of the firearms statute that was the subject of the Ninth Circuit opinion in <em>Stewart</em> (yet the Ninth Circuit nonetheless found an implicit relational requirement).  And the fact that these words now appear in the firearms statute but not the explosives statute cannot make the determinative difference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The history of the firearms statute makes clear that the reason Congress added to that statute the words \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to\xe2\x80\x9d has to do with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to remove from the firearms statute the word \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully\xe2\x80\x9d.  By removing that word, Congress indicated that the firearms statute should<em> </em>apply to \xe2\x80\x9cpersons who are licensed to carry firearms\xe2\x80\x9d but who \xe2\x80\x9cabuse that privilege by committing a crime with the weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, p.\xc2\xa0314, n.\xc2\xa010 (1983).  At the same time, however, Congress believed that the statute should not apply where the firearm\xe2\x80\x99s presence \xe2\x80\x9cplayed no part in the crime, such as a gun carried in a pocket and never displayed or referred to in the course of a pugilistic barroom fight.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The addition of the words \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to\xe2\x80\x9d made this dual objective textually clear.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of the words \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to\xe2\x80\x9d here must lead us to ask (but it does not answer) the question: Did Congress intend something different in respect to the explosives statute?  There are strong reasons for thinking it did not.  Congress, after all, amended the explosives statute in response to the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s express request to \xe2\x80\x9cbring\xe2\x80\x9d the explosives statute \xe2\x80\x9cin line with\xe2\x80\x9d the firearms statute.  See 131 Cong. Rec. 14166 (1985); see also 134 Cong. Rec. 32700 (1988) (statement of Sen. Biden) (noting that the purpose of amending the explosives statute was to \xe2\x80\x9cbring it in line with similar amendments [previously] adopted . . . with respect to the parallel offense of using or carrying a firearm during the commission of federal offenses\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress accordingly increased the mandatory minimum punishment to five years and struck the word \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa76474(b), 102 Stat. 4379\xe2\x80\x934380.  If Congress, in neglecting to add the words \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to,\xe2\x80\x9d sought to create a meaningful distinction between the explosives and firearms statutes, one would think that someone somewhere would have mentioned this objective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, to read the two statutes differently would break the very parallel treatment of firearms and explosives that led Congress, at the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s urging, to amend the explosives statute in the first place.  It would produce the peculiar and unfair results I previously mentioned.  See <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 2<em>. </em> It would conflict with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 original rationale for enacting the explosives statute (to punish the <em>misuse</em> of explosives).  And it would risk incoherent results: Why would Congress wish not to punish a policeman for carrying an unrelated revolver during the commission of a felony, but then wish to punish that same policeman for carrying unrelated gunpowder for unrelated bullets?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time one can explain the absence of the words \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to\xe2\x80\x9d in less damaging ways.   The legislative drafters of the explosives amendment may have assumed that prior judicial interpretation, (namely, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stewart, </em>779 F.\xc2\xa02d 538) made the words \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to\xe2\x80\x9d unnecessary.  See <em>Lorillard</em> v. <em>Pons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U. S. 575</a>, 580 (1978) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change\xe2\x80\x9d).  Or, as the majority recognizes, the omission of the language may reflect simple drafting inadvertence.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I concede that the presence of a phrase in one statute and the absence of the same phrase in another related statute can signal an intended difference in relative statutory scope.  But that is not inevitably so.  Cf. <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983) (noting only a <em>presumption</em> that Congress has acted intentionally and purposely if it \xe2\x80\x9cincludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And here the circumstances that I have mentioned make this a case in which that linguistic fact is not determinative.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No more here than elsewhere in life can words alone<em> </em>explain<em> </em>every nuance of their intended application.  Context matters.  And if judges are to give meaningful effect to the intent of the enacting legislature, they must interpret statutory text with reference to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and its history.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, with its decision today, makes possible the strange results I describe above precisely because it resolves the statutory interpretation question by examining the meaning of just one word in isolation.  In context, however, the language excludes from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope instances in which there is no significant relation between the explosives-carrying and the felony.  A contextual interpretation furthers Congress\xe2\x80\x99 original purpose, is less likely to encourage random punishment, and is consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s overall history.  As a result, like the Ninth Circuit, I would read the statute as insisting upon some (other than merely temporal) relationship between explosives carrying and \xe2\x80\x9cfelony.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, I cannot agree with the Ninth Circuit that the statute restricts the requisite relationship to one in which the carrying of the explosives \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98facilitated\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9caided\xe2\x80\x9d) the <em>felony</em>.  474 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 604.  In my view, the statute must also cover a felony committed to facilitate the <em>carrying of explosives</em>.  Why should it matter in which direction the facilitating flows?  Either way, there is a relation between the carrying of explosives and the other felony.  Either way, one might reasonably conclude that the presence of the explosives will elevate the risks of harm that otherwise would ordinarily arise out of the felony\xe2\x80\x99s commission.  Either way, one might consider the explosives \xe2\x80\x9cmisused.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, I believe the statute applies\nif the felony, here, the making of a false statement to\na customs officer, facilitated or aided the carrying of\nexplosives.  And I would remand the case for the Circuit\nto determine the presence or absence of that relevant relation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
