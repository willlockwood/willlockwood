Those two purchases were misdemeanors under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844, while Said\xe2\x80\x99s two sales were felonies, \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) and (b).  The Government charged Abuelhawa with six felonies on the theory that each of the phone calls, some placed by him, some by Said, violated \xc2\xa7843(b), which makes it a felony \xe2\x80\x9cto use any communication facility in \xe2\x80\xa6 facilitating\xe2\x80\x9d felony distribution and other drug crimes.  The District Court denied Abuelhawa\xe2\x80\x99s acquittal motion, in which he argued that his efforts to make misdemeanor purchases could not be treated as facilitating Said\xe2\x80\x99s felonies.  The jury convicted Abuelhawa on all six felony counts.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d should be given its ordinary meaning in \xc2\xa7843(b) and that Abuelhawa\xe2\x80\x99s use of a phone to buy cocaine counted as ordinary facilitation because it made Said\xe2\x80\x99s distribution of the drug easier.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Using a telephone to make a misdemeanor drug purchase does not \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d felony drug distribution in violation of \xc2\xa7843(b).  Stopping with the plain meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate\xe2\x80\x9d here would ignore the rule that because statutes are not read as a collection of isolated phrases, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U.

The literal sweep of \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d sits uncomfortably with common usage:\xc2\xa0Where a transaction like a sale necessarily presupposes two parties with specific roles, it would be odd to speak of one party as facilitating the other\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  The common usage has its parallel in cases holding that where a statute treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently, adding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the other would upend the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s punishment calibration.  In <em>Gebardi</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/112/index.html">287 U. S. 112</a>, 119, for example, the Court held that a woman who voluntarily crossed a state line with a man to have sex could not be tagged with the Mann Act violation for \xe2\x80\x9caid[ing] or assist[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d interstate transportation for immoral purposes because the statutory penalties were \xe2\x80\x9cclearly directed against the acts of the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the subject of the transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such cases have a bearing here in two ways.  First, given the presumption, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 380\xe2\x80\x93381, and n.\xc2\xa012, that the Congress that enacted \xc2\xa7843(b) was familiar with the traditional judicial limitation on applying terms like \xe2\x80\x9caid,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cabet,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cassist,\xe2\x80\x9d it is likely the Legislature had a comparable scope in mind when it used \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate,\xe2\x80\x9d a word with equivalent meaning.  Second, any broader reading would for practical purposes substantially skew the congressional calibration of respective buyer-seller penalties.  Moreover, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history\xe2\x80\x94which shows that in 1970 the CSA downgraded simple possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, \xc2\xa7844(a), and simultaneously limited the communications provision\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of facilitating a drug \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d to facilitating a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7843(b)\xe2\x80\x94drives home what is clear from the statutory text: Congress meant to treat purchasing drugs for personal use more leniently than felony distribution, and to narrow the scope of the communications provision to cover only those who facilitate a felony.  Yet, under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7843(b), in a substantial number of cases Congress would for all practical purposes simultaneously have graded back up to felony status with the left hand the same offense, simple drug possession, it had dropped to a misdemeanor with the right.  Given that Congress used no language spelling out a purpose so improbable, but legislated against a background usage of terms such as \xe2\x80\x9caid,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cabet,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cassist\xe2\x80\x9d that points in the opposite direction and accords with the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s choice to classify small purchases as misdemeanors, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position is just too unlikely.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7843(b).  The question here is whether someone violates \xc2\xa7843(b) in making a misdemeanor drug purchase because his phone call to the dealer can be said to facilitate the felony of drug distribution.  The answer is no.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FBI agents believed Mohammed Said was selling cocaine and got a warrant to tap his cell phone.  In the course of listening in, they recorded six calls between Said and petitioner Salman Khade Abuelhawa, during which Abuelhawa arranged to buy cocaine from Said in two separate transactions, each time a single gram.  Abuelhawa\xe2\x80\x99s two purchases were misdemeanors, \xc2\xa7844, while Said\xe2\x80\x99s two sales were felonies, \xc2\xa7841(a)(1) and (b).  The Government nonetheless charged Abuelhawa with six felonies on the theory that each of the phone calls, whether placed by Abuelhawa or by Said, had been made \xe2\x80\x9cin causing or facilitating\xe2\x80\x9d Said\xe2\x80\x99s felonies, in violation of \xc2\xa7843(b).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Abuelhawa moved for acquittal as a matter of law, arguing that his efforts to commit the misdemeanors of buying cocaine could not be treated as causing or facilitating Said\xe2\x80\x99s felonies, but the District Court denied his motion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a\xe2\x80\x9325a, and the jury convicted him on all six felony counts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abuelhawa argued the same point to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, with as much success.  The Circuit reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cfor purposes of \xc2\xa7843(b), \xe2\x80\x98facilitate\xe2\x80\x99 should be given its \xe2\x80\x98common meaning\xe2\x80\x94to make easier or less difficult, or to assist or aid.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  523 F.\xc2\xa03d 415, 420 (2008) (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lozano</em>, 839 F.\xc2\xa02d 1020, 1023 (CA4 1988)).  The court said Abuelhawa\xe2\x80\x99s use of a phone to buy cocaine counted as ordinary facilitation because it \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly made Said\xe2\x80\x99s cocaine distribution easier; in fact, \xe2\x80\x98it made the sale possible.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  523 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 421 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Binkley</em>, 903 F.\xc2\xa02d 1130, 1136 (CA7 1990) (emphasis deleted)). \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 555 U.

And of course on the literal plane, the phone calls could be described as \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitating\xe2\x80\x9d drug distribution; they \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly made . . . distribution easier.\xe2\x80\x9d  523 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 421.  But stopping there would ignore the rule that, because statutes are not read as a collection of isolated phrases, see <em>United States Nat. Bank of Ore.</em> v. <em>Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/439/index.html">508 U. S. 439</a>, 455 (1993), \xe2\x80\x9c[a] word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U. S. 481</a>, 486 (2006).  We think the word here does not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s literal sweep of \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate\xe2\x80\x9d sits uncomfortably with common usage.  Where a transaction like a sale necessarily presupposes two parties with specific roles, it would be odd to speak of one party as facilitating the conduct of the other.  A buyer does not just make a sale easier; he makes the sale possible.  No buyer, no sale; the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s part is already implied by the term \xe2\x80\x9csale,\xe2\x80\x9d and the word \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate\xe2\x80\x9d adds nothing.  We would not say that the borrower facilitates the bank loan. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, however, replies that using the instrument of communication under \xc2\xa7843(b) is different from borrowing the money or merely handing over the sale price for cocaine.  Drugs can be sold without anyone\xe2\x80\x99s mailing a letter or using a cell phone.  Because cell phones, say, really do make it easier for dealers to break the law, Congress probably meant to ratchet up the culpability of the buyer who calls ahead.  But we think that argument comes up short against several more reasons that count against the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common usage that limits \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate\xe2\x80\x9d to the efforts of someone other than a primary or necessary actor in the commission of a substantive crime has its parallel in the decided cases.  The traditional law is that where a statute treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently, adding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the other would upend the calibration of punishment set by the legislature, a line of reasoning exemplified in the courts\xe2\x80\x99 consistent refusal to treat noncriminal liquor purchases as falling under the prohibition against aiding or abetting the illegal sale of alcohol.  See <em>Lott</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 205 F. 28, 29\xe2\x80\x9331 (CA9 1913) (collecting cases).  And this Court followed the same course in rejecting the broadest possible reading of a similar provision in <em>Gebardi</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/112/index.html">287 U. S. 112</a> (1932).  The question there was whether a woman who voluntarily crossed a state line with a man to engage in \xe2\x80\x9cillicit sexual relations\xe2\x80\x9d could be tagged with \xe2\x80\x9caid[ing] or assist[ing] in \xe2\x80\xa6 transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce . . . any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or of debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the Mann Act, ch. 395, 36 Stat. 825.  <em>Gebardi</em>, 287 U. S., at 116\xe2\x80\x93118 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Since the statutory penalties were \xe2\x80\x9cclearly directed against the acts of the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the subject of the transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d we refused to \xe2\x80\x9cinfer that the mere acquiescence of the woman transported was intended to be condemned by the general language punishing those who aid and assist the transporter, any more than it has been inferred that the purchaser of liquor was to be regarded as an abettor of the illegal sale.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 119 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases do not strictly control the outcome of this one, but we think they have a bearing here, in two ways.  As we have said many times, we presume legislatures act with case law in mind, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 380\xe2\x80\x93381, and n.\xc2\xa012 (2000), and we presume here that when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7843(b), it was familiar with the traditional judicial limitation on applying terms like \xe2\x80\x9caid,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cabet,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cassist.\xe2\x80\x9d  We thus think it likely that Congress had comparable scope in mind when it used the term \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate,\xe2\x80\x9d a word with equivalent meaning, compare Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 76 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \xe2\x80\x9caid and abet\xe2\x80\x9d as to \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate the commission of a crime\xe2\x80\x9d) with <em>id</em>., at 627 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitation\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he act or an instance of aiding or helping; . . . the act of making it easier for another person to commit a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And applying the presumption is supported significantly by the fact that here, as in the earlier cases, any broader reading of \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate\xe2\x80\x9d would for practical purposes skew the congressional calibration of respective buyer-seller penalties.  When the statute was enacted, the use of land lines in drug transactions was common, and in these days when everyone over the age of three seems to carry a cell phone, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would skew the calibration of penalties very substantially.  The respect owed to that penalty calibration cannot be minimized.  Prior to 1970, Congress punished the receipt, concealment, purchase, or sale of any narcotic drug as a felony, see 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7174 (1964 ed.) (repealed), and on top of that added a minimum of two years, and up to five, for using a communication facility in committing, causing, or facilitating, any drug \xe2\x80\x9coffense,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71403 (1964 ed.).  In 1970, however, the CSA, 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801 <em>et seq.</em>, downgraded simple possession of a controlled substance to a misdemeanor, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a) (2006 ed.), and simultaneously limited the communications provision to prohibiting only the facilitation of a drug \xe2\x80\x9cfelony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7843(b).  This history drives home what is already clear in the current statutory text: Congress meant to treat purchasing drugs for personal use more leniently than the felony of distributing drugs, and to narrow the scope of the communications provision to cover only those who facilitate a drug felony.  Yet, under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7843(b), in a substantial number of cases Congress would for all practical purposes simultaneously have graded back up to felony status with the left hand the same offense it had dropped to a misdemeanor with the right.  As the Government sees it, Abuelhawa\xe2\x80\x99s use of a phone in making two small drug purchases would subject him, in fact, to six felony counts and a potential sentence of 24 years in prison, even though buying the same drugs minus the phone would have supported only two misdemeanor counts and two years of prison.  Given the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between simple possession and distribution, and the background history of these offenses, it is impossible to believe that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitating\xe2\x80\x9d to cause that twelve-fold quantum leap in punishment for simple drug possessors.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government suggests that this background usage and the 1970 choice to reduce culpability for possession is beside the point because Congress sometimes incorporates aggravating factors into the Criminal Code, and the phone use here is just one of them; the Government mentions possession by a prior drug offender, a felony punishable by up to two years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  And, for perspective, the Government points to unauthorized possession of flunitrazepim, a drug used to incapacitate rape victims, which is punishable by imprisonment up to three years.  Brief for United States 20.  It would not be strange, the Government says, for Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cdecid[e] to treat the use of a communication facility in a drug transaction as a significant act warranting additional punishment\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]oday\xe2\x80\x99s communication facilities . . . make illicit drug transactions easier and more efficient . . . . [and] greatly reduce the risk that the participants will be detected while negotiating a transaction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are skeptical.  There is no question that Congress intended \xc2\xa7843(b) to impede illicit drug transactions by penalizing the use of communication devices in coordinating illegal drug operations, and no doubt that its purpose will be served regardless of the outcome in this case.  But it does not follow that Congress also meant a first-time buyer\xe2\x80\x99s phone calls to get two small quantities of drugs for personal use to expose him to punishment 12 times more severe than a purchase by a recidivist offender and 8 times more severe than the unauthorized possession of a drug used by rapists.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  To the contrary, Congress used no language spelling out a purpose so improbable, but legislated against a background usage of terms such as \xe2\x80\x9caid,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cabet,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cassist\xe2\x80\x9d that points in the opposite direction and accords with the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s choice to classify small purchases as misdemeanors.

Brief for United States 21 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  This shows that Congress knew how to be clear in punishing the facilitation of a misdemeanor as a felony, and it only highlights Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to limit \xc2\xa7843(b) to the facilitation of a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Government asks us to affirm the Fourth Circuit on an alternative ground: that Abuelhawa used a communication facility \xe2\x80\x9cin causing\xe2\x80\x9d Said\xe2\x80\x99s drug felony rather than \xe2\x80\x9cin . . . facilitating\xe2\x80\x9d the felony.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument on this point takes the same form as its argument about the term \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate,\xe2\x80\x9d and the reasons that lead us to reject the one argument apply just as well to the other.  </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
