S. 511</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question for decision is whether \xc2\xa7 2 of the National Firearms Act of June 26, 1934, c. 757, 48 Stat. 1236, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1132-1132q, which imposes a $200 annual license tax on dealers in firearms, is a constitutional exercise of the legislative power of Congress.</p>\n<p>Petitioner was convicted by the District Court for Eastern Illinois on two counts of an indictment, the first charging him with violation of \xc2\xa7 2 by dealing in firearms without payment of the tax.  On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the conviction on the second count and affirmed on the first.  86 F.2d 486. On petition of the accused we granted certiorari, limited to the question of the constitutional validity of the statute in its application under the first count in the indictment.</p>\n<p>Section 2 of the National Firearms Act requires every dealer in firearms to register with the Collector of Internal Revenue in the district where he carries on business, and to pay a special excise tax of $200 a year.  Importers or manufacturers are taxed $500 a year.  Section 3 imposes a tax of $200 on each transfer of a firearm, payable by the transferor, and \xc2\xa7 4 prescribes regulations for the identification of purchasers.  The term "firearm" is defined by \xc2\xa7 1 as meaning a shotgun or a rifle having a barrel less than eighteen inches in length, or any other weapon, except </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 300 U. S. 512</a></p><p> a pistol or revolver, from which a shot is discharged by an explosive, if capable of being concealed on the person, or a machine gun, and includes a muffler or silencer for any firearm.  As the conviction for nonpayment of the tax exacted by \xc2\xa7 2 has alone been sustained, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the different tax levied by \xc2\xa7 3 and the regulations pertaining to it are valid.  Section 16 declares that the provisions of the act are separable.  Each tax is on a different activity, and is collectible independently of the other.  Full effect may be given to the license tax standing alone, even though all other provisions are invalid.  <em>Weller v.

S. 94</a></span>.  Petitioner does not deny that Congress may tax his business as a dealer in firearms.  He insists that the present levy is not a true tax, but a penalty imposed for the purpose of suppressing traffic in a certain noxious type of firearms, the local regulation of which is reserved to the states because not granted to the national government.  To establish its penal and prohibitive character, he relies on the amounts of the tax imposed by \xc2\xa7 2 on dealers, manufacturers, and importers, and of the tax imposed by \xc2\xa7 3 on each transfer of a "firearm," payable by the transferor.  The cumulative effect on the distribution of a limited class of firearms of relatively small value by the successive imposition of different taxes, one on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 300 U. S. 513</a></p><p> business of the importer or manufacturer, another on that of the dealer, and a third on the transfer to a buyer, is said to be prohibitive in effect, and to disclose unmistakably the legislative purpose to regulate, rather than to tax.</p>\n<p>The case is not one where the statute contains regulatory provisions related to a purported tax in such a way as has enabled this Court to say in other cases that the latter is a penalty resorted to as a means of enforcing the regulations.  <em>See Child Labor Tax Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/20/case.html">259 U. S. 20</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/20/case.html#35">259 U. S. 35</a></span>; <em>Hill v.

Carter Coal Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/298/238/case.html">298 U. S. 238</a></span>.  Nor is the subject of the tax described or treated as criminal by the taxing statute.  <em>Compare United States v. Constantine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/287/case.html">296 U. S. 287</a></span>.  Here, \xc2\xa7 2 contains no regulation other than the mere registration provisions, which are obviously supportable as in aid of a revenue purpose.  On its face, it is only a taxing measure, and we are asked to say that the tax, by virtue of its deterrent effect on the activities taxed, operates as a regulation which is beyond the congressional power.</p>\n<p>Every tax is in some measure regulatory.  To some extent, it interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed, as compared with others not taxed.  But a tax is not any the less a tax because it has a regulatory effect, <em>United States v. Doremus, supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/86/case.html#93">249 U. S. 93</a></span>-94; <em>Nigro v.
