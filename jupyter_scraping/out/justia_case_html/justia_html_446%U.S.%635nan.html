JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented is whether, in an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 against a public official whose position might entitle him to qualified immunity, a plaintiff must </p><p><a class="page-number" name="636">Page 446 U. S. 636</a></p><p> allege that the official has acted in bad faith in order to state a claim for relief or, alternatively, whether the defendant must plead good faith as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner Carlos Rivera Gomez brought this action against respondent, the Superintendent of the Police of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, contending that respondent had violated his right to procedural due process by discharging him from employment with the Police Department\'s Bureau of Criminal Investigation. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Basing jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3), [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] petitioner alleged the following facts in his complaint. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Petitioner had been employed as an agent with the Puerto Rican police since 1968.  In April, 1975, he submitted a sworn statement to his supervisor in which he asserted that two other agents had offered false evidence for use in a criminal case under their investigation.  As a result of this statement, petitioner was immediately transferred from the Criminal Investigation Corps for the Southern Area to Police Headquarters in San Juan, and a few weeks later to the Police Academy in Gurabo, where he was given no investigative authority.  In the meantime respondent ordered an investigation of petitioner\'s claims, and the Legal Division of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="637">Page 446 U. S. 637</a></p><p> the Police Department concluded that all of petitioner\'s factual allegations were true.</p>\n<p>In April, 1976, while still stationed at the Police Academy, petitioner was subpoenaed to give testimony in a criminal case arising out of the evidence that petitioner had alleged to be false.  At the trial, petitioner, appearing as a defense witness, testified that the evidence was in fact false.  As a result of this testimony, criminal charges, filed on the basis of information furnished by respondent, were brought against petitioner for the allegedly unlawful wiretapping of the agents\' telephones.  Respondent suspended petitioner in May, 1976, and discharged him without a hearing in July.  In October, the District Court of Puerto Rico found no probable cause to believe that petitioner was guilty of the allegedly unlawful wiretapping and, upon appeal by the prosecution, the Superior Court affirmed.  Petitioner, in turn, sought review of his discharge before the Investigation, Prosecution, and Appeals Commission of Puerto Rico, which, after a hearing, revoked the discharge order rendered by respondent and ordered that petitioner be reinstated with backpay.</p>\n<p>Based on the foregoing factual allegations, petitioner brought this suit for damages, contending that his discharge violated his right to procedural due process, and that it had caused him anxiety, embarrassment, and injury to his reputation in the community.  In his answer, respondent denied a number of petitioner\'s allegations of fact and asserted several affirmative defenses.  Respondent then moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, <em>see</em> Fed.Rule Civ Proc. 12(b)(6), and the District Court granted the motion.  Observing that respondent was entitled to qualified immunity for acts done in good faith within the scope of his official duties, it concluded that petitioner was required to plead as part of his claim for relief that, in committing the actions alleged, respondent was motivated by bad faith.  The absence of any such allegation, it held, required dismissal of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="638">Page 446 U. S. 638</a></p><p> the complaint.  The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.  602 F.2d 1018 (1979). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict anong the Courts of Appeals. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  444 U.S. 1031 (1980).

Navarette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/555/case.html">434 U. S. 555</a></span> (1978) (prison officials); <em>O\'Connor v.

S. 232</a></span> (1974) (state Governor and other executive officers).  <em>Cf. Owen v. City of Independence, supra,</em> (no qualified immunity for municipalities).</p>\n<p>Nothing in the language or legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="640">Page 446 U. S. 640</a></p><p> however, suggests that, in an action brought against a public official whose position might entitle him to immunity if he acted in good faith, a plaintiff must allege bad faith in order to state a claim for relief.  By the plain terms of \xc2\xa7 1983, two -- and only two -- allegations are required in order to state a cause of action under that statute.  First, the plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a federal right.  Second, he must allege that the person who has deprived him of that right acted under color of state or territorial law.  <em>See Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#171">365 U. S. 171</a></span> (1961).  Petitioner has made both of the required allegations.  He alleged that his discharge by respondent violated his right to procedural due process, <em>see Board of Regents v. Roth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/case.html">408 U. S. 564</a></span> (1972), and that respondent acted under color of Puerto Rican law.  <em>See Monroe v. Pape, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#172">365 U. S. 172</a></span>-187. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, this Court has never indicated that qualified immunity is relevant to the existence of the plaintiff\'s cause of action; instead, we have described it as a defense available to the official in question.  <em>See Procuner v. Navarette, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/555/case.html#562">434 U. S. 562</a></span>; <em>Pierson v.

Since qualified immunity is a defense, the burden of pleading it rests with the defendant.  <em>See</em> Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 8(c) (defendant must plead any "matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense"); 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 1271 (1969).  It is for the official to claim that his conduct was justified by an objectively reasonable belief that it was lawful.  We see no basis for imposing on the plaintiff an obligation to anticipate such a defense by stating in his complaint that the defendant acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion as to the allocation of the burden of pleading is supported by the nature of the qualified immunity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="641">Page 446 U. S. 641</a></p><p> defense.  As our decisions make clear, whether such immunity has been established depends on facts peculiarly within the knowledge and control of the defendant.  Thus, we have stated that</p>\n<p>"[i]t is the existence of reasonable grounds for the belief formed at the time and in light of all the circumstances, coupled with good faith belief, that affords a basis for qualified immunity of executive officers for acts performed in the course of official conduct."</p>\n<p><em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/case.html#247">416 U. S. 247</a></span>-248.  The applicable test focuses not only on whether the official has an objectively reasonable basis for that belief, but also on whether "[t]he official himself [is] acting sincerely, and with a belief that he is doing right," <em>Wood v. Strickland, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/308/case.html#321">420 U. S. 321</a></span>.  There may be no way for a plaintiff to know in advance whether the official has such a belief or, indeed, whether he will even claim that he does.  The existence of a subjective belief will frequently turn on factors which a plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to know.  For example, the official\'s belief may be based on state or local law, advice of counsel, administrative practice, or some other factor of which the official alone is aware.  To impose the pleading burden on the plaintiff would ignore this elementary fact, and be contrary to the established practice in analogous areas of the law.
