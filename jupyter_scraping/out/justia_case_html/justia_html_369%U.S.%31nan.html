Plaintiffs have appealed, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253; <em>NAACP v. Bennett,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/471/case.html">360 U. S. 471</a></span>.  We denied a motion to stay the prosecution of a number of criminal cases pending disposition of this appeal.  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/346/case.html">368 U.

They cannot </p><p><a class="page-number" name="33">Page 369 U. S. 33</a></p><p> represent a class of whom they are not a part.  <em>McCabe v. Atchison, T. &amp; S.F. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/235/151/case.html">235 U. S. 151</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/235/151/case.html#162">235 U.

But, as passengers using the segregated transportation facilities, they are aggrieved parties, and have standing to enforce their rights to nonsegregated treatment.  <em>Mitchell v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/80/case.html">313 U. S. 80</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/80/case.html#93">313 U. S. 93</a></span>; <em>Evers v. Dwyer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/202/case.html">358 U. S. 202</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We have settled beyond question that no State may require racial segregation of interstate or intrastate transportation facilities.  <em>Morgan v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/373/case.html">328 U. S. 373</a></span>; <em>Gayle v. Browder,</em> 352 U.S. 903; <em>Boynton v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/454/case.html">364 U. S. 454</a></span>.  The question is no longer open; it is foreclosed as a litigable issue.  Section 2281 does not require a three-judge court when the claim that a statute is unconstitutional is wholly insubstantial, legally speaking nonexistent.  <em>Ex parte Poresky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/30/case.html">290 U. S. 30</a></span>; <em>Bell v. Waterfront Comm.,</em> 279 F.2d 853, 857-858.  We hold that three judges are similarly not required when, as here, prior decisions make frivolous any claim that a state statute on its face is not unconstitutional.  <em>Willis v. Walker,</em> 136 F.Supp. 181; <em>Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board,</em> 138 F.Supp. 336; <em>Kelley v. Board of Education,</em> 139 F.Supp. 578.  We denied leave to file petitions for mandamus in <em>Bush,</em> 351 U.S. 948, and from a similar ruling in <em>Booker v. Tennessee Board of Education,</em> 351 U.S. 948.  The reasons for convening an extraordinary court are inapplicable in such cases, for the policy behind the three-judge requirement -- that a single judge ought not to be empowered to invalidate a state statute under a federal claim -- does not apply.  The three-judge requirement is a technical one, to be narrowly construed, <em>Phillips v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/246/case.html">312 U. S. 246</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/246/case.html#251">312 U. S. 251</a></span>.  The statute comes into play only when an injunction is sought "upon the ground of the unconstitutionality" of a statute.  There is no such ground when the constitutional issue presented is essentially fictitious. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="34">Page 369 U. S. 34</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This case is therefore not one "required . . . to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges," 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253, and therefore cannot be brought here on direct appeal.  However, we have jurisdiction to determine the authority of the court below and "to make such corrective order as may be appropriate to the enforcement of the limitations which that section imposes," <em>Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/16/case.html">292 U. S. 16</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/16/case.html#18">292 U. S. 18</a></span>; <em>Oklahoma Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v.
