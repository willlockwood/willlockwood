[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The specific issue presented is whether a prisoner incarcerated in a jurisdiction that has adopted the Extradition Act is entitled to the procedural protections of that Act -- particularly the right to a pretransfer hearing -- before being transferred to another jurisdiction pursuant to Art. IV of the Detainer Agreement.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held as a matter of statutory construction that a prisoner is entitled to such protections.  592 F.2d 720 (1979).  The Courts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 449 U. S. 436</a></p><p> of Appeals and state courts are divided upon the question, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  444 U.S. 1069 (1980).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In April, 1976, respondent John Adams was convicted in Pennsylvania state court of robbery and was sentenced to 30 years in the State Correctional Institution at Graterford, Pa.  The Camden County (New Jersey) prosecutor\'s office subsequently lodged a detainer against respondent, and in May, 1977, filed a "Request for Temporary Custody" pursuant to Art. IV of the Detainer Agreement in order to bring him to Camden for trial on charges of armed robbery and other offenses. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In an effort to prevent his transfer, respondent filed a <em>pro se</em> class action complaint in June, 1977, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  He sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1981 and 1983, alleging (1) that petitioners had violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses by failing to grant him the pretransfer hearing that would have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 449 U. S. 437</a></p><p> been available had he been transferred pursuant to the Extradition Act; and (2) that petitioners had violated the Due Process Clause by failing to inform him of his right pursuant to Art. IV (a) of the Detainer Agreement to petition Pennsylvania\'s Governor to disapprove New Jersey\'s request for custody.  Respondent contended, <em>inter alia,</em> that had he been granted a hearing or advised of his right to petition the Governor, he would have been able to convince Pennsylvania authorities to deny the custody request. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court, without reaching the class certification issue, dismissed respondent\'s complaint in October, 1977, for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  441 F.Supp. 556.  Respondent was then transferred to New Jersey, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] where he was convicted, sentenced to a 9 1/2-year prison term (to be served concurrently with his Pennsylvania sentence), and returned to Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the District Court judgment and remanded for further proceedings.  592 F.2d 720 (1979).  Finding no need to reach respondent\'s constitutional claims, <em>see Hagans v. Lavine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/case.html">415 U. S. 528</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/case.html#543">415 U. S. 543</a></span> (1974), it concluded as a matter of statutory construction that respondent had a right under Art. IV (d) of the Detainer Agreement to the procedural safeguards, including a pretransfer "hearing," prescribed by \xc2\xa7 10 of the Extradition Act.  It made no finding with respect to respondent\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 449 U. S. 438</a></p><p> argument that he was entitled to notification of his right to petition the Governor. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>While this case was on appeal, a Pennsylvania state court held that state prisoners transferred under Art. IV of the Detainer Agreement have no constitutional right to a pretransfer hearing.  <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Coleman v. Cuyler,</em> 261 Pa.Super. 274, 396 A.2d 394 (1978).  Although the Court of Appeals did not reach this constitutional issue, it held that it was not bound by the state court\'s result, because the Detainer Agreement is an interstate compact approved by Congress, and is thus a federal law subject to federal, rather than state, construction.  Before reaching the merits of the Third Circuit\'s decision, we must determine whether that conclusion was correct.  We hold that it was.</p>\n<p>The Compact Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10, cl. 3, provides that "No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State. . . ."  Because congressional consent transforms an interstate compact within this Clause into a law of the United States, we have held that the construction of an interstate agreement sanctioned by Congress under the Compact Clause presents a federal question.  <em>See Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/275/case.html">359 U.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It thus remains to be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 449 U. S. 439</a></p><p> determined whether the Detainer Agreement is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact within Art I, \xc2\xa7 10, of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>The requirement of congressional consent is at the heart of the Compact Clause.  By vesting in Congress the power to grant or withhold consent, or to condition consent on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 449 U. S. 440</a></p><p> States\' compliance with specified conditions, the Framers sought to ensure that Congress would maintain ultimate supervisory power over cooperative state action that might otherwise interfere with the full and free exercise of federal authority.  <em>See</em> Frankfurter &amp; Landis, The Compact Clause of the Constitution -- A Study in Interstate Adjustments, 34 Yale L.J. 685, 69695 (1925).</p>\n<p>Congressional consent is not required for interstate agreements that fall outside the scope of the Compact Clause.  Where an agreement is not</p>\n<p>"directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States,"</p>\n<p>it does not fall within the scope of the Clause, and will not be invalidated for lack of congressional consent.  <em>See, e.g., United States Steel Corp. v.

But where Congress has authorized the States to enter into a cooperative agreement, and where the subject matter of that agreement is an appropriate subject for congressional legislation, the consent of Congress transforms the States\' agreement into federal law under the Compact Clause. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 449 U. S. 441</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Congress may consent to an interstate compact by authorizing joint state action in advance or by giving expressed or implied approval to an agreement the States have already joined.  <em>Virginia v.

In the case of the Detainer Agreement, Congress gave its consent in advance by enacting the Crime Control Consent Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 909, as amended. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In pertinent part, this Act provides:</p>\n<p>"The consent of Congress is hereby given to any two or more States to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and in the enforcement of their respective criminal laws and policies. . . ."</p>\n<p>4 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 112 (a).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 449 U. S. 442</a></p><p> Because this Act was intended to be a grant of consent under the Compact Clause, and because the subject matter of the Act is an appropriate subject for congressional legislation, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] we conclude that the Detainer Agreement is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact the interpretation of which presents a question of federal law.  We therefore turn to the merits of the Court of Appeals\' holding that, as a matter of statutory construction, Art. IV (d) of the Detainer Agreement is to be read as incorporating the procedural safeguards provided by \xc2\xa7 10 of the Extradition Act. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 449 U. S. 443</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Detainer Agreement and the Extradition Act both establish procedures for the transfer of a prisoner in one jurisdiction to the temporary custody of another jurisdiction.  A prisoner transferred under the Extradition Act is explicitly granted a right to a pretransfer "hearing" at which he is informed of the receiving State\'s request for custody, his right to counsel, and his right to apply for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the custody request.  He is also permitted "a reasonable time" in which to apply for the writ. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  However, no similar explicit provision is to be found in the Detainer Agreement.</p>\n<p>The Detainer Agreement establishes two procedures under which the prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged may be transferred to the temporary custody of the receiving State.  One of these procedures may be invoked by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 449 U. S. 444</a></p><p> prisoner; the other by the prosecuting attorney of the receiving State.</p>\n<p>Article III of the Agreement provides the prisoner-initiated procedure.  It requires the warden to notify the prisoner of all outstanding detainers, and then to inform him of his right to request final disposition of the criminal charges underlying those detainers.  If the prisoner initiates the transfer by demanding disposition (which, under the Agreement, automatically extends to all pending charges in the receiving State), the authorities in the receiving State must bring him to trial within 180 days or the charges will be dismissed with prejudice, absent good cause shown.</p>\n<p>Article IV of the Agreement provides the procedure by which the prosecutor in the receiving State may initiate the transfer.  First, the prosecutor must file with the authorities in the sending State written notice of the custody request, approved by a court having jurisdiction to hear the underlying charges.  For the next 30 days, the prisoner and prosecutor must wait while the Governor of the sending State, on his own motion or that of the prisoner, decides whether to disapprove the request. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  If the Governor does not disapprove, the prisoner is transferred to the temporary custody of the receiving State, where he must be brought to trial on the charges underlying the detainer within 120 days of his arrival.  Again, if the prisoner is not brought to trial within the time period, the charges will be dismissed with prejudice, absent good cause shown.</p>\n<p>Although nothing in the Detainer Agreement explicitly provides for a pretransfer hearing, respondent contends that prisoners who are involuntarily transferred under Art. IV are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 449 U. S. 445</a></p><p> entitled to greater procedural protections than those who initiate the transfer procedure under Art. III.  He argues that a prisoner who initiates his own transfer to the receiving State receives a significant benefit under the Agreement, and may thus be required to waive any right he might have to contest his transfer; but that a prisoner transferred against his will to the receiving State under Art. IV does not benefit from the Agreement, and is thus entitled to assert any right he might have had under the Extradition Act (or any other state law applicable to interstate transfer of prisoners) to challenge his transfer.</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s argument has substantial support in the language of the Detainer Agreement.  Article III (e) provides that</p>\n<p>"[a]ny request for final disposition made by a prisoner [under this Article] <em>shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition</em> with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby. . . ."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  The reference to "waiver of extradition" can reasonably be interpreted to mean "waiver of those rights the sending state affords persons being extradited."  Since Pennsylvania has adopted the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, those rights would include the rights provided by \xc2\xa7 10 of that Act.</p>\n<p>The language of Art. IV supports respondent\'s further contention that a prisoner\'s extradition rights are meant to be preserved when the receiving State seeks disposition of an outstanding detainer.  Article IV (d) provides:</p>\n<p>"Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery."</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that the phrase "as provided in paragraph (a) hereof" modifies "right," not "delivery," and that paragraph </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 449 U. S. 446</a></p><p> (d) does no more than protect the right paragraph (a) gives the prisoner to petition the Governor to disapprove the custody request. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The Court of Appeals rejected this interpretation, concluding that the phrase "as provided in paragraph (a) hereof" modifies "delivery," not "right."  Since the major thrust of paragraph (a) is to describe the means by which the receiving State may obtain temporary custody of the prisoner, the Court of Appeals held that paragraph (d) must have been intended as the vehicle for incorporating all rights a prisoner would have under state or other laws to contest his transfer, except that the prisoner must forfeit his right, otherwise available under \xc2\xa7 7 of the Extradition Act, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] to oppose such transfer on the ground that the Governor had not explicitly approved the custody request.</p>\n<p>There are three textual reasons why we find this interpretation convincing.  First, if paragraph (d) protects only the right provided by paragraph (a) to petition the Governor, as petitioners claim, it is difficult to understand what purpose paragraph (d) serves in the Agreement.  Why would the drafters add a second provision to protect a right already explicitly provided?  Common sense requires paragraph (d) to be construed as securing something more.</p>\n<p>Second, the one ground for contesting a transfer that paragraph (d) explicitly withholds from the prisoner -- that the transfer has not been affirmatively approved by the Governor </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 449 U. S. 447</a></p><p> -- is a ground that the Extradition Act expressly reserves to the prisoner. It is surely reasonable to conclude from the elimination of this ground in the Detainer Agreement that the drafters meant the Detainer Agreement o be read as not affecting any rights given prisoners by the Extradition Act that are not expressly withheld by the Detainer Agreement.  As the Court of Appeals concluded,</p>\n<p>"the fact that Article IV(d) does specifically refer to one minor procedural feature of the extradition process which is to be affected suggests forcefully that the other aspects, particularly those furnishing safeguards to the prisoner, are to continue in effect."</p>\n<p>592 F.2d at 724.</p>\n<p>Finally, paragraph (d) refers to "<em>any</em> right [the prisoner] may have" (emphasis added) to challenge the legality of his transfer.  This suggests that more than one right is involved, a suggestion that is consistent with respondent\'s contention that all preexisting rights are preserved.  If petitioners\' contention were correct -- that the only right preserved is the right provided in paragraph (a) to petition the Governor -- it is much more likely that paragraph (d) would have referred narrowly to "<em>the</em> right the prisoner <em>does</em> have" to challenge the legality of his transfer.</p>\n<p>The legislative history of the Detainer Agreement, contained in the comments on the draft Agreement made by the Council of State Governments at its 1956 conference and circulated to all the adopting States, further supports the Court of Appeals\' reading.  In discussing the different degrees of protection to which a prisoner is entitled under Arts. III and IV of the Agreement, the drafters stated:</p>\n<p>"<em>Article IV (d) safeguards certain of the prisoner\'s rights.</em>  Normally, the only way to get a prisoner from one jurisdiction to another for purposes of trial on an indictment, information or complaint is through resort to extradition or waiver thereof.  If the prisoner waives, there is no problem.  However, <em>if he does not waive extradition, it</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 449 U. S. 448</a></p><p> <em>is not appropriate to attempt to force him to give up the safeguards of the extradition process,</em> even if this could be done constitutionally."</p>\n<p>Council of State Governments, Suggested State Legislation, Program for 1957, pp. 78-79 (1956) (emphasis added).  The suggestion, of course, is that a prisoner transferred against his will under Art. IV should be entitled to whatever "safeguards of the extradition process" he might otherwise have enjoyed.  Those safeguards include the procedural protections of the Extradition Act (in those States that have adopted it), as well as any other procedural protections the sending State guarantees persons being extradited from within its borders.</p>\n<p>That this is what the drafters intended is further suggested by the distinction they make between Art. III and Art. IV procedures:</p>\n<p>"The situation contemplated by this portion of the agreement [Article IV] is different than that dealt with in Article III.  [Article III] relates to proceedings initiated at the request of the prisoner.  Accordingly, in such instances, it is fitting that the prisoner be required to waive extradition.  In Article IV, the prosecutor initiates the proceeding.  Consequently, it probably would be improper to require the prisoner to waive those features of the extradition process which are designed for the protection of his rights."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 79.  These statements strongly support respondent\'s contention that prisoners were meant to be treated differently depending on which Article was being invoked, and that the general body of procedural rights available in the extradition context was meant to be preserved when the transfer was effected pursuant to Art. IV.</p>\n<p>Article IX of the Detainer Agreement states that the Agreement "shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purpose."  The legislative history of the Agreement, including </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 449 U. S. 449</a></p><p> the comments of the Council of State Governments and the congressional Reports and debates preceding the adoption of the Agreement on behalf of the District of Columbia and the Federal Government, emphasizes that a primary purpose of the Agreement is to protect prisoners against whom detainers are outstanding.  As stated in the House and Senate Reports:</p>\n<p>"[A] prisoner who has had a detainer lodged against him is seriously disadvantaged by such action.  He is in custody, and therefore in no position to seek witnesses or to preserve his defense.  He must often be kept in close custody, and is ineligible for desirable work assignments.  What is more, when detainers are filed against a prisoner, he sometimes loses interest in institutional opportunities, because he must serve his sentence without knowing what additional sentences may lie before him, or when, if ever, he will be in a position to employ the education and skills he may be developing."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 91-1018, p. 3 (1970); S.Rep. No. 91-1356, p. 3 (1970).  The remedial purpose of the Agreement supports an interpretation that gives prisoners the right to a judicial hearing in which they can bring a limited challenge to the receiving State\'s custody request. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  In light of the purpose of the Detainer Agreement, as reflected in the structure of the Agreement, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 449 U.

Initially drafted by the Council of State Governments in 1956 and included in the Council\'s Suggested State Legislation Program for 1957, the Agreement establishes procedures by which one jurisdiction may obtain temporary custody of a prisoner incarcerated in another jurisdiction for the purpose of bringing that prisoner to trial.

In light of our recent decisions, however, it cannot seriously be contended that the Detainer Agreement constitutes an "agreement or compact" as those terms have come to be understood in the Compact Clause.  In <em>New Hampshire v. Maine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/363/case.html">426 U.

Multistate Tax Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/452/case.html">434 U.

Certainly nothing about the Detainer Agreement threatens the just supremacy of the United States or enhances state power to the detriment of federal sovereignty.  As with the "compact" in <em>Multistate Tax Comm\'n,</em> any State is free to join the Detainer Agreement, so it cannot be considered to elevate member States at the expense of nonmembers.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/452/case.html#477">434 U.

S. 441</a></span>, n. 9, the views of the drafters of the Agreement or its form are not controlling.  The agreement involved in <em>Multistate Tax Comm\'n</em> was termed a "compact," and congressional consent to it was repeatedly sought, 434 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/452/case.html#456">434 U.

The relevant inquiry must be one of impact on our federal structure").</p>\n<p>Since the Detainer Agreement is not an "agreement or compact" within the purview of the Compact Clause, that constitutional provision is irrelevant to this case, and the Court\'s reliance on it can only be described as baffling.  Although </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 449 U. S. 452</a></p><p> never maintaining that congressional consent was required by the Compact Clause for the Detainer Agreement -- a conclusion foreclosed by our decisions -- the Court nonetheless views its inquiry as "whether the Detainer Agreement is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact <em>within Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10, of the Constitution,</em>" and concludes in this case that "the consent of Congress transforms the State\'s agreement into federal law <em>under the Compact Clause.</em>"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/433/case.html#439">449 U.

Whether a particular state enactment is "within" or "under" the Compact Clause, however, depends on whether it requires the consent of Congress -- the Clause speaks of nothing else.  Whatever effect the Compact Clause may have on those laws it <em>does</em> cover, one would have thought it unnecessary to say that it can have no effect on those it <em>does not</em> cover.  <em>See</em> Engdahl, Construction of Interstate Compacts:  A Questionable Federal Question, 51 Va.L.Rev. 987, 1017 (1965) ("[T]he construction of a compact not requiring consent, even if Congress has consented, will not present a federal question . . .").  The Court stresses the federal interest in the area of extradition, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/433/case.html#442">449 U. S. 442</a></span>, n. 10, but, for Compact Clause purposes, "[a]bsent a threat of encroachment or interference through enhanced state power, the existence of a federal interest is irrelevant."  <em>Multistate Tax Comm\'n, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/452/case.html#480">434 U. S. 480</a></span>, n. 33.</p>\n<p>If the Compact Clause of the Constitution does not operate to transform Pennsylvania\'s statute into federal law, it must be the consent of Congress, albeit unnecessary, which does so.  Such a proposition is, however, contrary to the established rule in other contexts.  The most fundamental example was discussed in <em>Coyle v. Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/559/case.html">221 U. S. 559</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/559/case.html#568">221 U.

Congress may require, under penalty of denying admission, that the organic laws of a new State at the time of admission shall be such as to meet its approval.  A constitution thus supervised by Congress would, after all, be a constitution of a State, and as such subject to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 449 U. S. 453</a></p><p> alteration and amendment by the State after admission.  Its force would be that of a state constitution, and not that of an act of Congress."</p>\n<p>The consent of Congress to state taxation of its instrumentalities does not mean that the interpretation of state tax laws presents a federal question, <em>see Gully v. First National Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html">299 U. S. 109</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html#115">299 U. S. 115</a></span> (1936) ("That there <em>is</em> a federal law permitting such taxation does not change the basis of the suit, which is still the statute of the state, though the federal law is evidence to prove the statute valid") (emphasis in original), and when Congress consents to state laws regulating commerce which would otherwise be prohibited the state laws remain state laws, <em>see In re Rahrer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/140/545/case.html">140 U.

They are not identical, though exercised in the same formal manner").  <em>See generally</em> Engdahl, <em>supra</em> at 1015-1016. It is particularly unsettling that the Court would confuse an act of congressional consent with an act of legislation when the consent was completely gratuitous, and given some 25 years before passage of the state law.\n</em></p>\n<p>What is most disturbing about the Court\'s analysis is its potential sweep.  The statute books of the States are full of reciprocal legislation in the criminal area.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, 11 U.L.A. 1 (Supp. 1980) (adopted in 54 jurisdictions); Uniform Rendition of Prisoners as Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Act, 11 U.L.A. 547 (Supp. 1980) (adopted in 13 jurisdictions).

S. 454</a></p><p> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/452/case.html#469">434 U. S. 469</a></span>-471, such reciprocal legislation is as subject to the Compact Clause as other more formal interstate agreements.  <em>See ibid.</em> (discussing <em>New York v. O\'Neill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/1/case.html">359 U. S. 1</a></span> (1959), a case involving the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses); <em>see also</em> 434 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/452/case.html#491">434 U. S. 491</a></span> (WHITE, J., dissenting).  In light of the Court\'s analysis in this case, it is not at all clear why the construction of each of the provisions in this broad array of state legislation is not a federal matter.  It is apparently no answer that congressional consent was not required under the Compact Clause; the same is true with the Detainer Agreement.  And the congressional "consent" in the Crime Control Consent Act of 1934 applies with the same force to all this reciprocal legislation as it does to the Detainer Agreement.  Yet it has never been supposed that the construction of the terms of such reciprocal legislation is a matter on which federal courts could override the courts of the enacting State.  Enough has been said to demonstrate that the Court\'s opinion threatens to become a judicial Midas meandering through the state statute books, turning everything it touches into federal law.</p>\n<p>Since I view the Detainer Agreement as a state statute, I would defer to the state court\'s interpretation of it.  It is sufficiently clear to me that the court in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Coleman v. Cuyler,</em> 261 Pa.Super. 274, 396 A.2d 394 (1978), disagrees with the statutory interpretation undertaken by the Court of Appeals below and by this Court. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/433/case.html">*</a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 449 U. S. 455</a></p><p> I would therefore reverse and remand, with instructions to the Court of Appeals to consider respondent\'s constitutional claims, which it avoided by what I consider unjustifiable statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p>* Judge Van der Voort, writing the opinion for the Pennsylvania court, assumed that the procedural protections sought by respondent were not incorporated as a matter of statutory interpretation in the Detainer Agreement, since he ruled that there was no constitutional deprivation in not affording those protections to prisoners subject to the Detainer Agreement.  The state court opinion contained a comprehensive survey of the features of both the Detainer Agreement and the Extradition Act, and did not read the Detainer Agreement to contain the protections which the federal court said were incorporated.  Even Judge Spaeth, who dissented on the equal protection ground in the court decision, obviously considered that the procedural protections under the two Acts were different, or else there could not have been an equal protection challenge.  <em>See also Wallace v. Hewitt,</em> 28 F.Supp. 39 (MD Pa.1976).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
