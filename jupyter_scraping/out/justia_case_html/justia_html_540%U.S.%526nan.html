Argued November 10, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 26, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Before 1994, \xc2\xa7330(a) of the Bankruptcy Code authorized a court to \xe2\x80\x9caward to a trustee, <em>to</em> an examiner, <em>to</em> a professional person employed under section 327 \xe2\x80\xa6 , <em>or to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x9d </em>\xe2\x80\x9c(1) reasonable compensation for \xe2\x80\xa6 services rendered by such trustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added to highlight text later deleted.)  In 1994 Congress amended the Code with a reform Act.  The Act altered \xc2\xa7330(a) by deleting \xe2\x80\x9cor to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x9d from what was \xc2\xa7330(a) and is now \xc2\xa7330(a)(1).  This change created apparent legislative drafting error in the current section.  The section is left with a missing \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d that infects its grammar.  And its inclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x9d in what was \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) and is now \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)(A) defeats the neat parallelism that otherwise marks the relationship between current \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7330(a)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9ctrustee, \xe2\x80\xa6 examiner, [or] professional person\xe2\x80\x9d) and 330(a)(1)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9ctrustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this case, petitioner filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) for the time he spent working on a behalf of a debtor in a chapter 7 proceeding.  The Government objected to the application.  It argued that \xc2\xa7330(a) makes no provision for the estate to compensate an attorney who is not employed by the estate trustee and approved by the court under \xc2\xa7327.  Petitioner admitted he was not employed by the trustee and approved by the court under \xc2\xa7327, but nonetheless contended \xc2\xa7330(a) authorized a fee award to him because he was a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney.  In denying petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application, the Bankruptcy Court, District Court, and Fourth Circuit all held that in a chapter 7 proceeding \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) does not authorize payment of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees unless the attorney has been appointed under \xc2\xa7327.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Under the Code\xe2\x80\x99s plain language, \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) does not authorize compensation awards to debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys from estate funds, unless they are employed as authorized by \xc2\xa7327.  If the attorney is to be paid from estate funds under \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) in a chapter 7 case, he must be employed by the trustee and approved by the court.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that this Court must look to legislative history to determine Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent because the existing statutory text is ambiguous in light of its predecessor.  He claims that subsection (A)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x9d is facially irreconcilable with the section\xe2\x80\x99s first part since the two parts\xe2\x80\x99 lists were previously parallel.  He claims also that only a drafting error can explain the missing conjunction \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d between \xe2\x80\x9can examiner\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca professional person\xe2\x80\x9d since the text was previously grammatically correct.  The starting point in discerning congressional intent, however, is the existing statutory text, <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v.<em> Jacobson, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/525/432/index.html">525 U. S. 432</a>, and not predecessor statutes.  So this Court begins with the present statute.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0That the present statute is awkward, and even ungrammatical, does not make it ambiguous on the point at issue.  A debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney not engaged under \xc2\xa7327 does not fall within the eligible class of persons that the first part of \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) authorizes to receive compensation: trustees, examiners, and \xc2\xa7327 professional persons.  Subsection (A) allows compensation for services rendered by four types of persons (the same three plus attorneys), but unless an applicant is in one of the classes named in the first part, the kind of service rendered is irrelevant.  The missing \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d does not change this conclusion.  Numerous federal statutes inadvertently lack a conjunction, but are read for their plain meaning.  Here, the missing \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d neither alters the text\xe2\x80\x99s substance nor obscures its meaning.  Subsection (A)\xe2\x80\x99s nonparalleled fourth category also does not cloud the statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  \xe2\x80\x9cAttorney\xe2\x80\x9d can be straightforwardly read to refer to those attorneys who qualify as \xc2\xa7327 professional persons.  Likewise, neighboring \xc2\xa7331, which permits both debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys and \xc2\xa7327 professional persons to receive interim compensation, most straightforwardly refers to \xc2\xa7327 debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys.  This reading may make \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)(A) surplusage, but surplusage does not always produce ambiguity.  When there are two ways to read the text\xe2\x80\x94either attorney is surplusage, which makes the text plain, or attorney is nonsurplusage, which makes the text ambiguous\xe2\x80\x94applying a rule against surplusage is inappropriate.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The plain meaning that \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) sets forth does not lead to absurd results.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments\xe2\x80\x94that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation will lead to a departure from the principle of prompt and effectual administration of bankruptcy law and attributes to Congress an intent to eliminate compensation essential to debtors\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of legal services\xe2\x80\x94overstate \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s effect.  Compensation remains available through various permitted means.  Compensation for debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys in chapter 12 and 13 bankruptcies, for example, is not much disturbed by \xc2\xa7330 as a whole.  Moreover, compensation for debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys in chapter 7 proceedings is not altogether prohibited.  Sections 327 and 330, taken together, allow chapter 7 trustees to engage attorneys, including debtors\xe2\x80\x99 counsel, and allow courts to award them fees.  Section \xc2\xa7327\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s incurring debts for professional services without the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s approval also advances the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for preserving the chapter 7 estate.  Add to this the apparent sound functioning of the bankruptcy system in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits, which have both adopted the plain meaning approach, and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments become unconvincing.  And \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) does not prevent a debtor from engaging in the common practice of paying counsel compensation in advance to ensure that a bankruptcy filing is in order.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0With a plain, nonabsurd meaning in view, this Court will not read \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)(A) to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cdebtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys,\xe2\x80\x9d in effect enlarging the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  See <em>Iselin</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/270/245/index.html">270 U. S. 245</a>, 251.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to soften the import of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 chosen words even if it believes the words lead to a harsh outcome is longstanding.  P.\xc2\xa011.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Though it is unnecessary to rely on the 1994 Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history, it is instructive to note that the history creates more confusion than clarity about the congressional intent.  History and policy considerations lend support both to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation and to the holding reached here.  This uncertainty illustrates the difficulty of relying on legislative history and the advantage of resting on the statutory text.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7330(a)(1), regulates court awards of professional fees, including fees for services rendered by attorneys in connection with bankruptcy proceedings.  Petitioner, a bankruptcy attorney, sought compensation under the section for legal services he provided to a bankrupt debtor after the proceeding was converted to a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  His application for fees was denied by the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  Each court held that in a chapter 7 proceeding \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) does not authorize payment of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees unless the attorney has been appointed under \xc2\xa7327 of the Code.  See 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7327 and 701 <em>et seq</em>.  Petitioner was not so appointed, and his fee request was denied.  Having granted the petition for certiorari to review this holding, we now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1994 Congress amended the Bankruptcy Code.  Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 (Act), 108 Stat. 4106.  The subject of professional fees was addressed and comprehensive changes were made.  See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb6  ;330.LH[5], pp. 330\xe2\x80\x9375 to 330\xe2\x80\x9376 (rev. 15th ed. 2003).  Most of the changes served to clarify the standards for the award of professional fees; but various courts disagree over the proper interpretation of the portion of the statute relevant to this dispute, concerning attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act replaced the predecessor section to the one in issue here.  Compare 108 Stat. 4130\xe2\x80\x934131 (\xc2\xa7224(b) of the Act amending 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7330(a)), with 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7330(a) (1988 ed.).  Before the 1994 Act, \xc2\xa7330(a) had read as\nfollows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a) After notice to <em>any</em> parties in interest and <em>to </em>the United States trustee and a hearing, and subject to sections 326, 328, and 329 <em>of this title</em>, the court may award to a trustee, <em>to</em> an examiner, <em>to</em> a professional person employed under section 327 or 1103 <em>of this title, or to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney</em>\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by such trustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney \xe2\x80\xa6 and by any paraprofessional persons employed by such trustee, professional person, or attorney . . . ; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added to highlight text later deleted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nPursuant to the 1994 Act, 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) now reads as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(a)(1) After notice to the parties in interest and the United States Trustee and a hearing, and subject to sections 326, 328, and 329, the court may award to a trustee, an examiner, a professional person employed under section 327 or 1103\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A) reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by the trustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney and by any paraprofessional person employed by any such person; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B) reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs can be noted, the 1994 enactment\xe2\x80\x99s principal, substantive alteration was its deletion of the five words at the end of what was \xc2\xa7330(a) and is now \xc2\xa7330(a)(1): \xe2\x80\x9cor to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The deletion created apparent legislative drafting error.  It left current \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) with a missing \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d that infects its grammar (<em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9can examiner, [or] a professional person \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of the word \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)(A) defeats the neat parallelism that otherwise marks the relationship between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7330(a)(1) and 330(a)(1)(A) (<em>i.e.</em>, in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1): \xe2\x80\x9ctrustee, \xe2\x80\xa6 examiner, [or] professional person;\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)(A): \xe2\x80\x9ctrustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney\xe2\x80\x9d) and so casts some doubt on the proper presence of \xe2\x80\x9cattorney.\xe2\x80\x9d  That the pre-1994 text had no grammatical error and was parallel in its structure strengthens the sense that error exists in the new text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits, when asked to interpret current \xc2\xa7330(a)(1), concluded that its language was plain irrespective of these quirks and history.  Under the statutory language as written, those courts held, fees may be awarded to attorneys for services rendered only to the extent they are payments to \xe2\x80\x9ca professional person employed under \xc2\xa7327,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7327(a) (authorizing an appointed trustee in a chapter 7 bankruptcy action to \xe2\x80\x9cemploy one or more attorneys \xe2\x80\xa6 to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s duties under this title\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7327(e) (authorizing an appointed trustee in a chapter 7 bankruptcy action to \xe2\x80\x9cemploy, for a specified special purpose, other than to represent the trustee in conducting the case, an attorney that has represented the debtor, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).

The Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits, in contrast, concluded that the text\xe2\x80\x99s apparent errors rendered the section ambiguous, requiring consideration of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history.  That history, those courts held, shows Congress intended \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) to continue to allow compensation of chapter 7 debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys, irrespective of qualification under \xc2\xa7327.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Ames Dept.

(ESI).  ESI retained petitioner to prepare, file, and prosecute a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding on its behalf.  He did so, all the while representing ESI with the approval of the court under \xc2\xa7327.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Equipment Services, Inc.</em>, 290 F.\xc2\xa03d 739, 742 (CA4 2002) (case below).  See also 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71107(a) (authorizing debtor-in-possession to exercise the statutory rights and powers of an estate trustee, including to retain counsel under \xc2\xa7327).  Three months into the chapter 11 reorganization, the United States Trustee (Government) filed a motion to convert the action into a chapter 7 liquidation proceeding.  The court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion and appointed an estate trustee pursuant to \xc2\xa7701, 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7701(a).  This terminated ESI\xe2\x80\x99s status as debtor-in-possession and so terminated petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s service under \xc2\xa7327 as an attorney for the debtor-in-possession.  Yet petitioner continued to provide legal services to ESI, the debtor, even though he did not have the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to do so.  He prepared reports detailing debts incurred and property acquired since the initial filing; he amended asset schedules; and he appeared at a hearing on an adversary complaint.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In due course petitioner filed an application seeking fees under \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) for the time he spent on ESI\xe2\x80\x99s behalf after the chapter 7 conversion.  The Government objected to the application.  It argued that \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) makes no provision for the estate to compensate an attorney not authorized under \xc2\xa7327.  The court agreed and denied the fees.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Equipment Services, Inc.</em>, 253 B.\xc2\xa0R. 724 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Va. 2000).  (Petitioner was paid fees for the services he provided to ESI before conversion of the proceeding to chapter 7 and when ESI was the debtor-in-possession.  The parties do not contest those fees.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner unsuccessfully sought reversal of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination, first from the District Court, see <em>In\xc2\xa0re Equipment Services, Inc.</em>, 260 B.\xc2\xa0R. 273 (WD Va. 2001), then from the Court of Appeals, see 290 F.\xc2\xa03d 739.  Both courts concluded the plain language of \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) controlled and that attorneys who provide services to debtors in chapter 7 proceedings must be hired by the trustee under \xc2\xa7327 to be eligible for compensation.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that its holding deepened the divide among the various Circuits, but held fast to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language, \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly because application of that plain language supports a reasonable interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code,\xe2\x80\x9d 290 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 745.  We granted the petition for certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/905/index.html">538 U.

He makes the case for ambiguity, for the most part, by comparing the present statute with its predecessor.

One determines ambiguity, under this contention, by relying on the grammatical soundness of the prior statute.  That contention is wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The starting point in discerning congressional intent is the existing statutory text, see <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>Jacobson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/432/index.html">525 U. S. 432</a>, 438 (1999), and not the predecessor statutes.  It is well established that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language is plain, the sole function of the courts\xe2\x80\x94at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd\xe2\x80\x94is to enforce it according to its terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Union Planters Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/1/index.html">530 U.

So we begin with the present statute.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute is awkward, and even ungrammatical; but that does not make it ambiguous on the point at issue.  In its first part, the statute authorizes an award of compensation to one of three types of persons: trustees, examiners, and \xc2\xa7327 professional persons.  A debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney not engaged as provided by \xc2\xa7327 is simply not included within the class of persons eligible for compensation.  In subsection (A) the statute further defines what type of compensation may be awarded: compensation that is reasonable; and for actual, necessary services; and rendered by four types of persons (the same three plus attorneys).  Unless the applicant for compensation is in one of the named classes of persons in the first part, the kind of service rendered is irrelevant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The missing conjunction \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d does not change our conclusion.  The Government points to numerous federal statutes that inadvertently lack a conjunction.  They are read, nonetheless, for their plain meaning.  See Brief for Respondent 17, n.\xc2\xa04.  Here, the missing conjunction neither alters the text\xe2\x80\x99s substance nor obscures its meaning.  This is not a case where a \xe2\x80\x9cnot\xe2\x80\x9d is missing or where an \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d inadvertently substitutes for an \xe2\x80\x9cand.\xe2\x80\x9d  The sentence may be awkward; yet it is straightforward.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsection (A)\xe2\x80\x99s nonparalleled fourth category of persons who can render compensable services does not cloud the statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  Petitioner reasons that since the section is a single sentence, and since it appears to strive for parallelism between those authorized to receive fees and those whose services are compensable, there is an ambiguity as to what \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)(A) refers to in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1).  He also points to neighboring \xc2\xa7331, which provides for both debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys and \xc2\xa7327 professional persons to receive interim compensation after an order for relief is entered but before an application for \xc2\xa7330 fees is filed.  He argues that since \xc2\xa7331 contemplates debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 receiving interim compensation there is reason to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)(A) refers to debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1), though they go unmentioned in that clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsection (A)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cattorney,\xe2\x80\x9d however, can be read in a straightforward fashion to refer to those attorneys whose fees are authorized by \xc2\xa7330(a)(1): attorneys qualified as \xc2\xa7327 professional persons, that is, in a chapter 7 context, those employed by the trustee and approved by the court.  See \xc2\xa7327(a) (appointed trustee may \xe2\x80\x9cemploy one or more attorneys \xe2\x80\xa6 to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s duties under this title); \xc2\xa7327(e) (appointed trustee may \xe2\x80\x9cemploy, for a specified special purpose, other than to represent the trustee in conducting the case, an attorney that has represented the debtor, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Likewise, \xc2\xa7331\xe2\x80\x99s reference to interim compensation for debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys most straightforwardly refers to debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys authorized under \xc2\xa7327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It must be acknowledged that, under our reading of the text, the word \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (A) may well be surplusage.  Subsection (A)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xc2\xa7327 professional persons undoubtedly includes attorneys, as much as does \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to professional persons.  That is not controlling, however.  Surplusage does not always produce ambiguity and our preference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.  See <em>Chickasaw Nation</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/84/index.html">534 U. S. 84</a>, 94 (2001) (the preference \xe2\x80\x9cis sometimes offset by the canon that permits a court to reject words \xe2\x80\x98as surplusage\xe2\x80\x99 if \xe2\x80\x98inadvertently inserted or if repugnant to the rest of the statute\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Where there are two ways to read the text\xe2\x80\x94either attorney is surplusage, in which case the text is plain; or attorney is nonsurplusage (<em>i.e.</em>, it refers to an ambiguous component in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)), in which case the text is ambiguous\xe2\x80\x94applying the rule against surplusage is, absent other indications, inappropriate.  We should prefer the plain meaning since that approach respects the words of Congress.  In this manner we avoid the pitfalls that plague too quick a turn to the more controversial realm of legislative history.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plain meaning that \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) sets forth does not lead to absurd results requiring us to treat the text as if it were ambiguous.  See <em>supra,</em> at 6 (citing <em>Hartford Underwriters</em>).  Petitioner disagrees and argues that our interpretation will \xe2\x80\x9centail an inexplicable, wholesale departure from . . . the guiding principle of the \xe2\x80\x98prompt and effectual administration\xe2\x80\x99 of federal bankruptcy law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 30.  He says that our reading \xe2\x80\x9cattribute[s] to Congress an illogical, penny-wise and pound-foolish determination to eliminate entirely\xe2\x80\x94as a purportedly asset-preserving measure\xe2\x80\x94compensation that is essential to debtors\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of legal services.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 35.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These arguments overstate the effect of \xc2\xa7330(a)(1).  Under the text\xe2\x80\x99s instruction compensation remains available to debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys through various permitted means.  First, while \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) requires proper authorization for payment to attorneys from estate funds in chapter 7 filings, it does not extend throughout all bankruptcy law.  Compensation for debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys in chapter 12 and 13 bankruptcies, for example, is not much disturbed by \xc2\xa7330 as a whole.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7330(a)(4)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case in which the debtor is an individual, the court may allow reasonable compensation to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Compensation for debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys working on chapter 7 bankruptcies, moreover, is not altogether prohibited.  Sections 327 and 330, taken together, allow chapter 7 trustees to engage attorneys, including debtors\xe2\x80\x99 counsel, and allow courts to award them fees.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7327(a) and (e).  Section 327\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on debtors\xe2\x80\x99 incurring debts for professional services without the chapter 7 trustee\xe2\x80\x99s approval is not absurd.  In the context of a chapter 7 liquidation it advances the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for preserving the estate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If we add to all this the apparent sound functioning of the bankruptcy system under the plain meaning approach, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments become unconvincing.  Seeming order has attended the rule\xe2\x80\x99s application for five years in the Fifth Circuit and for four years in the Eleventh Circuit.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re American Steel Product, Inc.</em>, 197 F.\xc2\xa03d 1354 (CA11 1999); <em>In\xc2\xa0re</em> <em>Pro-Snax Distributors, Inc.</em>, 157 F.\xc2\xa03d 414 (CA5 1998).  It appears to be routine for debtors to pay reasonable fees for legal services before filing for bankruptcy to ensure compliance with statutory requirements.  See generally Collier Compensation, Employment and Appointment of Trustees and Professionals in Bankruptcy Cases \xc2\xb6  ;3.02[1], p.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x932 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the majority of cases, the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s counsel will accept an individual or a joint consumer chapter 7 case only after being paid a retainer that covers the \xe2\x80\x98standard fee\xe2\x80\x99 and the cost of filing the petition\xe2\x80\x9d).  So our interpretation accords with common practice.  Section 330(a)(1) does not prevent a debtor from engaging counsel before a chapter 7 conversion and paying reasonable compensation in advance to ensure that the filing is in order.  Indeed, the Code anticipates these arrangements.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7329 (debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys must disclose fees they receive from a debtor in the year prior to its bankruptcy filing and courts may order excessive payments returned to the estate).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument stumbles on still harder ground in the face of another canon of interpretation.  His interpretation of the Act\xe2\x80\x94reading the word \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)(A) to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cdebtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94would have us read an absent word into the statute.  That is, his argument would result \xe2\x80\x9cnot [in] a construction of [the] statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted, presumably by inadvertence, may be included within its scope.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Iselin</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/270/245/index.html">270 U. S. 245</a>, 251 (1926).  With a plain, nonabsurd meaning in view, we need not proceed in this way.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a basic difference between filling a gap left by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 silence and rewriting rules that Congress has affirmatively and specifically enacted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mobil Oil Corp.</em> v. <em>Higginbotham,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/618/index.html">436 U. S. 618</a>, 625 (1978).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our unwillingness to soften the import of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 chosen words even if we believe the words lead to a harsh outcome is longstanding.  It results from \xe2\x80\x9cdeference to the supremacy of the Legislature, as well as recognition that Congressmen typically vote on the language of a bill.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Locke,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/84/index.html">471 U. S. 84</a>, 95 (1985) (citing <em>Richards</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/1/index.html">369 U. S. 1</a>, 9 (1962)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adhering to conventional doctrines of statutory interpretation, we hold that \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) does not authorize compensation awards to debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys from estate funds, unless they are employed as authorized by \xc2\xa7327.  If the attorney is to be paid from estate funds under \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) in a chapter 7 case, he must be employed by the trustee and approved by the court.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though we find it unnecessary to rely on the legislative history behind the 1994 enactment of \xc2\xa7330(a)(1), we find it instructive that the history creates more confusion than clarity about the congressional intent.  History and policy considerations lend support both to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation and to the holding we reach based on the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner, for instance, cites evidence supporting the conclusion that a scrivener\xe2\x80\x99s error obscures what was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 real intent.  For over 100 years debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys have been considered by Congress and the courts to be an integral part of the bankruptcy process.  See Bankruptcy Act of 1898, ch. 541, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa759(d) and 64(b), 30 Stat. 561, 563.  See also <em>In\xc2\xa0re Kross</em>, 96 F. 816 (SDNY 1899).  It is fair to doubt that Congress would so rework their longstanding role without announcing the change in the congressional record.  Cf. <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>de la Cruz, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/213/index.html">523 U. S. 213</a>, 221 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe \xe2\x80\xa6 will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legislative processes behind the change also lend some support to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  In 1994 the original proposed draft of new \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) featured two changes: stylistic changes throughout the section and the addition of a new provision giving the Government a right to object to fee applications.  See S. 540, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993), reprinted in S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x93168 (1993).  The right to object provision was added at \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s end.  Thus it came immediately after the critical text \xe2\x80\x9cor to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney,\xe2\x80\x9d which the draft edited to read \xe2\x80\x9cor the debtors <em>[sic]</em> attorney.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Before voting the Act into law, however, Congress amended the proposed draft.  See 140 Cong. Rec. 8383 (1994) (setting out amendment 1645 to S.\xc2\xa0540).  Amendment 1645 made only two changes to \xc2\xa7330(a)(1): It deleted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s right to object provision and the critical words (\xe2\x80\x9cor the debtors <em>[sic]</em> attorney\xe2\x80\x9d).  The rest of the original proposed draft remained intact.  Legislative history explains the first deletion, for the provision was installed elsewhere, as new \xc2\xa7330(a)(2).  Nothing, however, explains the second.<font b="1">  That the Government\xe2\x80\x99s right to object was deleted and reinstated (<em>i.e.</em>, reorganized), while the words at issue, which had preceded the moved provision, were deleted with no notation in the legislative history suggests the scrivener just reached too far in his deletion.  These factors combined to convince a leading treatise on bankruptcy law, Collier, that the deletion was a scrivener\xe2\x80\x99s error and ought not have any effect.  See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb6  ;330.LH[5], at 330\xe2\x80\x9375 to 330\xe2\x80\x9376.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are other aspects of the legislative record, however, that undermine this interpretation.  These considerations suggest Congress may have intended the change the scrivener worked.  For example, amendment 1645 was part of a reform Act designed to curtail abuses in fee awards, according to statements by the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor.  See 140 Cong. Rec., at 28753 (statement of Sen. Metzenbaum).  These abuses were not ghosts seen only by Congress.  Some bankruptcy courts had reached the same conclusion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>In\xc2\xa0re NRG Resources, Inc.</em>, 64 B.\xc2\xa0R. 643 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD La. 1986).  The deletion at issue furthered this reform by ensuring that chapter 7 debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys would receive no estate compensation absent the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s authorization of their work.  This objective is not inconsistent with the interest of involving debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys in bankruptcy proceedings.  As noted, the Act still allows debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys to be compensated in different ways.  See<em> supra,</em> at 9\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Amendment 1645, viewed in its entirety, gives further reason to think Congress may have intended the change.  The amendment added a new section that authorizes fee awards to debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys in chapter 12 and 13 bankruptcies.  140 Cong.\xc2\xa0Rec., at 8383 (setting out new 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7330(a)(4)(B)).  Since the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s deletion of \xe2\x80\x9cor the debtors <em>[sic]</em> attorney\xe2\x80\x9d from the original proposed draft affected chapter 12 and 13 debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys as much as chapter 7 debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys, \xc2\xa7330(a)(4)(B) shows a special intent to authorize the formers\xe2\x80\x99 fee awards in the face of the new, broad exclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Congress\xe2\x80\x99 action does not prove the point, the House of Representatives\xe2\x80\x99 inaction may.  The House passed the Act after having the deletion, as well as its impact, called to its attention.  See Bankruptcy Reform: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 551 (1994).  The National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA), which represents those lawyers most likely to be affected by \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s change, declined to object to the deletion.  <em>Ibid.</em> (noting the deletion but stating that the NACBA did \xe2\x80\x9cnot oppose\xe2\x80\x9d Amendment 1645\xe2\x80\x99s passage).  This alert, followed by the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s nonresponse, should support a presumption of legislative awareness and intention.  The Act may now contain surplusage, along with grammatical error; but that may have been the result of trying to make the substantive change with the fewest possible textual alterations or of an error by the scrivener in carrying out the change.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These competing interpretations of the legislative history make it difficult to say with assurance whether petitioner or the Government lays better historical claim to the congressional intent.  The alert to the change in policy was given, to be sure, before the House passed the final version, but that particular circumstance cannot bear too much weight.  The alert was not the subject of testimony from any witness at the congressional hearing.  It consisted of but two sentences contained within 472 pages of written statements delivered to the legislative subcommittee for its August 17, 1994, hearing day.  Those 472 pages were added to 236 pages of prepared statements and testimony transcribed from the day\xe2\x80\x99s testifying witnesses.  Within the NACBA\xe2\x80\x99s filing, the two relevant sentences appear on the 18th page of the 27-page report.  Nothing in the legislative history confirms that this particular point bore on the congressional deliberations or was given specific consideration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These uncertainties illustrate the difficulty of relying on legislative history here and the advantage of our determination to rest our holding on the statutory text.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is beyond our province to rescue Congress from its drafting errors, and to provide for what we might think \xe2\x80\xa6 is the preferred result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Granderson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/39/index.html">511 U.

Whenever there is such a plausible basis for believing that a significant change in statutory law resulted from a scrivener\xe2\x80\x99s error, I believe we have a duty to examine legislative history.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In this case, that history reveals that the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA) not only called the assumed drafting error to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 attention in a timely fashion, but also deemed the error unworthy of objection.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  This evidence convinces me that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the text, which surely is more natural than petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s, is correct.  I therefore concur in the judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As Chief Justice Marshall stated, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every thing from which aid can be derived \xe2\x80\xa6 .\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Fisher,</em> 2 Cranch 358, 386 (1805).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  Specifically, three months after the Senate passed the relevant amendment, the NACBA submitted written comments to the House Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law, which was considering the change.  Those comments first noted that the amended version of \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cappears to have some minor drafting errors, including the apparently inadvertent removal of debtors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys from the list of professionals whose compensation awards are covered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bankruptcy Reform: Hearing on H.\xc2\xa0R. 5116 before the Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 551 (1994).  With no proviso that these alleged errors be corrected, the NACBA then expressly did \xe2\x80\x9c<em>not</em> oppose\xe2\x80\x9d passage of the amendment.  <em>Ibid</em>.
