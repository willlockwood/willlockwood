After his acquittal in Municipal Court, appellee brought suit in Federal District Court challenging the ordinance\'s constitutionality and seeking, <em>inter alia,</em> damages and attorney\'s fees.  The District Court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad on its face, but the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the ordinance was substantially overbroad, since its literal wording punished and might deter a significant range of protected speech.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. A municipal ordinance that makes it unlawful to interrupt a police officer in the performance of his duty is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid on its face under the First Amendment.  The ordinance in question criminalizes a substantial amount of, and is susceptible of regular application to, constitutionally protected speech, and accords the police unconstitutional enforcement discretion, as is demonstrated by evidence indicating that, although the ordinance\'s plain language is violated scores of times daily, only those individuals chosen by police in their unguided discretion are arrested.  Appellant\'s argument that the ordinance is not substantially overbroad because it does not inhibit the exposition of ideas, but simply bans unprotected "core criminal conduct," is not persuasive.  Since the ordinance\'s language making it unlawful to "assault" or "strike" a police officer is expressly preempted by the State Penal Code, its enforceable portion prohibits verbal interruptions of police, and thereby deals with speech, rather than with core criminal conduct.  Moreover, although speech might be prohibited if it consists of "fighting words" that by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace, the ordinance in question is not limited to such expressions, but broadly applies to speech that "in any manner . . . interrupt[s] any policeman," and thereby impermissibly infringes the constitutionally protected freedom of individuals verbally to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 482 U. S. 452</a></p><p> oppose or challenge police action.  Appellant\'s contention that the ordinance\'s sweeping nature is both inevitable and essential to maintain public order is also without merit, since the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to prohibit only disorderly conduct or fighting words, but impermissibly provides police with unfettered discretion to arrest individuals for words or conduct that are simply annoying or offensive.

Abstention -- assertedly to allow the state courts to reach a readily available limiting construction that would eliminate the ordinance\'s overbreadth -- would be inappropriate here.  Even if this case did not involve a First Amendment facial challenge, for which abstention is particularly inappropriate, the ordinance in question is plain and unambiguous, and thus is not susceptible to a limiting construction.  Moreover, it cannot be limited by severing discrete unconstitutional subsections, since its enforceable portion is unconstitutional in its entirety.  Even if the municipal courts had not had many opportunities to narrow the ordinance\'s scope, appellant\'s claim that state courts had not had the chance to construe the ordinance would be unavailing in light of the ordinance\'s nonambiguity.  Nor does the availability of certification to state courts under state law in itself render abstention appropriate where, as here, there is no uncertain question of state law to be resolved.

S. 453</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether a municipal ordinance that makes it unlawful to interrupt a police officer in the performance of his or her duties is unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellee Raymond Wayne Hill is a lifelong resident of Houston, Texas.  At the time this lawsuit began, he worked as a paralegal and as executive director of the Houston Human Rights League.  A member of the board of the Gay Political Caucus, which he helped found in 1975, Hill was also affiliated with a Houston radio station, and had carried city and county press passes since 1975.  He lived in Montrose, a "diverse and eclectic neighborhood" that is the center of gay political and social life in Houston.  App. 26-27.</p>\n<p>The incident that sparked this lawsuit occurred in the Montrose area on February 14, 1982.  Hill observed a friend, Charles Hill, intentionally stopping traffic on a busy street, evidently to enable a vehicle to enter traffic.  Two Houston police officers, one of whom was named Kelley, approached Charles and began speaking with him.  According to the District Court, "shortly thereafter," Hill began shouting at the officers "in an admitted attempt to divert Kelley\'s attention from Charles Hill." App. to Juris. Statement B-2. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Hill </p><p><a class="page-number" name="454">Page 482 U. S. 454</a></p><p> first shouted: "Why don\'t you pick on somebody your own size?"  After Officer Kelley responded:  "[A]re you interrupting me in my official capacity as a Houston police officer?"  Hill then shouted:  "Yes, why don\'t you pick on somebody my size?" App. 40-41, 58, 71-74.  Hill was arrested under Houston Code of Ordinances, \xc2\xa7 34-11(a), for "willfully or intentionally interrupt[ing] a city policeman . . . by verbal challenge during an investigation."  App. 2. Charles Hill was not arrested.  Hill was then acquitted after a nonjury trial in Municipal Court. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 482 U. S. 455</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Code of Ordinances, City of Houston, Texas, \xc2\xa7 34-11(a) (1984), reads:</p>\n<p>"Sec. 34-11.  Assaulting or interfering with policemen."</p>\n<p>"(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to assault, strike or in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty, or any person summoned to aid in making an arrest. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]"</p>\n<p>Following his acquittal in the Charles Hill incident, Hill brought the suit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Texas, seeking (1) a declaratory judgment that \xc2\xa7 34-11(a) was unconstitutional both on its face and as it had been applied to him, (2) a permanent injunction against any attempt to enforce the ordinance, (3) an order expunging the records of his arrests under the ordinance, and (4) damages and attorney\'s fees under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1983 and 1988.</p>\n<p>At trial, Hill introduced records provided by the city regarding both the frequency with which arrests had been made for violation of the ordinance and the type of conduct with which those arrested had been charged.  He also introduced evidence and testimony concerning the arrests of several reporters under the ordinance.  Finally, Hill introduced evidence regarding his own experience with the ordinance, under which he has been arrested four times since 1975, but never convicted.</p>\n<p>The District Court held that Hill\'s evidence did not demonstrate that the ordinance had been unconstitutionally applied. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The court also rejected Hill\'s contention that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 482 U. S. 456</a></p><p> ordinance was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad on its face.  The ordinance was not vague, the court stated, because:</p>\n<p>"[t]he wording of the ordinance is sufficiently definite to put a person of reasonable intelligence on fair notice of what actions are forbidden.  In particular, the Court finds that the use of words such as \'interrupt\' are sufficiently clear by virtue of their commonly understood, everyday definitions.  \'Interrupt\' commonly means to cause one to cease, such as stopping someone in the middle of something.  The Plaintiff, for example, clearly \'interrupted\' the police officers regarding the Charles Hill incident."</p>\n<p>App. to Juris. Statement B-8.  The court also held that the statute was not overbroad, because "the ordinance does not, at least facially, proscribe speech or conduct which is protected by the First Amendment."  <em>Id.</em> at B-12.</p>\n<p>A panel of the Court of Appeals reversed.  764 F.2d 1156 (CA5 1985).  The city\'s suggestion for rehearing en banc was granted, and the Court of Appeals, by a vote of 8-7, upheld the judgment of the panel.  789 F.2d 1103 (1986).  The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court\'s conclusion that the ordinance was not vague, and that it "plainly encompasse[d] mere verbal as well as physical conduct."  <em>Id.</em> at 1109.  Applying the standard established in <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/case.html">413 U. S. 601</a></span> (1973), however, the Court of Appeals concluded that the ordinance was substantially </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 482 U. S. 457</a></p><p> overbroad.  It found that "[a] significant range of protected speech and expression is punishable and might be deterred by the literal wording of the statute."  789 F.2d at 1110.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also reviewed the evidence of the unconstitutional application of the ordinance which Hill had introduced at trial.  The court did not disturb the District Court\'s ruling that the statute had not been unconstitutionally applied to Hill or to the reporters.  It did conclude, however, that other evidence not mentioned by the District Court revealed "a realistic danger of, and a substantial potential for, the unconstitutional application of the ordinance."  <em>Ibid.</em>  This evidence showed that the ordinance "is officially regarded as penalizing the mere interruption of a policeman while in the line of duty," <em>id.</em> at 1109, and has been employed to make arrests for, <em>inter alia,</em> "arguing," "[t]alking," "[i]nterfering," "[f]ailing to remain quiet," "[r]efusing to remain silent," "[v]erbal abuse," "[c]ursing," "[v]erbally yelling," and "[t]alking loudly, [w]alking through scene."  <em>Id.</em> at 1113-1114. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The city appealed, claiming that the Court of Appeals erred in holding the ordinance facially overbroad and in not abstaining until the ordinance had been construed by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 482 U. S. 458</a></p><p> state courts. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  We noted probable jurisdiction, 479 U.S. 811 (1986), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The elements of First Amendment overbreadth analysis are familiar.  Only a statute that is substantially overbroad may be invalidated on its face.  <em>New York v. Ferber,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html">458 U.

Instead,</p>\n<p>"[i]n a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of a law, a court\'s first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct."</p>\n<p><em>Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/489/case.html">455 U.

Criminal statutes must be scrutinized with particular care, <em>e.g., Winters v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/507/case.html">333 U. S. 507</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/507/case.html#515">333 U. S. 515</a></span> (1948); those that make unlawful a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct may be held facially invalid even if they also have legitimate application.  <em>E.g., Kolender, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/352/case.html#359">461 U. S. 359</a></span>, n. 8.</p>\n<p>The city\'s principal argument is that the ordinance does not inhibit the exposition of ideas, and that it bans "core criminal conduct" not protected by the First Amendment.  Brief for Appellant 12.  In its view, the application of the ordinance to Hill illustrates that the police employ it only to prohibit such conduct, and not "as a subterfuge to control or dissuade free expression."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Since the ordinance is "content-neutral," and since there is no evidence that the city has applied the ordinance to chill particular speakers or ideas, the city concludes that the ordinance is not substantially overbroad. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 482 U. S. 460</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We disagree with the city\'s characterization for several reasons.  First, the enforceable portion of the ordinance deals not with core criminal conduct, but with speech.  As the city has conceded, the language in the ordinance making it unlawful for any person to "assault" or "strike" a police officer is preempted by the Texas Penal Code.  Reply Brief for Appellant 10.  The city explains, <em>ibid.,</em> that "any species of physical assault on a police officer is encompassed within the provisions [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 22.01, 22.02] of the Texas Penal Code," [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and, under \xc2\xa7 1.08 of the Code,</p>\n<p>"[n]o governmental subdivision or agency may enact or enforce a law that makes any conduct covered by this code an offense subject to a criminal penalty.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 482 U. S. 461</a></p><p> Tex.Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1.08 (1974).  <em>See Knott v. State,</em> 648 S.W.2d 20 (Tex.App.1983) (reversing conviction obtained under municipal ordinance preempted by state penal code).  Accordingly, the enforceable portion of the ordinance makes it \'unlawful for any person to . . . in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty,\' and thereby prohibits verbal interruptions of police officers. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]"</p>\n<p>Second, contrary to the city\'s contention, the First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers.</p>\n<p>"Speech is often provocative and challenging. . . .  [But it] is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest."</p>\n<p><em>Terminiello v. Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/1/case.html">337 U. S. 1</a></span>, 4 (1949).  In <em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html">415 U. S. 130</a></span> (1974), for example, the appellant was found to have yelled obscenities and threats at an officer who had asked appellant\'s husband to produce his driver\'s license.  Appellant was convicted under a municipal ordinance that made it a crime</p>\n<p>"\'for any person wantonly to curse or revile or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward or with reference to any member of the city police while in the actual performance of his duty.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html#132">415 U. S. 132</a></span> (citation omitted).  We vacated the conviction and invalidated the ordinance as facially overbroad.  Critical to our decision was the fact that the ordinance "punishe[d] only spoken words," and was not limited in scope to fighting words that, "<em>by their very utterance, </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 482 U. S. 462</a></em></p><p><em> inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html#133">415 U.

S. 525</a></span> (1972); <em>see also ibid.</em> (Georgia breach-of-peace statute not limited to fighting words held facially invalid).  Moreover, in a concurring opinion in <em>Lewis,</em> JUSTICE POWELL suggested that even the "fighting words" exception recognized in <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/case.html">315 U. S. 568</a></span> (1942), might require a narrower application in cases involving words addressed to a police officer, because\n</em></p>\n<p>"a properly trained officer may reasonably be expected to \'exercise a higher degree of restraint\' than the average citizen, and thus be less likely to respond belligerently to \'fighting words.\'"</p>\n<p>415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html#135">415 U. S. 135</a></span> (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The Houston ordinance is much more sweeping than the municipal ordinance struck down in <em>Lewis.</em>  It is not limited to fighting words nor even to obscene or opprobrious language, but prohibits speech that "in any manner . . . interrupt[s]" an officer.

The city recalls this Court\'s observation in <em>Smith v. Goguen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/566/case.html">415 U. S. 566</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/566/case.html#581">415 U.

Control of the broad range of disorderly conduct that may inhibit a policeman in the performance of his official duties may be one such area requiring, as it does, an on-the-spot assessment of the need to keep order."</p>\n<p>The city further suggests that its ordinance is comparable to the disorderly conduct statute upheld against a facial challenge in <em>Colten v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/104/case.html">407 U. S. 104</a></span> (1972). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 482 U.

In <em>Lewis,</em> JUSTICE POWELL elaborated the basis for our concern with such sweeping, dragnet laws:</p>\n<p>"This ordinance, as construed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, confers on police a virtually unrestrained power to arrest and charge persons with a violation.  Many arrests are made in \'one-on-one\' situations where the only witnesses are the arresting officer and the person charged.  All that is required for conviction is that the court accept the testimony of the officer that obscene or opprobrious language had been used toward him while in the performance of his duties. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/us/482/451/case.html#466">*</a></span>. . ."</p>\n<p>"Contrary to the city\'s argument, it is unlikely that limiting the ordinance\'s application to genuine \'fighting words\' would be incompatible with the full and adequate performance of an officer\'s duties. . . .  [I]t is usually unnecessary [to charge a person] with the less serious offense of addressing obscene words to the officer.  The present type of ordinance tends to be invoked only where there is no other valid basis for arresting an objectionable or suspicious person.  The opportunity for abuse, especially where a statute has received a virtually open-ended interpretation, is self-evident."</p>\n<p>415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html#135">415 U.

The ordinance\'s plain language is admittedly violated scores of times daily, App. 77, yet only some individuals -- those chosen by the police </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 482 U.

We conclude that the ordinance is substantially overbroad, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in holding it facially invalid.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The city has also urged us not to reach the merits of Hill\'s constitutional challenge, but rather to abstain for reasons related to those underlying our decision in <em>Railroad Comm\'n v. Pullman Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/case.html">312 U. S. 496</a></span> (1941).  In its view, there are certain limiting constructions readily available to the state courts that would eliminate the ordinance\'s overbreadth. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Abstention is, of course, the exception and not the rule, <em>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html">424 U.

[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  We have held that "abstention . . . is inappropriate for cases [where] . . . statutes are justifiably attacked on their face as abridging free expression."  <em>Dombrowski v.

In cases involving a facial challenge to a statute, the pivotal question in determining whether abstention is appropriate is whether the statute is "fairly subject to an interpretation which will render unnecessary or substantially modify the federal constitutional question."  <em>Harman v. Forssenius,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/528/case.html">380 U.

If the statute is not obviously susceptible of a limiting construction, then, even if the statute has "never [been] interpreted by a state tribunal, . . . it is the duty of the federal court to exercise its properly invoked jurisdiction."  <em>Harman, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/528/case.html#535">380 U.

Its constitutionality cannot "turn upon a choice between one or several alternative meanings."  <em>Baggett v. Bullitt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/360/case.html">377 U.

Nor can the ordinance be limited by severing discrete unconstitutional subsections from the rest.  For example, it cannot be limited to "core criminal conduct" such as physical assaults or fighting words, because those applications are preempted by state law.  <em>See supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#460">482 U. S. 460</a></span>-461, and n. 10.  The enforceable portion of this ordinance is a general prohibition of speech that "simply has no core" of constitutionally unprotected expression to which it might be limited.  <em>Smith v.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 482 U.

The city\'s proposed constructions are insufficient, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] and it is doubtful that even "a remarkable job of plastic surgery upon the face of the ordinance" could save it.  <em>Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/147/case.html">394 U.

In sum,</p>\n<p>"[s]ince \'the naked question, uncomplicated by [ambiguous language], is whether the Act on its face is unconstitutional,\' <em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/400/433/case.html">400 U. S. 433</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">400 U.

S. 237</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The city relies heavily on its claim that the state courts have not had an opportunity to construe the statute.  Even if true, that factor would not, in itself, be controlling.  As stated above, when a statute is not ambiguous, there is no need to abstain even if state courts have never interpreted the statute.  <em>Harman, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/528/case.html#534">380 U. S. 534</a></span>.  For example, we have declined to abstain from deciding a facial challenge to a state statute when the suit was filed in federal court just four days after the statute took effect.  <em>Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/491/case.html">472 U. S. 491</a></span> (1985).  But in any event, the city\'s claim that state courts have not had an opportunity to construe the statute is misleading.  Only the state <em>appellate</em> courts appear to have lacked this opportunity.  It is undisputed that Houston\'s Municipal Courts, which have been courts of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 482 U. S. 470</a></p><p> record in Texas since 1976, have had numerous opportunities to narrow the scope of the ordinance. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  There is no evidence that they have done so. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  In fact, the city\'s primary position throughout this litigation has been "to insis[t] on the validity of the ordinance as literally read."  789 F.2d at 1107.  We have long recognized that trial court interpretations, such as those given in jury instructions, constitute "a ruling on a question of state law that is as binding on us as though the precise words had been written into the ordinance."  <em>Terminiello,</em> 337 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/1/case.html#4">337 U. S. 4</a></span>.  Thus, where municipal courts have regularly applied an unambiguous statute, there is certainly no need for a federal court to abstain until state appellate courts have an opportunity to construe it.</p>\n<p>The possibility of certification does not change our analysis. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  The certification procedure is useful in reducing the substantial burdens of cost and delay that abstention places on litigants.  Where there is an uncertain question of state law that would affect the resolution of the federal claim, and where delay and expense are the chief drawbacks to abstention, the availability of certification becomes an important factor in deciding whether to abstain.  <em>E.g., Bellotti v. Baird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html">428 U. S. 132</a></span> (1976).  Nevertheless, even where we have recognized the importance of certification in deciding whether to abstain, we have been careful to note that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 482 U. S. 471</a></p><p> availability of certification is not, in itself, sufficient to render abstention appropriate.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html#151">428 U. S. 151</a></span>.  It would be manifestly inappropriate to certify a question in a case where, as here, there is no uncertain question of state law whose resolution might affect the pending federal claim.  As we have demonstrated, <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#468">482 U. S. 468</a></span>-469, this ordinance is neither ambiguous nor obviously susceptible of a limiting construction. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  A federal court may not properly ask a state court if it would care in effect to rewrite a statute. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  We therefore see no need in this case to abstain pending certification.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Today\'s decision reflects the constitutional requirement that, in the face of verbal challenges to police action, officers and municipalities must respond with restraint.  We are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 482 U. S. 472</a></p><p> mindful that the preservation of liberty depends in part upon the maintenance of social order.  <em>Cf. Teminiello v. Chicago, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/1/case.html#37">337 U. S. 37</a></span> (dissenting opinion).  But the First Amendment recognizes, wisely we think, that a certain amount of expressive disorder not only is inevitable in a society committed to individual freedom, but must itself be protected if that freedom would survive.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>* The facts in this case, and particularly the direct conflict of testimony as to "who said what," well illustrate the possibility of abuse.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>I Hill testified that his "motivation was to stop [the officers] from hitting Charles."  App. 37, 90.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>infra.</em>  He also explained:</p>\n<p>"I would rather that I get arrested than those whose careers can be damaged; I would rather that I get arrested than those whose families wouldn\'t understand; I would rather that I get arrested than those who couldn\'t spend a long time in jail.  I am prepared to respond in any legal, nonaggressive or nonviolent way, to any illegal police activity, at any time, under any circumstances."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/27/case.html#29">482 U. S. 29</a></span>.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court stated that Hill "shout[ed] <em>abuses</em>" at the officers, App. to Juris.  Statement B-2 (emphasis added).  As the Court of Appeals held, however, there is "no evidence to support the district court\'s finding that Raymond [Hill] <em>shout[ed] abuses\' at Officer Kelley."  789 F.2d 1103, 1105 (CA5 1986).  <em>See</em> App. 73-74 (testimony of Officer Kelley that Hill did not use "abusive" language).\n</em></p>\n<p>The testimony of Hill and Kelley is consistent in other ways ignored by the District Court.  Both agree, for example, that Charles attempted to leave after an initial conversation with the officers, and that Kelley then grabbed Charles by the arm, turned him around, and told him not to walk away.  <em>Id.</em> at 14, 57.  According to Hill, Charles, who "has a nervous tic," then went "into these spasms," which prompted one of the officers to "screa[m]" at Charles "Are you making fun of me?"  <em>Id.</em> at 14-15.  Kelley stated that Charles was "twitching" in an "erratic and strange" manner, and that Kelley "didn\'t know if [Charles] was about to have a seizure or if he was being insolent, or what."  <em>Id.</em> at 56-57.</p>\n<p>At this point, however, the testimony substantially diverges.  Kelley states that Hill then "interrupte[d]" him with the verbal challenge quoted in text, and that a crowd was beginning to form.  <em>Id.</em> at 57-58, 61, 68-69.  Hill testified that both officers grabbed Charles, placed him up against a wall, and threatened to hit him with a large flashlight.  <em>Id.</em> at 14.  Only then, according to Hill, did he call out:  "[T]he kid has done nothing wrong.  If you want to pick on somebody, pick on me."  <em>Id.</em> at 16.  We note the applicability of JUSTICE POWELL\'s observation that there is a "possibility of abuse" where convictions under an ordinance frequently turn on the resolution of a "direct conflict of testimony as to <em>who said what.\'"  <em>Lewis v.

Statement B-1.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The facts of Hill\'s other three arrests as found by the District Court are as follows.  On August 31, 1975, Hill intentionally interrupted two Houston police officers as they made a traffic arrest.  During the arrest, Hill wrote down license plate numbers, and then walked to within an arm\'s length of one of the officers on the side nearest the officer\'s revolver.  The officer asked Hill to leave, but Hill instead moved closer.  Hill was arrested, tried, and found not guilty.</p>\n<p>In 1977, after observing vice squad cars parked near a bookstore, Hill entered the store and announced on the public address system that police officers were present and that patrons should prepare to show their identification. The patrons promptly left the store, thereby frustrating the investigation.  Hill was arrested for interfering with the investigation, but the case was subsequently dismissed.</p>\n<p>Finally, on October 3, 1982, eight months after the lawsuit began, Hill was arrested for refusing to leave the immediate area of a car with an unknown and unconscious person inside.  The arresting officers failed to appear in Municipal Court, however, so the charge against Hill was dismissed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>These charges are summarized in an appendix to the opinion of the Court of Appeals, 789 F.2d at 1113-1114.  The court noted that</p>\n<p>[appellee] offered evidence of over 200 arrests that had been made for violation of the ordinance between November, 1981, and March, 1982.  Violations are apparently so frequent that the City uses a printed form to report charges.</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1107.  The form, entitled "Complaint:  Interrupting a Policeman," contains the preprinted charge of "willfully or intentionally interrupt[ing] a city policeman" that is followed by a blank in which the officer fills in a description of the basis for the charge.  <em>Id.</em> at 1108-1109.  While noting that the majority of those arrested are charged with conduct that is "patently unlawful," the Court of Appeals observed that</p>\n<p>"[i]n many instances, . . . the malefactor is described [in the handwritten portion] as having done nothing more offensive to the public order than speaking or failing to remain silent."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1109.  Over a third of these arrests were never prosecuted.  <em>Id.</em> at 1110.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The city also claims that the Court of Appeals engaged in improper factfinding. The city notes that the District Court found that the ordinance had not been unconstitutionally applied, and argues that the Court of Appeals erred in reviewing Hill\'s evidence and concluding that it showed a potential for unconstitutional application. Such a conclusion was foreclosed, according to the city, by the "clearly erroneous" standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). Brief for Appellant 40.</p>\n<p>This argument is without merit. An independent review of the record is appropriate where the activity in question is arguably protected by the Constitution. NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/883/case.html#886">468 U. S. 886</a></span>, 915916, n. 50 (1982). Moreover, the Court of Appeals accepted as "not challenged on appeal" the District Court\'s finding that the ordinance had not been unconstitutionally applied to Hill or to the reporters, 789 F.2d at 1107, 1110. The disagreement between the lower courts was therefore limited to a question of law -- whether the ordinance on its face was substantially overbroad. In concluding that the ordinance was overbroad, the Court of Appeals did not err in reviewing evidence ignored by the District Court concerning the application of the ordinance, and in concluding that this evidence demonstrated a significant potential for unconstitutional application of the ordinance.</p>\n<p>The question whether the ordinance has been unconstitutionally applied to Hill is neither presented by this appeal nor essential to our decision, and we do not address it.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The city\'s threshold argument that Hill lacks standing is without merit.  The basis for the argument is the District Court\'s finding that the ordinance has been constitutionally applied to Hill in the past.  This finding is irrelevant, however, to the question of Hill\'s standing to seek prospective relief.  Hill has shown "a genuine threat of enforcement" of the ordinance against his future activities, <em>Steffel v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/case.html">415 U.

Statement B-3, n. 1 (District Court finding that Hill "is a gay rights activist who claims that the Houston police have <em>systematically\' harassed him `as the direct result\' of his sexual preferences").  Moreover, although we have never required that a plaintiff "undergo a criminal prosecution" to obtain standing to challenge the facial validity of a statute, <em>Doe v. Bolton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/179/case.html">410 U.

Subsection \xc2\xa7 42.01(a)(1), which makes unlawful "abusive, indecent, profane or vulgar language" only if "by its very utterance [it] tends to incite an immediate breach of the peace," prohibits the use of fighting words.  The "practice commentary" in the annotated Code confirms that this section is designed to track the "fighting words" exception set forth in <em>Chaplinsky v.

But if some constitutionally unprotected speech must go unpunished, that is a price worth paying to preserve the vitality of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>"[I]f absolute assurance of tranquility is required, we may as well forget about free speech.  Under such a requirement, the only \'free\' speech would consist of platitudes.  That kind of speech does not need constitutional protection."</p>\n<p><em>Spence v.

For example, JUSTICE POWELL states that</p>\n<p>"a municipality constitutionally may punish an individual who chooses to stand near a police officer and persistently attempt to engage the officer in conversation while the officer is directing traffic at a busy intersection."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#479">482 U. S. 479</a></span>.  We agree, however, that such conduct might constitutionally be punished under a properly tailored statute, such as a disorderly conduct statute that makes it unlawful to fail to disperse in response to a valid police order or to create a traffic hazard.  <em>E.g., Colten v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/104/case.html">407 U. S. 104</a></span> (1972).  What a municipality may not do, however, and what Houston has done in this case, is to attempt to punish such conduct by broadly criminalizing speech directed to an officer -- in this case, by authorizing the police to arrest a person who in any manner verbally interrupts an officer.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL also observes that "contentious and abusive" speech can interrupt an officer\'s investigation, and offers as an example a person who "run[s] beside [an officer pursuing a felon] in a public street shouting at the officer."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#479">482 U. S. 479</a></span>.  But what is of concern in that example is not simply contentious speech, but rather the possibility that, by shouting and running beside the officer, the person may physically obstruct the officer\'s investigation.  Although that person might constitutionally be punished under a tailored statute that prohibited individuals from physically obstructing an officer\'s investigation, he or she may not be punished under a broad statute aimed at speech.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>This conclusion finds a familiar echo in the common law.  <em>See, e.g., The King v.

[told] some persons in a tone of voice undoubtedly intended for [the officer\'s] ears, that the arrested man was not drunk and the arrest was unjustifiable.  Now up to this point, he had committed no crime, as in a free country like this, citizens are entitled to express their opinions without thereby rendering themselves liable to arrest unless they are inciting others to break the law; and policemen are not exempt from criticism any more than Cabinet Ministers"); <em>Levy v.

In my view, the Court should not have reached the merits of the constitutional claims, but instead should have certified a question to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.  I also disagree with the Court\'s reasons for declining to abstain under the principle of <em>Railroad Comm\'n v.

Finally, although I agree that the ordinance as interpreted by the Court violates the Fourteenth Amendment, I write separately because I cannot join the Court\'s reasoning.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>This case involves a challenge to an ordinance designed to prevent interference with police officers in the performance of their duties.  Constitutional analysis should not proceed until we determine the precise meaning of the ordinance in question.

Both parties acknowledge, however, that the Texas Penal Code requires imputation of some culpability requirement.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellant 28-30; Brief for Appellee </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 482 U.

Texas Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 6.02(b) (1974) provides:</p>\n<p>"If the definition of an offense does not prescribe a culpable mental state, a culpable mental state is nevertheless required unless the definition plainly dispenses with any mental element. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]"</p>\n<p>The nature of this imputed mental state has a direct effect on the constitutional issue presented by this case.  The Court apparently assumes that the requisite intent can be provided by a person\'s intent to utter words that constitute an interruption.  But it would be plausible for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to construe the intent requirement differently.  For example, that court could conclude that conviction under the ordinance requires proof that the person not only intended to speak, but also intended to interfere with the officer\'s performance of his duties.</p>\n<p>This interpretation would change the constitutional questions in two ways:  it would narrow substantially the scope of the ordinance, and possibly resolve the overbreadth question; it also would make the language of the ordinance more precise, and possibly satisfy the concern as to vagueness.  At the least, such an interpretation would narrow the focus of the constitutional question and obviate the need for the Court\'s broad statements regarding First Amendment protections of speech directed at police officers.  It is not this Court\'s role, however, to place an interpretive gloss on the words the Houston City Council has chosen.  The ordinance is not a federal law, and we do not have the power "<em>authoritatively to construe\'" it.  <em>Gooding v.

Although I agree with the Court that <em>Pullman</em> abstention is inappropriate in this case, I write separately because my reasons are somewhat different from those expressed by the Court. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Pullman</em> abstention is inappropriate unless the state courts "provid[e] the parties with adequate means to adjudicate the controverted state law issue."  Field, Abstention in Constitutional Cases:  The Scope of the <em>Pullman</em> Abstention Doctrine, 122 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1071, 1144 (1974).  <em>See</em> 17 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 4242, p. 468 (1978).  <em>Cf. Railroad Comm\'n v. Pullman Co.,</em> 312 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/case.html#501">312 U. S. 501</a></span> (abstaining because the "law of Texas appears to furnish easy and ample means for determining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 482 U. S. 477</a></p><p> the Commission\'s authority"). [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  It is not clear that Texas law affords a remedy by which Hill could obtain a state court interpretation of the ordinance.  The only apparent means of securing such a ruling would be through an action for a declaratory judgment.  <em>See</em> Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 37.001 <em>et seq.</em> (1986) (authorizing courts to grant declaratory judgments).  But Texas law treats declaratory judgment actions as civil cases.  Thus, they are appealable to the Texas Supreme Court, rather than the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.  <em>See, e.g., United Services Life Ins. Co. v. Delaney,</em> 396 S.W.2d 855 (Tex.1965).  Moreover, because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to decide questions of Texas criminal law, <em>see</em> Tex.Const., Art. V, \xc2\xa7 5, the Texas Supreme Court has held, with narrow exceptions, that injunctive or declaratory relief against criminal statutes is not available in civil cases.  <em>See Texas Liquor Control Board v. Canyon Creek Land Corp.,</em> 456 S.W.2d 891, 894-896 (Tex.1970).  Thus, it is quite unlikely that a declaratory or injunctive action would bring Hill any determination of the meaning of the ordinance -- either from a trial or an appellate court.  In short, the only sure ways for the ordinance to be interpreted are by certification, <em>see supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#473">482 U. S. 473</a></span>-475, and by appeals of criminal convictions under the ordinance.  Neither of these routes provides Hill a means to obtain relief sufficient to justify <em>Pullman</em> abstention.</p>\n<p>Aside from the barriers created by Texas procedure, the late stage at which the city of Houston raised this issue weighs heavily against abstention.  Houston first suggested that abstention was appropriate after the Court of Appeals published its panel opinion invalidating the ordinance.  As </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 482 U. S. 478</a></p><p> we have noted in a similar case,</p>\n<p>"[t]his proposal comes nearly three years after the filing of the complaint, and would produce delay attributable to abstention that the Court in recent years has sought to minimize."</p>\n<p><em>See Mayor of Philadelphia v. Education Equality League,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/605/case.html">415 U. S. 605</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/605/case.html#628">415 U. S. 628</a></span> (1974).  In sum, the late presentation of this claim, coupled with the doubts as to whether relief could be secured under Texas law, convinces me that <em>Pullman</em> abstention is inappropriate here.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>I agree with the Court\'s conclusion that the ordinance violates the Fourteenth Amendment, but do not join the Court\'s reasoning.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court finds that the ordinance "deals not with core criminal conduct, but with speech."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#460">482 U. S. 460</a></span>.  This view of the ordinance draws a distinction where none exists.  The terms of the ordinance -- "oppose, molest, abuse or interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty" -- include general words that can apply as fully to conduct as to speech.  It is in this respect that <em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html">415 U. S. 130</a></span> (1974), is clearly distinguishable.  In that case, the New Orleans ordinance made it a breach of the peace for:</p>\n<p>"\'any person wantonly to curse or revile or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward or with reference to any member of the city police while in the actual performance of his duty.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html#132">415 U. S. 132</a></span> (quoting New Orleans Ordinance 828 M.C.S. \xc2\xa7 49-7).  On its face, the New Orleans ordinance criminalizes only the use of language.  JUSTICE BRENNAN, speaking for the Court in <em>Lewis,</em> explicitly noted this, stating that the ordinance "punishe[d] only spoken words."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html#134">415 U. S. 134</a></span>.  By contrast, the ordinance presented in this case could be applied to activity that involves no element of speech or communication.  For example, the ordinance evidently would punish individuals </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 482 U. S. 479</a></p><p> who -- without saying a single word -- obstructed an officer\'s access to the scene of an ongoing public disturbance, or indeed the scene of a crime.  Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Court that this ordinance punishes only speech.</p>\n<p>I do agree that the ordinance can be applied to speech in some cases.  And I also agree that the First Amendment protects a good deal of speech that may be directed at police officers.  On occasion, this may include verbal criticism, but I question the implication of the Court\'s opinion that the First Amendment generally protects verbal "challenge[s] directed at police officers," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#461">482 U. S. 461</a></span>.  A "challenge" often takes the form of opposition or interruption of performance of duty. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In many situations, speech of this type directed at police officers will be functionally indistinguishable from conduct that the First Amendment clearly does not protect.  For example, I have no doubt that a municipality constitutionally may punish an individual who chooses to stand near a police officer and persistently attempt to engage the officer in conversation while the officer is directing traffic at a busy intersection.  Similarly, an individual, by contentious and abusive speech, could interrupt an officer\'s investigation of possible criminal conduct.  A person observing an officer pursuing a person suspected of a felony could run beside him in a public street shouting at the officer.  Similar tactics could interrupt a policeman lawfully attempting to interrogate persons believed to be witnesses to a crime. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 482 U. S. 480</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In sum, the Court\'s opinion appears to reflect a failure to apprehend that this ordinance -- however it may be construed -- is intended primarily to further the public\'s interest in law enforcement.  To be sure, there is a fine line between legitimate criticism of police and the type of criticism that interferes with the very purpose of having police officers.  But the Court unfortunately seems to ignore this fine line, and to extend First Amendment protection to any type of verbal molestation or interruption of an officer in the performance of his duty.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Despite the concerns expressed above, I nevertheless agree that the ambiguous terms of this ordinance</p>\n<p>"confe[r] on police a virtually unrestrained power to arrest and charge persons with a violation. . . .  The opportunity for abuse, especially where a statute has received a virtually open-ended interpretation, is self-evident."</p>\n<p><em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html#135">415 U. S. 135</a></span>-136 (POWELL, J., concurring in result).  No Texas court has placed a limiting construction on the ordinance.  Also, it is clear that Houston has made no effort to curtail the wide discretion of police officers under the present ordinance.  The record contains a sampling of complaints filed under the ordinance in 1981 and 1982.  People have been charged with such crimes as "Failure to remain silent and stationary," "Remaining," "Refusing to remain silent," and "Talking."  789 F.2d 1103, 1113-1114 (CA5 1986) (en banc).  Although some of these incidents may have involved unprotected conduct, the vagueness of these charges suggests that, with respect to this ordinance, Houston officials have not been acting with proper sensitivity to the constitutional rights of their citizens.  When government protects society\'s interests in a manner that restricts some speech, the law must be framed more precisely than the ordinance before us.  Accordingly, I agree with the Court that the Houston ordinance is unconstitutional. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 482 U. S. 481</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is difficult, of course, specifically to frame an ordinance that applies in</p>\n<p>"areas of human conduct where, by the nature of the problems presented, legislatures simply cannot establish standards with great precision.  Control of the broad range of disorderly conduct that may inhibit a policeman in the performance of his official duties may be one such area, requiring as it does an on-the-spot assessment of the need to keep order."</p>\n<p><em>Smith v. Goguen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/566/case.html">415 U. S. 566</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/566/case.html#581">415 U. S. 581</a></span> (1974).  In view of the difficulty of drafting precise language that never restrains speech and yet serves the public interest, the attempts of States and municipalities to draft laws of this type should be accorded some leeway.  I am convinced, however, that the Houston ordinance is too vague to comport with the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  As I explained <em>supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#473">482 U. S. 473</a></span>-474, it should be possible for the present ordinance to be reframed in a way that would limit the present broad discretion of officers and at the same time protect substantially the city\'s legitimate interests.  For example, the ordinance could make clear that it applies to speech only if the purpose of the speech were to interfere with the performance by a police officer of his lawful duties.  In this situation, the difficulties of drafting precisely should not justify upholding this ordinance.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although I believe that the proper course is for the Court to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I "bo[w] to the Court\'s decision that the case is properly before us," <em>Brown Shoe Co. v.

First, it suggests that this Court should be "particularly reluctant to abstain in cases involving facial challenges based on the First Amendment."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#467">482 U. S. 467</a></span>.  The Court supports this conclusion with a citation to <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html">380 U. S. 479</a></span> (1965).  I see nothing in that case that supports such a broad principle.  The <em>Dombrowski</em> Court declined to abstain because "the interpretation ultimately put on the [challenged state] statutes by the state courts is irrelevant," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html#490">380 U.

S. 491</a></span>.  Both of these rationales are straightforward applications of the general rule that <em>Pullman</em> abstention is appropriate only when determination of an uncertain question of state law would obviate the need for the federal court to decide a substantial question of federal constitutional law.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s second reason for not abstaining is that it believes the statute is not "<em>fairly subject to an interpretation which will . . . substantially modify the federal constitutional question.\'" <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html#468">482 U.
