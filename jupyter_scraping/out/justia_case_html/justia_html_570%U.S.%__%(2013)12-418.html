After serving his sentence and receiving a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, he moved to Texas where he registered with state authorities as a sex offender.  Congress subsequently enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live, study, and work, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913(a), and which applies to offenders who, when SORNA became law, had already completed their sentences, 28 CFR \xc2\xa772.3.  When Kebodeaux moved within Texas and failed to update his registration, the Federal Government prosecuted him under SORNA, and the District Court convicted him.  The Fifth Circuit reversed, noting that, at the time of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, Kebodeaux had served his sentence and was no longer in any special relationship with the Federal Government.  Believing that Kebodeaux was not required to register under the pre-SORNA Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, the court found that he had been \xe2\x80\x9cunconditionally\xe2\x80\x9d freed.  That being so, the court held, the Federal Government lacked the power under Article I\xe2\x80\x99s Necessary and Proper Clause to regulate his intrastate movements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements as applied to Kebodeaux fall within the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

See, e.g., 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714072(i)(3)\xe2\x80\x93(4).  The fact that these federal-law requirements in part involved compliance with state-law requirements made them no less requirements of federal law.  See generally United States v. Sharpnack, \n\n355 U.\xc2\xa0S. 286\n\xe2\x80\x93294.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Congress promulgated the Wetterling Act under authority granted by the Military Regulation Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 14, and the Necessary and Proper Clause.  The same power that authorized Congress to promulgate the Uniform Code of Military Justice and punish Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s crime also authorized Congress to make the civil registration requirement at issue here a consequence of his conviction.  And its decision to impose a civil registration requirement that would apply upon the release of an offender like Kebodeaux is eminently reasonable.  See Smith v. Doe, \n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 84\n\xe2\x80\x93103.  It was also entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned a special role to the Federal Government in ensuring compliance with federal sex offender registration requirements.  See Carr v. United States, \n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438\n, ___.  Thus, Congress did not apply SORNA to an individual who had, prior to its enactment, been \xe2\x80\x9cunconditionally released,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather to an individual already subject to federal registration requirements enacted pursuant to the Military Regulation and Necessary and Proper Clauses.  SORNA somewhat modified the applicable registration requirements to which Kebodeaux was already subject, in order to make more uniform what had remained \xe2\x80\x9ca patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d Reynolds v. United States, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  No one here claims that these changes are unreasonable or that Congress could not reasonably have found them \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d means for furthering its pre-existing registration ends.

It imposed a sentence of three months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment and a bad conduct discharge.  In 2006, several years after Kebodeaux had served his sentence and been discharged, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), \n\n120Stat.\n590, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716901 et\xc2\xa0seq., a federal statute that requires those convicted of federal sex offenses to register in the States where they live, study, and work.  \xc2\xa716913(a); \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a).  And, by regulation, the Federal Government made clear that SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements ap- ply to federal sex offenders who, when SORNA became law, had already completed their sentences.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913(d) (Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority to issue regulations); 28 CFR \xc2\xa772.3 (2012) (regulation specifying application to pre-SORNA offenders).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe here must decide whether the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to enact SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements and apply them to a federal offender who had completed his sentence prior to the time of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  For purposes of answering this question, we assume that Congress has complied with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Ex Post Facto and Due Process Clauses.  See Smith v. Doe, \n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 84\n\xe2\x80\x93106 (2003) (upholding a similar Alaska statute against ex post facto challenge); Supp. Brief for Kebodeaux on Rehearing En Banc in No. 08\xe2\x80\x9351185 (CA5) (not raising any Due Process challenge); Brief for Respondent (same).  We conclude that the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress adequate power to enact SORNA and to apply it here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs we have just said, in 1999 a special court-martial convicted Kebodeaux, then a member of the Air Force, of a federal sex offense.  He served his 3-month sentence; the Air Force released him with a bad conduct discharge.  And then he moved to Texas.  In 2004 Kebodeaux registered as a sex offender with Texas state authorities.  Brief for Respondent 6\xe2\x80\x937.  In 2006 Congress enacted SORNA.  In 2007 Kebodeaux moved within Texas from San Antonio to El Paso, updating his sex offender registration.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a\xe2\x80\x93168a.  But later that year he returned to San Antonio without making the legally required sex-offender registration changes.  Id., at 169a.  And the Federal Government, acting under SORNA, prosecuted Kebodeaux for this last-mentioned SORNA registration failure.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA Federal District Court convicted Kebodeaux of having violated SORNA.  See 687 F.\xc2\xa03d 232, 234 (CA5 2012) (en banc).  On appeal a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit initially upheld the conviction.  647 F.\xc2\xa03d 137 (2011) (per curiam).  But the Circuit then heard the appeal en banc and, by a vote of 10 to 6, reversed.  687 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 234.  The court stated that, by the time Congress enacted SORNA, Kebodeaux had \xe2\x80\x9cfully served\xe2\x80\x9d his sex-offense sentence; he was \xe2\x80\x9cno longer in federal custody, in the military, under any sort of supervised release or parole, or in any other special relationship with the federal government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe court recognized that, even before SORNA, federal law required certain federal sex offenders to register.  Id., at 235, n.\xc2\xa04.  See Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, \xc2\xa7170101, \n\n108Stat.\n2038\xe2\x80\x932042.  But it believed that the pre-SORNA federal registration requirements did not apply to Kebodeaux.  687 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 235, n.\xc2\xa04.  Hence, in the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, Kebodeaux had been \xe2\x80\x9cunconditionally let .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. free.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 234.  And, that being so, the Federal Government lacked the power under Article I\xe2\x80\x99s Necessary and Proper Clause to regulate through registration Kebo- deaux\xe2\x80\x99s intrastate movements.  Id., at 234\xe2\x80\x93235.  In particular, the court said that after \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal government has unconditionally let a person free .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the fact that he once committed a crime is not a jurisdictional basis for subsequent regulation and possible criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Solicitor General sought certiorari.  And, in light of the fact that a Federal Court of Appeals has held a federal statute unconstitutional, we granted the petition.  See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598, \n605 (2000)\n; United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., \n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 418, \n425 (1993)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not agree with the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  And, in explaining our reasons, we need not go much further than the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s critical assumption that Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s release was \xe2\x80\x9cunconditional,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., that after Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s release, he was not in \xe2\x80\x9cany .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  special relationship with the fed- eral government.\xe2\x80\x9d  687 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 234.  To the contrary, the Solicitor General, tracing through a complex set of statutory cross-references, has pointed out that at the time of his offense and conviction Kebodeaux was subject to the federal Wetterling Act, an Act that imposed upon him registration requirements very similar to those that SORNA later mandated.  Brief for United States 18\xe2\x80\x9329.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress enacted the Wetterling Act in 1994 and up- dated it several times prior to Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s offense.  Like SORNA, it used the federal spending power to encourage States to adopt sex offender registration laws.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714071(i) (2000 ed.); Smith, supra, at 89\xe2\x80\x9390.  Like SORNA, it applied to those who committed federal sex crimes.  \xc2\xa714071(b)(7)(A).  And like SORNA, it imposed federal penalties upon federal sex offenders who failed to register in the States in which they lived, worked, and studied.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714072(i)(3)\xe2\x80\x93(4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn particular, \xc2\xa714072(i)(3) imposed federal criminal penalties upon any \xe2\x80\x9cperson who is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. described in section 4042(c)(4) of title 18, and knowingly fails to register in any State in which the person resides.\xe2\x80\x9d  The cross-referenced \xc2\xa74042(c)(4) said that a \xe2\x80\x9cperson is described in this paragraph if the person was convicted of\xe2\x80\x9d certain enumerated offenses or \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny other offense designated by the Attorney General as a sexual offense for purposes of this subsection.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74042(c)(4).  In 1998 the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cdelegated this authority [to designate sex offenses] to the Director of the Bureau of Prisons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Designation of Offenses Subject to Sex Offender Release Notification, 63 Fed. Reg. 69386.  And that same year the Director of the Bureau of Prisons \xe2\x80\x9cdesignate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the offense of which Kebodeaux was convicted, namely the military offense of \xe2\x80\x9ccarnal knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d as set forth in Article 120(B) of the Code of Military Justice.  Id., at 69387  See 28 CFR \xc2\xa7571.72(b)(2) (1999).  A full reading of these documents makes clear that, contrary to Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s contention, the relevant penalty applied to crimes committed by military personnel.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, a different Wetterling Act section imposed federal criminal penalties upon any \xe2\x80\x9cperson who is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sentenced by a court martial for conduct in a category specified by the Secretary of Defense under section 115(a)(8)(C) of title I of Public Law 105\xe2\x80\x93119, and know- ingly fails to register in any State in which the person resides.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714072(i)(4) (2000 ed.).  The cross-referenced section, \xc2\xa7115(a)(8)(C), said that the \xe2\x80\x9cSecretary of Defense shall specify categories of conduct punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice which encompass a range of conduct comparable to that described in [certain provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994], and such other conduct as the Secretary deems appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  1998 Appropriations Act, \xc2\xa7115(a)(8)(C)(i), \n\n111Stat.\n2466.  See note following \n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7951 (2000 ed.).  The Secretary had delegated certain types of authority, such as this last mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cdeem[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d authority, to an Assistant Secretary of Defense.  DoD Directive 5124.5, p. 4 (Oct. 31, 1994).  And in December 1998 an Assistant Secretary, acting pursuant to this authority, published a list of military crimes that included the crime of which Kebodeaux was convicted, namely Article 120(B) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a\xe2\x80\x93175a.  The provision added that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onvictions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall trigger requirements to notify state and local law enforcement agencies and to provide information to inmates concerning sex offender registration requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 175a.  And, the provision says (contrary to Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s reading, Brief for Respondent 57), that it shall \xe2\x80\x9ctake effect immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d It contains no expiration date.

Con- trary to what the Court of Appeals may have believed, the fact that the federal law\xe2\x80\x99s requirements in part involved compliance with state-law requirements made them no less requirements of federal law.

It could specify that the sex offense of which Kebodeaux was convicted was a military crime under that Code.  It could punish that crime through imprisonment and by placing conditions upon Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s release.  And it could make the civil registration requirement at issue here a consequence of Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s offense and conviction.  This civil requirement, while not a specific condition of Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s release, was in place at the time Kebodeaux committed his offense, and was a consequence of his violation of federal law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to impose such a civil requirement that would apply upon the release of an offender like Kebodeaux is eminently reasonable.  Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.  See Smith, 538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 102\xe2\x80\x93103 (sex offender registration has \xe2\x80\x9ca legitimate nonpunitive purpose of \xe2\x80\x98public safety, which is advanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex offenders in their community\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is evidence that recidivism rates among sex offenders are higher than the average for other types of criminals.  See  Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, P. Langan, E. Schmitt, &amp; M. Durose, Recidivism of Sex Offenders Released in 1994, p. 1 (Nov. 2003) (reporting that compared to non-sex offenders, released sex offenders were four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime, and that within the first three years following release 5.3% of released sex offenders were rearrested for a sex crime).  There is also conflicting evidence on the point.  Cf. R. Tewsbury, W. Jennings, &amp; K. Zgoba, Final Report on Sex Offenders: Recidivism and Collateral Consequences (Sept. 2011) (concluding that sex offenders have relatively low rates of recidivism, and that registration requirements have limited observable benefits regarding recidivism).  But the Clause gives Congress the power to weigh the evidence and to reach a rational conclusion, for example, that safety needs justify postrelease registration rules.  See Lambert v. Yellowley, \n\n272 U.\xc2\xa0S. 581\n\xe2\x80\x93 595 (1926) (upholding congressional statute limiting the amount of spirituous liquor that may be prescribed by a physician, and noting that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cfinding [regard- ing the appropriate amount], in the presence of the well-known diverging opinions of physicians, cannot be regarded as arbitrary or without a reasonable basis\xe2\x80\x9d).

United States, \n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438\n, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12).  The Federal Government has long kept track of former federal prisoners through probation, parole, and supervised release in part to prevent further crimes thereby protecting the public against the risk of recidivism.  See  Parole Act, \n\n36Stat.\n819; Probation Act, ch. 521, \n\n43Stat.\n1259; Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, ch. II, \n\n98Stat.\n1987.  See also 1 N.

Neither, as of 1994, was registration particularly novel, for by then States had implemented similar requirements for close to half a century.  See W. Logan, Knowledge as Power: Criminal Registration and Community Notification Laws in America 30\xe2\x80\x9331 (2009).  Moreover, the Wetterling Act took state interests into account by, for the most part, requiring released federal offenders to register in accordance with state law.  At the same time, the Wetterling Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements were reasonably narrow and precise, tying time limits to the type of sex offense, incorporating state-law details, and relating penalties for violations to the sex crime initially at issue.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714071(b) (2000 ed.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe upshot is that here Congress did not apply SORNA to an individual who had, prior to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, been \xe2\x80\x9cunconditionally released,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., a person who was not in \xe2\x80\x9cany .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. special relationship with the federal government,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather to an individual already subject to federal registration requirements that were themselves a valid exercise of federal power under the Military Regulation and Necessary and Proper Clauses.

In gen-eral, SORNA provided more detailed definitions of sex offenses, described in greater detail the nature of the information registrants must provide, and imposed somewhat different limits upon the length of time that regis- tration must continue and the frequency with which offenders must update their registration.  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716911, 16913\xe2\x80\x9316916 (2006 ed. and Supp. V).  But the statute, like the Wetterling Act, used Spending Clause grants to encourage States to adopt its uniform definitions and requirements.  It did not insist that the States do so.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716925(a), (d) (2006 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of this subchapter that are cast as directions to jurisdictions or their officials constitute, in relation to States, only conditions required to avoid the reduction of Federal funding under this section\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs applied to an individual already subject to the Wetterling Act like Kebodeaux, SORNA makes few changes.  In particular, SORNA modified the time limitations for a sex offender who moves to update his registration to within three business days of the move from both seven days before and seven days after the move, as required by the Texas law enforced under the Wetterling Act.  Compare \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913(c) with App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a\xe2\x80\x93168a.  SORNA also increased the federal penalty for a federal offender\xe2\x80\x99s registration violation to a maximum of 10 years from a maximum of 1 year for a first offense.  Compare \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a) with \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714072(i) (2000 ed.).  Kebodeaux was sentenced to one year and one day of imprisonment.  For purposes of federal law, SORNA re- duced the duration of Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement to 25 years from the lifetime requirement imposed by Texas law, compare \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716915(a) (2006 ed.) with App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a, and reduced the frequency with which Kebodeaux must update his registration to every six months from every 90 days as imposed by Texas law, compare \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716916(2) with App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a.  And as far as we can tell, while SORNA punishes violations of its requirements (instead of violations of state law), the Federal Government has prosecuted a sex offender for violating SORNA only when that offender also violated state-registration requirements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSORNA\xe2\x80\x99s general changes were designed to make more uniform what had remained \xe2\x80\x9ca patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration systems,\xe2\x80\x9d Reynolds v.

The majority, having established that premise and thus resolved the case before us, nevertheless goes on to discuss the general public safety benefits of the registration requirement.  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  Because that analysis is beside the point in this case, I con- cur in the judgment only.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile serving in the Air Force, Kebodeaux violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice by having sexual relations with a minor.  A special court-martial convicted him.  As relevant here, that conviction had two consequences: First, Kebodeaux was sentenced to confinement for three months.  And second, as the majority describes, he was required to register as a sex offender with the State in which he resided and keep that registration current; failure to do so would subject him to federal criminal penalties.  Ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x936.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the same way that Congress undoubtedly had the au- thority to impose the first consequence for a violation of military rules, it also had the authority to impose the second.  The Constitution gives Congress the power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa014.  And, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress can give those rules force by imposing consequences on members of the military who disobey them.  See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 416 (1819) (\xe2\x80\x9cAll admit that the government may, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws; and yet, this is not among the enumerated powers of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d).  A servicemember will be less likely to violate a relevant military regulation if he knows that, having done so, he will be required to register as a sex offender years into the future.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is this power, the power to regulate the conduct of members of the military by imposing consequences for their violations of military law, that supports application of the federal registration obligation to Kebodeaux.  As the Court explains, the Wetterling Act was in force when Kebodeaux committed the original offense, and applied to him as soon as the special court-martial rendered its verdict.  See ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Congress later, in enacting the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), modified the registration regime in place under the Wetterling Act.  But as applied to Kebodeaux here (the relevant inquiry in this as-applied challenge), those changes were insignificant; their only effect was that Kebodeaux received a day more than he could have received for the same conduct had the Wetterling Act remained in force.  See ante, at 11 (describing SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s effect on Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s registration obligations); compare post, at 10, n.\xc2\xa03 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (discussing changes that did not affect Kebodeaux).  Whatever other constitutional concerns might attach to such a change, as a question of Article I power it was permissible.  Just as the Federal Government may, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, alter the conditions of a federal prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s confinement or adjust the timing and location of drug tests required of a federal convict, so too could it make slight modifications to a previously imposed registration obligation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority says, more or less, the same thing.  Ante, at 8, 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  But sandwiched between its discussion of the basis for Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power and its discussion of the inconsequential nature of the changes is a discussion of benefits from the registration system.  Along with giving force to military regulations, the majority notes, Congress could also have \xe2\x80\x9creasonably conclude[d] that registration requirements .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. help protect the public from .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMaybe so, but those consequences of the registration requirement are irrelevant for our purposes.  Public safety benefits are neither necessary nor sufficient to a proper exercise of the power to regulate the military.  What matters\xe2\x80\x94all that matters\xe2\x80\x94is that Congress could have rationally determined that \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] the civil registration requirement at issue here a consequence of Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s offense\xe2\x80\x9d would give force to the Uniform Code of Military Justice adopted pursuant to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to regulate the Armed Forces.

Here, however, I worry that incautious readers will think they have found in the majority opinion something they would not find in either the Constitution or any prior decision of ours: a federal police power.  The danger of such confusion is heightened by the fact the Solicitor General adopted something very close to the police power argument, contending that \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal government has greater ties to former federal sex offenders than it does to other members of the general public,\xe2\x80\x9d and can therefore impose restrictions on them even years after their unconditional release simply to \xe2\x80\x9cserve[ ] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. public-protection purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 34\xe2\x80\x9335.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI write separately to stress not only that a federal police power is immaterial to the result in this case, but also that such a power could not be material to the result in this case\xe2\x80\x94because it does not exist.

A power of that magnitude vested in the Federal Government is not \xe2\x80\x9cconsist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d McCulloch, supra, at 421, and thus not a \xe2\x80\x9cproper [means] for carrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d the enumerated powers of the Federal Government, U.\xc2\xa0S.

The fact of a prior fed- eral conviction, by itself, does not give Congress a freestand- ing, independent, and perpetual interest in protecting the public from the convict\xe2\x80\x99s purely intrastate conduct.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut as I have said, I do not understand the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to be based on such a power.  The connection to the Military Regulation Clause on which the majority relies, ante, at 8, is less attenuated, and the power it produces less substantial, than would be true of a federal police power over prior federal offenders; the power to threaten and impose particular obligations as a result of a violation of military law is not such a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat substantive and independent power\xe2\x80\x9d that the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 failure to enumerate it must imply its absence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, I fear that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the public-safety benefits of the registration requirement will be mistaken for an endorsement of the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s public-safety basis for the law.

Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 14.  Exercising this power, Congress has enacted provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) that authorize members of the military to be tried before a military tribunal, rather than a state court, for ordinary criminal offenses, including sex crimes, that are committed both within and outside the boundaries of a military installation.  See, e.g., UCMJ Art. 2 (persons subject to UCMJ); Art. 5 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis chapter applies in all places\xe2\x80\x9d); Art. 120 (rape by a person subject to UCMJ); Solorio v. United States, \n\n483 U. S. 435\n\xe2\x80\x93438 (1987) (servicemember may be court-martialed for off-base crime without \xe2\x80\x9cservice connection\xe2\x80\x9d).  States usually have concurrent jurisdiction over such crimes when they are committed off base and sometimes possess jurisdiction over such offenses when committed on base.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  These offenses, however, are rarely prosecuted in both a military and a state court, and therefore when a servicemember is court-martialed for a sex offense over which the State had jurisdiction, this is usually because the State has deferred to the military.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Where the offense in question is a sex crime, a consequence of this handling of the case is that the offender, if convicted, may fall through the cracks of a state registration system.  For example, if the servicemember is convicted of a sex offense in a state court, the state court may be required by state law to provide that information to the state registry.  See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x9322\xe2\x80\x93104(1)(a)(I) (2012).  State law may also require the state corrections department to notify both state and local police of the offender\xe2\x80\x99s release.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x9322\xe2\x80\x93107(3).  Provisions such as these are designed to prevent sex offenders from avoiding registration, as many have in the past.  See H. R. Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x93218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005) (despite pre-SORNA registration efforts, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he most significant enforcement issue in the sex offender program [was] that over 100,000 sex offenders, or nearly one-fifth in the Nation are \xe2\x80\x98missing,\xe2\x80\x99 meaning that they have not complied with sex offender registration requirements\xe2\x80\x9d). When a servicemember is convicted by a military tribunal, however, the State has no authority to require that tribunal to notify the state registry, nor does it have the authority to require the officials at a military prison to notify state or local police when the servicemember is released from custody.  Because the exercise of military jurisdiction may have this effect\xe2\x80\x94in other words, may create a gap in the laws intended to maximize the registration of sex offenders\xe2\x80\x94it is necessary and proper for Congress to require the registration of members of the military who are convicted of a qualifying sex offense in a military court.  When Congress, in validly exercising a power expressly conferred by the Constitution, creates or exacerbates a dangerous situation (here, the possibility that a convicted sex offender may escape registration), Congress has the power to try to eliminate or at least diminish that danger.  See United States v. Comstock, \n\n560 U. S. 126\n\xe2\x80\x93158 (2010) (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).

Thus, SORNA is a valid exercise of congressional authority only if it is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d one or more of those federal powers enumerated in the Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the course of this litigation, the Government has argued that Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s conviction under \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(A) executes Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated powers to spend for the gen- eral welfare, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01; to regulate interstate commerce, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03; and to regulate the armed forces, \xc2\xa78, cl. 14.  But none of these powers justifies applying \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(A) to Kebodeaux.  The Spending Clause ar- gument is a nonstarter.  Section 2250(a)(2)(A) does not execute Congress\xe2\x80\x99 spending power because it regulates individuals who have not necessarily received federal funds of any kind.  The Government contends that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal fund- ing and logistical support offered to States for their sex-offender-registration-and-notification programs can be effective only if persons required to register actually do so\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress may impose penalties on such individuals as a means of achieving that goal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 52.

Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, Congress may use its Commerce Clause power to regulate (1) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the use of the channels of interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (2) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) economic activities that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantially affect interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

Section 2250(a)(2)(A) does not fall within the first two categories because it is not limited to regulating sex offenders who have traveled in interstate commerce.  Instead, it applies to all federal sex offenders who fail to register, even if they never cross state lines.  Nor does \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(A) fall within the third category.  Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity, such as sex crimes, based on the effect it might have on interstate commerce.  Cf. Morrison, supra, at 617.

Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 14.  Kebodeaux had long since fully served his criminal sentence for violating Article 120(b) of the UCMJ and was no longer in the military when Congress enacted SORNA.  Congress does not retain a general police power over every person who has ever served in the military.  See United States ex rel. Toth v.

Regulation of the land and naval Forces\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d justifies imposing SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements on Kebodeaux.  Ante, at 6.  But not one line of the opinion explains how SORNA is directed at regulating the armed forces.  Instead, the Court explains how SORNA and the Wetterling Act serve various ends that are not enumerated in the Constitution.  Cf. ante, at 12 (explaining that SORNA was designed to \xe2\x80\x9ckeep track of more offenders\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cencourage States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to adopt its uniform standards\xe2\x80\x9d); ante, at 8 (explaining that the Wetterling Act was designed to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the public from .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to link SORNA to any enumerated power results in analysis that is untethered from the Constitution and disregards the admonition that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he powers of the legislature are defined, and limited.\xe2\x80\x9d  Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 176.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is flawed at every step.  It begins by explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of his offense Kebodeaux was subject to the federal Wetterling Act, an Act that imposed upon him registration requirements very similar to those that SORNA later mandated.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Ante, at 4.  But that is beside the point.  Kebodeaux was convicted of violating SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements, not the Wetterling Act\xe2\x80\x99s, and so the relevant question is what enumerated power SORNA \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ies] into Execution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Necessary and Proper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact any law simply because it furthers other laws Congress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental authority; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every federal statute \xe2\x80\x98carr[ies] into Execution\xe2\x80\x99 one or more of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Comstock, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 168 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, apparently in an effort to bootstrap the Wetterling Act, the Court proceeds to determine whether the Wetterling Act (not SORNA) falls within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  The Court first notes that the Clause \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98leave[s] to Congress a large discretion as to the means that may be employed in executing a given power,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 7 (quoting Lottery Case, \n\n188 U.\xc2\xa0S. 321, \n355 (1903)\n)\xe2\x80\x94a fact that is entirely irrelevant under McCulloch\xe2\x80\x99s first step of determining whether the end is itself legitimate.  The Court then observes that the Necessary and Proper Clause\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cauthorizes Congress, in the implementation of other explicit powers, to create federal crimes, to confine offenders to prison, to hire guards and other prison personnel, to provide prisoners with medical care and educational training, to ensure the safety of those who may come into contact with prisoners, to ensure the public\xe2\x80\x99s safety through systems of parole and supervised release, and, where a federal prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition so requires, to confine that prisoner civilly after the expiration of his or her term of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tFrom these powers, the Court reasons that the Wetterling Act is valid because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  As I explained in Comstock, how- ever, this mode of analysis confuses the inquiry.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 168\xe2\x80\x93169 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  \xe2\x80\x9cFederal laws that criminalize conduct .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , establish prisons for those who engage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and treatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal sentence\xe2\x80\x9d are only valid if they \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Execut[e]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d an enumer- ated power.  Id., at 169.  Here, for example, Congress has authority to enact Article 120(b) of the UCMJ, to enforce that provision against military personnel who violate it, and to confine them in a military prison while they are awaiting trial and serving a sentence.  All of those actions \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[y] into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to promote order and discipline within the military by regulating the conduct of military personnel.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 14.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut the enumerated power that justified Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s conviction does not justify requiring him to register as a sex offender now that he is a civilian.  If Kebodeaux were required to register as part of his criminal sentence, then registration would help execute the power that justifies his conviction.  The court-martial here, however, did not impose registration requirements at Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing.  See ante, at 8 (acknowledging that registration is a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil requirement\xe2\x80\x9d and was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a specific condition of Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s release\xe2\x80\x9d).  Enacted long after Kebodeaux had completed his sentence, SORNA cannot be justified as a punishment for the offense Kebodeaux committed while in the military because retroactively increasing his punishment would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See Peugh v. United States, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8) (explaining that laws that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inflic[t] a greater punishment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. than the law annexed to the crime .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when committed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d violate the Ex Post Facto Clause) (quoting Calder v.

As the Court below correctly recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements are civil and were enacted after Kebodeaux committed his crime, the [G]overnment cannot justify their constitutionality on the ground that they merely punish Kebodeaux for the crime he committed while in the military.\xe2\x80\x9d  687 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 239.

But the degree to which the Wetterling Act or SORNA accommodates State interests and intrudes on the lives of individuals subject to registration is irrelevant because the Supremacy Clause makes federal law supreme.

SORNA increases the federal penalty for fail-ing to register from a misdemeanor punishable by no more than one year to a felony punishable by up to 10 years for a first offense.  Compare \n with \n (2000 ed.).  It is simply incorrect to minimize that change by saying that Kebodeaux received only a day more than he could have received for failing to register under the Wetterling Act.  Ante, at 2 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).  The \xe2\x80\x9clegally prescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d Alleyne v. United States, ante, at 11, and SORNA increased that range significantly.  SORNA also requires that a sex offender who moves update his registration within three days of moving, instead of seven.  Compare \n with App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a\xe2\x80\x93168a.  Thus, a person can be convicted under SORNA for conduct that would have complied with the Wetterling Act.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">4</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice contends that Congress has authority to impose registration as a consequence of Kebodeaux\xe2\x80\x99s conviction because \xe2\x80\x9c[a] servicemember will be less likely to violate a relevant military regulation if he knows that, having done so, he will be required to register as a sex offender years into the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2.  But SORNA could not possibly have deterred Kebodeaux from violating any military regulation because it was enacted after he left the military.\nJustice Alito contends that, by trying members of the military in a military court, Congress exacerbated \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility that a convicted sex offender may escape [the state] registration [system],\xe2\x80\x9d and that SORNA is necessary and proper to correct this problem.  Ante, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  But Justice Alito has not identified any enumerated power that gives Congress authority to address this supposed problem, and there is no evidence that such a problem exists.  Indeed, Texas has indicated that SORNA undermines its registration system, rather than making it more effective.  See Letter from Jeffrey S. Boyd, General Counsel and Acting Chief of Staff, Texas Office of the Governor, to Linda Baldwin, Director, SMART Office 1 (Aug. 17, 2011) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we in Texas certainly appreciate and agree with the stated goals of SORNA, the adoption of this \xe2\x80\x98one-size-fits-all\xe2\x80\x99 federal legislation in Texas would in fact undermine the accomplishment of those objectives in Texas, just as it would in most other states\xe2\x80\x9d), onlineat http://www.ncleg.net/documentsites/committees/JLOCJPS/October%2013,%202011%20Meeting/RD_SORNA_General_Information_2011-10-13.pdf (as visited June 21, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970737">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 12\xe2\x80\x93418\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tUNITED STATES, PETITIONER v.

That does not establish, however, that the Wetterling Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirement was itself a valid exercise of any federal power, or that SORNA is designed to carry the Wetterling Act into execution.  The former proposition is dubious, the latter obviously untrue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
