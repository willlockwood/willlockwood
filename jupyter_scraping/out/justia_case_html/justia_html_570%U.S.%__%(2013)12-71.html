Reading \xe2\x80\x9caccept\xe2\x80\x9d merely to denote willing receipt seems out of place in the context of an official mandate to accept and use something for a given purpose.  The implication of such a mandate is that its object is to be accepted as sufficient for the requirement it is meant to satisfy.  Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s reading is also difficult to reconcile with neighboring NVRA provisions, such as \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1)(B) and \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArizona\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the presumption against pre-emption invoked in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Supremacy Clause cases is inapposite.  The power the Elections Clause confers is none other than the power to pre-empt.  Because Congress, when it acts under this Clause, is always on notice that its legislation will displace some element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the States, the reasonable assumption is that the text of Elections Clause legislation accurately communicates the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive intent.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNonetheless, while the NVRA forbids States to demand that an applicant submit additional information beyond that required by the Federal Form, it does not preclude States from \xe2\x80\x9cdeny[ing] registration based on information in their possession establishing the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s ineligibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0Arizona is correct that the Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them.  The latter is the province of the States.  See U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01; Amdt. 17.  It would raise serious constitutional doubts if a federal statute precluded a State from obtaining the information necessary to enforce its voter qualifications.  The NVRA can be read to avoid such a conflict, however.  Section 1973gg\xe2\x80\x937(b)(1) permits the EAC to include on the Federal Form information \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant.\xe2\x80\x9d  That validly conferred discretionary executive authority is properly exercised (as the Government has proposed) to require the inclusion of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s concrete-evidence requirement if such evidence is necessary to enable Arizona to enforce its citizenship qualification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe NVRA permits a State to request the EAC to include state-specific instructions on the Federal Form, see \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x937(a)(2), and a State may challenge the EAC\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of that request (or failure to act on it) in a suit under the Administrative Procedure Act.  That alternative means of enforcing its constitutional power to determine voting qualifications remains open to Arizona here.  Should the EAC reject or decline to act on a renewed request, Arizona would have the opportunity to establish in a reviewing court that a mere oath will not suffice to effectuate its citizenship requirement and that the EAC is therefore under a nondiscretionary duty to include Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s concrete-evidence requirement on the Federal Form.

The contents of that form (colloquially known as the Federal Form) are prescribed by a federal agency, the Election Assistance Commission.  The Federal Form developed by the EAC does not require documentary evidence of citizenship; rather, it requires only that an applicant aver, under penalty of perjury, that he is a citizen.  Arizona law requires voter-registration officials to \xe2\x80\x9creject\xe2\x80\x9d any application for registration, including a Federal Form, that is not accompanied by concrete evidence of citizenship.  The question is whether Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s evidence-of-citizenship requirement, as applied to Federal Form applicants, is pre-empted by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s mandate that States \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Form.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOver the past two decades, Congress has erected a complex superstructure of federal regulation atop state voter-registration systems.

If so, the state law, \xe2\x80\x9cso far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.\xe2\x80\x9d  Siebold, supra, at 384.  In Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s view, these seemingly incompatible obligations can be read to operate harmoniously: The NVRA, it contends, requires merely that a State receive the Federal Form willingly and use that form as one element in its (perhaps lengthy) transaction with a prospective voter.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTaken in isolation, the mandate that a State \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Form is fairly susceptible of two inter-pretations.  It might mean that a State must accept the Federal Form as a complete and sufficient registration ap-plication; or it might mean that the State is merely required to receive the form willingly and use it somehow in its voter registration process.  Both readings\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9creceive willingly\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caccept as sufficient\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are compatible with the plain meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9caccept.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 1 Oxford English Dictionary 70 (2d ed. 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cTo take or receive (a thing offered) willingly\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cTo receive as sufficient or adequate\xe2\x80\x9d); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 14 (2d ed. 1954) (\xe2\x80\x9cTo receive (a thing offered to or thrust upon one) with a consenting mind\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cTo receive with favor; to approve\xe2\x80\x9d).  And we take it as self-evident that the \xe2\x80\x9celastic\xe2\x80\x9d verb \xe2\x80\x9cuse,\xe2\x80\x9d read in isolation, is broad enough to encompass Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s preferred construction.

And reading \xe2\x80\x9caccept\xe2\x80\x9d merely to denote willing receipt seems out of place in the context of an official mandate to accept and use something for a given purpose.  The implication of such a mandate is that its object is to be accepted as sufficient for the requirement it is meant to satisfy.  For example, a government diktat that \xe2\x80\x9ccivil servants shall accept government IOUs for payment of salaries\xe2\x80\x9d does not invite the response, \xe2\x80\x9csure, we\xe2\x80\x99ll accept IOUs\xe2\x80\x94if you pay us a ten percent down payment in cash.\xe2\x80\x9d  Many federal statutes contain similarly phrased commands, and they contemplate more than mere willing receipt.

Section 1973gg\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1)(B) provides that a State shall \xe2\x80\x9censure that any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the valid voter registration form of the applicant is postmarked\xe2\x80\x9d not later than a specified number of days before the election.  (Emphasis added.)  Yet Arizona reads the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) as permitting it to reject a completed Federal Form if the applicant does not submit additional information required by state law.  That reading can be squared with Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s obligation under \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1) only if a completed Federal Form is not a \xe2\x80\x9cvalid voter registration form,\xe2\x80\x9d  which seems unlikely.  The statute empowers the EAC to create the Federal Form, \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x937(a), requires the EAC to prescribe its contents within specified limits, \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x937(b), and requires States to \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d it, \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1).  It is improbable that the statute envisions a completed copy of the form it takes such pains to create as being anything less than \xe2\x80\x9cvalid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act also authorizes States, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n addition to accepting and using the\xe2\x80\x9d Federal Form, to create their own, state-specific voter-registration forms, which can be used to register voters in both state and federal elections.  \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(2) (emphasis added).  These state-developed forms may require information the Federal Form does not.  (For example, unlike the Federal Form, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s registration form includes Proposition 200\xe2\x80\x99s proof-of-citizenship requirement.  See Arizona Voter Registration Form, p.\xc2\xa01, online at http://www.azsos.gov.)  This permission works in tandem with the requirement that States \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Form.  States retain the flexibility to design and use their own registration forms, but the Federal Form provides a backstop: No matter what procedural hurdles a State\xe2\x80\x99s own form imposes, the Federal Form guarantees that a simple means of registering to vote in federal elections will be available.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s reading would permit a State to demand of Federal Form applicants every additional piece of information the State requires on its state-specific form.  If that is so, the Fed-eral Form ceases to perform any meaningful function, and would be a feeble means of \xe2\x80\x9cincreas[ing] the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal office.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71973gg(b).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, Arizona appeals to the presumption against pre-emption sometimes invoked in our Supremacy Clause cases.  See, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452\n\xe2\x80\x93461 (1991).  Where it applies, \xe2\x80\x9cwe start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n\n331 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, \n230 (1947)\n.  That rule of construction rests on an assumption about congressional intent: that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress does not exercise lightly\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary power\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9clegislate in areas traditionally regulated by the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gregory, supra, at 460.  We have never mentioned such a principle in our Elections Clause cases.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Siebold, for example, simply said that Elections Clause legislation, \xe2\x80\x9cso far as it extends and conflicts with the regulations of the State, necessarily supersedes them.\xe2\x80\x9d  100 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 384.  There is good reason for treating Elections Clause legislation differently: The assumption that Congress is reluctant to pre-empt does not hold when Congress acts under that constitutional provision, which empowers Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cmake or alter\xe2\x80\x9d state election regulations.  Art. I, \xc2\xa74, cl.\xc2\xa01.  When Congress legislates with respect to the \xe2\x80\x9cTimes, Places and Manner\xe2\x80\x9d of holding congressional elections, it necessarily displaces some element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the States.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Because the power the Elections Clause confers is none other than the power to pre-empt, the reasonable assumption is that the statutory text accurately communicates the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive intent.  More-over, the federalism concerns underlying the presumption in the Supremacy Clause context are somewhat weaker here.  Unlike the States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9chistoric police powers,\xe2\x80\x9d Rice, supra, at 230, the States\xe2\x80\x99 role in regulating congressional elections\xe2\x80\x94while weighty and worthy of respect\xe2\x80\x94has always existed subject to the express qualification that it \xe2\x80\x9cterminates according to federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Legal Comm., \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 341, \n347 (2001)\n.  In sum, there is no compelling reason not to read Elections Clause legislation simply to mean what it says.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe conclude that the fairest reading of the statute is that a state-imposed requirement of evidence of citizenship not required by the Federal Form is \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the NVRA\xe2\x80\x99s mandate that States \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Form.  Siebold, supra, at 397.

Arizona is correct that the Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them.  The Constitution prescribes a straightforward rule for the composition of the federal electorate.  Article I, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01, provides that electors in each State for the House of Representatives \xe2\x80\x9cshall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \n \nSeventeenth Amendment adopts the same criterion for senatorial elections.  Cf. also Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa71, cl.\xc2\xa02 (\xe2\x80\x9cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct,\xe2\x80\x9d presidential electors).  One cannot read the Elections Clause as treating implicitly what these other constitutional provisions regulate explicitly.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to see how words could be clearer in stating what Congress can control and what it cannot control.  Surely nothing in these provisions lends itself to the view that voting qualifications in federal elections are to be set by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oregon v.

That is to say, \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x937(b)(1) acts as both a ceiling and a floor with respect to the contents of the Federal Form.  We need not consider the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that despite the statute\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the EAC \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d require on the Federal Form information \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant,\xe2\x80\x9d other provisions of the Act indicate that such action is statutorily required.  That is because we think that\xe2\x80\x94by analogy to the rule of statutory interpretation that avoids questionable constitutionality\xe2\x80\x94validly conferred discretionary executive authority is properly exercised (as the Government has proposed) to avoid serious constitutional doubt.

That alternative means of enforcing its constitutional power to determine voting qualifications remains open to Arizona here.  In 2005, the EAC divided 2-to-2 on the request by Arizona to include the evidence-of-citizenship requirement among the state-specific instructions on the Federal Form, App. 225, which meant that no action could be taken, see \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715328 (\xe2\x80\x9cAny action which the Commission is authorized to carry out under this chapter may be carried out only with the approval of at least three of its members\xe2\x80\x9d).  Arizona did not challenge that agency action (or rather inaction) by seeking APA review in federal court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (Ari-zona), but we are aware of nothing that prevents Arizona from renewing its request.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Should the EAC\xe2\x80\x99s inaction persist, Arizona would have the opportunity to establish in a reviewing court that a mere oath will not suffice to effectuate its citizenship requirement and that the EAC is therefore under a nondiscretionary duty to include Ari-zona\xe2\x80\x99s concrete evidence requirement on the Federal Form.  See \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(1).

If the Court is skeptical of the basic idea of a presumption against pre-emption as a helpful instrument of construction in express pre-emption cases, see Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 504, \n545 (1992)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), it should say so and apply that skepticism across the board.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere are numerous instances in which Congress, in the undoubted exercise of its enumerated powers, has stated its express purpose and intent to pre-empt state law.  But the Court has nonetheless recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the text of a pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \xe2\x80\x98accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Altria Group, Inc. v.

This principle is best understood, perhaps, not as a presumption but as a cautionary principle to ensure that pre-emption does not go beyond the strict requirements of the statutory command.  The principle has two dimensions: Courts must be careful not to give an unduly broad interpretation to ambiguous or imprecise language Congress uses.  And they must confine their opinions to avoid overextending a federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive reach.  Error on either front may put at risk the validity and effectiveness of laws that Con- gress did not intend to disturb and that a State has deemed important to its scheme of governance.  That con- cern is the same regardless of the power Congress invokes, whether it is, say, the commerce power, the war power, the bankruptcy power, or the power to regulate federal elections under Article I, \xc2\xa74.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhether the federal statute concerns congressional regulation of elections or any other subject proper for Congress to address, a court must not lightly infer a congressional directive to negate the States\xe2\x80\x99 otherwise proper exercise of their sovereign power.  This case illustrates the point.  The separate States have a continuing, essential interest in the integrity and accuracy of the process used to select both state and federal officials.  The States pay the costs of holding these elections, which for practical reasons often overlap so that the two sets of officials are selected at the same time, on the same ballots, by the same voters.  It seems most doubtful to me to suggest that States have some lesser concern when what is involved  is their own historic role in the conduct of elections.  As already noted, it may be that a presumption against pre-emption is not the best formulation of this principle, but in all events the State\xe2\x80\x99s undoubted interest in the regulation and conduct of elections must be taken into account and ought not to be deemed by this Court to be a subject of secondary importance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, in my view, the Court is correct to conclude that the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is unambiguous in its pre-emption of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s statute.  For this reason, I concur in the judgment and join all of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion except its discussion of the presumption against pre-emption.

To avoid substantial constitutional problems created by interpreting \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) to permit Congress to ef- fectively countermand this authority, I would construe the law as only requiring Arizona to accept and use the form as part of its voter registration process, leaving the State free to request whatever additional information it determines is necessary to ensure that voters meet the qualifications it has the constitutional authority to establish.

See The Federalist No. 52, at 323.  This balance left the States with nearly complete control over voter qualifications.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondents appear to concede that States have the sole authority to establish voter qualifications, see, e.g., Brief for Gonzalez Respondents 63, but nevertheless argue that Congress can determine whether those qualifications are satisfied.  See, e.g., id., at 61.  The practical effect of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position is to read Article I, \xc2\xa72, out of the Constitution.  As the majority correctly recognizes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to establish voting requirements is of little value without the power to enforce those requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 15.  For this reason, the Voter Qualifications Clause gives States the authority not only to set qualifications but also the power to verify whether those qualifications are satisfied.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis understanding of Article I, \xc2\xa72, is consistent with powers enjoyed by the States at the founding.  For instance, ownership of real or personal property was a common prerequisite to voting, see Keyssar 306\xe2\x80\x93313 (Tables A.1 and A.2).  To verify that this qualification was satisfied, States might look to proof of tax payments.  See C. Williamson, American Suffrage from Property to Democracy, 1760\xe2\x80\x931860, p. 32 (1960).  In other instances, States relied on personal knowledge of fellow citizens to verify voter eligibility.  Keyssar 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn some locales, particularly in the South, voting was still an oral and public act: men assembled before election judges, waited for their names to be called, and then announced which candidates they supported\xe2\x80\x9d).  States have always had the power to ensure that only those qualified under state law to cast ballots exercised the franchise.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerhaps in part because many requirements (such as property ownership or taxpayer status) were indepen- dently documented and verifiable, States in 1789 did not generally \xe2\x80\x9cregister\xe2\x80\x9d voters using highly formalized procedures.  See id., at 122.  Over time, States replaced their informal systems for determining eligibility, with more formalized pre-voting registration regimes.  See An Act in Addition to the Several Acts for Regulating Elections, 1800 Mass. Acts ch. 74, in Acts and Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 96 (1897) (Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 1801 voter registration law).  But modern voter registration serves the same basic purpose as the practices used by States in the Colonies and early Federal Republic.  The fact that States have liberalized voting qualifications and streamlined the verification process through registration does not alter the basic fact that States possess broad authority to set voter qualifications and to verify that they are met.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBoth text and history confirm that States have the ex- clusive authority to set voter qualifications and to de- termine whether those qualifications are satisfied.

Natelson, The Original Scope of the Congressional Power to Regulate Elections, 13 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. J. Constitutional L. 1, 10\xe2\x80\x9318 (2010) (citing examples).  But there are good reasons for concluding that Article I, \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9cManner\xe2\x80\x9d is considerably more limited.  Id., at 20.  The Constitution does not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cManner\xe2\x80\x9d in iso- lation; rather, \xe2\x80\x9cafter providing for qualifications, times, and places, the Constitution described the residuum as \xe2\x80\x98the Manner of holding Elections.\xe2\x80\x99  This precise phrase seems to have been newly coined to denote a subset of traditional \xe2\x80\x98manner\xe2\x80\x99 regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  (emphasis deleted; footnote omitted).  Consistent with this view, during the state ratification debates, the \xe2\x80\x9cManner of holding Elections\xe2\x80\x9d was construed to mean the circumstances under which elections were held and the mechanics of the actual election.  See 4 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 71 (J.

Unlike Article I, \xc2\xa72, the Times, Places and Manner Clause was the subject of extensive ratification controversy.  Antifederalists were deeply concerned with ceding authority over the conduct of elections to the Federal Government.

The Federalist No. 60, at 368.  Hamilton explained why Article I, \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s Voter Qualifications Clause foreclosed this argument:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is that there is no method of securing to the rich the preference apprehended but by prescribing qualifications of property either for those who may elect or be elected.

The North Carolina debates provide a particularly direct example.  There, delegate John Steele relied on the established \xe2\x80\x9cmaxim of universal jurisprudence, of reason and common sense, that an instrument or deed of writing shall be construed as to give validity to all parts of it, if it can be done without involving any absurdity\xe2\x80\x9d in support of the argument that Article I, \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s grant of voter qualifications to the States required a limited reading of Article I, \xc2\xa74.  4 Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s Debates 71.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis was no isolated view.  See 2 id., at 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (Massachusetts delegate Rufus King observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe power of control given by [Article I, \xc2\xa74,] extends to the manner of election, not the qualifications of the electors\xe2\x80\x9d); 4 id., at 61 (same, North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s William Davie); 3 id., at 202\xe2\x80\x93203 (same, Virginia delegate Edmund Randolph); Roger Sherman, A Citizen of New Haven: Observations on the New Federal Constitution, Connecticut Courant, Jan. 7, 1788, in 15 Documentary History 282 (J.

It was well understood that congressional power to regulate the \xe2\x80\x9cManner\xe2\x80\x9d of elections under Article I, \xc2\xa74, did not include the power to override state voter qualifications under Article I, \xc2\xa72.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe concern that gave rise to Article I, \xc2\xa74, also supports this limited reading.  The Times, Places and Manner Clause was designed to address the possibility that States might refuse to hold any federal elections at all, eliminating Congress, and by extension the Federal Government.

Term Limits, Inc., 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 863 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (Article I, \xc2\xa74, designed \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that the States hold congressional elections in the first place, so that Congress continues to exist\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 863, and n. 10 (same, citing ratification era sources).  Reflecting this understanding of the reasoning behind Article I, \xc2\xa74, many of the original 13 States proposed constitutional amendments that would have strictly cabined the Times, Places and Manner Clause to situations in which state failure to hold elections threatened the continued existence of Congress.  See 2 Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s Debates 177 (Massachusetts); 18 Documentary History 71\xe2\x80\x9372  (J. Kaminski &amp; G.

Al- though these amendments were never enacted, they underscore how narrowly the ratification conventions construed Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power under the Times, Places and Manner Clause.  In contrast to a state refusal to hold federal elections at all, a state decision to alter the qualifica- tions of electors for state legislature (and thereby for federal elections as well) does not threaten Congress\xe2\x80\x99 very existence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinding no support in the historical record, respondents and the United States instead chiefly assert that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents involving the Times, Places and Manner Clause give Congress authority over voter qualifica- tions.  See, e.g., Brief for Respondent Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. (ITCA) et\xc2\xa0al. 30\xe2\x80\x9331, 48\xe2\x80\x9350 (hereafter Brief for ITCA Respondents; Brief for Gonzalez Respondents 44\xe2\x80\x9350; Brief for United States 24\xe2\x80\x9327, 31\xe2\x80\x9333.  But this Court does not have the power to alter the terms of the Constitution.  Moreover, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions do not support the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.  \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondents and the United States point out that Smiley v. Holm, \n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 355 (1932)\n, mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cregistration\xe2\x80\x9d in a list of voting-related subjects it believed Congress could regulate under Article I, \xc2\xa74.  Id., at 366 (listing \xe2\x80\x9cnotices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  See Brief for ITCA Respondents 49; Brief for Gonzalez Respondents 48; Brief for United States 21.  But that statement was dicta because Smiley involved congres- sional redistricting, not voter registration.  285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 361\xe2\x80\x93362.  Cases since Smiley have similarly not addressed the issue of voter qualifications but merely repeated the word \xe2\x80\x9cregistration\xe2\x80\x9d without further analysis.  See Cook v.

Mitchell, \n\n400 U.\xc2\xa0S. 112 (1970)\n, a majority of this Court, \xe2\x80\x9ctook the position that [Article I, \xc2\xa74,] did not confer upon Congress the power to regulate voter qualifications in federal elections,\xe2\x80\x9d as the majority recognizes.  Ante, at 14, n. 8.  See Mitchell, 400 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 288 (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); id., at 210\xe2\x80\x93212 (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); id., at 143 (opinion of Douglas, J.).  And even the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision in U.\xc2\xa0S. Term Limits, from which I dissented, recognized that Madison\xe2\x80\x99s Federalist No. 52 \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly contrasted the state control over the qualifications of electors\xe2\x80\x9d with what it believed was \xe2\x80\x9cthe lack of state control over the qualifications of the elected.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 806 (emphasis added).  Most of the remaining cases cited by respondents and the Government merely confirm that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate the \xe2\x80\x9cManner of holding Elections\xe2\x80\x9d is limited to regulating events surrounding the when, where, and how of actually casting ballots.  See, e.g., United States v. Classic, \n\n313 U.\xc2\xa0S. 299 (1941)\n (upholding federal regulation of ballot fraud in primary voting); Ex parte Yarbrough, \n\n110 U.\xc2\xa0S. 651 (1884)\n (upholding federal penalties for intimidating voter in congressional election); see also Foster v. Love, \n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 67 (1997)\n (overturning Louisiana primary system whose winner was deemed elected if he received a majority of votes in light of federal law setting the date of federal general elections); Roudebush, supra (upholding Indiana ballot recount procedures in close Senate election as within state power under Article I, \xc2\xa74).  It is, thus, difficult to maintain that the Times, Places and Manner Clause gives Congress power beyond regulating the casting of ballots and related activities, even as a matter of precedent.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArizona has not challenged the constitutionality of the NVRA itself in this case.  Nor has it alleged that Congress lacks authority to direct the EAC to create the federal form.  As a result, I need not address those issues.  Ari- zona did, however, argue that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) would raise constitutional concerns.  As discussed, supra, I too am concerned that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) would render the statute unconstitutional under Article I, \xc2\xa72.  Accordingly, I would interpret \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) to avoid the constitutional problems discussed above.  See Zadvydas v. Davis, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 678, \n689 (2001)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]t is a cardinal principle\xe2\x80\x99 of statutory interpretation, however, that when an Act of Congress raises \xe2\x80\x98a serious doubt\xe2\x80\x99 as to its constitutionality, \xe2\x80\x98this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Crowell v.

Arizona sets citizenship as a qualification to vote, and it wishes to verify citizenship, as it is authorized to do under Article 1, \xc2\xa72.  It matters not whether the United States has specified one way in which it believes Arizona might be able to verify citizenship; Arizona has the independent constitutional authority to verify citizenship in the way it deems necessary.  See in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A\xe2\x80\x932, supra.  By requiring Arizona to register people who have not demonstrated to Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction that they meet its citizenship qualification for voting, the NVRA, as interpreted by the Court, would exceed Congress\xe2\x80\x99 powers under Article I, \xc2\xa74, and violate Article 1, \xc2\xa72.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFortunately, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s alternative interpretation of \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) avoids this problem.  It is plausible that Arizona \xe2\x80\x9caccept[s] and use[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the federal form under \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) so long as it receives the form and considers it as part of its voter application process.  See post, at 6\xe2\x80\x9310 (Alito, J., dissenting); 677 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 444 (Rawlinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); 624 F.\xc2\xa03d 1162, 1205\xe2\x80\x931208 (CA9 2010) (Kozinski, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting in part), reh\xe2\x80\x99g 649 F.\xc2\xa03d 953 (CA9 2011); 677 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 439 (Kozinski, C.

Given States\xe2\x80\x99 exclusive authority to set voter qualifications and to determine whether those qualifications are met, I would hold that Arizona may request whatever additional information it requires to verify voter eligibility.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority purports to avoid the difficult constitutional questions implicated by the Voter Qualifications Clause.  See ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  It nevertheless adopts respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading of \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) because it interprets Article I, \xc2\xa72, as giving Arizona the right only to \xe2\x80\x9cobtai[n] information necessary for enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of its voting qualifications.  Ante, at 15.  The majority posits that Arizona may pursue relief by making an administrative request to the EAC that, if denied, could be challenged under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

I would not require Arizona to seek approval for its registration requirements from the Federal Government, for, as I have shown, the Federal Government does not have the constitutional authority to withhold such approval.  Accordingly, it does not have the authority to command States to seek it.

Legislatures in Florida in 1868 and Colorado in 1876 chose delegates, id., at 822, and in recent memory, the Florida Legislature in 2000 convened a special session to consider how to allocate its 25 electoral votes if the winner of the popular vote was not determined in time for delegates to participate in the electoral college, see James, Election 2000: Florida Legislature Faces Own Disputes over Electors, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 11, 2000, p.

See Art. I, \xc2\xa72, cl. 1 (House); Amdt. 17 (Senate).  The States also have the default authority to regulate federal voter registration.  See Art. I, \xc2\xa74, cl. 1.  Exercising its right to set federal voter qualifications, Arizona, like every other State, permits only U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and Arizona has concluded that this requirement cannot be effectively enforced unless applicants for registration are required to provide proof of citizenship.  According to the Court, however, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) deprives Arizona of this authority.  I do not think that this is what Congress intended.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI also doubt that Congress meant for the success of an application for voter registration to depend on which of two valid but substantially different registration forms the applicant happens to fill out and submit, but that is how the Court reads the NVRA.  The Court interprets one provision, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1)(B), to mean that, if an applicant fills out the federal form, a State must register the applicant without requiring proof of citizenship.  But the Court does not question Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s authority under another provision of the NVRA, \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(2), to create its own application form that demands proof of citizen- ship; nor does the Court dispute Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s right to refuse to register an applicant who submits that form without the requisite proof.  I find it very hard to believe that this is what Congress had in mind.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese results are not required by the NVRA.  Proper respect for the constitutional authority of the States demands a clear indication of a congressional intent to pre-empt state laws enforcing voter qualifications.  And while the relevant provisions of the Act are hardly models of clarity, their best reading is that the States need not treat the federal form as a complete voter registration application.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Elections Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, \xc2\xa74, cl.\xc2\xa01, I would begin by applying a presumption against pre-emption of the Arizona law requiring voter registration applicants to submit proof of citizenship.  Under the Elections Clause, the States have the authority to specify the times, places, and manner of federal elections except to the extent that Congress chooses to provide otherwise.  And in recognition of this allocation of authority, it is appropriate to presume that the States retain this authority unless Congress has clearly manifested a contrary intent.  The Court states that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e have never mentioned [the presumption against pre-emption] in our Elections Clause cases,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 10, but in United States v. Gradwell, \n\n243 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476 (1917)\n, we read a federal statute narrowly out of deference to the States\xe2\x80\x99 traditional authority in this area.  In doing so, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe policy of Congress for [a] great .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. part of our constitutional life has been .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to leave the conduct of the election of its members to state laws, administered by state officers, and that whenever it has assumed to regulate such elections it has done so by positive and clear statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 485 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The presumption against pre-emption applies with full force when Congress legislates in a \xe2\x80\x9cfield which the States have traditionally occupied,\xe2\x80\x9d Rice v. Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Elevator Corp., \n\n331 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, \n230 (1947)\n, and the NVRA was the first significant federal regulation of voter registration enacted under the Elections Clause since Reconstruction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court has it exactly backwards when it declines to apply the presumption against pre-emption because \xe2\x80\x9cthe federalism concerns underlying the presumption in the Su- premacy Clause context are somewhat weaker\xe2\x80\x9d in an Elections Clause case like this one.

First, as Madison explained in defense of the Elections Clause at the Virginia Convention, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t was found necessary to leave the regulation of [federal elections], in the first place, to the state governments, as being best acquainted with the situation of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 312 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).  Because the States are closer to the people, the Framers thought that state regulation of federal elections would \xe2\x80\x9cin ordinary cases .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be both more convenient and more satisfactory.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 59, p. 360 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, as we have previously observed, the integrity of federal elections is a subject over which the States and the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9care mutually concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ex\xc2\xa0parte Siebold, \n\n100 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371, \n391 (1880)\n.  By giving States a role in the administration of federal elections, the Elections Clause reflects the States\xe2\x80\x99 interest in the selection of the individuals on whom they must rely to represent their interests in the National Legislature.  See U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 779\n\xe2\x80\x93859 (1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the Elections Clause\xe2\x80\x99s default rule helps to protect the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to regulate state and local elections.  As a practical matter, it would be very burdensome for a State to maintain separate federal and state registration processes with separate federal and state voter rolls.  For that reason, any federal regulation in this area is likely to displace not only state control of federal elections but also state control of state and local elections.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNeedless to say, when Congress believes that some overriding national interest justifies federal regulation, it has the power to \xe2\x80\x9cmake or alter\xe2\x80\x9d state laws specifying the \xe2\x80\x9cTimes, Places and Manner\xe2\x80\x9d of federal elections.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa74, cl.\xc2\xa01.  But we should expect Congress to speak clearly when it decides to displace a default rule enshrined in the text of the Constitution that serves such important purposes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court answers that when Congress exercises its power under the Elections Clause \xe2\x80\x9cit necessarily displaces some element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11.  But the same is true whenever Congress legislates in an area of concurrent state and fed- eral power.  A federal law regulating the operation of grain warehouses, for example, necessarily alters the \xe2\x80\x9cpre-existing legal regime erected by the States,\xe2\x80\x9d see Rice, supra, at 229\xe2\x80\x93230\xe2\x80\x94even if only by regulating an activity the States had chosen not to constrain.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In light of Ari- zona\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionally codified interest in the integrity of its federal elections, \xe2\x80\x9cit is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended to pre-empt Ari- zona\xe2\x80\x99s law.

As the Court acknowledges, the Constitution reserves for the States the power to decide who is qualified to vote in federal elections.  Ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315; see Oregon v. Mitchell, \n\n400 U.\xc2\xa0S. 112\n\xe2\x80\x93211 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The Court also recognizes that, al- though Congress generally has the authority to regulate the \xe2\x80\x9cTimes, Places and Manner of holding\xe2\x80\x9d such elections, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa74, cl.\xc2\xa01, a federal law that frustrates a State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enforce its voter qualifications would be constitutionally suspect.  Ante, at 15; see ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x938 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  The Court nevertheless reads the NVRA to restrict Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enforce its law providing that only United States citizens may vote.  See Ariz. Const., Art. VII, \xc2\xa72.  We are normally more reluctant to inter- pret federal statutes as upsetting \xe2\x80\x9cthe usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gregory v. Ashcroft, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452, \n460 (1991)\n; see Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 527, 540 (1947) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the Federal Government .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. radically readjusts the balance of state and national authority, those charged with the duty of legislating are reasonably explicit\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn refusing to give any weight to Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s interest in enforcing its voter qualifications, the Court suggests that the State could return to the Election Assistance Com- mission and renew its request for a change to the federal form.  Ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  But that prospect does little to assuage constitutional concerns.  The EAC currently has no members, and there is no reason to believe that it will be restored to life in the near future.  If that situation persists, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s ability to obtain a judicial resolution of its constitutional claim is problematic.  The most that the Court is prepared to say is that the State \xe2\x80\x9cmight\xe2\x80\x9d succeed by seeking a writ of mandamus, and failing that, \xe2\x80\x9cmight\xe2\x80\x9d be able to mount a constitutional challenge.  Ante, at 17, n.\xc2\xa010.  The Court sends the State to traverse a veritable procedural obstacle course in the hope of obtaining a judicial decision on the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the NVRA.  A sensible interpretation of the Act would obviate these difficulties.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe NVRA does not come close to manifesting the clear intent to pre-empt that we should expect to find when Congress has exercised its Elections Clause power in a way that is constitutionally questionable.  Indeed, even if neither the presumption against pre-emption nor the canon of constitutional avoidance applied, the better reading of the Act would be that Arizona is free to require those who use the federal form to supplement their applications with proof of citizenship.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI agree with the Court that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use,\xe2\x80\x9d when read in isolation, is ambiguous, ante, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, but I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s use of that phrase means that a State must treat the federal form as a complete application and must either grant or deny registration without requiring that the ap- plicant supply additional information.  Instead, I would hold that a State \xe2\x80\x9caccept[s] and use[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the federal form so long as it uses the form as a meaningful part of the registration process.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court begins its analysis of \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s context by examining unrelated uses of the word \xe2\x80\x9caccept\xe2\x80\x9d elsewhere in the United\xc2\xa0States Code.  Ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  But a better place to start is to ask what it normally means to \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d an application form.  When the phrase is used in that context, it is clear that an organization can \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d a form that it does not treat as a complete application.  For example, many colleges and universities accept and use the Common Application for Undergraduate College Admission but also require that applicants submit various additional forms or documents.  See Common Application, 2012\xe2\x80\x932013 College Deadlines, Fees, and Requirements, https://www.commonapp.org/CommonApp/ MemberRequirements.aspx (all Internet materials as visited June 10, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Similarly, the Social Security Administration undoubtedly \xe2\x80\x9caccepts and uses\xe2\x80\x9d its Social Security card application form even though someone applying for a card must also prove that he or she is a citizen or has a qualifying immigration status.  See Application for a Social Secu- rity Card, Form SS\xe2\x80\x935 (2011), http://www.socialsecurity.gov/ online/ss-5.pdf.  As such examples illustrate, when an organization says that it \xe2\x80\x9caccepts and uses\xe2\x80\x9d an application form, it does not necessarily mean that the form constitutes a complete application.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is not to say that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d is meaningless when issued as a \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment diktat\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1).  Ante, at 7.  Arizona could not be said to \xe2\x80\x9caccept and use\xe2\x80\x9d the federal form if it required applicants who submit that form to provide all the same information a second time on a separate state form.  But Arizona does nothing of the kind.  To the contrary, the entire basis for respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit is that Proposition 200 mandates that applicants provide information that does not appear on a completed federal form.  Although \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) forbids States from requiring applicants who use the federal form to submit a duplicative state form, nothing in that pro- vision\xe2\x80\x99s text prevents Arizona from insisting that federal form applicants supplement their applications with additional information.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat understanding of \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1) is confirmed by \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(2), which allows States to design and use their own voter registration forms \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n addition to accepting and using\xe2\x80\x9d the federal form.  The Act clearly permits States to require proof of citizenship on their own forms, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x934(a)(2) and 1973gg\xe2\x80\x937(b)\xe2\x80\x94a step that Ari- zona has taken and that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not disturb.  Thus, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, whether someone can register to vote in Arizona without providing proof of citizenship will depend on the happenstance of which of two alternative forms the applicant completes.  That could not possibly be what Congress intended; it is as if the Internal Revenue Service issued two sets of personal income tax forms with different tax rates.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe could avoid this nonsensical result by holding that the Act lets the States decide for themselves what in- formation \xe2\x80\x9cis necessary .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to assess the eligibility of the applicant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94both by designing their own forms and by requiring that federal form applicants provide supplemental information when appropriate.  \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x937(b)(1).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s provision for state forms shows that the purpose of the federal form is not to supplant the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority in this area but to facilitate interstate voter registration drives.  Thanks to the federal form, volunteers distributing voter registration materials at a shopping mall in Yuma can give a copy of the same form to every person they meet without attempting to distinguish between residents of Arizona and California.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x939, p. 10 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cUniform mail forms will permit voter registration drives through a regional or national mailing, or for more than one State at a central location, such as a city where persons from a number of neighboring States work, shop or attend events\xe2\x80\x9d).  The federal form was meant to facilitate voter registration drives, not to take away the States\xe2\x80\x99 traditional authority to decide what information registrants must supply.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court purports to find support for its contrary approach in \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1)(B), which says that a State must \xe2\x80\x9censure that any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the valid voter registration form of the applicant is postmarked\xe2\x80\x9d within a specified period.  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  The Court understands \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1)(B) to mean that a State must register an eligible applicant if he or she submits a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98valid voter registration form.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9.  But when read in context, that provision simply identifies the time within which a State must process registration applications; it says nothing about whether a State may require the submission of supplemental in- formation.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s more expansive interpretation of \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1)(B) sneaks in a qualification that is nowhere to be found in the text.  The Court takes pains to say that a State need not register an applicant who properly completes and submits a federal form but is known by the State to be ineligible.  See ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But the Court takes the position that a State may not demand that an applicant supply any additional information to confirm voting eligibility.  Nothing in \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1)(B)  supports this distinction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat is a State to do if it has reason to doubt an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility but cannot be sure that the applicant is ineligible?  Must the State either grant or deny registration without communicating with the applicant?  Or does the Court believe that a State may ask for additional information in individual cases but may not impose a categorical requirement for all applicants?  If that is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s position, on which provision of the NVRA does it rely?  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71973gg\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1)(B) is atex- tual and makes little sense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tProperly interpreted, the NVRA permits Arizona to require applicants for federal voter registration to provide proof of eligibility.
