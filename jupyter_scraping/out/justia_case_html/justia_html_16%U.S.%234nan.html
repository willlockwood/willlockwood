Duryee,</a></span></em> 7 Cranch 481.  The Court cannot distinguish the two cases.  The doctrine there held was that the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect in every other court of the United States which it had in the state where it was pronounced, and that whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state, and none others, could be pleaded in any other court in the United States.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
