CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The bond in this case is insufficient in form either for the purposes of a supersedeas or an appeal inasmuch as it contains no security for costs.  This, however, does not necessarily avoid the appeal, but we may impose such terms on the appellants for the omission as, under the circumstances, shall seem to be proper.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/14/304/case.html">Martin v. Hunter\'s Lessee,</a></span></em> 1 Wheat. 304; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/447/case.html">Davidson v. Lanier,</a></span></em> 4 Wall. 447.  The appeal will therefore be dismissed unless the appellants, on or before the first Monday in January next, give bond with good and sufficient security in due form of law to prosecute their appeal to effect and to answer all damages and costs if they fail to make their plea good, the bond to be in the penal sum of $1,000 and the security taken and approved by the Justice of this Court assigned to the fifth circuit, and it is</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
