After the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel recommended against investing in a fund managed by FA Technology Ventures, the general counsel received anonymous e-mails demanding that he recommend the investment and threatening, if he did not, to disclose information about the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s alleged affair to his wife, government officials, and the media.  Some of the e-mails were traced to the home computer of petitioner Sekhar, a managing partner of FA Technology Ventures.  Petitioner was convicted of attempted extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(a), which defines \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71951(b)(2).  The jury specified that the property petitioner attempted to extort was the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to approve the investment.  The Second Circuit affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Attempting to compel a person to recommend that his employer approve an investment does not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cthe obtaining of property from another\xe2\x80\x9d under the Hobbs Act.

As far as is known, no case predating the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x94English, federal, or state\xe2\x80\x94ever identified conduct such as that charged here as extortionate.  Extortion required the obtaining of items of value, typically cash, from the victim.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s text confirms that obtaining property requires \xe2\x80\x9cnot only the deprivation but also the acquisition of property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393\n.  The property extorted must therefore be transferable\xe2\x80\x94that is, capable of passing from one person to another, a defining feature lacking in the alleged property here.  The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.  Congress borrowed nearly verbatim the definition of extortion from a 1909 New York statute but did not copy the coercion provision of that statute.  And in 1946, the time of the borrowing, New York courts had consistently held that the sort of interference with rights that occurred here was coercion.  Finally, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s own precedent demands reversal of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.  See id., at 404\xe2\x80\x93405.

Coke, The Third Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 148\xe2\x80\x93150 (1648) (reprint 2008).  The crime originally applied only to extortionate action by public officials, but was later extended by statute to private extortion.  See 4 C. Torcia, Wharton\xe2\x80\x99s Criminal Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7695, 699 (14th ed. 1981).  As far as is known, no case predating the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x94English, federal, or state\xe2\x80\x94ever identified conduct such as that charged here as extortionate.  Extortion required the obtaining of items of value, typically cash, from the victim.  See, e.g., People v. Whaley, 6 Cow. 661 (N.\xc2\xa0Y. Sup. Ct. 1827) (justice of the peace properly indicted for extorting money); Commonwealth v. Bagley, 24 Mass. 279 (1828) (officer properly convicted for demanding a fee for letting a man out of prison); Commonwealth v.

Rep. 949 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1707) (upholding indictment for extorting \xe2\x80\x9cmoney and a note\xe2\x80\x9d).  It did not cover mere coercion to act, or to refrain from acting.  See, e.g., King v. Burdett, 1 Ld. Raym. 149, 91 Eng. Rep. 996 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1696) (dictum) (extortion consisted of the \xe2\x80\x9ctaking of money for the use of the stalls,\xe2\x80\x9d not the deprivation of \xe2\x80\x9cfree liberty to sell [one\xe2\x80\x99s] wares in the market according to law\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe text of the statute at issue confirms that the alleged property here cannot be extorted.  Enacted in 1946, the Hobbs Act defines its crime of \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe ob- taining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(b)(2) (emphasis added).  Obtaining property requires \xe2\x80\x9cnot only the deprivation but also the acquisition of property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393, \n404 (2003)\n (citing United States v. Enmons, \n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 396, \n400 (1973)\n).  That is, it requires that the victim \xe2\x80\x9cpart with\xe2\x80\x9d his property, R. Perkins &amp; R. Boyce, Criminal Law 451 (3d ed. 1982), and that the extortionist \xe2\x80\x9cgain possession\xe2\x80\x9d of it, Scheidler, supra, at 403, n.\xc2\xa08; see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1682 (2d ed. 1949) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cobtain\xe2\x80\x9d); Murray, Note, Protesters, Extortion, and Coercion: Preventing RICO from Chilling \n \nFirst Amendment Freedoms, 75 Notre Dame L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 691, 706 (1999) (Murray).  The property extorted must therefore be transferable\xe2\x80\x94that is, capable of passing from one person to another.  The alleged property here lacks that defining feature.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.  The Act was modeled after \xc2\xa7850 of the New York Penal Law (1909), which was derived from the famous Field Code, a 19th-century model penal code, see 4 Commissioners of the Code, Penal Code of the State of New York \xc2\xa7613, p.\xc2\xa0220 (1865) (reprint 1998).  Congress borrowed, nearly verbatim, the New York statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of extortion.  See Scheidler, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 403.  The New York statute contained, in addition to the felony crime of extortion, a new (that is to say, nonexistent at common law) misdemeanor crime of coercion.  Whereas the former required, as we have said, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the criminal acquisition of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. property,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., the latter required merely the use of threats \xe2\x80\x9cto compel another person to do or to abstain from doing an act which such other such person has a legal right to do or to abstain from doing.\xe2\x80\x9d  N.\xc2\xa0Y. Penal Law \xc2\xa7530 (1909), earlier codified in N.\xc2\xa0Y. Penal Code \xc2\xa7653 (1881).  Congress did not copy the coercion provision.  The omission must have been deliberate, since it was perfectly clear that extortion did not include coercion.  At the time of the borrowing (1946), New York courts had consistently held that the sort of interference with rights that occurred here was coercion.  See, e.g., People v. Ginsberg, 262 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 556, 188 N.\xc2\xa0E. 62 (1933) (per curiam) (compelling store owner to become a member of a trade association and to remove advertisements); People v.

In Scheidler, we held that protesters did not commit extortion under the Hobbs Act, even though they \xe2\x80\x9cinterfered with, disrupted, and in some instances completely deprived\xe2\x80\x9d abortion clinics of their ability to run their business.  537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404\xe2\x80\x93405.  We reasoned that the protesters may have deprived the clinics of an \xe2\x80\x9calleged property right,\xe2\x80\x9d but they did not pursue or receive \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98something of value from\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the clinics that they could then \xe2\x80\x9cexercise, transfer, or sell\xe2\x80\x9d themselves.

The deprivation alleged here is far more abstract.  Scheidler rested its decision, as we do, on the term \xe2\x80\x9cobtaining.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 402, n.\xc2\xa06.

According to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict form, the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d that petitioner attempted to extort was \xe2\x80\x9cthe General Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to approve the Commitment.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 142.  But the Government expends minuscule effort in defending that theory of conviction.  And for good reason\xe2\x80\x94to wit, our decision in Cleveland v. United States, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 12 (2000)\n, which reversed a business owner\xe2\x80\x99s mail-fraud conviction for \xe2\x80\x9cobtaining money or property\xe2\x80\x9d through misrepresentations made in an application for a video-poker license issued by the State.  We held that a \xe2\x80\x9clicense\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d while in the State\xe2\x80\x99s hands and so cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cobtained\xe2\x80\x9d from the State.  Id., at 20\xe2\x80\x9322.  Even less so can an employee\xe2\x80\x99s yet-to-be-issued recommendation be called obtainable property, and less so still a yet-to-be-issued recommendation that would merely ap- prove (but not effect) a particular investment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHence the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on an alternative, more sophisticated (and sophistic) description of the property.  Instead of defending the jury\xe2\x80\x99s description, the Gov- ernment hinges its case on the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cintangible property right to give his disinterested legal opinion to his client free of improper outside interference.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 39.  But what, exactly, would the petitioner have obtained for himself?  A right to give his own disinterested legal opinion to his own client free of improper interference?  Or perhaps, a right to give the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s disinterested legal opinion to the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s client?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEither formulation sounds absurd, because it is.  Clearly, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s goal was not to acquire the general coun- sel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cintangible property right to give disinterested legal advice.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was to force the general counsel to offer advice that accorded with petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s wishes.  But again, that is coercion, not extortion.  See Murray 721\xe2\x80\x93722.  No fluent speaker of English would say that \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner obtained and exercised the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s right to make a recommendation,\xe2\x80\x9d any more than he would say that a person \xe2\x80\x9cobtained and exercised another\xe2\x80\x99s right to free speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  He would say that \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner forced the general counsel to make a particular recommendation,\xe2\x80\x9d just as he would say that a person \xe2\x80\x9cforced another to make a statement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Adopting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory here would not only make nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstanding distinction between extortion and coercion and ignore Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice to penalize one but not the other.

And the lower courts have long given the term a similarly expansive construction.  See, e.g., United States v. Tropiano, 418 F. 2d 1069, 1075 (CA2 1969) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe concept of prop-erty under the Hobbs Act .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. includes, in a broad sense, any valuable right considered as a source or element of wealth\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDespite the breadth of some of these formulations, however, the term \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d plainly does not reach everything that a person may hold dear; nor does it extend to everything that might in some indirect way portend the possibility of future economic gain.  I do not suggest that the current lower court case law is necessarily correct, but it seems clear that the case now before us is an outlier and that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict stretches the concept of property beyond the breaking point.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is not customary to refer to an internal recommendation to make a government decision as a form of property.  It would seem strange to say that the government or its employees have a property interest in their internal recommendations regarding such things as the issuance of a building permit, the content of an environmental impact statement, the approval of a new drug, or the indictment of an individual or a corporation.  And it would be even stranger to say that a private party who might be affected by the government\xe2\x80\x99s decision can obtain a property interest in a recommendation to make the decision.  See, e.g., Doyle v. University of Alabama, 680 F.\xc2\xa02d 1323, 1326 (CA11 1982) (\xe2\x80\x9cDoyle had no protected property interest in the mere recommendation for a raise; thus she was not entitled to due process safeguards when the recommended raise was disapproved by the University\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur decision in Cleveland v.

We held that a video poker license is not property in the hands of the State.  Cleveland, supra, at 15.  I do not suggest that the concepts of property under the mail fraud statute and the Hobbs Act are necessarily the same.  But surely a video poker license has a stronger claim to be classified as property than a mere internal recommendation that a state government take an initial step that might lead eventually to an investment that would be beneficial to private parties.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government has not cited any Hobbs Act case holding that an internal recommendation regarding a gov-ernment decision constitutes property.

And the Government also presses that theory in this Court.  Brief for United States 15, 34\xe2\x80\x9345.  According to the Government, the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s property interest in his recommendation encompasses the right to make the recommendation.  Id., at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  But this argument assumes that the recommendation itself is property.  See id., at 35 (the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98recommendation\xe2\x80\x99 and his \xe2\x80\x98right to make the recommendation\xe2\x80\x99 are merely different expressions of the same property\xe2\x80\x9d).  If an internal recommendation regarding a government decision does not constitute property, then surely a government employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to make such a recommendation is not property either (nor could it be deemed a property right).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government argues that the recommendation was the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s personal property because it was inextricably related to his right to pursue his profession as an attorney.  See id., at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  But that argument is clearly wrong: If the general counsel had left the State\xe2\x80\x99s employ before submitting the recommendation, he could not have taken the recommendation with him, and he certainly could not have given it or sold it to someone else.  Therefore, it is obvious that the recommendation (and the right to make it) were inextricably related to the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s position with the government, and not to his broader personal right to pursue the practice of law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s job surely had economic value to him, as did his labor as a lawyer, his law license, and his reputation as an attorney.  But the indictment did not allege, and the jury did not find, that petitioner attempted to obtain those things.  Nor would such a theory make sense in the context of this case.  Petitioner did not, for example, seek the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s legal advice or demand that the general counsel represent him in a legal proceeding.  Cf. United States v. Thompson, 647 F.\xc2\xa03d 180, 186\xe2\x80\x93187 (CA5 2011) (a person\xe2\x80\x99s labor is property capable of being extorted).  Nor did petitioner attempt to enhance his own ability to compete with the general counsel for legal work by threatening to do something that would, say, tarnish the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s reputation or cause his law license to be revoked.  Cf. Tropiano, 418 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1071\xe2\x80\x931072, 1075\xe2\x80\x931077 (threats to competitor in order to obtain customers constitute extortion); United States v.

But even if the Hobbs Act were ambiguous on this point, the rule of lenity would counsel in favor of an interpretation of the statute that does not reach so broadly, see Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393, \n409 (2003)\n.  This is not to say that the Government could not have prosecuted petitioner for ex-tortion on these same facts under some other theory. The question before us is whether the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation\xe2\x80\x94or the right to make it\xe2\x80\x94constitutes property under the Hobbs Act.  In my view, they do not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0To recognize that an internal recommendation regarding a government decision is not property does not foreclose the possibility that threatening a government employee, as the government\xe2\x80\x99s agent, in order to secure government property could qualify as Hobbs Act extortion.  Here, after all, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate goal was to secure an investment of money from the government.  But the jury found only that petitioner had attempted to obtain the general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, so I have no occasion to consider whether a Hobbs Act conviction could have been sustained on a different legal theory.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
