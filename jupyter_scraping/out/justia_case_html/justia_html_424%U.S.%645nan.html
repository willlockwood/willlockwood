Philadelphia Civil Service Comm\'n</b></p><p><b>No. 75-783</b></p><p><b>Decided March 22, 1976</b></p><p><b>424 U.S. 645</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em>APPEAL TO THE COMMONWEALTH COURT\n</em></p>\n<p><em>OF PENNSYLVANIA, EASTERN DISTRICT\n</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Philadelphia municipal regulation requiring city employees to be residents of the city held to be constitutional as a <em>bona fide</em> continuing residence requirement and not to violate the right of interstate travel of appellant, whose employment as a city fireman was terminated under the regulation because he moved his residence from Philadelphia to New Jersey.</p>\n<p>19 Pa.Commw. 383, 339 A.2d 634, affirmed.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>After 16 years of service, appellant\'s employment in the Philadelphia Fire Department was terminated because he moved his permanent residence from Philadelphia to New Jersey in contravention of a municipal regulation requiring employees of the city of Philadelphia to be residents of the city.  He challenges the constitutionality of the regulation and the authorizing ordinances [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] as violative of his federally protected right of interstate travel.  The regulation was sustained by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and review was denied by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  His timely appeal is here pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257(2).</p>\n<p>The Michigan Supreme Court held that Detroit\'s similar </p><p><a class="page-number" name="646">Page 424 U. S. 646</a></p><p> requirement for police officers was not irrational, and did not violate the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  We dismissed the appeal from that  judgment because no substantial federal question was presented. <em>Detroit Police Officers Assn. v. City of Detroit,</em> 405 U.S. 950 (1972).  We have therefore held that this kind of ordinance is not irrational.  <em>Hicks v. Miranda,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/332/case.html">422 U. S. 332</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/332/case.html#343">422 U. S. 343</a></span>-345 (1975); <em>see Wardwell v. Board of Education of Cincinnati,</em> 529 F.2d 625, 628 (CA6 1976).</p>\n<p>We have not, however, specifically addressed the contention made by appellant in this case that his constitutionally recognized right to travel interstate as defined in <em>Shapiro v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/case.html">394 U. S. 618</a></span> (1969); <em>Dunn v. Blumstein,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/case.html">405 U. S. 330</a></span> (1972); and <em>Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/250/case.html">415 U. S. 250</a></span> (1974), is impaired.  Each of those cases involved a statutory requirement of residence in the State for at least one year before becoming eligible either to vote, as in <em>Dunn,</em> or to receive welfare benefits, as in <em>Shapiro</em> and <em>Memorial Hospital.</em> [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Neither in those cases nor in any others have we questioned the validity of a condition placed upon municipal employment that a person be a resident at the time of his application. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In this case, appellant claims a constitutional right to be employed by the city of Philadelphia </p><p><a class="page-number" name="647">Page 424 U. S. 647</a></p><p> <em>while</em> he is living elsewhere. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  There is no support in our cases for such a claim.</p>\n<p>We have previously differentiated between a requirement of continuing residency and a requirement of prior residency of a given duration.  Thus, in <em>Shapiro, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/case.html#636">394 U. S. 636</a></span>, we stated:  "The residence requirement and the one-year waiting period requirement are distinct and independent prerequisites."  And in <em>Memorial Hospital, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/250/case.html#255">415 U. S. 255</a></span>, quoting <em>Dunn, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/case.html#342">405 U. S. 342</a></span> n. 13, the Court explained that <em>Shapiro</em> and <em>Dunn</em> did not question "<em>the validity of appropriately defined and uniformly applied <em>bona fide</em> residence requirements.\'"\n</em></p>\n<p>This case involves that kind of <em>bona fide</em> continuing residence requirement.  The judgment of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN would note probable jurisdiction and set the case for argument.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 7-401(u) of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter of 1951; \xc2\xa7 20-101 of the Philadelphia Code (as amended); and \xc2\xa7 30.01 of the Philadelphia Civil Service Regulations.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>19 Pa.Commw. 383, 339 A.2d 634 (1975).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In an unreported order entered on September 2, 1975, that court denied a petition for review.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Detroit Police Officers Assn. v.
