The church\xe2\x80\x99s picketing has also condemned the Catholic Church for scandals involving its clergy.  Fred Phelps, who founded the church, and six Westboro Baptist parishioners (all relatives of Phelps) traveled to Maryland to picket the funeral of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, who was killed in Iraq in the line of duty.  The picketing took place on public land approximately 1,000 feet from the church where the funeral was held, in accordance with guidance from local law enforcement officers.  The picketers peacefully displayed their signs\xe2\x80\x94stating, <em>e.g.,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cThank God for Dead Soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFags Doom Nations,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica is Doomed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPriests Rape Boys,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Going to Hell\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for about 30 minutes before the funeral began.  Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s father (Snyder), petitioner here, saw the tops of the picketers\xe2\x80\x99 signs when driving to the funeral, but did not learn what was written on the signs until watching a news broadcast later that night.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Snyder filed a diversity action against Phelps, his daughters\xe2\x80\x94who participated in the picketing\xe2\x80\x94and the church (collectively Westboro) alleging, as relevant here, state tort claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil conspiracy.  A jury held Westboro liable for millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages.  Westboro challenged the verdict as grossly excessive and sought judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the First Amendment fully protected its speech.  The District Court reduced the punitive damages award, but left the verdict otherwise intact.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, concluding that Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s statements were entitled to First Amendment protection because those statements were on matters of public concern, were not provably false, and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The First Amendment shields Westboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.

The placards highlighted issues of public import\xe2\x80\x94the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens, the fate of the Nation, homosexuality in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic clergy\xe2\x80\x94and Westboro conveyed its views on those issues in a manner designed to reach as broad a public audience as possible.  Even if a few of the signs were viewed as containing messages related to a particular individual, that would not change the fact that the dominant theme of Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s demonstration spoke to broader public issues.  P.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9ccontext\xe2\x80\x9d of the speech\xe2\x80\x94its connection with Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s funeral\xe2\x80\x94cannot by itself transform the nature of Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s speech.  The signs reflected Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s condemnation of much in modern society, and it cannot be argued that Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s use of speech on public issues was in any way contrived to insulate a personal attack on Snyder from liability.  Westboro had been actively engaged in speaking on the subjects addressed in its picketing long before it became aware of Matthew Snyder, and there can be no serious claim that the picketing did not represent Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s honestly held beliefs on public issues.  Westboro may have chosen the picket location to increase publicity for its views, and its speech may have been particularly hurtful to Snyder.  That does not mean that its speech should be afforded less than full First Amendment protection under the circumstances of this case.

The facts here are quite different, however, both with respect to the activity being regulated and the means of restricting those activities, from the few limited situations where the Court has concluded that the location of targeted picketing can be properly regulated under provisions deemed content neutral.  <em>Frisby</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 477; <em>Madsen</em> v. <em>Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health Center, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/753/index.html">512 U.

Maryland now has a law restricting funeral picketing but that law was not in effect at the time of these events, so this Court has no occasion to consider whether that law is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable time, place, or manner restrictio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d under the standards announced by this Court.  <em>Clark</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 293.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cspecial protection\xe2\x80\x9d afforded to what Westboro said, in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it, cannot be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was \xe2\x80\x9coutrageous\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of applying the state law tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  That would pose too great a danger that the jury would punish Westboro for its views on matters of public concern.  For all these reasons, the jury verdict imposing tort liability on Westboro for intentional infliction of emotional distress must be set aside.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Snyder also may not recover for the tort of intrusion upon seclusion.  He argues that he was a member of a captive audience at his son\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, but the captive audience doctrine\xe2\x80\x94which has been applied sparingly, see <em>Rowan</em> v. <em>Post Office Dept.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/728/index.html">397 U.

Westboro stayed well away from the memorial service, Snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers\xe2\x80\x99 signs, and there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the funeral service itself.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c) Because the First Amendment bars Snyder from recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclusion\xe2\x80\x94the allegedly unlawful activity Westboro conspired to accomplish\xe2\x80\x94Snyder also cannot recover for civil conspiracy based on those torts.  P.\xc2\xa014.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d) Westboro addressed matters of public import on public property, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of local officials.  It did not disrupt Mathew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, and its choice to picket at that time and place did not alter the nature of its speech.  Because this Nation has chosen to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that public debate is not stifled, Westboro must be shielded from tort liability for its picketing in this case.

The church frequently communicates its views by picketing, often at military funerals.  In the more than 20 years that the members of Westboro Baptist have publicized their message, they have picketed nearly 600 funerals.

Lance Corporal Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s father selected the Catholic church in the Snyders\xe2\x80\x99 hometown of Westminster, Maryland, as the site for his son\xe2\x80\x99s funeral.  Local newspapers provided notice of the time and location of the service.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Phelps became aware of Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s funeral and decided to travel to Maryland with six other Westboro Baptist parishioners (two of his daughters and four of \nhis grandchildren) to picket.  On the day of the memorial service, the Westboro congregation members picketed on public land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland State House, the United States Naval Academy, and Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s funeral.  The Westboro picketers carried signs that were largely the same at all three locations.  They stated, for instance: \xe2\x80\x9cGod Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica is Doomed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Pray for the USA,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThank God for IEDs,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThank God for Dead Soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPope in Hell,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPriests Rape Boys,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGod Hates Fags,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Going to Hell,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGod Hates You.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The church had notified the authorities in advance of its intent to picket at the time of the funeral, and the picketers complied with police instructions in staging their demonstration.

Snyder alleged five state tort law claims: defamation, publicity given to private life, intentional infliction of emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil conspiracy.  Westboro moved for summary judgment contending, in part, that the church\xe2\x80\x99s speech was insulated from liability by the First Amendment.

A trial was held on the remaining claims.  At trial, Snyder described the severity of his emotional injuries.  He testified that he is unable to separate the thought of his dead son from his thoughts of Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s picketing, and that he often becomes tearful, angry, and physically ill when he thinks about it.  <em>Id.,</em> at 588\xe2\x80\x93589.

Westboro filed several post-trial motions, including a motion contending that the jury verdict was grossly excessive and a motion seeking judgment as a matter of law on all claims on First Amendment grounds.  The District Court remitted the punitive damages award to $2.1 million, but left the jury verdict otherwise intact.  <em>Id.,</em> at 597.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Court of Appeals, Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s primary argument was that the church was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the First Amendment fully protected Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s speech.  The Court of Appeals agreed.  580 F.\xc2\xa03d 206, 221 (CA4 2009).  The court reviewed the picket signs and concluded that Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s statements were entitled to First Amendment protection because those statements were on matters of public concern, were not provably false, and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.  <em>Id.</em>, at 222\xe2\x80\x93224.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  559 U.

While these messages may fall short of \nrefined social or political commentary, the issues they highlight\xe2\x80\x94the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens, the fate of our Nation, homosexuality in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic clergy\xe2\x80\x94are matters of public import.  The signs certainly convey Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s position on those issues, in a manner designed, unlike the private speech in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet</em>, to reach as broad a public audience as possible.  And even if a few of the signs\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Going to Hell\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGod Hates You\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94were viewed as containing messages related to Matthew Snyder or the Snyders specifically, that would not change the fact that the overall thrust and dominant theme of Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s demonstration spoke to broader public issues.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from the content of Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s signs, Snyder contends that the \xe2\x80\x9ccontext\xe2\x80\x9d of the speech\xe2\x80\x94its connection with his son\xe2\x80\x99s funeral\xe2\x80\x94makes the speech a matter of private rather than public concern.  The fact that Westboro spoke in connection with a funeral, however, cannot by itself transform the nature of Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s speech.  Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s signs, displayed on public land next to a public street, reflect the fact that the church finds much to condemn in modern society.  Its speech is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Connick</em>, 461 U. S., at 146, and the funeral setting does not alter that conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Snyder argues that the church members in fact mounted a personal attack on Snyder and his family, and then attempted to \xe2\x80\x9cimmunize their conduct by claiming that they were actually protesting the United States\xe2\x80\x99 tolerance of homosexuality or the supposed evils of the Catholic Church.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 10.  We are not concerned in this case that Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s speech on public matters was in any way contrived to insulate speech on a private matter from liability.  Westboro had been actively engaged in speaking on the subjects addressed in its picketing long before it became aware of Matthew Snyder, and there can be no serious claim that Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s picketing \ndid not represent its \xe2\x80\x9chonestly believed\xe2\x80\x9d views on public issues.  <em>Garrison</em>, 379 U. S., at 73.  There was no pre-existing relationship or conflict between Westboro and Snyder that might suggest Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s speech on public matters was intended to mask an attack on Snyder over a private matter.  Contrast <em>Connick</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 153 (finding public employee speech a matter of private concern when it was \xe2\x80\x9cno coincidence that [the speech] followed upon the heels of [a] transfer notice\xe2\x80\x9d affecting the employee).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Snyder goes on to argue that Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s speech should be afforded less than full First Amendment protection \xe2\x80\x9cnot only because of the words\xe2\x80\x9d but also because the church members exploited the funeral \xe2\x80\x9cas a platform to bring their message to a broader audience.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 44, 40.  There is no doubt that Westboro chose to stage its picketing at the Naval Academy, the Maryland State House, and Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s funeral to increase publicity for its views and because of the relation between those sites and its views\xe2\x80\x94in the case of the military funeral, because Westboro believes that God is killing American soldiers as punishment for the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s sinful policies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s choice to convey its views in conjunction with Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s funeral made the expression of those views particularly hurtful to many, especially to Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s father.  The record makes clear that the applicable legal term\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cemotional distress\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94fails to capture fully the anguish Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s choice added to Mr. Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s already incalculable grief.  But Westboro conducted its picketing peacefully on matters of public concern at a public place adjacent to a public street.  Such space occupies a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial position in terms of First Amendment protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Grace</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/171/index.html">461 U.

Law Code Ann. \xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x93205 (Lexis Supp. 2010), as do 43 other States and the Federal Government.  See Brief for American Legion as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>18\xe2\x80\x9319, n.\xc2\xa02 (listing statutes).  To the extent these laws are content neutral, they raise very different questions from the tort verdict at issue in this case.  Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s law, however, was not in effect at the time of the events at issue here, so we have no occasion to consider how it might apply to facts such as those before us, or whether it or other similar regulations are constitutional.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have identified a few limited situations where the location of targeted picketing can be regulated under provisions that the Court has determined to be content neutral.  In <em>Frisby</em>,<em> </em>for example, we upheld a ban on such picketing \xe2\x80\x9cbefore or about\xe2\x80\x9d a particular residence, 487 U. S., at 477.  In <em>Madsen</em> v.<em> Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health Center, Inc.</em>, we approved an injunction requiring a buffer zone between protesters and an abortion clinic entrance.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/753/index.html">512 U. S. 753</a>, 768 (1994).  The facts here are obviously quite different, both with respect to the activity being regulated and the means of restricting those activities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Simply put, the church members had the right to be where they were.  Westboro alerted local authorities to its funeral protest and fully complied with police guidance on where the picketing could be staged.  The picketing was conducted under police supervision some 1,000 feet from the church, out of the sight of those at the church.  The protest was not unruly; there was no shouting, profanity, or violence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record confirms that any distress occasioned by Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s picketing turned on the content and viewpoint of the message conveyed, rather than any interference with the funeral itself.  A group of parishioners standing at the very spot where Westboro stood, holding signs that said \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGod Loves You,\xe2\x80\x9d would not have been subjected to liability.  It was what Westboro said that exposed it to tort damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given that Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s speech was at a public place on a matter of public concern, that speech is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cspecial protection\xe2\x80\x9d under the First Amendment.  Such speech cannot be restricted simply because it is upsetting or arouses contempt.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Texas</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/397/index.html">491 U. S. 397</a>, 414 (1989).  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe point of all speech protection \xe2\x80\xa6 is to shield just those choices of content that in someone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are misguided, or even hurtful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hurley</em> v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/557/index.html">515 U.

S., at 55 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In a case such as this, a jury is \xe2\x80\x9cunlikely to be neutral with respect to the content of [the] speech,\xe2\x80\x9d posing \xe2\x80\x9ca real danger of becoming an instrument for the suppression of \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasan[t]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d expression.  <em>Bose Corp.</em>, 466 U.

Such a risk is unacceptable; \xe2\x80\x9cin public debate [we] must tolerate insulting, and even outrageous, speech in order to provide adequate \xe2\x80\x98breathing space\xe2\x80\x99 to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boos</em> v. <em>Barry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/index.html">485 U.

What Westboro said, in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it, is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cspecial protection\xe2\x80\x9d under the First Amendment, and that protection cannot be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, the jury verdict imposing tort liability on Westboro for intentional infliction of emotional distress must be set aside.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury also found Westboro liable for the state law torts of intrusion upon seclusion and civil conspiracy.

Brief for Petitioner 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  We do not agree.  In most circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution does not permit the government to decide which types of otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer.  Rather, \xe2\x80\xa6 the burden normally falls upon the viewer to avoid further bombardment of [his] sensibilities simply by averting [his] eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Erznoznik</em> v. <em>Jacksonville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/205/index.html">422 U. S. 205</a>, 210\xe2\x80\x93211 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted).  As a result, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ability of government, consonant with the Constitution, to shut off discourse solely to protect others from hearing it is \xe2\x80\xa6 dependent upon a showing that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/15/index.html">403 U. S. 15</a>, 21 (1971).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a general matter, we have applied the captive audience doctrine only sparingly to protect unwilling listeners from protected speech.  For example, we have upheld a statute allowing a homeowner to restrict the delivery of offensive mail to his home, see <em>Rowan</em> v. <em>Post Office Dept.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/728/index.html">397 U.

S., at 484\xe2\x80\x93485.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, Westboro stayed well away from the memorial service.  Snyder could see no more than the tops of the signs when driving to the funeral.  And there is no indication that the picketing in any way interfered with the funeral service itself.  We decline to expand the captive audience doctrine to the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we find that the First Amendment bars Snyder from recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclusion\xe2\x80\x94the alleged unlawful activity Westboro conspired to accomplish\xe2\x80\x94we must likewise hold that Snyder cannot recover for civil conspiracy based on those torts.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holding today is narrow.  We are required in First Amendment cases to carefully review the record, and the reach of our opinion here is limited by the particular facts before us.

Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its con-tribution to public discourse may be negligible.  But \nWestboro addressed matters of public import on public property, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of local officials.  The speech was indeed planned to coincide with Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, but did not itself disrupt that funeral, and Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s choice to conduct its picketing at that time and place did not alter the nature of its speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Speech is powerful.  It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and\xe2\x80\x94as it did here\xe2\x80\x94inflict great pain.  On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker.  As a Nation we have chosen a different course\xe2\x80\x94to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.  That choice requires that we shield Westboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0A few weeks after the funeral, one of the picketers posted a message on Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s Web site discussing the picketing and containing religiously oriented denunciations of the Snyders, interspersed among lengthy Bible quotations.  Snyder discovered the posting, referred to by the parties as the \xe2\x80\x9cepic,\xe2\x80\x9d during an Internet search for his son\xe2\x80\x99s name.  The epic is not properly before us and does not factor in our analysis.  Although the epic was submitted to the jury and discussed in the courts below, Snyder never mentioned it in his petition for certiorari.  See Pet. for Cert. <em>i</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cSnyder\xe2\x80\x99s claim arose out of Phelps\xe2\x80\x99 intentional acts <em>at Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x99s funeral</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 14.1(g) (petition must contain statement \xe2\x80\x9csetting out the facts material to consideration of the question presented\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor did Snyder respond to the statement in the opposition to certiorari that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hough the epic was asserted as a basis for the claims at trial, the petition \xe2\x80\xa6 appears to be addressing only claims based on the picketing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief in Opposition 9.  Snyder devoted only one paragraph in the argument section of his opening merits brief to the epic.  Given the foregoing and the fact that an Internet posting may raise distinct issues in this context, we decline to consider the epic in deciding this case.

The Court of Appeals majority determined that the picketers had \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily waived\xe2\x80\x9d any such contention on appeal.  <em>Id.,</em> at 216.

But, as the court below noted, there is \xe2\x80\x9cno suggestion that the speech at issue falls within one of the categorical exclusions from First Amendment protection, such as those for obscenity or \xe2\x80\x98fighting words.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  580 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 218, n.\xc2\xa012; see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stevens</em>, 559 U.

That opinion restricts its analysis here to the matter raised in the petition for certiorari, namely, Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s picketing activity.  The opinion does not examine in depth the effect of television broadcasting.  Nor does it say anything about Internet postings.  The Court holds that the First Amendment protects the picketing that occurred here, primarily because the picketing addressed matters of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic concern.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the picketing addressed matters of public concern, I do not believe that our First Amendment analysis can stop at that point.  A State can sometimes regulate picketing, even picketing on matters of public concern.  See <em>Frisby</em> v. <em>Schultz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/474/index.html">487 U. S. 474</a> (1988).  Moreover, suppose that A were physically to assault B, knowing that the assault (being newsworthy) would provide A with an opportunity to transmit to the public his views on a matter of public concern.  The constitutionally protected nature of the end would not shield A\xe2\x80\x99s use of unlawful, unprotected means.  And in some circumstances the use of certain words as means would be similarly unprotected.  See <em>Chaplinsky</em> v. <em>New Hampshire</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/index.html">315 U. S. 568</a> (1942) (\xe2\x80\x9cfighting words\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent recognizes that the means used here consist of speech.  But it points out that the speech, like an assault, seriously harmed a private individual.  Indeed, the state tort of \xe2\x80\x9cintentional infliction of emotional distress\xe2\x80\x9d forbids only conduct that produces distress \xe2\x80\x9cso severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it,\xe2\x80\x9d and which itself is \xe2\x80\x9cso outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (opinion of Alito, J.) (quoting <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, 281 Md. 560, 567, 571, 380 A.\xc2\xa02d 611, 614, 616 (1977); internal quotation marks omitted)<em>. </em> The dissent requires us to ask whether our holding unreasonably limits liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress\xe2\x80\x94to the point where A (in order to draw attention to his views on a public matter) might launch a verbal assault upon B, a private person, publicly revealing the most intimate details of B\xe2\x80\x99s private life, while knowing that the revelation will cause B severe emotional harm.  Does our decision leave the State powerless to protect the individual against invasions of, <em>e.g.</em>, personal privacy, even in the most horrendous of such circumstances?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I understand the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, it does not hold or imply that the State is always powerless to provide private individuals with necessary protection.  Rather, the Court has reviewed the underlying facts in detail, as will sometimes prove necessary where First Amendment values and state-protected (say, privacy-related) interests seriously conflict.  Cf.<em> Florida Star</em> v. <em>B.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0F.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/524/index.html">491 U. S. 524</a>, 533 (1989); <em>Bose Corp.</em> v. <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/485/index.html">466 U. S. 485</a>, 499 (1984).  That review makes clear that Westboro\xe2\x80\x99s means of communicating its views consisted of picketing in a place where picketing was lawful and in compliance with all police directions.  The picketing could not be seen or heard from the funeral ceremony itself.  And Snyder testified that he saw no more than the tops of the picketers\xe2\x80\x99 signs as he drove to the funeral.  To uphold the application of state law in these circumstances would punish Westboro for seeking to communicate its views on matters of public concern without proportionately advancing the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in protecting its citizens against severe emotional harm.  Consequently, the First Amendment protects Westboro.  As I read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, it holds no more. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963458">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nSNYDER V.

He is simply a parent whose son, Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, was killed in Iraq.  Mr. Snyder wanted what is surely the right of any parent who experiences such an incalculable loss: to bury his son in peace.  But respondents, members of the Westboro Baptist Church, deprived him of that elementary right.  They first issued a press release and thus turned Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s funeral into a tumultuous media event.  They then appeared at the church, approached as closely as they could without trespassing, and launched a malevolent verbal attack on Matthew and his family at a time of acute emotional vulnerability.  As a result, Albert Snyder suffered severe and lasting emotional injury.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Court now holds that the First Amendment protected respondents\xe2\x80\x99 right to brutalize Mr. Snyder.  I cannot agree.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents and other members of their church have strong opinions on certain moral, religious, and political issues, and the First Amendment ensures that they have almost limitless opportunities to express their views.  They may write and distribute books, articles, and other texts; they may create and disseminate video and audio recordings; they may circulate petitions; they may speak to individuals and groups in public forums and in any private venue that wishes to accommodate them; they may picket peacefully in countless locations; they may appear on television and speak on the radio; they may post messages on the Internet and send out e-mails.  And they may express their views in terms that are \xe2\x80\x9cuninhibited,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cvehement,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccaustic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>New York Times Co. </em>v.<em> Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html">376 U. S. 254</a>, 270 (1964).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It does not follow, however, that they may intentionally inflict severe emotional injury on private persons at a time of intense emotional sensitivity by launching vicious verbal attacks that make no contribution to public debate.  To protect against such injury, \xe2\x80\x9cmost if not all jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d permit recovery in tort for the intentional infliction of emotional distress (or IIED).  <em>Hustler Magazine</em>,<em> Inc. </em>v.<em> Falwell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/46/index.html"></a><a href="/us/485/46/index.html">485 U.

Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa712, p. 61 (5th ed. 1984).  To recover, a plaintiff must show that the conduct at issue caused harm that was truly severe.  See <em>Figueiredo-Torres</em> v. <em>Nickel</em>, 321 Md. 642, 653, 584 A.\xc2\xa02d 69, 75 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ecovery will be meted out sparingly, its balm reserved for those wounds that are truly severe and incapable of healing themselves\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, 281 Md. 560, 571, 380 A.\xc2\xa02d 611, 616 (1977) (the distress must be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa746, Comment <em>j</em> (1963\xe2\x80\x931964))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A plaintiff must also establish that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 567, 380 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 614 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa746, Comment <em>d</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the elements of the IIED tort are difficult to meet, respondents long ago abandoned any effort to show that those tough standards were not satisfied here.  On appeal, they chose not to contest the sufficiency of the evidence.  See 580 F.\xc2\xa03d 206, 216 (CA4 2009).  They did not dispute that Mr. Snyder suffered \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wounds that are truly severe and incapable of healing themselves.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Figueiredo-Torres</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 653, 584 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 75.  Nor did they dispute that their speech was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harris</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 567, 380 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 614.  Instead, they maintained that the First Amendment gave them a license to engage in such conduct.  They are wrong.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is well established that a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress can be satisfied by speech.  Indeed, what has been described as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he leading case\xe2\x80\x9d recognizing this tort involved speech.  Prosser and Keeton,  <em>supra,</em> \xc2\xa712, at 60 (citing <em>Wilkinson </em>v.<em> Downton</em>, [1897] 2 Q.\xc2\xa0B. 57); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa746, illustration 1.  And although this Court has not decided the question, I think it is clear that the First Amendment does not entirely preclude liability for the intentional infliction of emotional distress by means of speech.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has recognized that words may \xe2\x80\x9cby their very utterance inflict injury\xe2\x80\x9d and that the First Amendment does not shield utterances that form \xe2\x80\x9cno essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chaplinsky</em> v. <em>New Hampshire</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/index.html">315 U.

When grave injury is intentionally inflicted by means of an attack like the one at issue here, the First Amendment should not interfere with recovery.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, respondents brutally attacked Matthew Snyder, and this attack, which was almost certain to inflict injury, was central to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 well-practiced strategy for attracting public attention.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the morning of Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, respondents could have chosen to stage their protest at countless locations.  They could have picketed the United States Capitol, the White House, the Supreme Court, the Pentagon, or any of the more than 5,600 military recruiting stations in this country.  They could have returned to the Maryland State House or the United States Naval Academy, where they had been the day before.  They could have selected any public road where pedestrians are allowed.  (There are more than 4,000,000 miles of public roads in the United States.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>])  They could have staged their protest in a public park.  (There are more than 20,000 public parks in this country.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>])  They could have chosen any Catholic church where no funeral was taking place.  (There are nearly 19,000 Catholic churches in the United States.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>])  But of course, a small group picketing at any of these locations would have probably gone unnoticed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Westboro Baptist Church, however, has devised a strategy that remedies this problem.  As the Court notes, church members have protested at nearly 600 military funerals.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  They have also picketed the funerals of police officers,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] firefighters,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and the victims of natural disasters,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] accidents,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and shocking crimes.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  And in advance of these protests, they issue press releases to ensure that their protests will attract public attention.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This strategy works because it is expected that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 verbal assaults will wound the family and friends of the deceased and because the media is irresistibly drawn to the sight of persons who are visibly in grief.  The more outrageous the funeral protest, the more publicity the Westboro Baptist Church is able to obtain.  Thus, when the church recently announced its intention to picket the funeral of a 9-year-old girl killed in the shooting spree in Tucson\xe2\x80\x94proclaiming that she was \xe2\x80\x9cbetter off dead\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]\xe2\x80\x94their announcement was national news,[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and the church was able to obtain free air time on the radio in exchange for canceling its protest.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Similarly, in 2006, the church got air time on a talk radio show in exchange for canceling its threatened protest at the funeral of five Amish girls killed by a crazed gunman.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, respondents implemented the Westboro Baptist Church\xe2\x80\x99s publicity-seeking strategy.  Their press release stated that they were going \xe2\x80\x9cto picket the funeral of Lance Cpl. Matthew A. Snyder\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty killed Lance Cpl. Snyder.  He died in shame, not honor\xe2\x80\x94for a fag nation cursed by God \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Now in Hell\xe2\x80\x94sine die.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x931026 (CA4), p.\xc2\xa0158a.  This announcement guaranteed that Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s funeral would be transformed into a raucous media event and began the wounding process.  It is well known that anticipation may heighten the effect of a painful event.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the day of the funeral, respondents, true to their word, displayed placards that conveyed the message promised in their press release.  Signs stating \xe2\x80\x9cGod Hates You\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThank God for Dead Soldiers\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated the message that God had caused Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s death in retribution for his sins.  App. to Brief for Appellants in No. 08\xe2\x80\x931026 (CA4), pp. 3787, 3788 (hereinafter App.).  Others, stating \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Going to Hell\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNot Blessed Just Cursed,\xe2\x80\x9d conveyed the message that Matthew was \xe2\x80\x9cin Hell\xe2\x80\x94sine die.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 3783.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if those who attended the funeral were not alerted in advance about respondents\xe2\x80\x99 intentions, the meaning of these signs would not have been missed.  Since respondents chose to stage their protest at Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s funeral and not at any of the other countless available venues, a reasonable person would have assumed that there was a connection between the messages on the placards and the deceased.  Moreover, since a church funeral is an event that naturally brings to mind thoughts about the afterlife, some of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 signs\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g</em>., \xe2\x80\x9cGod Hates You,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot Blessed Just Cursed,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re Going to Hell\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94would have likely been interpreted as referring to God\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of the deceased.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other signs would most naturally have been understood as suggesting\xe2\x80\x94falsely\xe2\x80\x94that Matthew was gay.  Homosexuality was the theme of many of the signs.  There were signs reading \xe2\x80\x9cGod Hates Fags,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSemper Fi Fags,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFags Doom Nations,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFag Troops.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 3781\xe2\x80\x933787.  Another placard depicted two men engaging in anal intercourse.  A reasonable bystander seeing those signs would have likely concluded that they were meant to suggest that the deceased was a homosexual.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the funeral, the Westboro picketers reaffirmed the meaning of their protest.  They posted an online account entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Burden of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew A. Snyder.  The Visit of Westboro Baptist Church to Help the Inhabitants of Maryland Connect the Dots!\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 3788.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Belying any suggestion that they had simply made general comments about homosexuality, the Catholic Church, and the United States military, the \xe2\x80\x9cepic\xe2\x80\x9d addressed the Snyder family directly:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGod blessed you, Mr. and Mrs. Snyder, with a resource and his name was Matthew.

You did JUST THE OPPOSITE\xe2\x80\x94you raised him for the devil.</p>\n<p align="left">.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAlbert and Julie RIPPED that body apart and taught Matthew to defy his Creator, to divorce, and to commit adultery.  They taught him how to support the largest pedophile machine in the history of the entire world, the Roman Catholic monstrosity.  Every dime they gave the Roman Catholic monster they condemned their own souls.  They also, in supporting satanic Catholicism, taught Matthew to be an idolater.</p>\n<p align="left">.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThen after all that they sent him to fight for the United States of Sodom, a filthy country that is in lock step with his evil, wicked, and sinful manner of life, putting him in the cross hairs of a God that is so mad He has smoke coming from his nostrils and fire from his mouth!  How dumb was that?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 3791.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this evidence, it is abundantly clear that respondents, going far beyond commentary on matters of public concern, specifically attacked Matthew Snyder because (1) he was a Catholic and (2) he was a member of the United States military.  Both Matthew and petitioner were private figures,[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and this attack was not speech on a matter of public concern.  While commentary on the Catholic Church or the United States military constitutes speech on matters of public concern, speech regarding Matthew Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s purely private conduct does not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer provides an apt analogy to a case in which the First Amendment would permit recovery in tort for a verbal attack:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[S]uppose that A were physically to assault B, knowing that the assault (being newsworthy) would provide A with an opportunity to transmit to the public his views on a matter of public concern.  The constitutionally protected nature of the end would not shield A\xe2\x80\x99s use of unlawful, unprotected means.  And in some circumstances the use of certain words as means would be similarly unprotected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This captures what respondents did in this case.  Indeed, this is the strategy that they have routinely employed\xe2\x80\x94and that they will now continue to employ\xe2\x80\x94inflicting severe and lasting emotional injury on an ever growing list of innocent victims.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court concludes that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 speech was protected by the First Amendment for essentially three reasons, but none is sound.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First\xe2\x80\x94and most important\xe2\x80\x94the Court finds that \xe2\x80\x9cthe overall thrust and dominant theme of [their] demonstration spoke to\xe2\x80\x9d broad public issues. <em>Ante,</em> at 8.  As I have attempted to show, this portrayal is quite inaccurate; respondents\xe2\x80\x99 attack on Matthew was of central importance.  But in any event, I fail to see why actionable speech should be immunized simply because it is interspersed with speech that is protected.  The First Amendment allows recovery for defamatory statements that are interspersed with nondefamatory statements on matters of public concern, and there is no good reason why respondents\xe2\x80\x99 attack on Matthew Snyder and his family should be treated differently.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Second, the Court suggests that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 personal attack on Matthew Snyder is entitled to First Amendment protection because it was not motivated by a private grudge, see <em>ante</em>, at 9, but I see no basis for the strange distinction that the Court appears to draw.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motivation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto increase publicity for its views,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>\xe2\x80\x94did not transform their statements attacking the character\nof a private figure into statements that made a contribution to debate on matters of public concern.  Nor did their publicity-seeking motivation soften the sting of their attack.  And as far as culpability is concerned, one might well think that wounding statements uttered in the heat of a private feud are less, not more, blameworthy than similar statements made as part of a cold and calculated strategy to slash a stranger as a means of attracting public attention.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court finds it significant that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 protest occurred on a public street, but this fact alone should not be enough to preclude IIED liability.  To be sure, statements made on a public street may be less likely to satisfy the elements of the IIED tort than statements made on private property, but there is no reason why a public street in close proximity to the scene of a funeral should be regarded as a free-fire zone in which otherwise actionable verbal attacks are shielded from liability.  If the First Amendment permits the States to protect their residents from the harm inflicted by such attacks\xe2\x80\x94and the Court does not hold otherwise\xe2\x80\x94then the location of the tort should not be dispositive.  A physical assault may occur without trespassing; it is no defense that the perpetrator had \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to be where [he was].\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 11.  And the same should be true with respect to unprotected speech.  Neither classic \xe2\x80\x9cfighting words\xe2\x80\x9d nor defamatory statements are immunized when they occur in a public place, and there is no good reason to treat a verbal assault based on the conduct or character of a private figure like Matthew Snyder any differently.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One final comment about the opinion of the Court is in order.  The Court suggests that the wounds inflicted by vicious verbal assaults at funerals will be prevented or at least mitigated in the future by new laws that restrict picketing within a specified distance of a funeral.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311<em>.</em>  It is apparent, however, that the enactment of these laws is no substitute for the protection provided by the established IIED tort; according to the Court, the verbal attacks that severely wounded petitioner in this case complied with the new Maryland law regulating funeral picketing.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11, n. 5.  And there is absolutely nothing to suggest that Congress and the state legislatures, in enacting these laws, intended them to displace the protection provided by the well-established IIED tort.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The real significance of these new laws is not that they obviate the need for IIED protection.  Rather, their enactment dramatically illustrates the fundamental point that funerals are unique events at which special protection against emotional assaults is in order.  At funerals, the emotional well-being of bereaved relatives is particularly vulnerable.  See <em>National Archives and Records Admin.</em> v. <em>Favish</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/157/index.html">541 U. S. 157</a>, 168 (2004).  Exploitation of a funeral for the purpose of attracting public attention \xe2\x80\x9cintrud[es] upon their \xe2\x80\xa6 grief,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and may permanently stain their memories of the final moments before a loved one is laid to rest.  Allowing family members to have a few hours of peace without harassment does not undermine public debate.  I would therefore hold that, in this setting, the First Amendment permits a private figure to recover for the intentional infliction of emotional distress caused by speech on a matter of private concern.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reversing the District Court judgment in favor of petitioner, the Court of Appeals relied on several grounds not discussed in the opinion of this Court or in the separate opinion supporting affirmance.  I now turn briefly to those issues.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court erred by allowing the jury to decide whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 speech was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98directed specifically at the Snyder family.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  580 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 221.  It is not clear whether the Court of Appeals thought that this was a question for the trial judge alone or a question on which the judge had to make a preliminary ruling before sending it to the jury.  In either event, however, the submission of this question to the jury was not reversible error because, as explained above, it is clear that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 statements targeted the Snyders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court of Appeals held that the trial judge went astray in allowing the jury to decide whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 speech was so \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98offensive and shocking as to not be entitled to First Amendment protection.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This instruction also did respondents no harm.  Because their speech did not relate to a matter of public concern, it was not protected from liability by the First Amendment, and the only question for the jury was whether the elements of the IIED tort were met.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court of Appeals appears to have concluded that the First Amendment does not permit an IIED plaintiff to recover for speech that cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual.  See <em>id.,</em> at 222.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on two of our cases\xe2\x80\x94<em>Milkovich </em>v.<em> Lorain Journal Co</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/1/index.html">497 U. S. 1</a> (1990), and <em>Hustler,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/46/index.html"></a><a href="/us/485/46/index.html">485 U. S. 46</a>\xe2\x80\x94but neither supports the broad proposition that the Court of Appeals adopted.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Milkovich</em> was a defamation case, and falsity is an element of defamation.  Nothing in <em>Milkovich</em> even hints that the First Amendment requires that this defamation element be engrafted onto the IIED tort.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hustler</em> did involve an IIED claim, but the plaintiff there was a public figure, and the Court did not suggest that its holding would also apply in a case involving a private figure.  Nor did the Court suggest that its holding applied across the board to all types of IIED claims.  Instead, the holding was limited to \xe2\x80\x9cpublications such as the one here at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, a caricature in a magazine.  485 U. S., at 56.  Unless a caricature of a public figure can reasonably be interpreted as stating facts that may be proved to be wrong, the caricature does not have the same potential to wound as a personal verbal assault on a vulnerable private figure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I cannot agree either with the holding of this Court or the other grounds on which the Court of Appeals relied, I would reverse the decision below and remand for further proceedings.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 outrageous conduct caused petitioner great injury, and the Court now compounds that injury by depriving petitioner of a judgment that acknowledges the wrong he suffered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to have a society in which public issues can be openly and vigorously debated, it is not necessary to allow the brutalization of innocent victims like petitioner.

The epic, however, is not a distinct claim but a piece of evidence that the jury considered in imposing liability for the claims now before this Court.  The protest and the epic are parts of a single course of conduct that the jury found to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress.
