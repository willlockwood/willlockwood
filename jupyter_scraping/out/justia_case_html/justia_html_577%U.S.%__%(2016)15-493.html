In <i>Hughes</i> v. <i>Rowe</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 5 (1980)\n (<i>per curiam</i>), this Court interpreted \xc2\xa71988 to permit a prevailing defendant in such a suit to recover fees only if \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 14 (quoting <i>Christiansburg Garment Co.</i> v. <i>EEOC</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 412,\n421 (1978)\n (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the decision below, the Idaho Supreme Court concluded that it was not bound by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71988 in <i>Hughes</i>.  According to that court, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough the Supreme Court may have the authority to limit the discretion of lower federal courts, it does not have the authority to limit the discretion of state courts where such limitation is not contained in the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  158 Idaho713, 734, 351 P.\xc2\xa03d 1171, 1192 (2015).  The court then pro-ceeded to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71988 to a prevailing defendant without first determining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court\xe2\x80\x99s fee award rested solely on its interpretation of federal law; the court explicitly refused to award fees under state law.  <i>Id.</i>, at 734\xe2\x80\x93735, 351 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1192\xe2\x80\x931193.  We grant certiorari, and now reverse.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 1988 is a federal statute.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to say what a [federal] statute means, and once the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other courts to respect that understanding of the governing rule of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Nitro-Lift Technologies, L.

And for good reason.  As Justice Story explained 200 years ago, if state courts were permitted to disregard this Court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings on federal law, \xe2\x80\x9cthe laws, the treaties, and the constitution of the United States would be different in different states, and might, perhaps, never have precisely the same construction, obligation, or efficacy, in any two states.  The public mischiefs that would attend such a state of things would be truly deplorable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 1 Wheat. 304, 348 (1816).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Idaho Supreme Court, like any other state or fed-eral court, is bound by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of federal law.  The state court erred in concluding otherwise.  The judgment of the Idaho Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
