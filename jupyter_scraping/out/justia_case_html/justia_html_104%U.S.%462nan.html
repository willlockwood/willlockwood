It prays for an order upon him to pay the taxes out of that fund, and for general relief.</p>\n<p>The court sustained a demurrer to the bill, and Rosenblatt appealed.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The single question in this case is whether the personal assets and personal property of an insolvent national bank in the hands of a receiver appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency, in accordance with the provision of sec. 5234 of the Revised Statutes, are exempt from taxation under state laws, and we have no hesitation in saying that in our opinion they are.  Such property and assets, in legal contemplation, still belong to the bank, though in the hands of a receiver, to be administered under the law.  The bank did not cease to exist on the appointment of the receiver.  Its corporate capacity continues until its affairs are finally wound up and its assets distributed.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/81/383/case.html">Bank of Bethel v. Pahquioque Bank,</a></span></em> 14 Wall. 383; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/498/case.html">Kennedy v.

If the shares have any value, they are taxable in the hands of the holders or owners, under sec. 5219 of the Revised Statutes; but the property held by the receiver is exempt to the same extent it was before his appointment.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
