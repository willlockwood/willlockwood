We are asked to decide whether, under <em>Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html">427 U. S. 132</a></span> (1976), the city\'s action is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 151 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1980, Golden State, which operated taxicabs under the Yellow Cab name, applied to the city for a renewal of its operating franchise eventually scheduled to lapse on March 31, 1981.  That franchise had first been acquired in 1977.  On September 4, 1980, the city\'s Board of Transportation Commissioners recommended the renewal of Golden State\'s franchise -- the largest, with approximately 400 cabs, of companies operating in Los Angeles -- along with the franchises of 12 other taxi companies.</p>\n<p>In October, while the franchise renewal application was pending, Golden State\'s labor contract with its drivers expired.  The company and the drivers, represented by Local </p><p><a class="page-number" name="610">Page 475 U. S. 610</a></p><p> 572 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, signed a short-term contract in order that operations would continue while negotiation and mediation proceeded.  This interim contract was to expire at midnight, February 10, 1981, the day before the City Council was scheduled to consider action on the franchise renewals.</p>\n<p>On February 2, the Council\'s Transportation and Traffic Committee endorsed franchise renewals recommended by the Board of Transportation Commissioners.  The Committee\'s report stated that Golden State and other companies were "in compliance with all terms and conditions of their franchise[s]."  App. 39.</p>\n<p>On February 11, the drivers struck Golden State, halting its operations.  At the Council meeting that day, Teamster representatives argued against renewal of Golden State\'s franchise because of the pendency of the labor dispute.  The Council postponed decision on Golden State\'s application until February 17, but, with possibly one exception, approved all other franchise renewal applications.  At the February 17 meeting, when the union again opposed the renewal, the Council voted to extend Golden State\'s franchise from March 31 to April 30, but only if the Council expressly found, on or before March 27, that the extension was in the best interests of the city.</p>\n<p>At its March 23 meeting, the Council held a short public hearing on whether it should grant the limited extension.  By this time, the labor dispute and the franchise renewal issue had become clearly intertwined.  The Teamsters opposed any extension of the Yellow Cab franchise, stating that such action would simply lengthen the strike and keep the drivers out of work.  It preferred to see the franchise terminated, and to have the drivers seek jobs from Golden State\'s successor or from other franchise holders.  As others spoke, the discussion turned to whether there was even a need for Yellow Cab, in light of the services performed by the other 12 franchised taxi companies.  There were comments regarding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="611">Page 475 U. S. 611</a></p><p> an excess of cabs; the city\'s policy at the time, however, was not to limit the number of taxi companies or the number of taxis in each fleet.  <em>Id.</em> at 81-82.</p>\n<p>The strike was central to the discussion.  One Council member charged Golden State with negotiating unreasonably, <em>id.</em> at 71, while another accused the company of trying to "brea[k] the back of the union."  <em>Id.</em> at 66.  The sympathies of the Council members who spoke lay with the union.  But rather than defeat the renewal outright, the council reached a consensus for rejection of the extension with a possibility for reopening the issue if the parties settled their labor dispute before the franchise expired the following week.  Four Council members endorsed this approach, and the Assistant City Attorney said that he clearly had informed the parties that this was the city\'s position.  <em>Id.</em> at 68.  The Council President said:</p>\n<p>"I find that it will be very difficult to get this ordinance past (<em>sic</em>) to extend this franchise if the labor dispute is not settled by the end of this week."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 75.  He added:  "I just think that this kind of information should be put out in the open, so everybody understands it."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Council, by a vote of 11 to 1, defeated the motion to extend the franchise, and it expired by its terms on March 31.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Golden State filed this action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the city\'s action was preempted by the NLRA and violated the company\'s rights to due process and equal protection.  It sought declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.  The District Court found that it was "undisputed that the sole basis for refusing to extend [Golden State\'s] franchise was its labor dispute with its Teamster drivers," 520 F.Supp. 191, 193 (1981); that the Council had "threaten[ed] to allow Yellow Cab\'s franchise to terminate unless it entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters," <em>id.</em> at 194; and that the Council had denied the company an essential weapon </p><p><a class="page-number" name="612">Page 475 U. S. 612</a></p><p> of economic strength -- the ability to wait out a strike.  On the basis of the preemption claim, the District Court granted Golden State\'s motion for a preliminary injunction to preserve the franchise.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found "ample evidence" in the record to support the District Court\'s finding, but nevertheless vacated the injunction.  686 F.2d 758, 759, 762 (1982).  The court reasoned that Golden State had little chance of prevailing on its preemption claim or on the other grounds it asserted.  This Court denied Golden State\'s petition for certiorari.  459 U.S. 1105 (1983).</p>\n<p>Following litigation on unrelated issues, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and with the company having abandoned its equal protection claim, the District Court granted summary judgment for the city.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a.  Golden State had not moved for summary judgment in its favor.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the city\'s action was not preempted.  754 F.2d 830 (1985).  The court felt that, when the activity regulated is only a peripheral or incidental concern of labor policy, traditional municipal regulation is not preempted.  The court found nothing in the record to suggest that the city\'s nonrenewal decision "was not concerned with transportation."  <em>Id.</em> at 833.  Moreover to avoid undue restriction of local regulation, "only actions seeking to directly alter the substantive outcome of a labor dispute should be preempted."  Here, the city had not attempted to dictate the terms of the agreement, but had "merely insisted upon resolution of the dispute as a condition to franchise renewal."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court of Appeals also rejected Golden State\'s due </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 475 U. S. 613</a></p><p> process claim.  <em>Id.</em> at 833-834. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Because of our concern about the propriety of the grant of summary judgment for the city in this factual and labor context, we granted certiorari.  472 U.S. 1016 (1985).

The drivers were entitled to strike -- and to time the strike to coincide with the Council\'s decision -- in an attempt to apply pressure on Golden State.  <em>See NLRB v.

And Golden State was entirely justified in using its economic power to withstand the strike in an attempt to obtain bargaining concessions from the union.  <em>See Belknap, Inc. v.

The District Court found that the Council had conditioned the franchise on a settlement of the labor dispute by March 31.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that this finding is amply supported by the record. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The city\'s insistence on a settlement is preempted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="616">Page 475 U.

It does not purport to set any time limits on negotiations or economic struggle.  Instead, the Act provides a framework for the negotiations; it "is concerned primarily with establishing an equitable process for determining terms and conditions of employment."  <em>Metropolitan Life Ins.

Wagner affirming that the Act encourages "voluntary settlement of industrial disputes").</p>\n<p>Protecting the free use of economic weapons during the course of negotiations was the rationale for this Court\'s findings of preemption in <em>Machinists</em> and in its predecessor, <em>Teamsters v.

Similarly, in the transportation area, a State may not ensure uninterrupted service to the public by prohibiting a strike by the unionized employees of a privately owned local transit company.  <em>See Bus Employees v.

Whether summary judgment should have been entered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="620">Page 475 U.

But for the nonrenewal in 1981, Golden State would be more likely to have an operating franchise now.

At the meeting of March 23, 1981, four Council members without contradiction pointedly conveyed the settlement condition to the parties as the Council\'s "bottom line" on the issue.  The condition also was announced to the parties by the Council\'s agent, the Assistant City Attorney, revealing that the condition was city policy.  Moreover, the condition was evident from the schedule on which the Council considered the question.  Golden State\'s franchise issue was deferred from February 11 to the 17th, from February 17 to March 23, and from March 23 to the 31st.  Only Golden State, among the franchise applicants, was subjected to a conditional 1-month extension of its franchise.  The only plausible reason for these repeated short extensions is that the city was giving the franchise holder additional time to comply with a particular requirement.  Yet Golden State was in compliance with all the terms of the franchise except the Council\'s desire for a settlement.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>There is no issue here that, rather than regulating the relationship between the employer and the union, the city\'s action protected innocent third parties from the employer.  <em>See Belknap, Inc. v.

The idea that state action may be upheld under such circumstances is part of the <em>Garmon</em> analysis.  <em>See Belknap, Inc. v.

Because we hold that the city directly interfered with the bargaining process -- a central concern of the NLRA -- we need not reach the question whether this exception applies to a <em>Machinists case.</em> <em>But see Metropolitan Life Ins.

New York State Labor Relations Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/767/case.html">330 U. S. 767</a></span> (1947), this Court addressed the permissible scope of state regulation of labor disputes by examining New York\'s so-called Little Wagner Act, under which foremen were permitted to unionize.  The status of foremen under the federal Act had been a matter of dispute at the time that New York asserted its right to supervise the organization of a union of foremen at the Bethlehem Steel Company plant in that State.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/767/case.html#770">330 U.

Teamsters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/346/485/case.html">346 U. S. 485</a></span> (1953), the Court was presented with a claim of preemption under the Taft-Hartley Act, which imposed regulations and duties on labor correlative to the those imposed on management by the Wagner Act.  The case involved unionized drivers who had engaged in conduct clearly prohibited by the Taft-Hartley Act, which might have made them subject to a cease-and-desist order by the National Labor Relations Board.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/346/485/case.html#486">346 U.

S. 488</a></span>.</p>\n<p>From the acorns of these two very sensible decisions has grown the mighty oak of this Court\'s labor preemption doctrine, which sweeps ever outward though still totally uninformed by any express directive from Congress.  The National Labor Relations Board, organized management, and organized labor have vied with each other in urging the Court to sweep into the maw of labor relations law concerns that would have been regarded as totally peripheral to that body of law by the Congresses which enacted the Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley Act.</p>\n<p>Today we are told that a city, not seeking to place its weight on one side or the other of the scales of economic warfare, may not condition the renewal of a taxicab franchise on the settlement of a labor dispute.  The settlement of that dispute would have enabled the company to put its taxis back on the streets where the franchise presumably contemplated they would be.  The Court says that, since the Labor Board may not structure an ideal balance of collective bargaining weapons, the city may not consider the existence of a labor dispute in deciding whether to renew a franchise.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/608/case.html#619">475 U. S. 619</a></span>-620.  We are further told that, because a State may not legislate to provide uninterrupted service to the public by prohibiting a strike of public utility employees, a city may not act upon its views of sound transportation policy to refuse to renew a taxi franchise unless the franchisee settles a labor dispute and returns its cabs to the purpose for which the franchise exists.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/608/case.html#617">475 U.

Such sweeping generalizations commend themselves neither to common sense nor to whatever hypothetical "intent of Congress" as can be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="623">Page 475 U. S. 623</a></p><p> discerned in an area so remote from the core concerns of labor-management relations addressed by federal labor law.</p>\n<p>Federal preemption of state law is a matter of congressional intent, presumed or expressed.  Because Congress cannot foresee the various ways in which state laws might rub up against the operation of federal statutes, the Court, in a multitude of cases, has held state regulation preempted even when Congress has not expressed any intent to preempt because of the danger that the existence of federal and state regulations side by side will interfere with the achievement of the objectives of the federal legislation.  The entire body of this Court\'s labor law preemption doctrine has been built on a series of implications as to congressional intent in the face of congressional silence, so that we now have an elaborate preemption doctrine traceable not to any expression of Congress, but only to statements by this Court in its previous opinions of what Congress must have intended.</p>\n<p>The Court today doffs its hat to the legislative history of the Wagner Act and comes up with the following three items:</p>\n<p>"[1] The Senate Report states:"</p>\n<p>"Disputes about wages, hours of work, and other working conditions should continue to be resolved by the play of competitive forces. . . .  This bill in no respect regulates or even provides for supervision of wages or hours, nor does it establish any form of compulsory arbitration."</p>\n<p>"[2] Senator Wagner, sponsor of the NLRA, said that the Board would not usurp the role of free collective action."</p>\n<p>"[3] Senator Wagner affirm[ed] that the Act encourages \'voluntary settlement of industrial disputes.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/608/case.html#617">475 U.

The observations that the Wagner Act leaves it to the parties to resolve their disputes by the play of competitive forces, that the Labor Board would not usurp the role of free collective </p><p><a class="page-number" name="624">Page 475 U. S. 624</a></p><p> action, and that the Act encourages voluntary settlement of industrial disputes, simply do not speak to the question whether a city may condition the renewal of a taxicab franchise on the settlement of a labor dispute.  I do not believe that Congress intended the labor law net to be cast this far, and I therefore dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
