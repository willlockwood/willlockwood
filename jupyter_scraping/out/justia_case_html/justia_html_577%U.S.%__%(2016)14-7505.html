A penalty-phase jury recommended that Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s judge impose a death sentence.  Notwithstanding this recommendation, Florida law required the judge to hold a separate hearing and determine whether sufficient aggravating circumstances existed to justify imposing the death penalty.  The judge so found and sentenced Hurst to death.</p>\n<p>We hold this sentencing scheme unconstitutional.  The\n \nSixth Amendment requires a jury, not a judge, to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death.  A jury\xe2\x80\x99s mere recommendation is not enough.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>On May 2, 1998, Cynthia Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s body was discovered in the freezer of the restaurant where she worked\xe2\x80\x94bound, gagged, and stabbed over 60 times.  The restaurant safe was unlocked and open, missing hundreds of dollars.  The State of Florida charged Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s co-worker, Timothy Lee Hurst, with her murder.  See 819 So.\xc2\xa02d 689, 692\xe2\x80\x93694 (Fla. 2002).</p>\n<p>During Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s 4-day trial, the State offered substantial forensic evidence linking Hurst to the murder.  Witnesses also testified that Hurst announced in advance that he planned to rob the restaurant; that Hurst and Harrison were the only people scheduled to work when Harrison was killed; and that Hurst disposed of blood-stained evidence and used stolen money to purchase shoes and rings.</p>\n<p>Hurst responded with an alibi defense.  He claimed he never made it to work because his car broke down.  Hurst told police that he called the restaurant to let Harrison know he would be late.  He said she sounded scared and he could hear another person\xe2\x80\x94presumably the real murderer\xe2\x80\x94whispering in the background.</p>\n<p>At the close of Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s defense, the judge instructed the jury that it could find Hurst guilty of first-degree murder under two theories: premeditated murder or felony murder for an unlawful killing during a robbery.  The jury convicted Hurst of first-degree murder but did not specify which theory it believed.</p>\n<p>First-degree murder is a capital felony in Florida.  See Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7782.04(1)(a) (2010).  Under state law, the maximum sentence a capital felon may receive on the basis of the conviction alone is life imprisonment.  \xc2\xa7775.082(1).  \xe2\x80\x9cA person who has been convicted of a capital felony shall be punished by death\xe2\x80\x9d only if an additional sentencing proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cresults in findings by the court that such person shall be punished by death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]therwise such person shall be punished by life imprisonment and shall be ineligible for parole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The additional sentencing proceeding Florida employs is a \xe2\x80\x9chybrid\xe2\x80\x9d proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cin which [a] jury renders an advisory verdict but the judge makes the ultimate sentencingdeterminations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ring</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 584,\n608, n.\n6 (2002)\n.  First, the sentencing judge conducts an evidentiary hearing before a jury.  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7921.141(1) (2010).  Next, the jury renders an \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory sentence\xe2\x80\x9d of life or death without specifying the factual basis of its recommendation.  \xc2\xa7921.141(2).  \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding the recommendation of a majority of the jury, the court, after weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, shall enter a sentence of life imprisonment or death.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921.141(3).  If the court imposes death, it must \xe2\x80\x9cset forth in writing its findings upon which the sentence of death is based.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Although the judge must give the jury recommendation \xe2\x80\x9cgreat weight,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Tedder </i>v. <i>State</i>, 322 So.\xc2\xa02d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975) (<i>per curiam</i>), the sentencing order must \xe2\x80\x9creflect the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s independent judgment about the existence of aggravating and mitigating factors,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Blackwelder </i>v. <i>State</i>, 851 So.\xc2\xa02d 650, 653 (Fla. 2003) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).</p>\n<p>Following this procedure, Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s jury recommended a death sentence.  The judge independently agreed.  See 819 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 694\xe2\x80\x93695.  On postconviction review, however, the Florida Supreme Court vacated Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s sentence for reasons not relevant to this case.  See 18 So. 3d 975 (2009).</p>\n<p>At resentencing in 2012, the sentencing judge conducted a new hearing during which Hurst offered mitigating evidence that he was not a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor participant\xe2\x80\x9d in the murder because he was at home when it happened.  App. 505\xe2\x80\x93507.  The sentencing judge instructed the advisory jury that it could recommend a death sentence if it found at least one aggravating circumstance beyond a reason-able doubt: that the murder was especially \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d or that it occurred while Hurst was committing a robbery.  <i>Id</i>., at 211\xe2\x80\x93212.  The jury recommended death by a vote of 7 to 5.</p>\n<p>The sentencing judge then sentenced Hurst to death.  In her written order, the judge based the sentence in part on her independent determination that both the heinous-murder and robbery aggravators existed.  <i>Id</i>., at 261\xe2\x80\x93263.  She assigned \xe2\x80\x9cgreat weight\xe2\x80\x9d to her findings as well as to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation of death.  <i>Id</i>., at 271.</p>\n<p>The Florida Supreme Court affirmed 4 to 3.  147 So. 3d 435 (2014).  As relevant here, the court rejected Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s argument that his sentence violated the\n \nSixth Amendment in light of <i>Ring</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 584\n.  <i>Ring</i>, the court recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cheld that capital defendants are entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in the maximum punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  147 So. 3d<i>,</i> at 445.  But the court considered <i>Ring</i> inapplicable in light of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated support of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentencing scheme in pre-<i>Ring </i>cases.  147 So. 3d, at 446\xe2\x80\x93447 (citing <i>Hildwin</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 638 (1989)\n (<i>per curiam</i>)); see also <i>Spaziano</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447\n\xe2\x80\x93465 (1984).

She reiterated her view that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Ring </i>requires any fact that qualifies a capital defendant for a sentence of death to be found by a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 450 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve whether Florida\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentencing scheme violates the\n \nSixth Amendment in light of <i>Ring</i>.  575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).

In <i>Apprendi</i> v. <i>New Jersey</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466,\n494 (2000)\n, this Court held that any fact that \xe2\x80\x9cexpose[s] the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s guilty verdict\xe2\x80\x9d is an \xe2\x80\x9celement\xe2\x80\x9d that must be submitted to a jury.  In the years since <i>Apprendi</i>, we have applied its rule to instances involving plea bargains, <i>Blakely</i> v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296 (2004)\n, sentencing guidelines, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220 (2005)\n, criminal fines, <i>Southern Union Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), mandatory minimums, <i>Alleyne</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, and, in <i>Ring</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 584\n, capital punishment.</p>\n<p>In <i>Ring</i>, we concluded that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentencing scheme violated <i>Apprendi</i>\xe2\x80\x99s rule because the State allowed a judge to find the facts necessary to sentence a defendant to death.  An Arizona jury had convicted Timothy Ring of felony murder.  536 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 591.  Under state law, \xe2\x80\x9cRing could not be sentenced to death, the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder, unless further findings were made.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 592.  Specifically, a judge could sentence Ring to death only after independently finding at least one aggravating circumstance.  <i>Id.</i>, at 592\xe2\x80\x93593.  Ring\xe2\x80\x99s judge followed this procedure, found an aggravating circumstance, and sentenced Ring to death.</p>\n<p>The Court had little difficulty concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the required finding of an aggravated circumstance exposed Ring to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s guilty verdict.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 604 (quoting <i>Apprendi</i>, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 494;<i> </i>alterations omitted).  Had Ring\xe2\x80\x99s judge not engaged in any factfinding, Ring would have received a life sentence.  <i>Ring</i>, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>, </i>at 597.  Ring\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence therefore violated his right to have a jury find the facts behind his punishment.</p>\n<p>The analysis the <i>Ring </i>Court applied to Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing scheme applies equally to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s.  Like Arizona at the time of <i>Ring</i>,<i> </i>Florida does not require the jury to make the critical findings necessary to impose the death penalty.  Rather, Florida requires a judge to find these facts.  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7921.141(3).  Although Florida incorporates an advisory jury verdict that Arizona lacked, we have previously made clear that this distinction is immaterial: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that in Florida the jury recommends a sentence, but it does not make specific factual findings with regard to the existence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances and its recommendation is not binding on the trial judge.  A Florida trial court no more has the assistance of a jury\xe2\x80\x99s findings of fact with respect to sentencing issues than does a trial judge in Arizona.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Walton</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 639,\n648 (1990)\n; accord, <i>State </i>v. <i>Steele</i>, 921 So.\xc2\xa02d 538, 546 (Fla. 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he trial court alone must make detailed findings about the existence and weight of aggravating circumstances; it has no jury findings on which to rely\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>As with Timothy Ring, the maximum punishment Timothy Hurst could have received without any judge-made findings was life in prison without parole.  As with Ring, a judge increased Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s authorized punishment based on her own factfinding.  In light of <i>Ring</i>,<i> </i>we hold that Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s sentence violates the\n \nSixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p>Without contesting <i>Ring</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, Florida offers a bevy of arguments for why Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s sentence is constitutional.  None holds water.</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>Florida concedes that <i>Ring </i>required a jury to find every fact necessary to render Hurst eligible for the death pen-alty.  But Florida argues that when Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing jury recommended a death sentence, it \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily included a finding of an aggravating circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 44.  The State contends that this finding qualified Hurst for the death penalty under Florida law, thus satisfying <i>Ring</i>.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he additional requirement that a judge <i>also</i> find an aggravator,\xe2\x80\x9d Florida concludes, \xe2\x80\x9conly provides the defendant additional protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 22.</p>\n<p>The State fails to appreciate the central and singular role the judge plays under Florida law.  As described above and by the Florida Supreme Court, the Florida sentencing statute does not make a defendant eligible for death until \xe2\x80\x9cfindings <i>by the court</i> that such person shall be punished by death.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7775.082(1) (emphasis added).  The trial court <i>alone</i> must find \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts . . . [t]hat sufficient aggravating circumstances exist\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat there are insufficient mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921.141(3); see <i>Steele</i>, 921 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 546.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he jury\xe2\x80\x99s function under the Florida death penalty statute is advisory only.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Spaziano </i>v. <i>State</i>, 433 So.\xc2\xa02d 508, 512 (Fla. 1983).  The State cannot now treat the advisory recommendation by the jury as the necessary factual finding that <i>Ring</i> requires<i>.</i></p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>Florida launches its second salvo at Hurst himself, arguing that he admitted in various contexts that an aggravating circumstance existed.  Even if <i>Ring </i>normally requires a jury to hear all facts necessary to sentence a defendant to death, Florida argues, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Ring </i>does not require jury findings on facts defendants have admitted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 41.  Florida cites our decision in <i>Blakely</i> v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296 (2004)\n, in which we stated that under <i>Apprendi</i>, a judge may impose any sentence authorized \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 303 (emphasis deleted).

Brief for Respondent 42\xe2\x80\x9344.</p>\n<p><i>Blakely</i>, however, was a decision applying <i>Apprendi</i> to facts admitted in a guilty plea, in which the defendant necessarily waived his right to a jury trial.  See 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310\xe2\x80\x93312.  Florida has not explained how Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s alleged admissions accomplished a similar waiver.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s argument is also meritless on its own terms.  Hurst never admitted to either aggravating circumstance alleged by the State.  At most, his counsel simply refrained from challenging the aggravating circumstances in parts of his appellate briefs.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Initial<i> </i>Brief for Appellant in No. SC12\xe2\x80\x931947 (Fla.), p.\xc2\xa024 (\xe2\x80\x9cnot challeng[ing] the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s findings\xe2\x80\x9d but arguing that death was nevertheless a disproportionate punishment).</p>\n<p>C</p>\n<p>The State next argues that <i>stare decisis </i>compels us to uphold Florida\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentencing scheme.  As the Flor-ida Supreme Court observed, this Court \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly has reviewed and upheld Florida\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentencing statute over the past quarter of a century.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bottoson </i>v. <i>Moore</i>, 833 So.\xc2\xa02d 693, 695 (2002) (<i>per curiam</i>) (citing <i>Hildwin,</i>\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 638\n; <i>Spaziano</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447\n).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn a comparable situation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Florida court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x98If a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the [other courts] should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bottoson</i>, 833 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 695 (quoting <i>Rodriguez de Quijas</i> v. <i>Shearson/American Express, Inc.</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477,\n484 (1989)\n); see also 147 So. 3d, at 446\xe2\x80\x93447 (casebelow).</p>\n<p>We now expressly overrule <i>Spaziano </i>and <i>Hildwin</i> in relevant part.</p>\n<p><i>Spaziano </i>and <i>Hildwin</i> summarized earlier precedent to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nSixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hildwin</i>, 490 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 640\xe2\x80\x93641.  Their conclusion was wrong, and irreconcilable with <i>Apprendi</i>.  Indeed, today is not the first time we have recognized as much.  In <i>Ring</i>, we held that another pre-<i>Apprendi </i>decision\xe2\x80\x94<i>Walton</i>,\n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 639\n\xe2\x80\x94could not \xe2\x80\x9csurvive the reasoning of <i>Apprendi</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 603.  <i>Walton</i>, for its part, was a mere application of <i>Hildwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding to Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentencing scheme.  497 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 648.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthe doctrine of <i>stare decisis </i>is of fundamental importance to the rule of law[,]\xe2\x80\x9d .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

And in the <i>Apprendi </i>context, we have found that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>stare decisis </i>does not compel adherence to a decision whose \xe2\x80\x98underpinnings\xe2\x80\x99 have been \xe2\x80\x98eroded\xe2\x80\x99 by subsequent developments of constitutional law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Alleyne</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Gaudin</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 506\n\xe2\x80\x93520 (1995) (over-ruling <i>Sinclair</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n279 U.\xc2\xa0S. 263 (1929)\n);<i> Ring</i>, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 609 (overruling <i>Walton</i>, 497 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 639);<i> Alleyne</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (overruling <i>Harris </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 545 (2002)\n).</p>\n<p>Time and subsequent cases have washed away the logic of <i>Spaziano </i>and <i>Hildwin</i>.  The decisions are overruled to the extent they allow a sentencing judge to find an aggravating circumstance, independent of a jury\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding, that is necessary for imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p>D</p>\n<p>Finally, we do not reach the State\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that any error was harmless.  See <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9319 (1999) (holding that the failure to submit an uncontested element of an offense to a jury may be harmless).  This Court normally leaves it to state courts to consider whether an error is harmless, and we see no reason to depart from that pattern here.  See <i>Ring</i>, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 609, n.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p>The\n \nSixth Amendment protects a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to an impartial jury.

And as the Court also concedes, our precedents hold that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the\n \nSixth Amendment <i>does not</i> require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 9 (quoting <i>Hildwin </i>v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 638\n\xe2\x80\x93641 (1989) (<i>per curiam</i>); emphasis added); see also <i>Spaziano</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447,\n460 (1984)\n.  The Court now reverses course, striking down Florida\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentencing system, overruling our decisions in <i>Hildwin </i>and <i>Spaziano</i>, and holding that the\n \nSixth Amendment <i>does</i> require that the specific findings authorizing a sentence of death be made by a jury.  I disagree.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">First, I would not overrule <i>Hildwin</i> and <i>Spaziano</i> without reconsidering the cases on which the Court\xe2\x80\x99s present decision is based.  The Court relies on later cases holding that any fact that exposes a defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s guilty verdict is an element of the offense that must be submitted to a jury.  <i>Ante</i>, at 5.  But there are strong reasons to question whether this principle is consistent with the original understanding of the jury trial right.  See <i>Alleyne</i> v.<i> United States</i>, 570 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2013) (Alito, J., dissent-ing) (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932).  Before overruling <i>Hildwin </i>and<i> Spaziano</i>, I would reconsider the cases, including most prominently <i>Ring</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 584 (2002)\n, on which the Court now relies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, even if <i>Ring</i> is assumed to be correct, I would not extend it.  Although the Court suggests that today\xe2\x80\x99s holding follows ineluctably from <i>Ring</i>, the Arizona sentencing scheme at issue in that case was much different from the Florida procedure now before us.  In <i>Ring</i>, the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder and did no more.  It did not make the findings required by the\n \nEighth Amendment before the death penalty may be imposed in a felony-murder case.  See <i>id.</i>, at 591\xe2\x80\x93592, 594; <i>Enmund</i> v.<i> Florida</i>,\n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 782 (1982)\n; <i>Tison</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137 (1987)\n.  Nor did the jury find the presence of any aggravating factor, as required for death eligibility under Arizona law.  <i>Ring</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 592\xe2\x80\x93593.  Nor did it consider mitigating factors.  And it did not determine whether a capital or noncapital sentence was appropriate.  Under that system, the jury played <i>no</i> role in the capital sentencing process.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Florida system is quite different.  In Florida, the jury sits as the initial and primary adjudicator of the factors bearing on the death penalty.  After unanimously determining guilt at trial, a Florida jury hears evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  See Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7921.141(1) (2010).  At the conclusion of this separate sentencing hearing, the jury may recommend a death sentence only if it finds that the State has proved one or more aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and only after weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors.  \xc2\xa7921.141(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Once the jury has made this decision, the trial court performs what amounts, in practical terms, to a reviewing function.  The judge duplicates the steps previously performed by the jury and, while the court can impose a sentence different from that recommended by the jury, the judge must accord the jury\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation \xe2\x80\x9cgreat weight.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Lambrix</i> v. <i>Singletary</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 518\n\xe2\x80\x93526 (1997) (recounting Florida law and procedure).  Indeed, if the jury recommends a life sentence, the judge may override that decision only if \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts suggesting a sentence of death were so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tedder</i> v.<i> State</i>, 322 So.\xc2\xa02d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975) (<i>per curiam</i>).  No Florida trial court has overruled a jury\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation of a life sentence for more than 15 years.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under the Florida system, the jury plays a critically important role.  Our decision in <i>Ring</i> did not decide whether this procedure violates the\n \nSixth Amendment, and I would not extend <i>Ring</i> to cover the Florida system.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, even if there was a constitutional violation in this case, I would hold that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See <i>Chapman </i>v. <i>California</i>,\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S.  18,\n24 (1967)\n.  Although petitioner attacks the Florida system on numerous grounds, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is based on a single perceived defect, <i>i.e.</i>, that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination that at least one aggravating factor was proved is not binding on the trial judge.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.  The Court makes no pretense that this supposed defect could have prejudiced petitioner, and it seems very clear that it did not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Attempting to show that he might have been prejudiced by the error, petitioner suggests that the jury might not have found the existence of an aggravating factor had it been instructed that its finding was a prerequisite for the imposition of the death penalty, but this suggestion is hard to credit.  The jury was told to consider two aggravating factors: that the murder was committed during the course of a robbery and that it was especially \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 212.  The evidence in support of both factors was overwhelming.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The evidence with regard to the first aggravating factor\xe2\x80\x94that the murder occurred during the commission of a robbery\xe2\x80\x94was as follows.  The victim, Cynthia Harrison, an assistant manager of a Popeye\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant, arrived at work between 7 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. on the date of her death.  When other employees entered the store at about 10:30 a.m., they found that she had been stabbed to death and that the restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s safe was open and the previous day\xe2\x80\x99s receipts were missing.  At trial, the issue was whether Hurst committed the murder.  There was no suggestion that the murder did not occur during the robbery.  Any alternative scenario\xe2\x80\x94for example, that Cynthia Harrison was first murdered by one person for somereason other than robbery and that a second personcame upon the scene shortly after the murder and somehow gained access to and emptied the Popeye\xe2\x80\x99s safe\xe2\x80\x94is fanciful.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The evidence concerning the second aggravating factor\xe2\x80\x94that the murder was especially \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was also overwhelming.  Cynthia Harrison was bound, gagged, and stabbed more than 60 times.  Her injuries included \xe2\x80\x9cfacial cuts that went all the way down to the underlying bone,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccuts through the eyelid region\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe top of her lip,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca large cut to her neck which almost severed her trachea.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 261.  It was estimated that death could have taken as long as 15 minutes to occur.  The trial court characterized the manner of her death as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cThe utter terror and pain that Ms. Harrison likely experienced during the incident is unfathomable.  Words are inadequate to describe this death, but the photographs introduced as evidence depict a person bound, rendered helpless, and brutally, savagely, and unmercifully slashed and disfigured.  The murder of Ms. Harrison was conscienceless, pitiless, and unnecessarily torturous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 261\xe2\x80\x93262.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of this evidence, it defies belief to suggest that the jury would not have found the existence of either aggravating factor if its finding was binding.  More than 17 years have passed since Cynthia Harrison was brutally murdered.  In the interest of bringing this protracted litigation to a close, I would rule on the issue of harmless error and would affirm the decision of the Florida Supreme Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
