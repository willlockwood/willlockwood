The tract is situate within the exterior boundaries of a larger one, known as the "Costilla estate," which was severed from the "Sangre de Cristo grant."  The latter is known and designated as "claim No. 14 of Charles Beaubien," in the letter of the Secretary of the Interior to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, bearing date Feb. 11, 1857.  With that claim were transmitted copies of the grant, order of prefect\'s court, notice of claim, deed of administrator, testimony, and report.</p>\n<p>The case was submitted to the district court on the following agreed statement of facts:</p>\n<p>The piece or parcel of land described in the plaintiff\'s declaration, and for the possession of which the plaintiff brings this suit, is now, and at the time of the commencement of this suit was, situate, lying, and being in the County of Costilla, in the Territory of Colorado, and, at the time of the commencement of this suit, and for a long time prior thereto, was in the actual possession of the said defendant, who, before the commencement of said suit, has made valuable improvements thereon.</p>\n<p>The said piece or parcel of land is within the exterior boundaries of and forms a part of a larger tract or parcel of land claimed by the plaintiff in fee simple, and known as the "Costilla estate," which said estate is bounded as follows, <em>viz.:</em></p>\n<p>"Beginning at a point one league below the confluence of the Rio Costilla and the Rio del Norte; thence up the Rio del Norte, on the eastern bank thereof, to its confluence with the Rio Culebra; thence easterly, following the southern bank of the Rio Culebra, to a point at or near the junction of the Rio Seco with the Rio Culebra; thence easterly to the Culebra Peaks; thence southerly to the boundary of the lands of Miranda and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="645">Page 93 U.

The signature of the clerk of the probate court, attached to a transcript of the record of the court ordering the sale of the property of Stephen L. Lee, deceased, is also proved to be genuine.  It is also proven that Stephen L. Lee and Luis Lee, assigned in the original petition, were one and the same individual, and that Narciso Beaubien, the son of Charles Beaubien, the present claimant, died without issue.  The testimony also shows that the land has been occupied from the time the grant was made up to the present day."</p>\n<p>"The supreme authorities of the remote province of New Spain, afterwards the Republic of Mexico, exercised from time immemorial certain prerogatives and powers, which, although not positively sanctioned by congressional enactments, were universally conceded by the Spanish and Mexican governments, and there being no evidence that these prerogatives and powers were revoked or repealed by the supreme authorities, it is to be presumed that the exercise of them was lawful.

The said Charles Beaubien, the present claimant and actual owner, claims a perfect title to said lands by virtue of a grant made on the thirtieth day of December, A.D. 1843, by Manuel Armijo, Governor of the Department of New Mexico, and perfected according to law by possession being given by the alcalde, Jose Miguel Sanchez, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 93 U.

S. 661</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. It was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory, and Tameling sued out this writ of error.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DAVIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The determination of this case depends upon the effect of the Act of Congress "to confirm certain private land claims in the Territory of New Mexico," approved June 21, 1860.  12 Stat. 71.  Did the act confirm the Sangre de Cristo grant to the extent of the exterior boundaries of the claim?  If it did, the judgment below must be affirmed.  If it did not, inasmuch as no specific portion of the land within those boundaries was severed from the remainder and confirmed to the claimant, the plaintiff below, who derives title under him, has not shown a right to the demanded premises, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p>We have repeatedly held that individual rights of property, in the territory acquired by the United States from Mexico, were not affected by the change of sovereignty and jurisdiction.  They were entitled to protection, whether the party had the full and absolute ownership of the land or merely an equitable interest therein, which required some further act of the government to vest in him a perfect title.  The duty of providing the mode of securing them and fulfilling the obligations which the treaty of cession imposed, was within the appropriate province of the political department of the government.  In discharging it, Congress required that all titles to real property in California, whether inchoate or consummate, should undergo judicial examination.  If a party failed to avail himself within a prescribed time of the provisions of the act of March 3, 1851, and prosecute his claim thereunder, it was completely barred, and the land covered by it reverted to the public domain.  The California land claims disposed of in this Court were asserted in a direct proceeding against the United States.  It became our duty, as it had been that of the board of commissioners and of the district court, to decide on their validity, upon the documentary and other evidence incorporated in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="662">Page 93 U. S. 662</a></p><p> record.  We were required to be governed by Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the law of nations, the laws, usages, and customs of the government from which the claim was derived, the principles of equity, and the decisions of this Court, as far as they were applicable.  Were we now exercising appellate jurisdiction over the proceedings of a court or officer specially appointed to determine the validity and extent of the grant in question, it would be our duty to either affirm or reverse the decision, pursuant to the rules prescribed for our guidance.  But Congress legislated otherwise for the adjustment of land claims in New Mexico.  By the eighth section of the act of 1854, 10 Stat. 308, the duty of ascertaining their origin, nature, character, and extent was expressly enjoined upon the surveyor general of that territory.  He was empowered for that purpose to issue notices, summon witnesses, administer oaths, and perform all necessary acts in the premises.  He was directed to make a full report, with his decision, as to the validity or invalidity of each claim, under the laws, usages, and customs of the country before its cession to the United States.  That report, according to a form to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, was to be laid before Congress for such action as might be deemed just and proper.</p>\n<p>It will thus be seen that the modes for the determination of land claims of Spanish or Mexican origin were radically different.  Where they embraced lands in California, a procedure, essentially judicial in its character, was provided, with the right of ultimate appeal by either the claimant or the United States to this Court.  No jurisdiction over such claims in New Mexico was conferred upon the courts, but the surveyor general, in the exercise of the authority with which he was invested, decides them in the first instance.  The final action on each claim reserved to Congress, is, of course, conclusive, and therefore not subject to review in this or any other forum.</p>\n<p>It is obviously not the duty of this Court to sit in judgment upon either the recital of matters of fact by the surveyor general, or his decision declaring the validity of the grant.  They are embodied in his report, which was laid before Congress for its consideration and action.  We need only say that he distinctly sets forth that Luis Lee and Narciso Beaubien, Sept. 27, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="663">Page 93 U. S. 663</a></p><p> 1843, petitioned the then civil and military governor of New Mexico</p>\n<p>"for a grant of land in what is now the County of Taos, embracing the Costilla, Culebra, and Trinchera Rivers, including the Rito of the Indians, and Sangre de Cristo to its junction with the Del Norte River;"</p>\n<p>that the petition was referred by the governor to the prefect, with instructions to give the possession asked for by the petitioners; that they were put in possession with the boundaries contained in the petition, "vesting in them, their children and successors, a title in fee to said lands."  After stating that, by the death of one of the grantees, his heir-at-law, Charles Beaubien, inherited the undivided half of the land, and that he acquired the remainder from the administrator of the other grantee, the surveyor general reaches the conclusion that the grant is a good and valid one, and that a legal title vests in Charles Beaubien to the land embraced within the limits contained in the petition.  The grant was approved, and recommended for confirmation by Congress.</p>\n<p>Congress acted upon the claim "as recommended for confirmation by the surveyor general."  The confirmation being absolute and unconditional, without any limitation as to quantity, we must regard it as effectual and operative for the entire tract.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff in error insists that, under the Mexican colonization laws in force when the grant was made, not more than eleven square leagues for each petitioner could be lawfully granted.  As there were in the present instance but two petitioners, and the land within the boundaries in question is largely in excess of that quantity, the invalidity of the grant has been earnestly and elaborately pressed upon our attention.  This was matter for the consideration of Congress, and we deem ourselves concluded by the action of that body.  The phraseology of the confirmatory act is, in our opinion, explicit and unequivocal.
