Without notice that a course of training is deficient, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause violations of constitutional rights.  Thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern of similar <em>Brady</em> violations, and four reversals by Louisiana courts for dissimilar<font b="1" i="1"> <em>Brady</em> violations in the 10 years before the robbery trial could not have put the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office on notice of the need for specific training.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9310.</font></p><font b="1" i="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Thompson mistakenly relies on the \xe2\x80\x9csingle-incident\xe2\x80\x9d liability hypothesized in <em>Canton</em>, contending that the <em>Brady</em> violation in his case was the \xe2\x80\x9cobvious\xe2\x80\x9d consequence of failing to provide specific <em>Brady</em> training and that this \xe2\x80\x9cobviousness\xe2\x80\x9d showing can substitute for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability.  In <em>Canton</em>, the Court theorized that if a city armed its police force and deployed them into the public to capture fleeing felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly force, the failure to train could reflect the city\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence, namely, violations of constitutional rights.  Failure to train prosecutors in their <em>Brady </em>obligations does not fall within the narrow range of <em>Canton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s hypothesized single-incident liability.  The obvious need for specific legal training present in <em>Canton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>scenario\xe2\x80\x94police academy applicants are unlikely to be familiar with constitutional constraints on deadly force and, absent training, cannot obtain that knowledge\xe2\x80\x94is absent here.  Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment.  They receive training before entering the profession, must usually satisfy continuing education requirements, often train on the job with more experienced attorneys, and must satisfy licensing standards and ongoing ethical obligations.  Prosecutors not only are equipped but are ethically bound to know what <em>Brady </em>entails and to perform legal research when they are uncertain.  Thus, recurring constitutional violations are not the \xe2\x80\x9cobvious consequence\xe2\x80\x9d of failing to provide prosecutors with formal in-house training.  The nuance of the allegedly necessary training also distinguishes the case from the example in <em>Canton</em>.  Here, the prosecutors were familiar with the general <em>Brady</em> rule.  Thus, Thompson cannot rely on the lack of an ability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies the <em>Canton</em> hypothetical, but must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular <em>Brady</em> evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.  That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate indifference here.  Contrary to the holding below, it does not follow that, because <em>Brady</em> has gray areas and some <em>Brady </em>decisions are difficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them amounts, as it must, to \xe2\x80\x9ca decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Canton,</em> 489 U.

S. 83</a> (1963).  Thompson was convicted.  Because of that conviction Thompson elected not to testify in his own defense in his later trial for murder, and he was again convicted.  Thompson spent 18 years in prison, including 14 years on death row.  One month before Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled execution, his investigator discovered the undisclosed evidence from his armed robbery trial.  The reviewing court determined that the evidence was exculpatory, and both of Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s convictions were vacated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After his release from prison, Thompson sued petitioner Harry Connick, in his official capacity as the Orleans Parish District Attorney, for damages under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  Thompson alleged that Connick had failed to train his prosecutors adequately about their duty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of training had caused the nondisclosure in Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s rob-bery case.  The jury awarded Thompson $14 million, \nand the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by an evenly divided en banc<em> </em>court.  We granted certiorari to decide whether a district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office may be held liable under \xc2\xa71983 for failure to train based on a single <em>Brady</em> violation.  We hold that it cannot.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In early 1985, John Thompson was charged with the murder of Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr. in New Orleans.  Publicity following the murder charge led the victims of an unrelated armed robbery to identify Thompson as their attacker. The district attorney charged Thompson with attempted armed robbery.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As part of the robbery investigation, a crime scene technician took from one of the victims\xe2\x80\x99 pants a swatch of fabric stained with the robber\xe2\x80\x99s blood.  Approximately one week before Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s armed robbery trial, the swatch was sent to the crime laboratory.  Two days before the trial, assistant district attorney Bruce Whittaker received the crime lab\xe2\x80\x99s report, which stated that the perpetrator had blood type B.  There is no evidence that the prosecutors ever had Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s blood tested or that they knew what his blood type was.  Whittaker claimed he placed the report on assistant district attorney James Williams\xe2\x80\x99 desk, but Williams denied seeing it.  The report was never disclosed to Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Williams tried the armed robbery case with assistant district attorney Gerry Deegan.  On the first day of trial, Deegan checked all of the physical evidence in the case out of the police property room, including the blood-stained swatch.  Deegan then checked all of the evidence but the swatch into the courthouse property room.  The prosecutors did not mention the swatch or the crime lab report at trial, and the jury convicted Thompson of attempted armed robbery.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few weeks later, Williams and special prosecutor Eric Dubelier tried Thompson for the Liuzza murder.  Because of the armed robbery conviction, Thompson chose not to testify in his own defense.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  <em>State</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, 516 So.\xc2\xa02d 349 (La. 1987).  In the 14 years following Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s murder conviction, state and federal courts reviewed and denied his challenges to the conviction and sentence.  See <em>State ex rel. Thompson</em> v. <em>Cain</em>, 95\xe2\x80\x932463 (La. 4/25/96), 672 So.\xc2\xa02d 906; <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>Cain</em>, 161 F.\xc2\xa03d 802 (CA5 1998).  The State scheduled Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s execution for May 20, 1999.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In late April 1999, Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s private investigator discovered the crime lab report from the armed robbery investigation in the files of the New Orleans Police Crime Laboratory.  Thompson was tested and found to have blood type O, proving that the blood on the swatch was not his.  Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys presented this evidence to the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, which, in turn, moved to stay the execution and vacate Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s armed robbery conviction.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Louisiana Court of Appeals then reversed Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s murder conviction, concluding that the armed robbery conviction unconstitutionally deprived Thompson of his right to testify in his own defense at the murder trial.  <em>State</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, 2002\xe2\x80\x930361 (La. App. 7/17/02), 825 So.\xc2\xa02d 552.  In 2003, the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office retried Thompson for Liuzza\xe2\x80\x99s murder.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The jury found him not guilty.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompson then brought this action against the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, Connick, Williams, and others, alleging that their conduct caused him to be wrongfully convicted, incarcerated for 18 years, and nearly executed.  The only claim that proceeded to trial was Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s claim under \xc2\xa71983 that the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office had violated <em>Brady </em>by failing to disclose the crime lab report in his armed robbery trial.  See <em>Brady</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a>.  Thompson alleged liability under two theories: (1)\xc2\xa0the <em>Brady</em> violation was caused by an unconstitutional policy of the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office; and (2)\xc2\xa0the violation was caused by Connick\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train the prosecutors in his office in order to avoid such constitutional violations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before trial, Connick conceded that the failure to produce the crime lab report constituted a <em>Brady </em>violation.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  See Record EX608, EX880.  Accordingly, the District Court instructed the jury that the \xe2\x80\x9conly issue\xe2\x80\x9d was whether the nondisclosure was caused by either a policy, practice, or custom of the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office or a deliberately indifferent failure to train the office\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutors.  Record 1615.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although no prosecutor remembered any specific training session regarding <em>Brady </em>prior to 1985, it was undisputed at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the general <em>Brady </em>requirement that the State disclose to the defense evidence in its possession that is favorable to \nthe accused.  Prosecutors testified that office policy was to turn crime lab reports and other scientific evidence over \nto the defense.  They also testified that, after the discovery of the undisclosed crime lab report in 1999, prosecutors disagreed about whether it had to be disclosed under <em>Brady </em>absent knowledge of Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s blood type.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury rejected Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s claim that an unconstitutional office policy caused the <em>Brady </em>violation, but found the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office liable for failing to train the prosecutors.  The jury awarded Thompson $14 million in damages, and the District Court added more than $1 million in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the verdict, Connick renewed his objection\xe2\x80\x94which he had raised on summary judgment\xe2\x80\x94that he could not have been deliberately indifferent to an obvious need for more or different <em>Brady </em>training because there was no evidence that he was aware of a pattern of similar <em>Brady </em>violations.  The District Court rejected this argument for the reasons that it had given in the summary judgment order.  In that order, the court had concluded that a pattern of violations is not necessary to prove deliberate indifference when the need for training is \xe2\x80\x9cso obvious.\xe2\x80\x9d  No. Civ. A. 03\xe2\x80\x932045 (ED La., Nov. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005 WL 3541035, *13.

S. 378</a> (1989),<em> </em>the court had held that Thompson could demonstrate deliberate indifference by proving that \xe2\x80\x9cthe DA\xe2\x80\x99s office knew to a moral certainty that assistan[t] [district attorneys] would acquire <em>Brady</em> material, that without training it is not always obvious what <em>Brady</em> requires, and that withholding <em>Brady</em> material will virtually always lead to a substantial violation of constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005 WL 3541035, *13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  The panel acknowledged that Thompson did not present evidence of a pattern of similar <em>Brady </em>violations, 553 F.\xc2\xa03d 836, 851 (2008), but held that Thompson did not need to prove a pattern, <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 854.  According to the panel, Thompson demonstrated that Connick was on notice of an obvious need for <em>Brady</em> training by presenting evidence \xe2\x80\x9cthat attorneys, often fresh out of law school, would undoubtedly be required to confront <em>Brady</em> issues while at the DA\xe2\x80\x99s Office, that erroneous decisions regarding <em>Brady</em> evidence would result in serious constitutional violations, that resolution of <em>Brady</em> issues was often unclear, and that training in <em>Brady</em> would have been helpful.\xe2\x80\x9d  553 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 854<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals sitting en banc vacated the panel opinion, granted rehearing, and divided evenly, thereby affirming the District Court.  578 F.\xc2\xa03d 293 (CA5 2009) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  In four opinions, the divided en banc court disputed whether Thompson could establish municipal liability for failure to train the prosecutors based on the single <em>Brady </em>violation without proving a prior pattern of similar violations, and, if so, what evidence would make that showing.  We granted certiorari.  559 U. S. ___ (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Brady </em>violation conceded in this case occurred when one or more of the four prosecutors involved with Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the crime lab report to Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.  Under Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s failure-to-train theory, he bore the burden of proving both (1) that Connick, the policymaker for the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the prosecutors about their <em>Brady </em>disclosure obligation with respect to evidence of this type and (2) that the lack of training actually caused the <em>Brady </em>violation in this case.  Connick argues that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Thompson did not prove that he was on actual or constructive notice of, and therefore deliberately indifferent to, a need for more or different <em>Brady </em>training.

None of those cases involved failure to disclose blood evidence, a crime lab report, or physical or scientific evidence of any kind.

He contends that the <em>Brady </em>violation in his case was the \xe2\x80\x9cobvious\xe2\x80\x9d consequence of failing to provide specific <em>Brady</em> training, and that this showing of \xe2\x80\x9cobviousness\xe2\x80\x9d can substitute for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Canton</em>, the Court left open the possibility that, \xe2\x80\x9cin a narrow range of circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d a pattern of similar violations might not be necessary to show deliberate indifference.  <em>Bryan Cty.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 409.  The Court posed the hypothetical example of a city that arms its police force with firearms and deploys the armed officers into the public to capture fleeing felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly force.  <em>Canton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 390, n.\xc2\xa010.  Given the known frequency with which police attempt to arrest fleeing felons and the \xe2\x80\x9cpredictability that an officer lacking specific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens\xe2\x80\x99 rights,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court theorized that a city\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to train the officers about constitutional limits on the use of deadly force could reflect the city\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate indifference to the \xe2\x80\x9chighly predictable consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, violations of constitutional rights.  <em>Bryan Cty.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 409.  The Court sought not to foreclose the possibility, however rare, that the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train could be so patently obvious that a city could be liable under \xc2\xa71983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of violations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Failure to train prosecutors in their <em>Brady </em>obligations does not fall within the narrow range of <em>Canton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s hypothesized single-incident liability.  The obvious need for specific legal training that was present in the <em>Canton </em>scenario is absent here.  Armed police must sometimes make split-second decisions with life-or-death consequences.  There is no reason to assume that police academy applicants are familiar with the constitutional constraints on the use of deadly force.  And, in the absence of training, there is no way for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they require.  Under those circumstances there is an obvious need for some form of training.  In stark contrast, legal \xe2\x80\x9c[t]raining is what differentiates attorneys from average public employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  578 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 304\xe2\x80\x93305 (opinion of Clement, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment.  Before they may enter the profession and receive a law license, all attorneys must graduate from law school or pass a substantive examination; attorneys in the vast majority of jurisdictions must do both.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, La. State Bar Assn. (LSBA), Articles of Incorporation, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa737, ch. 4, App., Art. 14, \xc2\xa77 (1988 West Supp.) (as amended through 1985).  These threshold requirements are designed to ensure that all new attorneys have learned how to find, understand, and apply legal rules.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cronic</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/648/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/648/index.html">466 U. S. 648</a>, 658, 664 (1984) (noting that the presumption \xe2\x80\x9cthat the lawyer is competent to provide the guiding hand that the defendant needs\xe2\x80\x9d applies even to young and inexperienced lawyers in their first jury trial and even when the case is complex).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does professional training end at graduation.  Most jurisdictions require attorneys to satisfy continuing-education requirements.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, Rule 1.1(b) (effective 1987); La. Sup. Ct. Rule XXX (effective 1988).  Even those few jurisdictions that do not impose mandatory continuing-education requirements mandate that attorneys represent their clients competently and encourage attorneys to engage in continuing study and education.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mass. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.1 and comment 6 (West 2006).  Before Louisiana adopted continuing-education requirements, it imposed similar general competency requirements on its state bar.  LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 1\xe2\x80\x931, 1\xe2\x80\x932, DR 6\xe2\x80\x93101 (West 1974) (effective 1971).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Attorneys who practice with other attorneys, such as in district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s offices, also train on the job as they learn from more experienced attorneys.  For instance, here in the Orleans Parish District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office, junior prosecutors were trained by senior prosecutors who supervised them as they worked together to prepare cases for trial, and trial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.  Senior attorneys also circulated court decisions and instructional memoranda to keep the prosecutors abreast of relevant legal developments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy character and fitness standards to receive a law license and are personally subject to an ethical regime designed to reinforce the profession\xe2\x80\x99s standards.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 14, \xc2\xa77 (1985); see generally <em>id.</em>, Art. 16 (1971) (Code of Professional Responsibility).  Trial lawyers have a \xe2\x80\x9cduty to bring to bear such skill and knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial testing process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, 688 (1984).  Prosecutors have a special \xe2\x80\x9cduty to seek justice, not merely to convict.\xe2\x80\x9d  LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 7\xe2\x80\x9313 (1971); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 3\xe2\x80\x931.1(c) (2d ed. 1980).  Among prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 unique ethical obligations is the duty to produce <em>Brady </em>evidence to the defense.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 7\xe2\x80\x9313 (1971); ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct 3.8(d) (1984).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  An attorney who violates his or her ethical obligations is subject to professional discipline, including sanctions, suspension, and disbarment.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 15, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75, 6 (1971); <em>id.</em>, Art. 16, DR 1\xe2\x80\x93102; ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct 8.4 (1984).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this regime of legal training and professional responsibility, recurring constitutional violations are not the \xe2\x80\x9cobvious consequence\xe2\x80\x9d of failing to provide prosecutors with formal in-house training about how to obey the law.  <em>Bryan Cty.</em>, 520 U. S., at 409.  Prosecutors are not only equipped but are also ethically bound to know what <em>Brady </em>entails and to perform legal research when they are uncertain.  A district attorney is entitled to rely on prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 professional training and ethical obligations in the absence of specific reason, such as a pattern of violations, to believe that those tools are insufficient to prevent future constitutional violations in \xe2\x80\x9cthe usual and recurring situations with which [the prosecutors] must deal.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  <em>Canton</em>, 489 U. S., at 391.  A licensed attorney making legal judgments, in his capacity as a prosecutor, about <em>Brady </em>material simply does not present the same \xe2\x80\x9chighly predictable\xe2\x80\x9d constitutional danger as <em>Canton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s untrained officer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A second significant difference between this case and the example in <em>Canton</em> is the nuance of the allegedly necessary training.  The <em>Canton </em>hypothetical assumes that the armed police officers have no knowledge at all of the constitutional limits on the use of deadly force.  But it is undisputed here that the prosecutors in Connick\xe2\x80\x99s office were familiar with the general <em>Brady </em>rule.  Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s complaint therefore cannot rely on the utter lack of an ability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies the <em>Canton </em>hypothetical, but rather must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular <em>Brady </em>evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.  That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate indifference here.  As the Court said in <em>Canton</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n virtually every instance where a person has had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city employee, a \xc2\xa71983 plaintiff will be able to point to something the city \xe2\x80\x98could have done\xe2\x80\x99 to prevent the unfortunate incident.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U. S., at 392 (citing <em>Tuttle</em>, 471 U. S., at 823 (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompson suggests that the absence of any <em>formal</em> training sessions about <em>Brady </em>is equivalent to the complete absence of legal training that the Court imagined in <em>Canton</em>.  But failure-to-train liability is concerned with the substance of the training, not the particular instructional format.  The statute does not provide plaintiffs or courts <em>carte blanche</em> to micromanage local governments throughout the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not assume that prosecutors will always make correct <em>Brady </em>decisions or that guidance regarding specific <em>Brady</em> questions would not assist prosecutors.  But showing merely that additional training would have been \nhelpful in making difficult decisions does not establish municipal liability.  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]rov[ing] that an injury or accident could have been avoided if an [employee] had had better or more training, sufficient to equip him to avoid the particular injury-causing conduct\xe2\x80\x9d will not suffice.  <em>Canton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 391.  The possibility of single-incident liability that the Court left open in <em>Canton</em> is not this case.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent rejects our holding that <em>Canton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s hypothesized single-incident liability does not, as a legal matter, encompass failure to train prosecutors in their <em>Brady </em>obligation.  It would instead apply the <em>Canton </em>hypothetical to this case, and thus devotes almost all of its opinion to explaining why the evidence supports liability under that theory.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  But the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to address our holding\xe2\x80\x94by pointing out that not all prosecutors will necessarily have enrolled in criminal procedure class\xe2\x80\x94misses the point.  See <em>post</em>, at 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  The reason why the <em>Canton </em>hypothetical is inapplicable is that attorneys, unlike police officers, are equipped with the tools to find, interpret, and apply legal principles.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the end of its opinion, however, the dissent finally reveals that its real disagreement is not with our holding today, but with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  The dissent does not see \xe2\x80\x9cany reason,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 31, for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in <em>Bryan County</em> that a pattern of violations is \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to demonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train, 520 U.

As our precedent makes clear, proving that a municipality itself actually caused a constitutional violation by failing to train the offending employee presents \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult problems of proof,\xe2\x80\x9d and we must adhere to a \xe2\x80\x9cstringent standard of fault,\xe2\x80\x9d lest municipal liability under \xc2\xa71983 collapse into <em>respondeat superior</em>.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  <em>Bryan County</em>, 520 U.

They based this conclusion on Connick\xe2\x80\x99s awareness that (1)\xc2\xa0prosecutors would confront <em>Brady</em> issues while at the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office; (2)\xc2\xa0inexperienced prosecutors were expected to understand <em>Brady</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements; (3)\xc2\xa0<em>Brady </em>has gray areas that make for difficult choices; and (4)\xc2\xa0erroneous decisions regarding <em>Brady </em>evidence would result in constitutional violations.  553 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 854; App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005 WL 3541035, *13.  This is insufficient.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It does not follow that, because <em>Brady</em> has gray areas and some <em>Brady </em>decisions are difficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them amounts to \xe2\x80\x9ca decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Canton</em>, 489 U. S., at 395 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  To prove deliberate indifference, Thompson needed to show that Connick was on notice that, absent additional specified training, it was \xe2\x80\x9chighly predictable\xe2\x80\x9d that the prosecutors in his office would be confounded by those gray areas and make incorrect <em>Brady </em>decisions as a result.  In fact, Thompson had to show that it was <em>so </em>predictable that failing to train the prosecutors amounted to <em>conscious disregard</em> for defendants\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Brady</em> rights.  See <em>Bryan Cty.</em>, 520 U. S., at 409; <em>Canton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 389.

I write separately only to address several aspects of the dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy excavation of the trial record is a puzzling exertion.  The question presented for our review is whether a municipality is liable for a single <em>Brady</em> violation by one of its prosecutors, even though no pattern or practice of prior violations put the municipality on notice of a need for specific training that would have prevented it.  See <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963).  That question is a legal one: whether a <em>Brady</em> violation presents one of those rare circumstances we hypothesized in <em>Canton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s footnote 10, in which the need for training in constitutional requirements is so obvious <em>ex ante</em> that the municipality\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide that training amounts \nto deliberate indifference to constitutional violations.  See <em>Canton</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/378/index.html">489 U. S. 378</a>, 390, n.\xc2\xa010 (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent defers consideration of this question until page 23 of its opinion.  It first devotes considerable space to allegations that Connick\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutors misunderstood <em>Brady</em> when asked about it at trial, see <em>post</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.), and to supposed gaps in the <em>Brady</em> guidance provided by Connick\xe2\x80\x99s office to prosecutors, including deficiencies (unrelated to the specific <em>Brady</em> violation at issue in this case) in a policy manual published by Connick\xe2\x80\x99s office three years after Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s trial, see <em>post</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9321.  None of that is relevant.  Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s failure-to-train theory at trial was not based on a pervasive culture of indifference to <em>Brady</em>, but rather on the inevitability of mistakes over enough iterations of criminal trials.  The District Court instructed the jury it could find Connick deliberately indifferent if:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cFirst: The District Attorney was certain that prosecutors would confront the situation where they would have to decide which evidence was required by the constitution to be provided to an accused[;]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond: The situation involved a difficult choice, or one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling, such that additional training, supervision, or monitoring was clearly needed[; and]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThird: The wrong choice by a prosecutor in that situation will frequently cause a deprivation of an accused\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 828.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That theory of deliberate indifference would repeal the law of <em>Monell[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</em> in favor of the Law of Large Numbers.  <em>Brady</em> mistakes are inevitable.  So are all species of error routinely confronted by prosecutors: authorizing a bad warrant; losing a <em>Batson[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</em> claim; crossing the line in closing argument; or eliciting hearsay that violates the Confrontation Clause.  Nevertheless, we do not have \xe2\x80\x9c<em>de facto respondeat superior</em> liability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Canton</em>, 489 U. S., at 392, for each such violation under the rubric of failure-to-train simply because the municipality does not have a professional educational program covering the specific violation in sufficient depth.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Were Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s theory the law, there would have been no need for <em>Canton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s footnote to confine its hypothetical to the extreme circumstance of arming police officers with guns without telling them about the constitutional limitations upon shooting fleeing felons; the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions cover every recurring situation in which citizens\xe2\x80\x99 rights can be violated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That result cannot be squared with our admonition that failure-to-train liability is available only in \xe2\x80\x9climited circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 387, and that a pattern of consti-tutional violations is \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability and causation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Board of Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Bryan Cty.</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/397/index.html">520 U. S. 397</a>, 409 (1997).  These restrictions are indispensable because without them, \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to train\xe2\x80\x9d would become a talismanic incantation producing municipal liability \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n virtually every instance where a person has had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city employee\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which is what <em>Monell</em> rejects.  <em>Canton</em>, 489 U. S., at 392.  Worse, it would \xe2\x80\x9cengage the federal courts in an endless exercise of second-guessing municipal employee-training programs,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby diminishing the autonomy of state and local governments.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.  Perhaps for that reason, the dissent does not seriously contend that Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s theory of recovery was proper.  Rather, it accuses Connick of acquiescing in that theory at trial.  See <em>post</em>, at 25.  The accusation is false.  Connick\xe2\x80\x99s central claim was and is that failure-to-train liability for a <em>Brady </em>violation cannot be premised on a single incident, but requires a pattern or practice of previous violations.  He pressed that argument at the summary judgment stage but was rebuffed.  At trial, when Connick offered a jury instruction to the same effect, the trial judge effectively told him to stop bringing up the subject:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[Connick\xe2\x80\x99s counsel]: Also, as part of that definition in that same location, Your Honor, we would like to include language that says that deliberate indifference to training requires a pattern of similar violations and proof of deliberate indifference requires more than a single isolated act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel]: That\xe2\x80\x99s not the law, Your Honor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not giving that.  That was in your motion for summary judgment that I denied.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 1013.</p>\n<p align="left">\nNothing more is required to preserve a claim of error.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 51(d)(1)(B).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.  But in any event, to recover from a municipality under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, a plaintiff must satisfy a \xe2\x80\x9crigorous\xe2\x80\x9d standard of causation, <em>Bryan Cty.</em>, 520 U. S., at 405; he must \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 404.  Thompson cannot meet that standard.  The withholding of evidence in his case was almost certainly caused not by a failure to give prosecutors specific training, but by miscreant prosecutor Gerry Deegan\xe2\x80\x99s willful suppression of evidence he believed to be exculpatory, in an effort to railroad Thompson.  According to Deegan\xe2\x80\x99s colleague Michael Riehlmann, in 1994 Deegan confessed to him\xe2\x80\x94in the same conversation in which Deegan revealed he had only a few months to live\xe2\x80\x94that he had \xe2\x80\x9csuppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thompson that in some way exculpated the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 367; see also <em>id.</em>, at 362 (\xe2\x80\x9c[Deegan] told me \xe2\x80\xa6 that he had failed to inform the defense of exculpatory information\xe2\x80\x9d).  I have no reason to disbelieve that account, particularly since Riehlmann\xe2\x80\x99s testimony hardly paints a flattering picture of himself: Riehlmann kept silent about Deegan\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct for another five years, as a result of which he incurred professional sanctions.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Riehlmann</em>, 2004\xe2\x80\x930680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So.\xc2\xa02d 1239.  And if Riehlmann\xe2\x80\x99s story is true, then the \xe2\x80\x9cmoving force,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bryan Cty.</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 404 (internal quotation marks omitted), behind the suppression of evidence was Deegan, not a failure of continuing legal education.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.  The dissent suspends disbelief about this, insisting that with proper <em>Brady</em> training, \xe2\x80\x9csurely at least one\xe2\x80\x9d of the prosecutors in Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s trial would have turned over the lab report and blood swatch.  <em>Post</em>, at 21.  But training must consist of more than mere broad encomiums of <em>Brady:</em> We have made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe identified deficiency in a city\xe2\x80\x99s training program [must be] closely related to the ultimate injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Canton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 391.  So even indulging the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutors failed to disclose the lab report <em>in good faith</em>\xe2\x80\x94in a way that could be prevented by training\xe2\x80\x94what sort of training would have prevented the good-faith nondisclosure of a blood report not known to be exculpatory?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps a better question to ask is what <em>legally accurate</em> training would have prevented it.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion is to instruct prosecutors to ignore the portion of <em>Brady</em> limiting prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 disclosure obligations to evidence that is \xe2\x80\x9cfavorable to an accused,\xe2\x80\x9d 373 U. S., at 87.  Instead, the dissent proposes that \xe2\x80\x9cConnick could have communicated to Orleans Parish prosecutors, in no uncertain terms, that, \xe2\x80\x98[i]f you have physical evidence that, if tested, can establish the innocence of the person who is charged, you have to turn it over.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 20, n.\xc2\xa013 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 34).  Though labeled a training suggestion, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is better described as a <em>sub silentio</em> expansion of the substantive law of <em>Brady</em>.  If any of our cases establishes such an obligation, I have never read it, and the dissent does not cite it.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s trial, however, we have decided a case that appears to say just the opposite of the training the dissent would require: In <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Youngblood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/51/index.html">488 U. S. 51</a>, 58 (1988), we held that \xe2\x80\x9cunless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  We acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Brady</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 makes the good or bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d but concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Due Process Clause requires a different result when we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 57.  Perhaps one day we will recognize a distinction between good-faith failures to preserve from destruction evidence whose inculpatory or exculpatory character is unknown, and good-faith failures to turn such evidence over to the defense.  But until we do so, a failure to train prosecutors to observe that distinction cannot constitute deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05. By now the reader has doubtless guessed the best-kept secret of this case: There was probably no <em>Brady</em> violation at all\xe2\x80\x94except for Deegan\xe2\x80\x99s (which, since it was a bad-faith, knowing violation, could not possibly be attributed to lack of training).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The dissent surely knows this, which is why it leans heavily on the fact that Connick conceded that <em>Brady </em>was violated.  I can honor that concession in my analysis of the case because even if it extends beyond Deegan\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate actions, it remains irrelevant to Connick\xe2\x80\x99s training obligations.  For any <em>Brady</em> violation apart from Deegan\xe2\x80\x99s was surely on the very frontier of our <em>Brady</em> jurisprudence; Connick could not possibly have been on notice decades ago that he was required to instruct his prosecutors to respect a right to untested evidence that we had not <em>(and still have not)</em> recognized.  As a consequence, even if I accepted the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that failure-to-train liability could be premised on a single <em>Brady</em> error, I could not agree that the lack of an accurate training regimen caused the violation Connick has conceded.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0<em>Monell</em> v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/index.html">436 U.

It is meaningless to say that after \xe2\x80\x9cthe court rejected [Connick\xe2\x80\x99s] categorical position,\xe2\x80\x9d as it did, he did not \xe2\x80\x9cassail the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s formulation of the deliberate indifference instruction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 26, n. 18.

Given the effort the dissent has expended persuading us that Connick\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of <em>Brady</em> is profoundly misguided, its newfound trust in his expertise on the subject is, to the say the least, surprising.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s only response to this is that the jury must have found otherwise, since it was instructed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[f]or liability to attach because of a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not in any particular prosecutor.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 28, n. 20 (quoting Tr. 1098).  But this instruction did not require the jury to find that Deegan did not commit a bad-faith, knowing violation; it merely prevented the jury from finding that, if he did so, Connick was liable for a failure to train.

S. 83</a>, 87 (1963), this Court held that due process requires the prosecution to turn over evidence favorable to the accused and material to his guilt or punishment.  That obligation, the parties have stipulated, was dishonored in this case; consequently, John Thompson spent 18 years in prison, 14 of them isolated on death row, before the truth came to light: He was innocent of the charge of attempted armed robbery, and his subsequent trial on a murder charge, by prosecutorial design, was fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court holds that the Orleans Parish District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office (District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office or Office) cannot be held liable, in a civil rights action under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, for the grave injustice Thompson suffered.  That is so, the Court tells us, because Thompson has shown only an aberrant <em>Brady</em> violation, not a routine practice of giving short shrift to <em>Brady</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  The evidence presented to the jury that awarded compensation to Thompson, however, points distinctly away from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment.  As the trial record in the \xc2\xa71983 action reveals, the conceded, long-concealed prosecutorial transgressions were neither isolated nor atypical.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the top down, the evidence showed, members of the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office, including the District At-torney himself, misperceived <em>Brady</em>\xe2\x80\x99s compass and therefore inadequately attended to their disclosure obligations.  Throughout the pretrial and trial proceedings against Thompson, the team of four engaged in prosecuting him for armed robbery and murder hid from the defense and the court exculpatory information Thompson requested and had a constitutional right to receive.  The prosecutors did so despite multiple opportunities, spanning nearly two decades, to set the record straight.  Based on the prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 conduct relating to Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s trials, a fact trier could reasonably conclude that inattention to <em>Brady</em> was standard operating procedure at the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What happened here, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion obscures, was no momentary oversight, no single incident of a lone officer\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct.  Instead, the evidence demonstrated that misperception and disregard of <em>Brady</em>\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements were pervasive in Orleans Parish.  That evidence, I would hold, established persistent, deliberately indifferent conduct for which the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office bears responsibility under \xc2\xa71983.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment mindful that <em>Brady</em> violations, as this case illustrates, are not easily detected.  But for a chance discovery made by a defense team investigator weeks before Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled execution, the evidence that led to his exoneration might have remained under wraps.  The prosecutorial concealment Thompson encountered, however, is bound to be repeated unless municipal agencies bear responsibility\xe2\x80\x94made tangible by \xc2\xa71983 liability\xe2\x80\x94for adequately conveying what <em>Brady</em> requires and for monitoring staff compliance.  Failure to train, this Court has said, can give rise to municipal liability under \xc2\xa71983 \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the failure \xe2\x80\xa6 amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Canton</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/378/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/378/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/378/index.html">489 U.

That standard is well met in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I turn first to a contextual account of the <em>Brady </em>violations that infected Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s trials.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the early morning hours of December 6, 1984, an assailant shot and killed Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr., son of a prominent New Orleans business executive, on the street fronting the victim\xe2\x80\x99s home.  Only one witness saw the assailant.  As recorded in two contemporaneous police reports, that eyewitness initially described the assailant as African-American, six feet tall, with \xe2\x80\x9cclose cut hair.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record EX2\xe2\x80\x93EX3, EX9.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Thompson is five feet eight inches tall and, at the time of the murder, styled his hair in a large \xe2\x80\x9cAfro.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at EX13.  The police reports of the witness\xe2\x80\x99 immediate identification were not disclosed to Thompson or to the court.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While engaged in the murder investigation, the Orleans Parish prosecutors linked Thompson to another violent crime committed three weeks later.  On December 28, an assailant attempted to rob three siblings at gunpoint.  During the struggle, the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s blood stained the oldest child\xe2\x80\x99s pant leg.  That blood, preserved on a swatch of fabric cut from the pant leg by a crime scene analyst, was eventually tested.  The test conclusively established that the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s blood was type B.  <em>Id.</em>, at EX151.  Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s blood is type O.  His prosecutors failed to disclose the existence of the swatch or the test results.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One month after the Liuzza murder, Richard Perkins, a man who knew Thompson, approached the Liuzza family.  Perkins did so after the family\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of a $15,000 reward for information leading to the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  Police officers surreptitiously recorded the Perkins-Liuzza conversations.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  As documented on tape, Perkins told the family, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind helping [you] catch [the perpetrator], \xe2\x80\xa6 but I would like [you] to help me and, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ll help [you].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at EX479, EX481.  Once the family assured Perkins, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re on your side, we want to try and help you,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at EX481, Perkins intimated that Thompson and another man, Kevin Freeman, had been involved in Liuzza\xe2\x80\x99s murder.  Perkins thereafter told the police what he had learned from Freeman about the murder, and that information was recorded in a police report.  Based on Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 account, Thompson and Freeman were arrested on murder charges.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Freeman was six feet tall and went by the name \xe2\x80\x9cKojak\xe2\x80\x9d because he kept his hair so closely trimmed that his scalp was visible.  Unlike Thompson, Freeman fit the eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99 initial description of the Liuzza assailant\xe2\x80\x99s height and hair style.  As the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at 4, n.\xc2\xa02, Freeman became the key witness for the prosecution at Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s trial for the murder of Liuzza.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s arrest for the Liuzza murder, the father of the armed robbery victims saw a newspaper photo of Thompson with a large Afro hairstyle and showed it to his children.  He reported to the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office that the children had identified Thompson as their attacker, and the children then picked that same photo out of a \xe2\x80\x9cphotographic lineup.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record EX120, EX642\xe2\x80\x93EX643.  Indicting Thompson on the basis of these questionable identifications, the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office did not pause to test the pant leg swatch dyed by the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s blood.  This lapse ignored or overlooked a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s notation that the Office \xe2\x80\x9cmay wish to do [a] blood test.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at EX122.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The murder trial was scheduled to begin in mid-March 1985.  Armed with the later indictment against Thompson for robbery, however, the prosecutors made a strategic choice: They switched the order of the two trials, proceeding first on the robbery indictment.  <em>Id.</em>, at EX128\xe2\x80\x93EX129.  Their aim was twofold.  A robbery conviction gained first would serve to inhibit Thompson from testifying in his own defense at the murder trial, for the prior conviction could be used to impeach his credibility.  In addition, an armed robbery conviction could be invoked at the penalty phase of the murder trial in support of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s plea for the death penalty.  <em>Id.</em>, at 682.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing the need for an effective prosecution team, petitioner Harry F. Connick, District Attorney for the Parish of Orleans, appointed his third-in-command, Eric Dubelier, as special prosecutor in both cases.  Dubelier enlisted Jim Williams to try the armed robbery case and to assist him in the murder case.  Gerry Deegan assisted Williams in the armed robbery case.  Bruce Whittaker, the fourth prosecutor involved in the cases, had approved Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s armed robbery indictment.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During pretrial proceedings in the armed robbery case, Thompson filed a motion requesting access to all materials and information \xe2\x80\x9cfavorable to the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial and relevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cany results or reports\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cscientific tests or experiments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at EX144, EX145.  Prosecutorial responses to this motion fell far short of <em>Brady </em>compliance.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, prosecutors blocked defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s inspection of the pant leg swatch stained by the robber\xe2\x80\x99s blood.  Although Dubelier\xe2\x80\x99s April 3 response stated, \xe2\x80\x9cInspection to be permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at EX149, the swatch was signed out from the property room at 10:05 a.m. the next day, and was not returned until noon on April 10, the day before trial, <em>id.</em>, at EX43, EX670.  Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s attorney inspected the evidence made available to him and found no blood evidence.  No one told defense counsel about the swatch and its recent removal from the property room.  <em>Id.</em>, at EX701\xe2\x80\x93EX702; Tr. 400\xe2\x80\x93402.  But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa011 (Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s attorney had \xe2\x80\x9caccess to the evidence locker where the swatch was recorded as evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Dubelier or Whittaker ordered the crime laboratory to rush a pretrial test of the swatch.  Tr. 952\xe2\x80\x93954.  Whittaker received the lab report, addressed to his attention, two days before trial commenced.  Immediately thereafter, he placed the lab report on Williams\xe2\x80\x99 desk.  Record EX151, EX589.  Although the lab report conclusively identified the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s blood type, <em>id.</em>, at EX151, the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office never revealed the report to the defense.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, Deegan checked the swatch out of the property room on the morning of the first day of trial, but the prosecution did not produce the swatch at trial.  <em>Id.</em>, at EX43.  Deegan did not return the swatch to the property room after trial, and the swatch has never been found.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 37.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[B]ased solely on the descriptions\xe2\x80\x9d provided by the three victims, Record 683, the jury convicted Thompson of attempted armed robbery.  The court sentenced him to 49.5 years without possibility of parole\xe2\x80\x94the maximum available sentence.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prosecutors continued to disregard <em>Brady </em>during the murder trial, held in May 1985, at which the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s order-of-trial strategy achieved its aim.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  By prosecuting Thompson for armed robbery first\xe2\x80\x94and withholding blood evidence that might have exonerated Thompson of that charge\xe2\x80\x94the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office disabled Thompson from testifying in his own defense at the murder trial.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  As earlier observed, see <em>supra</em>, at 5,<em> </em>impeaching use of the prior conviction would have severely undermined Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s credibility.  And because Thompson was effectively stopped from testifying in his own defense, the testimony of the witnesses against him gained force.  The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s failure to reveal evidence that could have impeached those witnesses helped to seal Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s fate.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the prosecution undermined Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to impeach Perkins.  Perkins testified that he volunteered information to the police with no knowledge of reward money.  Record EX366, EX372\xe2\x80\x93EX373.  Because prosecutors had not produced the audiotapes of Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 conversations with the Liuzza family (or a police summary of the tapes), Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys could do little to cast doubt on Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 credibility.  In closing argument, the prosecution emphasized that Thompson presented no \xe2\x80\x9cdirect evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that reward money had motivated any of the witnesses.  <em>Id.</em>, at EX3171\xe2\x80\x93EX3172.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the prosecution impeded Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s impeachment of key witness Kevin Freeman.  It did so by failing to disclose a police report containing Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 account of\nwhat he had learned from Freeman about the murder.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s trial testimony was materially inconsistent with that report.  Tr. 382\xe2\x80\x93384, 612\xe2\x80\x93614;\nRecord EX270\xe2\x80\x93EX274.  Lacking any knowledge of the police report, Thompson could not point to the inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, and most vital, the eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99 initial description of the assailant\xe2\x80\x99s hair, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, was of prime relevance, for it suggested that Freeman, not Thompson, murdered Liuzza, see <em>supra</em>, at 4.  The materiality of the eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99 contemporaneous description of the murderer should have been altogether apparent to the prosecution.  Failure to produce the police reports setting out what the eyewitness first said not only undermined efforts to impeach that witness and the police officer who initially interviewed him.  The omission left defense counsel without knowledge that the prosecutors were restyling the killer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclose cut hair\xe2\x80\x9d into an \xe2\x80\x9cAfro.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prosecutors finessed the discrepancy between the eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99 initial description and Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.  They asked leading questions prompting the eyewitness to agree on the stand that the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s hair was \xe2\x80\x9cafro type,\xe2\x80\x9d yet \xe2\x80\x9cstraight back.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record EX322\xe2\x80\x93EX323.  Corroboratively, the police officer\xe2\x80\x94after refreshing his recollection by reviewing material at the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s table\xe2\x80\x94gave artful testimony.  He characterized the witness\xe2\x80\x99 initial description of the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s hair as \xe2\x80\x9cblack and short, <em>afro style</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at EX265 (emphasis added).  As prosecutors well knew, nothing in the withheld police reports, which described the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s hair simply as \xe2\x80\x9cclose cut,\xe2\x80\x9d portrayed a perpetrator with an Afro or Afro-style hair.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder.  Having prevented Thompson from testifying that Freeman was the killer, the prosecution delivered its ultimate argument.  Because Thompson was already serving a near-life sentence for attempted armed robbery, the prosecution urged, the only way to punish him for murder was to execute him.  The strategy worked as planned; Thompson was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompson discovered the prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 misconduct through a serendipitous series of events.  In 1994, nine years after Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s convictions, Deegan, the assistant prosecutor in the armed robbery trial, learned he was terminally ill.  Soon thereafter, Deegan confessed to his friend Michael Riehlmann that he had suppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery case.  <em>Id.</em>, at EX709.  Deegan did not heed Riehlmann\xe2\x80\x99s counsel to reveal what he had done.  For five years, Riehlmann, himself a former Orleans Parish prosecutor, kept Deegan\xe2\x80\x99s confession to himself.  <em>Id.</em>, at EX712\xe2\x80\x93EX713.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On April 16, 1999, the State of Louisiana scheduled Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s execution.  <em>Id.</em>, at EX1366\xe2\x80\x93EX1367.  In an eleventh-hour effort to save his life, Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys hired a private investigator.  Deep in the crime lab archives, the investigator unearthed a microfiche copy of the lab report identifying the robber\xe2\x80\x99s blood type.  The copy showed that the report had been addressed to Whittaker.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7.  Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys contacted Whittaker, who informed Riehlmann that the lab report had been found.  Riehlmann thereupon told Whittaker that Deegan \xe2\x80\x9chad failed to turn over stuff that might have been exculpatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 718.  Riehlmann prepared an affidavit describing Deegan\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure \xe2\x80\x9cthat he had intentionally suppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thompson.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record EX583.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers presented to the trial court the crime lab report showing that the robber\xe2\x80\x99s blood type was B, and a report identifying Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s blood type as O.  This evidence proved Thompson innocent of the robbery.  The court immediately stayed Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s execution, <em>id.</em>, at EX590, and commenced proceedings to assess the newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Connick sought an abbreviated hearing.  A full hearing was unnecessary, he urged, because the Office had confessed error and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery charges.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at EX617.  The court insisted on a public hearing.  Given \xe2\x80\x9cthe history of this case,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said, it \xe2\x80\x9cwas not willing to accept the representations that [Connick] and [his] office made [in their motion to dismiss].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>id.</em>, at EX882.  After a full day\xe2\x80\x99s hearing, the court vacated Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s attempted armed robbery conviction and dismissed the charges.  Before doing so, the court admonished:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ll day long there have been a number of young Assistant D.\xc2\xa0A.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 sitting in this courtroom watching this, and I hope they take home \xe2\x80\xa6 and take to heart the message that this kind of conduct cannot go on in this Parish if this Criminal Justice System is going to work.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at EX883.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office then initiated grand jury proceedings against the prosecutors who had withheld the lab report.  Connick terminated the grand jury after just one day.  He maintained that the lab report would not be <em>Brady </em>material if prosecutors did not know Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s blood type.  Tr. 986; cf. <em>supra</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa06.  And he told the investigating prosecutor that the grand jury \xe2\x80\x9cw[ould] make [his] job more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 978\xe2\x80\x93979.

Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s defense was bolstered by evidence earlier unavailable to him: ten exhibits the prosecution had not disclosed when Thompson was first tried.  The newly produced items included police reports describing the assailant in the murder case as having \xe2\x80\x9cclose cut\xe2\x80\x9d hair, the police report recounting Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 meetings with the Liuzza family, see <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, audio recordings of those meetings, and a 35-page supplemental police report.

Thompson sought to hold Connick and the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office liable for failure adequately to train prosecutors concerning their <em>Brady </em>obligations.  Such liability attaches, I agree with the Court, only when the failure \xe2\x80\x9camount[s] to \xe2\x80\x98deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (quoting <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/378/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/378/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/378/index.html">489 U.

Thompson presented convincing evidence to satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71983 suit proceeded to a jury trial on two theories of liability: First, the Orleans Parish Office\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>official <em>Brady </em>policy was unconstitutional; and second, Connick was deliberately indifferent to an obvious need to train his prosecutors about their <em>Brady</em> obligations.  Connick\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady </em>policy directed prosecutors to \xe2\x80\x9cturn over what was required by state and federal law, but no more.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The jury thus understandably rejected Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the official policy itself was unconstitutional.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury found, however, that Connick was deliberately indifferent to the need to train prosecutors about <em>Brady</em>\xe2\x80\x99s command.  On the special verdict form, the jury answered yes to the following question:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWas the <em>Brady </em>violation in the armed robbery case or any infringements of John Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s rights in the murder trial substantially caused by [Connick\xe2\x80\x99s] failure, through deliberate indifference, to establish policies and procedures to protect one accused of a crime from these constitutional violations?\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 1585.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with the question put to the jury, and without objection, the court instructed the jurors: \xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou are not limited to the nonproduced blood evidence and the resulting infringement of Mr. Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s right to testify at the murder trial.  You may consider all of the evidence presented during this trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 1099; Record 1620.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 2, 6, 10, n.\xc2\xa07, 16; <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Scalia, J., concurring) (maintaining that the case involves a single <em>Brady </em>violation).  That evidence included a stipulation that in his retrial for the Liuzza murder, Thompson had introduced ten exhibits containing relevant information withheld by the prosecution in 1985.  See <em>supra</em>, at 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abundant evidence supported the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding that additional <em>Brady </em>training was obviously necessary to ensure that <em>Brady </em>violations would not occur:  (1) Connick, the Office\xe2\x80\x99s sole policymaker, misunderstood <em>Brady</em>.  (2) Other leaders in the Office, who bore direct responsibility for training less experienced prosecutors, were similarly uninformed about <em>Brady</em>.  (3) Prosecutors in the Office received no <em>Brady </em>training.  (4) The Office shirked its responsibility to keep prosecutors abreast of relevant legal developments concerning <em>Brady </em>requirements.  As a result of these multiple shortfalls, it was hardly surprising that <em>Brady </em>violations in fact occurred, severely undermining the integrity of Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s trials.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Connick was the Office\xe2\x80\x99s sole policymaker, and his testimony exposed a flawed understanding of a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady</em> obligations.  First, Connick admitted to the jury that his earlier understanding of <em>Brady</em>, conveyed in prior sworn testimony, had been too narrow.  Tr. 181\xe2\x80\x93182.  Second, Connick confessed to having withheld a crime lab report \xe2\x80\x9cone time as a prosecutor and I got indicted by the U. S. Attorney over here for doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 872.  Third, even at trial Connick persisted in misstating <em>Brady</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  For example, Connick urged that there could be no <em>Brady </em>violation arising out of \xe2\x80\x9cthe inadvertent conduct of [an] assistant under pressure with a lot of case load.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 188\xe2\x80\x93189.  The court, however, correctly instructed the jury that, in determining whether there has been a <em>Brady </em>violation, the \xe2\x80\x9cgood or bad faith of the prosecution does not matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 1094\xe2\x80\x931095.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The testimony of other leaders in the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office revealed similar misunderstandings.  Those misunderstandings, the jury could find, were in large part responsible for the gross disregard of <em>Brady </em>rights Thompson experienced.  Dubelier admitted that he never reviewed police files, but simply relied on the police to flag any potential <em>Brady </em>information.  Tr. 542.  The court, however, instructed the jury that an individual prosecutor has a \xe2\x80\x9cduty \xe2\x80\xa6 to learn of any favorable evidence known to others acting on the government\xe2\x80\x99s behalf in the case, including the police.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1095; Record 1614.  Williams was asked whether \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Brady </em>material includes documents in the possession of the district attorney that could be used to impeach a witness, to show that he\xe2\x80\x99s lying\xe2\x80\x9d; he responded simply, and mistakenly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 381.  The testimony of \xe2\x80\x9chigh-ranking individuals in the Orleans Parish District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office,\xe2\x80\x9d Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s expert explained,[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] exposed \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete errors \xe2\x80\xa6 as to what <em>Brady</em> required [prosecutors] to do.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 427, 434.  \xe2\x80\x9cDubelier had no understanding of his obligations under <em>Brady </em>whatsoever,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 458, the expert observed, and Williams \xe2\x80\x9cis still not sure what his obligations were under <em>Brady</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 448.  But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t was undisputed at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the general <em>Brady </em>requirement that the State disclose to the defense evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury could attribute the violations of Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s rights directly to prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 misapprehension of <em>Brady</em>.  The prosecution had no obligation to produce the \xe2\x80\x9cclose-cut hair\xe2\x80\x9d police reports, Williams maintained, because newspaper reports had suggested that witness descrip-\ntions were not consistent with Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.  Therefore, Williams urged, the defense already \xe2\x80\x9chad everything.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 139.  Dubelier tendered an alternative ex-\nplanation for the nondisclosure.  In Dubelier\xe2\x80\x99s view, the descriptions were not \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with [Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s] appearance,\xe2\x80\x9d as portrayed in a police photograph showing Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s hair extending at least three inches above his forehead.  <em>Id.</em>, at 171\xe2\x80\x93172; Record EX73.  Williams insisted that he had discharged the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s duty to disclose the blood evidence by mentioning, in a motion hearing, that the prosecution intended to obtain a blood sample from Thompson.  Tr. 393\xe2\x80\x93394.  During the armed robbery trial, Williams told one of the victims that the results of the blood test made on the swatch had been \xe2\x80\x9cinconclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 962.  And he testified in the \xc2\xa71983 action that the lab report was not <em>Brady </em>material \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the blood type of Mr. Thompson was.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 393.  But see <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, n.\xc2\xa05 (District Court instructed the jury that the lab report was <em>Brady </em>material).</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Connick should have comprehended that Orleans Parish prosecutors lacked essential guidance on <em>Brady </em>and its application.  In fact, Connick has effectively conceded that <em>Brady </em>training in his Office was inadequate.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 60.  Connick explained to the jury that prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 offices must \xe2\x80\x9cmake \xe2\x80\xa6 very clear to [new prosecutors] what their responsibility [i]s\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Brady </em>and must not \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[e] them a lot of leeway.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 834\xe2\x80\x93835.  But the jury heard ample evidence that Connick\xe2\x80\x99s Office gave prosecutors no <em>Brady </em>guidance, and had installed no procedures to monitor <em>Brady </em>compliance.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1985, Connick acknowledged, many of his prosecutors \xe2\x80\x9cwere coming fresh out of law school,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Office\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[h]uge turnover\xe2\x80\x9d allowed attorneys with little experience to advance quickly to supervisory positions.  See Tr. 853\xe2\x80\x93854, 832.  By 1985, Dubelier and Williams were two of the highest ranking attorneys in the Office, <em>id.</em>, at 342, 356\xe2\x80\x93357, yet neither man had even five years of experience as a prosecutor, see <em>supra</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa03; Record EX746; Tr. 55, 571\xe2\x80\x93576.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dubelier and Williams learned the prosecutorial craft in Connick\xe2\x80\x99s Office, and, as earlier observed, see <em>supra</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318, their testimony manifested a woefully deficient understanding of <em>Brady</em>.  Dubelier and Williams told the jury that they did not recall any <em>Brady </em>training in the Office.  Tr. 170\xe2\x80\x93171, 364.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Connick testified that he relied on supervisors, including Dubelier and Williams, to ensure prosecutors were familiar with their <em>Brady</em> obligations.  Tr. 805\xe2\x80\x93806.  Yet Connick did not inquire whether the supervisors themselves understood the importance of teaching newer prosecutors about <em>Brady</em>.  Riehlmann could not \xe2\x80\x9crecall that [he] was ever trained or instructed by anybody about [his] <em>Brady</em> obligations,\xe2\x80\x9d on the job or otherwise.  Tr. 728\xe2\x80\x93729.  Whittaker agreed it was possible for \xe2\x80\x9cinexperienced lawyers, just a few weeks out of law school with no training,\xe2\x80\x9d to bear responsibility for \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions on \xe2\x80\xa6 whether material was <em>Brady </em>material and had to be produced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s expert characterized Connick\xe2\x80\x99s supervision regarding <em>Brady</em> as \xe2\x80\x9cthe blind leading the blind.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 458.  For example, in 1985 trial attorneys \xe2\x80\x9csometimes \xe2\x80\xa6 went to Mr. Connick\xe2\x80\x9d with <em>Brady </em>questions, \xe2\x80\x9cand he would tell them\xe2\x80\x9d how to proceed.  Tr. 892.  But Connick acknowledged that he had \xe2\x80\x9cstopped reading law books \xe2\x80\xa6 and looking at opinions\xe2\x80\x9d when he was first elected District Attorney in 1974.  <em>Id.</em>, at 175\xe2\x80\x93176.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As part of their training, prosecutors purportedly attended a pretrial conference with the Office\xe2\x80\x99s chief of trials before taking a case to trial.  Connick intended the practice to provide both training and accountability.  But it achieved neither aim in Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutions, for Dubelier and Williams, as senior prosecutors in the Office, were free to take cases to trial without pretrying them, and that is just how they proceeded in Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 901\xe2\x80\x93902; Record 685.  But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 13 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]rial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prosecutors confirmed that training in the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office, overall, was deficient.  Soon after Connick retired, a survey of assistant district attorneys in the Office revealed that more than half felt that they had not received the training they needed to do their jobs.  Tr. 178.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompson, it bears emphasis, is not complaining about the absence of formal training sessions.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 55.  But cf. <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  His complaint does not demand that <em>Brady </em>compliance be enforced in any particular way.  He asks only that <em>Brady</em> obligations be communicated accurately and genuinely enforced.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Because that did not happen in the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office, it was inevitable that prosecutors would misapprehend <em>Brady</em>.  Had <em>Brady</em>\xe2\x80\x99s importance<em> </em>been brought home to prosecutors, surely at least one of the four officers who knew of the swatch and lab report would have revealed their existence to defense counsel and the court.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Louisiana did not require continuing legal education at the time of Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s trials.  Tr. 361.  But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Primary responsibility for keeping prosecutors <em>au courant </em>with developments in the law, therefore, resided in the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office.  Over the course of Connick\xe2\x80\x99s tenure as District Attorney, the jury learned, the Office\xe2\x80\x99s chief of appeals circulated memoranda when appellate courts issued important opinions.  Tr. 751\xe2\x80\x93754, 798.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1987 Office policy manual was a compilation of memoranda on criminal law and practice circulated to prosecutors from 1974, when Connick became District Attorney, through 1987.  <em>Id.</em>, at 798.  The manual contained four sentences, nothing more, on <em>Brady</em>.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] <em> </em>This slim instruction, the jury learned, was notably inaccurate, incomplete, and dated.  Tr. 798\xe2\x80\x93804, 911\xe2\x80\x93918.  But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 13 (\xe2\x80\x9cSenior attorneys also circulated court decisions and instructional memoranda to keep the prose-cutors abreast of relevant legal developments.\xe2\x80\x9d).  For example, the manual did not acknowledge what <em>Giglio</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/150/index.html">405 U. S. 150</a> (1972), made plain: Impeachment evidence is <em>Brady </em>material prosecutors are obligated to disclose.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the evidence permitted the jury to reach the following conclusions.  First, Connick did not ensure that prosecutors in his Office knew their <em>Brady </em>obligations; he neither confirmed their familiarity with <em>Brady </em>when he hired them, nor saw to it that training took place on his watch.  Second, the need for <em>Brady </em>training and monitoring was obvious to Connick.  Indeed he so testified.  Third, Connick\xe2\x80\x99s cavalier approach to his staff\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and observation of <em>Brady </em>requirements contributed to a culture of inattention to <em>Brady </em>in Orleans Parish.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As earlier noted, see <em>supra</em>, at 11,<em> </em>Connick resisted an effort to hold prosecutors accountable for <em>Brady </em>compliance because he felt the effort would \xe2\x80\x9cmake [his] job more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 978.  He never disciplined or fired a single prosecutor for violating <em>Brady</em>.  Tr. 182\xe2\x80\x93183.<em> </em>The jury was told of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/419/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/419/index.html">514 U. S. 419</a> (1995), a capital case prosecuted by Connick\xe2\x80\x99s Office that garnered attention because it featured \xe2\x80\x9cso many instances of the state\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose exculpatory evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 455 (Stevens, J., concurring).  When questioned about <em>Kyles</em>, Connick told the jury he was satisfied with his Office\xe2\x80\x99s practices and saw no need, occasioned by <em>Kyles</em>, to make any changes.

They were just what one would expect given the attitude toward <em>Brady </em>pervasive in the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office.  Thompson demonstrated that no fewer than five prosecutors\xe2\x80\x94the four trial prosecutors and Riehlmann\xe2\x80\x94disregarded his <em>Brady </em>rights.  He established that they kept from him, year upon year, evidence vital to his defense.

But as this case so vividly shows, a municipality that empowers prosecutors to press for a death sentence without ensuring that those prosecutors know and honor <em>Brady </em>rights may be no less \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately indifferent\xe2\x80\x9d to the risk to innocent lives.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Brady</em>, this Court has long recognized,<em> </em>is among the most basic safeguards brigading a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s fair trial right.

Vigilance in superintending prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 attention to <em>Brady</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement is all the more important for this reason: A <em>Brady </em>violation, by its nature, causes suppression of evidence beyond the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to ferret out.  Because the absence of the withheld evidence may result in the conviction of an innocent defendant, it is unconscionable not to impose reasonable controls impelling prosecutors to bring the information to light.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nevertheless holds <em>Canton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s example inapposite.

See Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials and Prosecutors as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 13.  Connick himself recognized that his prosecutors, because of their inexperience, were not so equipped.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cunderstanding and complying with <em>Brady </em>obligations are not easy tasks, and the appropriate way to resolve <em>Brady </em>issues is not always self-evident.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials and Prosecutors as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 6.  \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Brady </em>compliance,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, \xe2\x80\x9cis too much at risk, and too fundamental to the fairness of our criminal justice system, to be taken for granted,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctraining remains critical.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 3, 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority further suggests that a prior pattern of similar violations is necessary to show deliberate indifference to defendants\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Brady </em>rights.

Connick, who himself had been indicted for suppression of evidence, created a tinderbox in Orleans Parish in which <em>Brady </em>violations were nigh inevitable.  And when they did occur, Connick insisted there was no need to change anything, and opposed efforts to hold prosecutors accountable on the ground that doing so would make his job more difficult.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A District Attorney aware of his office\xe2\x80\x99s high turnover rate, who recruits prosecutors fresh out of law school and promotes them rapidly through the ranks, bears responsibility for ensuring that on-the-job training takes place.  In short, the buck stops with him.[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  As the Court recognizes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe duty to produce <em>Brady </em>evidence to the defense\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c[a]mong prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 unique ethical obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.

The Court, however, overlooks the date of that Fifth Circuit decision.

The jury in the \xc2\xa71983 trial, of course, had far more extensive and accurate information on which to reach its decision.  Moreover, as earlier noted, the same trial court that made the 1995 findings was, in 1999, outraged by the subsequently discovered <em>Brady </em>violations and by Connick\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to bring those violations to light.
