Of this, he said, there could be no doubt; and, with respect to the mode of authentication, he observed, that the Act of Assembly relates only to powers executed in a foreign country, and leaves the matter here to common law proof. </p><p> The Court were of opinion, that the general power was sufficient for the purpose of the release; and, having directed the person acting under it, to enter an acknowledgment of satisfaction on the record; they ordered the Plaintiff to be discharged. <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1907531">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> QUESNEL v.
