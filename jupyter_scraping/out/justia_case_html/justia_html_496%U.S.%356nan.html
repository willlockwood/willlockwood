Petitioner, a former high school student, filed a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit in a Florida Circuit Court seeking damages and injunctive relief against, <em>inter alios,</em> the local school board, alleging, among other things, that his federal constitutional rights were violated when his car was searched on school premises in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution, and that he was suspended from classes without due process.  The court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the board, and dismissed the complaint against the board with prejudice, citing <em>Hill v. Department of Corrections,</em> 513 So.2d 129, in which the State Supreme Court ruled that Florida\'s statutory waiver of sovereign immunity applied only to state court tort actions and conferred a blanket immunity on state governmental entities from federal civil rights actions under \xc2\xa7 1983 in state court.  The District Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal, holding that the availability of sovereign immunity in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action brought in state court is a matter of state law, and that, under <em>Hill,</em> the statutory waiver of immunity did not apply.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em>  A state law "sovereign immunity" defense is not available to a school board in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action brought in a state court that otherwise has jurisdiction when such defense would not be available if the action were brought in a federal forum.

S. 58</a></span>, <em>Hill\'s</em> actual disposition, if not its language and reasoning, comports with <em>Will,</em> which established that the State and arms of the State, which have traditionally enjoyed Eleventh Amendment immunity, are not subject to suit under \xc2\xa7 1983 in either federal or state court.  However, in construing <em>Hill</em> to extend absolute immunity not only to the State and its arm </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 496 U. S. 357</a></p><p> but also to municipalities, counties, and school districts who might otherwise be subject to suit under \xc2\xa7 1983 in federal court, the District Court of Appeal\'s decision raises the concern that that court may be evading federal law and discriminating against federal causes of action.  The adequacy of the state law ground to support a judgment precluding litigation of the federal claim is a federal question, which this Court reviews <em>de novo.  See, e.g., James v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/341/case.html">466 U.

Houseman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/130/case.html">93 U. S. 130</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/130/case.html#136">93 U.

An excuse that is inconsistent with or violates federal law is not a valid excuse:  the Supremacy Clause forbids state courts to dissociate themselves from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the superior authority of its source.  <em>See, e.g., Mondou v. New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/223/1/case.html">223 U.

A valid excuse may exist when a state court refuses jurisdiction because of a neutral state rule of judicial administration, <em>see, e.g., Douglas, supra,</em> unless that rule is preempted by federal law, <em>see Felder v. Casey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/131/case.html">487 U. S. 131</a></span>.

S. 367</a></span>-375.</p>\n<p>(c) The District Court of Appeal\'s refusal to entertain \xc2\xa7 1983 actions against state entities such as school boards violates the Supremacy Clause.  If that refusal amounts to the adoption of a substantive rule of decision that state agencies are not subject to liability under \xc2\xa7 1983, it directly violates federal law, which makes governmental defendants that are not arms of the State liable for their constitutional violations under \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>See, e.g., St. Louis v. Praprotnik,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/112/case.html">485 U.

Conduct by persons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under \xc2\xa7 1983 cannot be immunized by state law, even though the federal cause of action is being asserted in state court.  <em>See, e.g., Martinez v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/277/case.html">444 U.

If, on the other hand, the District Court of Appeal\'s decision meant that \xc2\xa7 1983 claims are excluded from the category of tort claims that the Circuit Court could hear against a school board, it was no less violative of federal law.  <em>Cf. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Burnette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/239/199/case.html">239 U.

The State has constituted the Circuit Court as a court of general jurisdiction, and it entertains state common law and statutory claims against state entities in a variety of their capacities, as well as \xc2\xa7 1983 actions against individual state officials.  A state policy that declines jurisdiction over one discrete category of \xc2\xa7 1983 claims, yet permits similar state law actions against state defendants, can be based only on the rationale that such defendants should not be held liable for \xc2\xa7 1983 violations.  Thus, there is no neutral or valid excuse for the refusal to hear suits like petitioner\'s.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/356/case.html#375">496 U.

The fact that a rule is denominated jurisdictional does not provide a state court an excuse to avoid the obligation to enforce federal law if the rule does not reflect the concerns of power over the person and competence over the subject matter that jurisdictional rules are designed to protect.  Also meritless is respondent\'s contention that sovereign immunity is not a creature of state law, but of long-established legal principles that Congress did not intend to abrogate in enacting \xc2\xa7 1983.  Congress did take common law principles into account in, <em>e.g.,</em> excluding States and arms of the State from the definition of "person," but individual States may not rely on their own common law heritage to exempt from federal liability persons that Congress subjected to liability.

Contending that the search and subsequent suspension violated rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution and under similar provisions of the State Constitution, he prayed for damages and an order expunging any reference to the suspension from the school records.</p>\n<p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on various grounds, including failure to exhaust state administrative remedies. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The school board also contended that the court was without jurisdiction to hear the federal claims -- but not the state claims -- because the Florida waiver of sovereign immunity statute did not extend to claims based on \xc2\xa7 1983.  App. 13-14.  The Circuit Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, citing a state case requiring state law challenges to be first presented to the District Court of Appeal and the Florida Supreme Court decision in <em>Hill v. Department of Corrections,</em>513 So.2d 129 (1987).  App. 19.</p>\n<p>The District Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal of petitioner\'s \xc2\xa7 1983 claim against the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="360">Page 496 U.

[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  It held that the availability of sovereign immunity in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action brought in state court is a matter of state law, and that Florida\'s statutory waiver of sovereign immunity did not apply to \xc2\xa7 1983 cases.  The court rejected the argument that whether a State has maintained its sovereign immunity from a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit in its state courts is a question of federal law.  It wrote:</p>\n<p>"[W]hen a section 1983 action is brought in state court, the sole question to be decided on the basis of <em>state</em> law is whether the state has waived its common law sovereign immunity to the extent necessary to allow a section 1983 action in state court.  <em>Hill</em> holds that Florida has not so waived its sovereign immunity.  We therefore do not reach appellant\'s second issue in this case, <em>i.e.,</em> whether, under <em>federal</em> law, a Florida school board is immune from a section 1983 law.

It held, however, that, under <em>Hill,</em> a State\'s invocation of a "state common law immunity from the use of its courts for suits against the state in those state courts" raised "purely a question of state law."  537 So.2d at 708.

S. 361</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The question in this case stems from the Florida Supreme Court\'s decision in the <em>Hill</em> case.  In that case, the plaintiff sought damages for common law negligence and false imprisonment and violations of his constitutional rights under \xc2\xa7 1983 from the Florida Department of Corrections for the conduct of one of its probation supervisors.  <em>Hill</em> argued that the Department was a "person" under \xc2\xa7 1983, that it was responsible for the actions of its supervisor, and that it was subject to suit in the Circuit Court pursuant to the Florida waiver of sovereign immunity.  Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 768.28 (1989). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  That statute provides that the State and its subdivisions, including municipalities and school boards, \xc2\xa7 768.28(2), are subject to suit in Circuit Court for tort claims "in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,"  \xc2\xa7 768.28(5). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Although the terms of the waiver </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 496 U.

The Florida courts thus have entertained suits against state agencies for the violation of nondiscretionary duties committed in the performance of various governmental activities, including the roadside stop and arrest of an individual driving with an expired inspection sticker, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the negligent maintenance by city employees of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 496 U.

On appeal, the District Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal of the \xc2\xa7 1983 claim and reversed the judgment on the common law claim.  It also certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question whether Florida\'s statutory waiver of sovereign immunity permitted suits against the State and its agencies under \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>Department of Corrections v. Hill,</em> 490 So.2d 118 (1986).</p>\n<p>The State Supreme Court answered that question in the negative.  <em>Hill v. Department of Corrections,</em> 513 So.2d 129 (Fla. 1987), <em>cert. denied,</em> 484 U.S. 1064 (1988).  Without citing any of its own sovereign immunity cases, and relying solely on analogy to the Eleventh Amendment and decisions of the courts of other States, the State Supreme Court held that the Florida statute conferred a blanket immunity on governmental entities from federal civil rights actions under \xc2\xa7 1983.  513 So.2d, at 133.  It stated:</p>\n<p>"While Florida is at liberty to waive its immunity from section 1983 actions, it has not done so.  The recovery ceilings in section 768.28 were intended to waive sovereign immunity for state tort actions, not federal civil rights actions commenced under section 1983."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The court thus affirmed the dismissal of the \xc2\xa7 1983 claim, but reversed the Court of Appeal\'s judgment on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="365">Page 496 U. S. 365</a></p><p> the common law claim and allowed the judgment for <em>Hill</em> on that claim to stand.</p>\n<p>On its facts, the disposition of the <em>Hill</em> case would appear to be unexceptional.  The defendant in <em>Hill</em> was a state agency protected from suit in a federal court by the Eleventh Amendment.  <em>See Quern v. Jordan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/332/case.html">440 U.

The anomaly identified by the State Supreme Court, and by the various state courts which it cited, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] that a State might be forced to entertain in its own courts suits from which it was immune in federal court, is thus fully met by our decision in <em>Will.  Will</em> establishes that the State and arms of the State, which have traditionally enjoyed Eleventh Amendment immunity, are not subject to suit under \xc2\xa7 1983 in either federal court or state court.</p>\n<p>The language and reasoning of the State Supreme Court, if not its precise holding, however, went further.  That further step was completed by the District Court of Appeal in this case.  As it construed the law, Florida has extended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="366">Page 496 U.

That holding raises the concern that the state court may be evading federal law and discriminating against federal causes of action.

The requirement that a state court of competent jurisdiction treat federal law as the law of the land does not necessarily include within it a requirement that the State create a court competent to hear the case in which the federal claim is presented.

In <em>Mondou,</em> for example, we held that rights under the Federal Employers\' Liability Act (FELA) "may be enforced, as of right, in the courts of the States when their jurisdiction, as prescribed by local laws, is adequate to the occasion."  223 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/223/59/case.html">223 U.

The Rhode Island court had distinguished our decisions in <em>McKnett</em> and <em>Mondou</em> on the grounds that the federal act was a "penal statute," which would not have been enforceable under the Full Faith and Credit Clause if passed by another State.

We observed that the Rhode Island court enforced the "same type of claim" arising under state law and claims for double damages under federal law.  330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html#394">330 U.

Petitioner argues that the court adopted a substantive rule of decision that state agencies are not subject to liability under \xc2\xa7 1983.  Respondent, stressing the court\'s language that it had not "opened its own courts for federal actions against the state," 537 So.2d at 708, argues that the case simply involves the court\'s refusal to take cognizance of \xc2\xa7 1983 actions against state defendants.  We conclude that, whether the question is framed in preemption terms, as petitioner would have it, or in the obligation to assume jurisdiction over a "federal" cause of action, as respondent would have it, the Florida court\'s refusal to entertain one discrete category of \xc2\xa7 1983 claims, when the court entertains similar state law actions against state defendants, violates the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p>If the District Court of Appeal meant to hold that governmental entities subject to \xc2\xa7 1983 liability enjoy an immunity over and above those already provided in \xc2\xa7 1983, that holding directly violates federal law.  The elements of, and the defenses to, a federal cause of action are defined by federal law.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/330/case.html">486 U.

Casey,</em> we followed <em>Martinez</em> and held that a Wisconsin notice-of-claim statute that effectively shortened the statute of limitations and imposed an exhaustion requirement on claims against public agencies and employees was preempted insofar as it was applied to \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.  After observing that the lower federal courts, with one exception, had determined that notice of claim statutes were inapplicable to \xc2\xa7 1983 actions brought in federal courts, we stated that such a consensus also demonstrated that</p>\n<p>"enforcement of the notice-of-claim statute in \xc2\xa7 1983 actions brought in state court . . . interfer[ed] with and frustrat[ed] the substantive right Congress created."</p>\n<p>487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/131/case.html#151">487 U.

Praprotnik,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/112/case.html">485 U.

Florida law, as interpreted by the District Court of Appeal, would make all such defendants absolutely immune from liability under the federal statute.  To the extent that the Florida law of sovereign immunity reflects a substantive disagreement with the extent to which governmental entities should be held liable for their constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 496 U. S. 378</a></p><p> violations, that disagreement cannot override the dictates of federal law.</p>\n<p>"Congress surely did not intend to assign to state courts and legislatures a conclusive role in the formative function of defining and characterizing the essential elements of a federal cause of action."</p>\n<p><em>Wilson v.

Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Burnette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/239/199/case.html">239 U.

This case does not present the questions whether Congress can require the States to create a forum with the capacity to enforce federal statutory rights or to authorize service of process on parties who would not otherwise be subject to the court\'s jurisdiction. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The State of Florida has constituted the Circuit Court for Pinellas County as a court of general jurisdiction. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  It exercises jurisdiction over tort claims by private citizens against state entities (including school boards) of the size and type of petitioner\'s claim here, and it can enter judgment against them.  That court also exercises jurisdiction over \xc2\xa7 1983 actions against individual officers, [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] and is fully competent to provide the remedies the federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 496 U. S. 379</a></p><p> statute requires.  <em>Cf. Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/case.html">396 U. S. 229</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/case.html#238">396 U. S. 238</a></span> (1969).  Petitioner has complied with all the state law procedures for invoking the jurisdiction of that court.</p>\n<p>The mere facts, as argued by respondent\'s <em>amici,</em> that state common law and statutory law do not make unlawful the precise conduct that \xc2\xa7 1983 addresses and that \xc2\xa7 1983 actions "are more likely to be frivolous than are other suits," Brief for Washington Legal Foundation <em>et al.</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 17, clearly cannot provide sufficient justification for the State\'s refusal to entertain such actions.  These reasons have never been asserted by the State, and are not asserted by the school board.  More importantly, they are not the kind of neutral policy that could be a "valid excuse" for the state court\'s refusal to entertain federal actions.  To the extent that the Florida rule is based upon the judgment that parties who are otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the court should not be held liable for activity that would not subject them to liability under state law, we understand that to be only another way of saying that the court disagrees with the content of federal law.  Sovereign immunity in Florida turns on the nature of the claim -- whether the duty allegedly breached is discretionary -- not on the subject matter of the dispute.  There is no question that the Circuit Court, which entertains state common law and statutory claims against state entities in a variety of their capacities, ranging from law enforcement to schooling to the protection of individuals using parking lots, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] has jurisdiction over the subject of this suit.  That court cannot reject petitioner\'s \xc2\xa7 1983 claim </p><p><a class="page-number" name="380">Page 496 U. S. 380</a></p><p> because it has chosen, for substantive policy reasons, not to adjudicate other claims which might also render the school board liable.  The federal law is law in the State as much as laws passed by the state legislature.  A</p>\n<p>"state court cannot \'refuse to enforce the right arising from the law of the United States because of conceptions of impolicy or want of wisdom on the part of Congress in having called into play its lawful powers.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Testa,</em> 330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html#393">330 U. S. 393</a></span> (quoting <em>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis,</em> 241 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/241/211/case.html#222">241 U. S. 222</a></span>).</p>\n<p>The argument by <em>amici</em> that suits predicated on federal law are more likely to be frivolous and have less of an entitlement to the State\'s limited judicial resources warrants little response.  A State may adopt neutral procedural rules to discourage frivolous litigation of all kinds, as long as those rules are not preempted by a valid federal law.  A State may not, however, relieve congestion in its courts by declaring a whole category of federal claims to be frivolous.  Until it has been proven that the claim has no merit, that judgment is not up to the States to make.</p>\n<p>Respondent has offered no neutral or valid excuse for the Circuit Court\'s refusal to hear \xc2\xa7 1983 actions against state entities.  The Circuit Court would have had jurisdiction if the defendant were an individual officer and the action was based on \xc2\xa7 1983.  It would also have had jurisdiction over the defendant school board if the action were based on established state common law or statutory law.  A state policy that permits actions against state agencies for the failure of their officials to adequately police a parking lot and for the negligence of such officers in arresting a person on a roadside, but yet declines jurisdiction over federal actions for constitutional violations by the same persons can be based only on the rationale that such persons should not be held liable for \xc2\xa7 1983 violations in the courts of the State.  That reason, whether presented in terms of direct disagreement with substantive federal law or simple refusal to take cognizance of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 496 U. S. 381</a></p><p> the federal cause of action, flatly violates the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent offers two final arguments in support of the judgment of the District Court of Appeal. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  First, at oral argument -- but not in its brief -- it argued that a federal court has no power to compel a state court to entertain a claim over which the state court has no jurisdiction as a matter of state law.  Second, respondent argues that sovereign immunity is not a creature of state law, but of long-established legal principles which have not been set aside by \xc2\xa7 1983.  We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p>The fact that a rule is denominated jurisdictional does not provide a court an excuse to avoid the obligation to enforce federal law if the rule does not reflect the concerns of power over the person and competence over the subject matter that jurisdictional rules are designed to protect.  It is settled that a court of otherwise competent jurisdiction may not avoid its parallel obligation under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to entertain another State\'s cause of action by invocation of the term "jurisdiction."  <em>See First Nat.

[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Similarly, a State may not evade the strictures of the Privileges and Immunities Clause by denying jurisdiction to a court otherwise competent.  <em>See Angel v.

As our discussion of <em>Testa, McKnett,</em> and <em>Mondou</em> establishes, the same is true with respect to a state court\'s obligations under the Supremacy Clause. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The force </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 496 U. S. 383</a></p><p> of the Supremacy Clause is not so weak that it can be evaded by mere mention of the word "jurisdiction."  Indeed, if this argument had merit, the State of Wisconsin could overrule our decision in <em>Felder v. Casey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/131/case.html">487 U. S. 131</a></span> (1988), by simply amending its notice of claims statute to provide that no state court would have jurisdiction of an action in which the plaintiff failed to give the required notice.  The Supremacy Clause requires more than that.</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s argument that Congress did not intend to abrogate an immunity with an ancient common law heritage is the same argument, in slightly different dress, as the argument that we have already rejected that the States are free to redefine the federal cause of action.  Congress did take common law principles into account in providing certain forms of absolute and qualified immunity, <em>see Wood v. Strickland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/308/case.html">420 U. S. 308</a></span> (1975); <em>Scheuer v.

Jordan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/332/case.html">440 U. S. 332</a></span> (1979).  But as to persons that Congress subjected to liability, individual States may not exempt such persons from federal liability by relying on their own common law heritage.  If we were to uphold the immunity claim in this case, every State would have the same opportunity to extend the mantle of sovereign immunity to "persons" who would otherwise be subject to \xc2\xa7 1983 liability.  States would then be free to nullify for their own people the legislative decisions that Congress has made on behalf of all the People.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p>"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The defendants did not call into question the school board\'s potential liability if the actions of the school officials violated the Constitution.

On that hypothesis, state courts would be subject to the ultimate superintendence of federal courts which would vacate judgments entered in violation of federal law, just as they might overturn unconstitutional state legislative or executive decisions.  Federal courts would exercise a superior authority to enforce and apply the Constitution and laws passed pursuant to it.  <em>See</em> Wechsler, The Appellate Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court:  Reflections on the Law and the Logistics of Direct Review, 34 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 1043, 1047 (1977) (describing, and rejecting, alternative view of Supremacy Clause, as intrusion on state autonomy).</p>\n<p>The language of the Supremacy Clause --  which directs that "the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding," -- and our cases confirm that state courts have the coordinate authority and consequent responsibility to enforce the Supreme Law of the Land.  Early in our history, in support of the Court\'s power of review over state courts, Justice Story anticipated that such courts</p>\n<p>"in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction . . . would incidentally take cognizance of cases arising under the constitution, the laws, and treaties of the United States,"</p>\n<p><em>Martin v.

But that ruling in no sense implied that the duty which was declared to exist on the part of the state court depended upon the conception that for the purpose of enforcing the right the state court was to be treated as a Federal court deriving its authority not from the State creating it, but from the United States.  On the contrary, the principle upon which the <em>Mondou Case</em> rested, while not questioning the diverse governmental sources from which state and national courts drew their authority, recognized the unity of the governments, national and state, and the common fealty of all courts, both state and national, to both state and national constitutions, and the duty resting upon them, when it was within the scope of their authority, to protect and enforce rights lawfully created, without reference to the particular government from whose exercise of lawful power the right arose."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/241/211/case.html#222">241 U.
