The ensuing fire severely damaged the home. Jones was convicted in the District Court of violating, <i>inter alia, </i>18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 844(i), which makes it a federal crime to "maliciously damag[e] or destro[y], ... by means of fire or an explosive, any building ... used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce."

But \xc2\xa7 844(i) contains the qualifying words "used in" a commerce-affecting activity. The key word is "used." Congress did not define the crime as the explosion of a building whose damage or destruction might affect interstate commerce, but required that the damaged or destroyed property itself have been used in commerce or in an activity affecting commerce. The proper inquiry, therefore, is into the function of the building itself, and then into whether that function affects interstate commerce. The Court rejects the Government\'s argument that the Indiana residence involved in this case was constantly "used" in at least three "activit[ies] affecting commerce": (1) it was "used" as collateral to obtain and secure a mortgage from an Oklahoma lender, who, in turn, "used" it as security for the loan; (2) it was "used" to obtain from a Wisconsin insurer a casualty insurance policy, which safeguarded the interests of the homeowner and the mortgagee; and (3) it was "used" to receive natural gas from sources outside Indiana.

It surely is not the common perception that a private, owner-occupied residence is "used" in the "activity" of receiving natural gas, a mortgage, or an insurance policy. Cf. <i>id., </i>at 145. The Government does not allege that the residence here served as a home office or the locus of any commercial undertaking. The home\'s only "active employment," so far as the record reveals, was for the everyday living of Jones\'s cousin and his family. <i>Russell </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/858/case.html">471 U.

The Court there observed that "[b]y its terms," \xc2\xa7 844(i) applies only to "property that is \'used\' in an \'activity\' that affects commerce," and ruled that "the rental of real estate" fits that description, <i>ibid. </i>Here, the homeowner did not use his residence in any trade or business. Were the Court to adopt the Government\'s expansive interpretation, hardly a building in the land would fall outside \xc2\xa7 844(i)\'s domain, and the statute\'s limiting language, "used in," would have no office.

No one was injured in the ensuing fire, but the blaze severely damaged the home. A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment charging Jones with arson, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 844(i) (1994 ed., Supp. IV); using a destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence (the arson), 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 924(c); and making an illegal destructive device, 26 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 5861(f). Jones was tried under that indictment in the Northern District of Indiana and convicted by a jury on all three counts.1 The District Court sentenced him, pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, to a total prison term of 35 years, to be followed by five years of supervised release. The court also ordered Jones to pay $77,396.87 to the insurer of the damaged home as restitution for its loss.

First, the homeowner "used" the dwelling as collateral to obtain and secure a mortgage from an Oklahoma lender; the lender, in turn, "used" the property as security for the home loan. Second, the homeowner "used" the residence to obtain a casualty insurance policy from a Wisconsin insurer. That policy, the Government points out, safeguarded the interests of the homeowner and the mortgagee. Third, the homeowner "used" the dwelling to receive natural gas from sources outside Indiana. See Brief for United States 19-23.</p><p>The Government correctly observes that \xc2\xa7 844(i) excludes no particular type of building (it covers "any building"); the provision does, however, require that the building be "used" in an activity affecting commerce. That qualification is most sensibly read to mean active employment for commercial purposes, and not merely a passive, passing, or past connection to commerce. Although "variously defined," the word "use," in legislation as in conversation, ordinarily signifies "active employment." <i>Bailey </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/516/137/case.html">516 U.

The panel majority considered adequate either of two interstate commerce connections: the building was owned and leased by out-ofstate parties, and received natural gas from across state borders. The panel added, however, that it would not extend the decision "to property which is purely private in nature, such as a privately owned home, used solely for residential purposes." 9 F. 3d, at 666-667.

The Government does not allege that the Indiana residence involved in this case served as a home office or the locus of any commercial undertaking. The home\'s only "active employment," so far as the record reveals, was for the everyday living of Jones\'s cousin and his family.</p><p>Our decision in <i>Russell </i>does not warrant a less "use" -centered reading of \xc2\xa7 844(i). In that case, which involved the arson of property rented out by its owner, see <i>supra, </i>at 853, the Court referred to the recognized distinction between legislation limited to activities "in commerce" and legislation invoking Congress\' full power over activity substantially "affecting ... commerce." 471 U. S., at 859860, and n. 4. The <i>Russell </i>opinion went on to observe, however, that "[b]y its terms," \xc2\xa7 844(i) applies only to "property that is \'used\' in an \'activity\' that affects commerce." <i>Id., </i>at 862. "The rental of real estate," the Court then stated, "is unquestionably such an activity." <i>Ibid.</i>s Here, as earlier emphasized, the owner used the property as his home, the center of his family life. He did not use the residence in any trade or business.</p><p>8 Notably, the Court in <i>Russell </i>did not rest its holding on the expansive interpretation advanced by the Government both in <i>Russell </i>and in this case.

Practically every building in our cities, towns, and rural areas is constructed with supplies that have moved in interstate commerce, served by utilities that have an interstate connection, financed or insured by enterprises that do business across state lines, or bears some other trace of interstate commerce. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>FERC v. <i>Mississippi, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/case.html">456 U.

If such connections sufficed to trigger \xc2\xa7 844(i), the statute\'s limiting language, "used in" any commerce-affecting activity, would have no office.

In <i>Lopez, </i>this Court invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act, former 18 U. S.

The defendant in that case, a 12thgrade student, had been convicted for knowingly possessing a concealed handgun and bullets at his San Antonio, Texas, high school, in violation of the federal Act. Holding that the Act exceeded Congress\' power to regulate commerce, the Court stressed that the area was one of traditional state concern, see 514 U. S., at 561, n. 3, 567; <i>id., </i>at 577 (KENNEDY, J., concurring), and that the legislation aimed at activity in which "neither the actors nor their conduct has a commercial character," <i>id., </i>at 580 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); <i>id., </i>at 560562 (opinion of the Court).</p><p>Given the concerns brought to the fore in <i>Lopez, </i>it is appropriate to avoid the constitutional question that would arise were we to read \xc2\xa7 844(i) to render the "traditionally local criminal conduct" in which petitioner Jones engaged "a matter for federal enforcement." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Bass, 404 </i>U. S. 336, 350 (1971). Our comprehension of \xc2\xa7 844(i) is additionally reinforced by other interpretive guides. We have instructed that "ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity," <i>Rewis </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/808/case.html">401 U. S. 808</a>, 812 (1971), and that "when choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite," <i>United States </i>v. <i>Universal </i>C. 1. <i>T. Credit Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/218/case.html">344 U. S. 218</a>, 221-222 (1952). We have cautioned, as well, that "unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance" in the prosecution of crimes. <i>Bass, </i>404 U. S., at 349. To read \xc2\xa7 844(i) as encompassing the arson of an owneroccupied private home would effect such a change, for arson is a paradigmatic common-law state crime. See generally Poulos, The Metamorphosis of the Law of Arson, 51 Mo. L.

We hold that the provision covers only property currently used in commerce or in an activity affecting commerce. The home owned and occupied by petitioner Jones\'s cousin was not so used-it was a dwelling place used for everyday family living. As we read \xc2\xa7 844(i), Congress left cases of this genre to the law enforcement authorities of the States.</p><p>Our holding that \xc2\xa7 844(i) does not cover the arson of an owner-occupied dwelling means that Jones\'s \xc2\xa7 844(i) conviction must be vacated.

It also seems appropriate, however, to emphasize the kinship between our well-established presumption against federal pre-emption of state law, see <i>Ray </i>v. <i>Atlantic Richfield Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html">435 U. S. 151</a>, 157 (1978), and our reluctance to "believe Congress intended to authorize federal intervention in local law enforcement in a marginal case such as this." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Altobella, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/442/310/">442 F.2d 310</a>, 316 <i>(CA7 1971). </i>The fact that petitioner received a sentence of 35 years in prison when the maximum penalty for the comparable state offense was only 10 years, Ind. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 35-43-1-1, 35-502-5 (1993), illustrates how a criminal law like this may effectively displace a policy choice made by the State.
