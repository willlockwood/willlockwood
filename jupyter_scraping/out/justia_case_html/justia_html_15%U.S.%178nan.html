And on the same day, Messrs.

Said Girault asked if there was any news which was calculated to enhance the price or value of the article about to be purchased, and that the said purchase was then and there made, and the bill of parcels annexed to the plaintiff\'s petition delivered to the plaintiff between 8 and 9 o\'clock in the morning of that day, and that in consequence of said news the value of said article had risen from 30 to 50 percent.  There being no evidence that the plaintiff had asserted or suggested anything to the said Girault calculated to impose upon him with respect to said news and to induce him to think or believe that it did not exist, and it appearing that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 15 U.

CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question in this case is whether the intelligence of extrinsic circumstances, which might influence the price of the commodity and which was exclusively within the knowledge of the vendee, ought to have been communicated by him to the vendor.  The Court is of opinion that he was not bound to communicate it.  It would be difficult to circumscribe the contrary doctrine within proper limits where the means of intelligence are equally accessible to both parties.  But at the same time, each party must take care not to say or do anything tending to impose upon the other.  The Court thinks that the absolute instruction of the judge was erroneous, and that the question, whether any imposition was practiced by the vendee upon the vendor ought to have been submitted to the jury.  For these reasons, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court of Louisiana with directions to award a <em>venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n<p><em>Venire de novo awarded.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
