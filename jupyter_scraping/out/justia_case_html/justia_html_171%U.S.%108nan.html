As between the other parties, the judgment of the supreme court of New York was, of course, left undisturbed, and it is not perceived that the terms of the mandate signify anything else or imply the consequences suggested by counsel.</p>\n<p><em>The motion is denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
