The judgment is one of reversal only, and the case is remanded to be proceeded with according to law.  The supreme court decided that the defense set forth in the peremptory exception was not good, and that is all that court decided.  The case was therefore sent back for trial upon the defenses set up in the answer, or any other that might be properly presented.  If the decision below upon the exception had been correct, such a trial would have been unnecessary.  The supreme court having decided that it was not correct, the inferior court must now proceed further.  This brings the case within our ruling at the present term in <em>Ex Parte French, supra,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/91/423/case.html">91 U.
