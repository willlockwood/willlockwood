Until 1972, when the statute was amended to eliminate the distinction, "elapsed years" depended upon the wage earner\'s sex.  Section 215(b)(3) prescribed that the number of "elapsed years" for a male wage earner would be three higher than for an otherwise similarly situated female wage earner; for a male, the number of "elapsed years" equaled the number of years that elapsed after 1950 and before the year in which he became 65, whereas, for a female, the number of "elapsed years" equaled the number of years that elapsed after 1950 and before the year in which she became 62.  Accordingly, a female could exclude from the computation of her "average monthly wage" three more lower earning years than a similarly situated male could exclude, and this would result in a slightly higher "average monthly wage" and correspondingly higher monthly old-age benefits for the retired female wage earner.

Thus, allowing women, who as such have been unfairly hindered from earning as much as men, to eliminate additional low-earning years from the calculation of their retirement benefits works directly to remedy some part of the effect of past discrimination. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Cf. Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/498/case.html#508">419 U. S. 508</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The legislative history of \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3) also reveals that Congress directly addressed the justification for differing treatment of men and women in the former version of that section and purposely enacted the more favorable treatment for female wage earners to compensate for past employment discrimination against women.  Before 1956, the sexes were treated equally by \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3); the computation it required turned on the attainment of "retirement age," which was then defined in 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 416(a) (1952 ed.) as 65 for both sexes. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In 1956, however, retirement age was redefined as 62 for women and 65 for men, Social Security Amendments of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="319">Page 430 U. S. 319</a></p><p> 1956, \xc2\xa7 102(a), 70 Stat. 809, thereby changing the calculation under \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3).  A House Report emphasizes that this reduction in the retirement age for women was purposely made to remedy discrimination against women in the job market:</p>\n<p>"Your committee believes that the age of eligibility should be reduced to 62 for women workers. . . .  A recent study by the United States Employment Service in the Department of Labor showed that age limits are applied more frequently to job openings for women than for men, and that the age limits applied are lower."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 1189, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (1955). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The effect of this change on \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3) was also discussed in connection with the amendment of that section in 1961. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Social Security Amendments of 1961, \xc2\xa7 102(d)(2), 75 Stat. 135.  During the hearings on that amendment, Representative Watts asked why a woman would draw more benefits than a similarly situated man.  After it was noted that this did not change the law as it had existed since 1956, Representative Boggs confirmed that the difference in treatment was not inadvertent:</p>\n<p>"If I may interrupt, I think we went into this at great length some years ago when we adopted the 62-year provision for women and the theory was that a woman at that age was less apt to have employment opportunities than a man, and despite the fact of some statistics to the effect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="320">Page 430 U. S. 320</a></p><p> that women live longer than men, I think the other fact is equally commanding, so there is some justification for a distinction between men and women."</p>\n<p>Executive Hearings on Social Security Amendments of 1961, before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 146-147 (1961).  Thus, the legislative history is clear that the differing treatment of men and women in former \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3) was not "the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about females," <em>Califano v. Goldfarb, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/199/case.html#223">430 U. S. 223</a></span> (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment), but rather was deliberately enacted to compensate for particular economic disabilities suffered by women.</p>\n<p>That Congress changed its mind in 1972 and equalized the treatment of men and women does not, as the District Court concluded, constitute an admission by Congress that its previous policy was invidiously discriminatory.  413 F.Supp. at 129.  Congress has in recent years legislated directly upon the subject of unequal treatment of women in the job market. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Congress may well have decided that "[t]hese congressional reforms . . . have lessened the economic justification for the more favorable benefit computation formula in \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3)."  <em>Kohr v. Weinberger,</em> 378 F.Supp. 1299, 1305 (ED Pa.1974), <em>vacated on other grounds,</em> 422 U.S. 1050 (1975).  Moreover, elimination of the more favorable benefit computation for women wage earners, even in the remedial context, is wholly consistent with those reforms, which require equal treatment of men and women in preference to the attitudes of "romantic paternalism" that have contributed to the "long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination."  <em>Frontiero v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/677/case.html">411 U.

Weinberger,</em> 378 F.Supp. 1299 (ED Pa.1974), <em>vacated on other grounds,</em> 422 U.S. 1050 (1975); <em>Polelle v. Secretary of HEW,</em> 386 F.Supp. 443 (ND Ill.1974); <em>McEvoy v. Weinberger,</em> CCH Unempl.Ins.Rep. p. 17,414 (SD Fla., Aug. 28, 1973).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Even with the advantage provided by former \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3), women on the average received lower retirement benefits than men.  "As of December, 1972, the average monthly retirement insurance benefit for males was \xc2\xa7179.60 and for females, \xc2\xa7140.50."  <em>Polelle v. Secretary of HEW, supra</em> at 444 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>At that time, the calculation of the "average monthly wage" under \xc2\xa7 215(b) was somewhat different from the scheme set out in  <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra,</em> which was not adopted until Social Security Amendments of 1960, \xc2\xa7 303(a), 74 Stat. 960.  The role of \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3) in the computation was similar under the old scheme, however, and the differences between the old and new methods of computation are essentially irrelevant to the effect of the 1956 change in the definition of retirement age on \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Congress deliberately adopted the change notwithstanding the argument urged upon it that reducing the retirement age would not benefit women.  S.Rep. No. 2133, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., 14-15 (1956).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1961, in connection with the extension of reduced retirement benefits to men at age 62, the definition of retirement age in 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 416(a) was repealed, and the differing ages for the computation of "elapsed years" under \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3) were written explicitly into that section for the first time.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 102(c)(1), 102(d)(2), 75 Stat. 134, 135.  It was at that time that \xc2\xa7 215(b)(3) took on the form it was to retain until 1972.  <em>See </em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">nn</a> 1-2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000(d); Civil Rights Act of 1964, \xc2\xa7 703(a), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(a).</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>While I am happy to concur in the Court\'s judgment, I find it somewhat difficult to distinguish the Social Security provision upheld here from that struck down so recently in <em>Califano v. Goldfarb, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/199/case.html">430 U. S. 199</a></span>.  Although the distinction drawn by the Court between this case and <em>Goldfarb</em> is not totally lacking in substance, I question whether certainty in the law is promoted by hinging the validity of important statutory schemes on whether five Justices view them to be more akin to the "offensive" provisions struck down in <em>Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/636/case.html">420 U. S. 636</a></span> (1975), and <em>Frontiero v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/677/case.html">411 U. S. 677</a></span> (1973), or more like the "benign" provisions upheld in <em>Schlesinger v. Ballard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/498/case.html">419 U. S. 498</a></span> (1975), and <em>Kahn v. Shevin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/351/case.html">416 U. S. 351</a></span> (1974).  I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court for reasons stated by MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST in his dissenting opinion in <em>Goldfarb,</em> in which MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and I joined.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
