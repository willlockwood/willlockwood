In a boxed-off section occupying most of two pages, respondent commented on "some loudspeakers of special interest," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 466 U. S. 488</a></p><p> one of which was the Bose 901 -- an admittedly "unique and unconventional" system that had recently been placed on the market by petitioner. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  After describing the system and some of its virtues, and after noting that a listener "could pinpoint the location of various instruments much more easily with a standard speaker than with the Bose system," respondent\'s article made the following statements:</p>\n<p>"Worse, individual instruments heard through the Bose system seemed to grow to gigantic proportions and tended to wander about the room.  For instance, a violin appeared to be 10 feet wide and a piano stretched from wall to wall.  With orchestral music, such effects seemed inconsequential.  But we think they might become annoying when listening to soloists."</p>\n<p>Plaintiff\'s Exhibit 2, p. 274.  After stating opinions concerning the overall sound quality, the article concluded:</p>\n<p>"We think the Bose system is so unusual that a prospective buyer must listen to it and judge it for himself.  We would suggest delaying so big an investment until you were sure the system would please you after the novelty value had worn off."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 275.</p>\n<p>Petitioner took exception to numerous statements made in the article, and when respondent refused to publish a retraction, petitioner commenced this product disparagement action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  After a protracted period of pretrial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 466 U. S. 489</a></p><p> discovery, the District Court denied respondent\'s motion for summary judgment, 84 F.R.D. 682 (1980), and conducted a 19-day bench trial on the issue of liability.  In its lengthy, detailed opinion on the merits of the case, 508 F.Supp. 1249 (1981), the District Court ruled in respondent\'s favor on most issues. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Most significantly, the District Court ruled that the petitioner is a "public figure" as that term is defined in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html">Gertz</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 466 U.

First, it found that one sentence in the article contained a "false" statement of "fact" concerning the tendency of the instruments to wander. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Based primarily on testimony by the author of the article, the District Court found that instruments heard through the speakers tended to wander "along the wall," rather than "about the room" as reported by respondent. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Second, it found that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 466 U. S. 491</a></p><p> the statement was disparaging.  Third, it concluded,</p>\n<p>"on the basis of proof which it considers clear and convincing, that the plaintiff has sustained its burden of proving that the defendant published a false statement of material fact with the knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity."</p>\n<p>508 F.Supp. at 1277. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Judgment was entered for petitioner on the product disparagement claim. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed.  692 F.2d 189 (1982).  The court accepted the finding that the comment about wandering instruments was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 466 U. S. 492</a></p><p> disparaging.  It assumed, without deciding, that the statement was one of fact, rather than opinion, and that it was false, observing that,</p>\n<p>"stemming at least in part from the uncertain nature of the statement as one of fact or opinion, it is difficult to determine with confidence whether it is true or false."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 194.  After noting that petitioner did not contest the conclusion that it was a public figure, or the applicability of the <em>New York Times</em> standard, the Court of Appeals held that its review of the "actual malice" determination was not "limited" to the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a); instead, it stated that it</p>\n<p>"must perform a <em>de novo</em> review, independently examining the record to ensure that the district court has applied properly the governing constitutional law and that the plaintiff has indeed satisfied its burden of proof."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 195.  It added, however, that it "[was] in no position to consider the credibility of witnesses, and must leave questions of demeanor to the trier of fact."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Based on its own review of the record, the Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<p>"[W]e are unable to find clear and convincing evidence that CU published the statement that individual instruments tended to wander about the room with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.  The evidence presented merely shows that the words in the article may not have described precisely what the two panelists heard during the listening test.  CU was guilty of using imprecise language in the article -- perhaps resulting from an attempt to produce a readable article for its mass audience.  Certainly this does not support an inference of actual malice."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 197. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="493">Page 466 U. S. 493</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to consider whether the Court of Appeals erred when it refused to apply the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a) to the District Court\'s "finding" of actual malice.  461 U.S. 904 (1983).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>To place the issue in focus, it is necessary to state in somewhat greater detail (a) the evidence on the "actual malice" issue; and (b) the basis for the District Court\'s determination.</p>\n<p><em>Evidence of Actual Malice.</em></p>\n<p>At trial, petitioner endeavored to prove that the key sentence embodied three distinct falsehoods about instruments heard through the Bose system:  (1) that their size seemed grossly enlarged; (2) that they seemed to move; and (3) that their movement was "about the room."</p>\n<p>Although a great deal of the evidence concerned the first two points, the District Court found that neither was false.  It concluded that the average reader would understand that the reference to enlarged instruments was intended to describe the size of the area from which the sound seemed to emanate, rather than to any perception about the actual size of the musical instruments being played, rejecting as "absurd" the notion that readers would interpret the figurative language literally.  508 F.Supp. at 1266. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  After referring to testimony explaining that</p>\n<p>"a certain degree of movement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 466 U. S. 494</a></p><p> of the location of the apparent sound source is to be expected with all stereo loudspeaker systems, \' the District Court recognized that the statement was accurate insofar as it reported that \'instruments . . . tended to wander. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1267.  Thus, neither the reference to the apparent size of the instruments nor the reference to the fact that instruments appeared to move was false. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The statement that instruments tended to wander "about the room" was found false because what the listeners in the test actually perceived was an apparent movement back and forth along the wall in front of them and between the two speakers.  Because an apparent movement "about the room" -- rather than back and forth -- would be so different from what the average listener has learned to expect, the District Court concluded that "the location of the movement of the apparent sound source is just as critical to a reader as the fact that movement occurred."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The evidence concerning respondent\'s knowledge of this falsity focused on Arnold Seligson, an engineer employed by respondent.  Seligson supervised the test of the Bose 901 and prepared the written report upon which the published article was based.  His initial in-house report contained this sentence:</p>\n<p>"\'Instruments not only could not be placed with precision, but appeared to suffer from giganticism and a tendency to wander around the room; a violin seemed about 10 ft. wide, a piano stretched from wall to wall, etc.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1264, n. 28.  Since the editorial revision from "around the room" to "about the room" did not change the meaning of the false statement, and since there was no evidence that the editors were aware of the inaccuracy in the original report, the actual malice determination rests entirely on an evaluation of Seligson\'s state of mind when he wrote his initial report, or when he checked the article against that report. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 466 U. S. 495</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Seligson was deposed before trial, and testified for almost six days at the trial itself.  At one point in his direct examination, he responded at length to technical testimony by Dr. Bose, explaining the scientific explanation for the apparent movement of the source of sound back and forth across a wall.   App. 117-122.  The trial judge then questioned Seligson, and that questioning revealed that the movement which Seligson had heard during the tests was confined to the wall. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  During his cross-examination, at counsel\'s request he drew a rough sketch of the movement of the sound source that he intended to describe with the words "tended to wander about the room"; that sketch revealed a back and forth movement along the wall between the speakers.  He was then asked:</p>\n<p>"Q. Mr. Seligson, why did you use the words \'tended to wander about the room\' to describe what you have drawn on the board?"</p>\n<p>"A. Well, I don\'t know what made me pick that particular choice of words.  Would you have been more satisfied </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 466 U. S. 496</a></p><p> if we said \'across,\' -- I think not -- instead of before.  I have the feeling you would have objected in either event.  The word \'about\' meant just as I drew it on the board.  Now, I so testified in my deposition."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 169. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p><em>The District Court\'s Actual Malice Determination.</em></p>\n<p>The District Court\'s reasons for finding falsity in the description of the location of the movement of the wandering instruments provided the background for its ruling on actual malice.  The court concluded that "no reasonable reader" would understand the sentence as describing lateral movement along the wall.  Because the "average reader" would interpret the word "about" according to its "plain ordinary meaning," the District Court unequivocally rejected Seligson\'s testimony -- and respondent\'s argument -- that the sentence, when read in context, could be understood to refer to lateral movement. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 466 U. S. 497</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On similar reasoning, the District Court found Seligson\'s above-quoted explanation of the intended meaning of the sentence incredible.  The District Court reasoned:</p>\n<p>"Thus, according to Seligson, the words used in the Article -- \'About the room\' -- mean something different to him than they do to the populace in general.  If Seligson is to be believed, at the time of publication of the Article, he interpreted, and he still interprets today, the words \'about the room\' to mean \'along the wall.\'  After careful consideration of Seligson\'s testimony and of his demeanor at trial, the Court finds that Seligson\'s testimony on this point is not credible.  Seligson is an intelligent person whose knowledge of the English language cannot be questioned.  It is simply impossible for the Court to believe that he interprets a commonplace word such as \'about\' to mean anything other than its plain ordinary meaning."</p>\n<p>"Based on the above finding that Seligson\'s testimony to the contrary is not credible, the Court further finds that, at the time of the Article\'s publication, Seligson knew that the words \'individual instruments . . . tended to wander about the room\' did not accurately describe the effects that he and Lefkow had heard during the \'special listening test.\'  Consequently, the Court concludes, on the basis of proof which it considers clear and convincing, that the plaintiff has sustained its burden of proving that the defendant published a false statement of material fact with the knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity."</p>\n<p>508 F.Supp. at 1276-1277. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 466 U.

Even though the District Court found it impossible to believe that Seligson -- at the time of trial -- was truthfully maintaining that the words "about the room" could fairly be read, in context, to describe lateral movement, rather than irregular movement throughout the room, the District Court did not identify any independent evidence that Seligson realized the inaccuracy of the statement, or entertained serious doubts about its truthfulness, at the time of publication.

Although such statements have been made most frequently in cases to which Rule 52(a) does not apply because they arose in state courts, respondent argues that the constitutional principle is equally applicable to federal litigation.  We quite agree; surely it would pervert the concept of federalism for this Court to lay claim to a broader power of review over state court judgments than it exercises in reviewing the judgments of intermediate federal courts.</p>\n<p>Our standard of review must be faithful to both Rule 52(a) and the rule of independent review applied in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.</em>  The conflict between the two rules is in some respects more apparent than real.  The <em>New York Times</em> rule emphasizes the need for an appellate court to make an independent examination of the entire record; Rule 52(a) never forbids such an examination, and indeed our seminal decision on the Rule expressly contemplated a review of the entire record, stating that a</p>\n<p>"finding is \'clearly erroneous\' when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/364/case.html#395">333 U. S. 395</a></span> (emphasis supplied).  Moreover, Rule 52(a) commands that "due regard" shall be given to the trial judge\'s opportunity to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 466 U. S. 500</a></p><p> observe the demeanor of the witnesses; the constitutionally based rule of independent review permits this opportunity to be given its due.  Indeed, as we previously observed, the Court of Appeals in this case expressly declined to second-guess the District Judge on the credibility of the witnesses.  The requirement that special deference be given to a trial judge\'s credibility determinations is itself a recognition of the broader proposition that the presumption of correctness that attaches to factual findings is stronger in some cases than in others.  The same "clearly erroneous" standard applies to findings based on documentary evidence as to those based entirely on oral testimony, <em>see United States Gypsum Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/364/case.html#394">333 U. S. 394</a></span>, but the presumption has lesser force in the former situation than in the latter.  Similarly, the standard does not change as the trial becomes longer and more complex, but the likelihood that the appellate court will rely on the presumption tends to increase when trial judges have lived with the controversy for weeks or months, instead of just a few hours. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  One might therefore assume that the cases in which the appellate courts have a duty to exercise </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 466 U. S. 501</a></p><p> independent review are merely those in which the presumption that the trial court\'s ruling is correct is particularly weak.  The difference between the two rules, however, is much more than a mere matter of degree.  For the rule of independent review assigns to judges a constitutional responsibility that cannot be delegated to the trier of fact, whether the factfinding function be performed in the particular case by a jury or by a trial judge.</p>\n<p>Rule 52(a) applies to findings of fact, including those described as "ultimate facts" because they may determine the outcome of litigation.  <em>See Pullman-Standard v. Swint,</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/273/case.html#287">456 U. S. 287</a></span>.  But Rule 52(a) does not inhibit an appellate court\'s power to correct errors of law, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of law and fact, or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunderstanding of the governing rule of law.  <em>See ibid.; Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/844/case.html#855">456 U. S. 855</a></span>, n. 15.  Nor does Rule 52(a) "furnish particular guidance with respect to distinguishing law from fact."  <em>Pullman Standard v. Swint,</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/273/case.html#288">456 U. S. 288</a></span>.  What we have characterized as "the vexing nature" of that distinction, <em>ibid.,</em> does not, however, diminish its importance, or the importance of the principles that require the distinction to be drawn in certain cases. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>In a consideration of the possible application of the distinction to the issue of "actual malice," at least three characteristics of the rule enunciated in the <em>New York Times</em> case are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 466 U. S. 502</a></p><p> relevant.  First, the common law heritage of the rule itself assigns an especially broad role to the judge in applying it to specific factual situations.  Second, the content of the rule is not revealed simply by its literal text, but rather is given meaning through the evolutionary process of common law adjudication; though the source of the rule is found in the Constitution, it is nevertheless largely a judge-made rule of law.  Finally, the constitutional values protected by the rule make it imperative that judges -- and in some cases judges of this Court -- make sure that it is correctly applied.  A few words about each of these aspects of the rule are appropriate.</p>\n<p>The federal rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood unless he proves that the false</p>\n<p>"statement was made with \'actual malice\' -- that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not,"</p>\n<p><em>New York Times,</em> 376 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#279">376 U. S. 279</a></span>-280, has its counterpart in rules previously adopted by a number of state courts and extensively reviewed by scholars for generations. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The earlier defamation cases, in turn, have a kinship to English cases considering the kind of motivation that must be proved to support a common law action for deceit. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  It has long been recognized that the formulation of a rule of this kind "allows the judge the maximum of power in passing judgment in the particular case." [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 466 U. S. 503</a></p><p> Moreover, the exercise of this power is the process through which the rule itself evolves and its integrity is maintained. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  As we have explained, the meaning of some concepts cannot be adequately expressed in a simple statement:</p>\n<p>"These considerations fall short of proving St. Amant\'s reckless disregard for the accuracy of his statements about Thompson.  \'Reckless disregard,\' it is true, cannot be fully encompassed in one infallible definition.  Inevitably its outer limits will be marked out through case-by-case adjudication, as is true with so many legal standards for judging concrete cases, whether the standard is provided by the Constitution, statutes, or case law.  Our cases, however, have furnished meaningful guidance for the further definition of a reckless publication."</p>\n<p><em>St. Amant v. Thompson,</em> 390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/727/case.html#730">390 U. S. 730</a></span>-731.</p>\n<p>When the standard governing the decision of a particular case is provided by the Constitution, this Court\'s role in marking out the limits of the standard through the process of case-by-case adjudication is of special importance.  This process has been vitally important in cases involving restrictions on the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment, particularly in those cases in which it is contended that the communication in issue is within one of the few classes of "unprotected" speech.</p>\n<p>The First Amendment presupposes that the freedom to speak one\'s mind is not only an aspect of individual liberty -- and thus a good unto itself -- but also is essential to the common quest for truth and the vitality of society as a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 466 U.

Nevertheless, there are categories of communication and certain special utterances to which the majestic protection of the First Amendment does not extend, because they</p>\n<p>"are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality."</p>\n<p><em>Chaplinsky v.

In such cases, the Court has regularly conducted an independent review of the record both to be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and to confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits in an effort to ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited.  Providing triers of fact with a general description of the type of communication whose content is unworthy of protection has not, in and of itself, served sufficiently to narrow the category, nor served to eliminate the danger that decisions by triers of fact may inhibit the expression of protected ideas.

Sullivan</em> is a rule of federal constitutional law.  It emerged from the exigency of deciding concrete cases; it is law in its purest form under our common law heritage.  It reflects a deeply held conviction that judges -- and particularly Members of this Court -- must </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 466 U. S. 511</a></p><p> exercise such review in order to preserve the precious liberties established and ordained by the Constitution.  The question whether the evidence in the record in a defamation case is of the convincing clarity required to strip the utterance of First Amendment protection is not merely a question for the trier of fact.  Judges, as expositors of the Constitution, must independently decide whether the evidence in the record is sufficient to cross the constitutional threshold that bars the entry of any judgment that is not supported by clear and convincing proof of "actual malice."</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals was correct in its conclusions (1) that there is a significant difference between proof of actual malice [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] and mere proof of falsity, and (2) that such additional proof is lacking in this case.</p>\n<p>The factual portion of the District Court\'s opinion may fairly be read as including the following findings:  (1) Seligson\'s actual perception of the apparent movement of the sound source at the time the Bose 901 was tested was "along the wall," rather than "about the room"; (2) even when the words in the disputed sentence are read in the context of the entire article, neither the "average reader" nor any other intelligent person would interpret the word "about" to mean "across"; (3) Seligson is an intelligent, well-educated person; (4) the words "about the room" have the same meaning for Seligson as they do for the populace in general; and (5) although he was otherwise a credible witness, Seligson\'s testimony that (a) he did not "know what made me pick that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 466 U. S. 512</a></p><p> particular choice of words" and (b) that the word "about" meant what he had drawn on the board, is not credible.</p>\n<p>When the testimony of a witness is not believed, the trier of fact may simply disregard it.  Normally the discredited testimony is not considered a sufficient basis for drawing a contrary conclusion.  <em>See Moore v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/573/case.html">340 U. S. 573</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/573/case.html#575">340 U. S. 575</a></span> (1951).  In this case, the trial judge found it impossible to believe that Seligson continued to maintain that the word "about" meant "across."  Seligson\'s testimony does not rebut any inference of actual malice that the record otherwise supports, but it is equally clear that it does not constitute clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.  Seligson displayed a capacity for rationalization.  He had made a mistake, and, when confronted with it, he refused to admit it and steadfastly attempted to maintain that no mistake had been made -- that the inaccurate was accurate.  That attempt failed, but the fact that he made the attempt does not establish that he realized the inaccuracy at the time of publication.</p>\n<p>Aside from Seligson\'s vain attempt to defend his statement as a precise description of the nature of the sound movement, the only evidence of actual malice on which the District Court relied was the fact that the statement was an inaccurate description of what Seligson had actually perceived.  Seligson of course had insisted "I know what I heard."  The trial court took him at his word, and reasoned that, since he did know what he had heard, and he knew that the meaning of the language employed did not accurately reflect what he heard, he must have realized the statement was inaccurate at the time he wrote it.</p>\n<p>"Analysis of this kind may be adequate when the alleged libel purports to be an eyewitness or other direct account <em>of events that speak for themselves.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Time, Inc. v.

The choice of such language, though reflecting a misconception, does not place the speech beyond the outer limits of the First Amendment\'s broad protective umbrella.

We express no view on that ruling, but having accepted it for purposes of deciding this case, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the difference between hearing violin sounds move around the room and hearing them wander back and forth fits easily within the breathing space that gives life to the First Amendment.  We may accept all of the purely factual findings of the District Court and nevertheless hold as a matter of law that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence that Seligson or his employer prepared the loudspeaker article with knowledge that it contained a false statement, or with reckless disregard of the truth. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 466 U.

Moreover, the analysis of the central legal question before us may seem out of place in a case involving a dispute about the sound quality of a loudspeaker.  But though the question presented reaches us on a somewhat peculiar wavelength, we reaffirm the principle of independent appellate review that we have applied uncounted times before.  We hold that the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not prescribe the standard of review to be applied in reviewing a determination of actual malice in a case governed by <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.</em> [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Appellate judges in such a case must exercise independent judgment and determine whether the record establishes actual malice with convincing clarity.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 466 U.

The law of New York and Massachusetts, viewed by the parties as in accord in this area, governed the product disparagement claim.  508 F.Supp. at 1259, n. 17.  The District Court held that, under the applicable state law, plaintiff had the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the statements in issue were false and disparaging, and also had the burden of establishing actual damages in order to recover.  <em>Id.</em> at 1259-1260.  In addition to the product disparagement claim, petitioner alleged claims for unfair competition and a violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1121.  The District Court held that neither of those claims had been proved.  508 F.Supp. at 1277.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s attack on the article included contentions that it was misleading in referring to two persons as a "panel" and in creating the impression that evaluations of loudspeaker quality are objective, rather than subjective, judgments.  While the District Court agreed with petitioner on these points, it ruled that they did not entitle petitioner to relief.  <em>Id.</em> at 1260-1262.  Petitioner also argued that the overall sound quality of the Bose 901 should have been rated higher by the reviewers.  The District Court rejected this claim, observing that all of the testimony, including that of Dr. Bose, revealed that the evaluation of a speaker\'s "sound quality" or "accuracy" is a "subjective matter," and hence, in the final analysis, is "nothing more than an opinion and, as such, it cannot be proved to be true or false."  <em>Id.</em> at 1262.  The court also found that petitioner had failed to prove false a statement recommending use of an amplifier of 50 watts per channel to achieve the "deepest" bass response with the speakers, observing that the parties had conceded that the power requirements of the speakers were readily and objectively ascertainable.  <em>Id.</em> at 1263-1264.  The court also found that petitioner had failed to prove that the person primarily responsible for the article was biased by reason of his financial interest in eventually marketing a speaker on which he had obtained a patent.  On the other hand, the District Court rejected respondent\'s argument that there could be no actual malice because respondent had no motive to distort the facts; the District Court identified two possible reasons for the disparagement, first, the "scant proof " that respondent had a "built-in bias" against "higher priced products," and second, a suggestion in the testimony that respondent resorted to "sarcasm" to boost circulation.  <em>Id.</em> at 1275-1276.  The District Court did not, however, rely upon these possible motivations as affirmative proof of actual malice.  <em>See id.</em> at 1276-1277.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In its ruling on respondent\'s motion for summary judgment, the District Court had held that the question whether respondent\'s panelists "actually heard instruments grow to gigantic proportions or wander about the room is a question of fact, not opinion. . . ."  84 F.R.D. 682, 684 (1980).  In support of the motion for summary judgment, respondent had submitted an affidavit by one of the panelists, Arnold Seligson, stating that the article accurately reported what was heard in the tests and "I know what I heard," while petitioner had submitted an affidavit by Dr. Bose, who designed the Bose 901, stating in substance that "the phenomenon of widened and wandering instruments . . . is a scientific impossibility."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Although at one point the District Court seemed to suggest that the instruments, <em>i.e.,</em> the sound, did not wander at all, relying on a review in another publication stating that "<em>each instrument has its prescribed space -- and it stays there,</em>" 508 F.Supp. at 1268 (emphasis supplied by the District Court) (citation omitted), the District Court had previously stated that some degree of "movement" of sound between loudspeakers is common to all systems, and its discussion of liability indicates that respondent could have truthfully reported that the sound tended to wander "along the wall," or at least "seemed" to wander along the wall.  It is not entirely clear that the District Court made a finding of fact, as such, regarding where the sound tended to wander.  Indeed, it is not entirely clear that he found as a <em>fact</em> that the sound did not wander about the room.  Rather, as discussed more extensively <em>infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/485/case.html#493">466 U. S. 493</a></span>-497, the finding seemed to be that the "panel" conducting the test did not subjectively perceive the sound to be wandering "about the room," but rather perceived it to be wandering "across the room."  Just where the sound did "wander," in reality, did not appear to be the focus of the decision, though there was conflicting testimony concerning whether it was "scientifically impossible" for sound to wander "about" the room, or to "seem" to wander "about" the room.  <em>See</em> 508 F.Supp. at 1267-1269, 1276-1277.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>In its ruling on the motion for summary judgment, the District Court assumed, without deciding, that the actual malice standard would be applicable in the case, and expressly recognized that falsity alone does not prove that statements were made with actual malice, observing that additional facts are required, and that there must be clear and convincing evidence on this question.  84 F.R.D. at 684-685.  In holding that there was a material issue of "fact" (a label we use advisedly) on actual malice, the District Court recounted petitioner\'s argument that the panelists must have known the statements concerning enlarged and wandering instruments were false because they were false, <em>ibid.</em>  ("[A]ccording to the plaintiff, the panel could not have heard these phenomena, and the statement that they did hear them was false.  The plaintiff further contends that, because Seligson was a member of the listening panel . . . he must have known that the statement was false. . . .").  The court also noted petitioner\'s evidence concerning Seligson\'s patent on a speaker system, and indulging in all reasonable inferences favorable to the plaintiff, concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed on the question of actual malice.  <em>Id.</em> at 686.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>A separate trial before a different judge on the issue of damages resulted in a finding that the false disparaging statement resulted in a sales loss of 824 units, each of which would have produced a net profit of $129, causing petitioner damages of $106,296.  Petitioner also was awarded $9,000 for expenses incurred in an attempt to mitigate damages.  Judgment for the total amount, plus interest, was entered by the District Court.  529 F.Supp. 357 (1981).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Judge Campbell concurred specially to emphasize the fact that the Court of Appeals had not passed on the merits of the District Court\'s holding that petitioner was a public figure.  We, of course, also do not pass on that question.</p>\n<p>We observe that respondent\'s publication of Consumer Reports plainly would qualify it as a "media" defendant in this action under any conceivable definition of that term.  Hence, the answer to the question presented in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., cert. granted,</em> 464 U.S. 959 (1983), could not affect this case, and we naturally express no view at this time on that question.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>"Therefore, the plaintiff did not present any evidence to contradict the defendant\'s evidence which tended to show that, when listening to the Bose 901, a listener could and does perceive that the apparent sound source is very large.  Thus, the court concludes that the plaintiff has not sustained its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\'s statement -- \'instruments . . . seemed to grow to gigantic proportions\' -- was false."</p>\n<p>508 F.Supp. at 1267.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, respondent prevailed on both of the issues of fact that had been identified at the summary judgment stage of the proceedings.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The following questions were asked and answered:</p>\n<p>"[Q.] Does that explain, in your opinion, the lateral movement of the instrument?"</p>\n<p>"[A.] Yes."</p>\n<p>"[Q.] I think your statement in the article which says they moved into the room, just as if they came forward, as well -- "</p>\n<p>"[A.] The example given for the movement into the room refers only to a widened violin and a widened piano, and was meant to imply only that the widening and movement was across the rear wall from the two speakers."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"[Q.] \'It tended to wander about the room.\'  It didn\'t say from side to side or against the walls alone, but it says -- "</p>\n<p>"[A.] I believe the next sentence is meant to explain that.

Would it have been more accurate in your judgment to say that the instruments tended to move back and forth between the two speakers?"</p>\n<p>"A. No, I don\'t think so, taken in context of the way it\'s described.  Remember, the effect is carefully described in a few sentences later.  It\'s hard to mistake."</p>\n<p>"Q. Is there anything in the article which you think conveys to the reader the idea that the instruments stayed down at one end of the room and didn\'t come out and wander about, like you wandered about, where you have drawn the orange line?"</p>\n<p>"A. Yes."</p>\n<p>"Q. What is that?"</p>\n<p>"A. I would think that the reader would get that from reading that a violin appeared to be ten feet wide and a piano stretched from wall to wall.

On the contrary, a review quoted by the District Court commented that "each instrument has its prescribed space -- and it stays there."  <em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  This evidence, however, was more probative of falsity in ascribing any movement at all to the sound source than of falsity in describing the location of the movement.  As we have pointed out, the District Court found that the article was truthful insofar as it stated that apparent movement occurred.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court expressly rejected petitioner\'s exhaustive attempt to prove that Seligson had a continuing interest in marketing his own speaker, and therefore deliberately distorted the review.  508 F.Supp. at 1275.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, in <em>Herbert v.

Finding so-called ultimate \'facts\' more clearly implies the application of standards of law.  And so the \'finding of fact,\' even if made by two courts, may go beyond the determination that should not be set aside here.  Though labeled \'finding of fact,\' it may involve the very basis on which judgment of fallible evidence is to be made.

The suppression of a particular writing or other tangible form of expression is, therefore, an individual matter, and, in the nature of things, every such suppression raises an individual constitutional problem in which a reviewing court must determine for itself whether the attacked expression is suppress[i]ble within constitutional standards.

Sullivan</em> and to which the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a) is fully applicable.  Indeed, it is not actually necessary to review the "entire" record to fulfill the function of independent appellate review on the actual malice question; rather, only those portions of the record which relate to the actual malice determination must be independently assessed.  The independent review function is not equivalent to a "<em>de novo</em>" review of the ultimate judgment itself, in which a reviewing court makes an original appraisal of all the evidence to decide whether or not it believes that judgment should be entered for plaintiff.  If the reviewing Court determines that actual malice has been established with convincing clarity, the judgment of the trial court may only be reversed on the ground of some other error of law or clearly erroneous finding of fact.  Although the Court of Appeals stated that it must perform a <em>de novo</em> review, it is plain that the Court of Appeals did not overturn any factual finding to which Rule 52(a) would be applicable, but instead engaged in an independent assessment only of the evidence germane to the actual malice determination.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Although I do not believe that the "reckless disregard" component of the <em>New York Times</em> malice standard is a question of historical fact, I agree with JUSTICE REHNQUIST that the actual knowledge component surely is.  Here, the District Court found that the defamatory statement was written with actual knowledge of falsity.  The Court of Appeals thus erred in basing its disagreement with the District Court on its <em>de novo</em> review of the record.  The majority is today equally in error.  I would remand to the Court of Appeals so that it may perform its task under the proper standard.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE O\'CONNOR joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>There is more than one irony in this "Case of the Wandering Instruments," which subject matter makes it sound more like a candidate for inclusion in the "Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" than in a casebook on constitutional law.  It is ironic, in the first place, that a constitutional principle which originated in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">376 U. S. 254</a></span> (1964), because of the need for freedom to criticize the conduct of public officials is applied here to a magazine\'s false statements about a commercial loudspeaker system.</p>\n<p>It is also ironic that, in the interest of protecting the First Amendment, the Court rejects the "clearly erroneous" standard of review mandated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) in favor of a "<em>de novo</em>" standard of review for the "constitutional facts" surrounding the "actual malice" determination.  But the facts dispositive of that determination -- actual knowledge or subjective reckless disregard for truth -- involve no more than findings about the <em>mens rea</em> of an author, findings which appellate courts are simply ill-prepared to make in any context, including the First Amendment context.  Unless "actual malice" now means something different from the definition given to the term 20 years ago by this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 466 U. S. 516</a></p><p> Court in <em>New York Times,</em> I do not think that the constitutional requirement of "actual malice" properly can bring into play any standard of factual review other than the "clearly erroneous" standard.</p>\n<p>In this case, the District Court concluded by what it found to be clear and convincing evidence that respondent\'s engineer Arnold Seligson had written the defamatory statement about Bose\'s product with actual knowledge that it was false.  It reached that conclusion expressly relying on its determination about the credibility of Seligson\'s testimony.  508 F.Supp. 1249, 1276-1277 (1981).  On appeal, there was no issue as to whether the District Court had properly understood what findings were legally sufficient to establish "actual malice," nor was there any issue as to the necessary quantum of proof nor the proper allocation of the burden of proof of "actual malice."  The issue on appeal thus was only the propriety of the District Court\'s factual conclusion that Bose had actually proved "actual malice" in this case.  Yet the Court of Appeals never rebutted the District Court\'s conclusion that Seligson had actual knowledge that what he printed was false.  Instead, it concluded after <em>de novo</em> review that Seligson\'s language was merely "imprecise," and that, as such, it would not "support an inference of actual malice."  692 F.2d 189, 197 (1982).</p>\n<p>It is unclear to me just what that determination by the Court of Appeals has to do with the <em>mens rea</em> conclusion necessary to the finding of "actual malice" and with the District Court\'s finding of actual knowledge here.  In approving the Court of Appeals\' <em>de novo</em> judgment on the "actual malice" question, for all the factual detail and rehearsal of testimony with which the majority\'s opinion is adorned, the Court never quite comes to grips with what factual finding it must focus on.  At one point, we are told that</p>\n<p>"[t]he statement in this case represents the sort of inaccuracy that is commonplace in the forum of robust debate to which the <em>New York Times</em> rule applies,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/485/case.html#513">466 U. S. 513</a></span>, suggesting that the disparaging </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 466 U. S. 517</a></p><p> statement was perhaps not even false, or at any rate not false enough.  One paragraph later, we are told that,</p>\n<p>"as a matter of law . . . the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence that Seligson or his employer prepared the loudspeaker article with knowledge that it contained a false statement, or with reckless disregard of the truth."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/485/case.html#513">466 U. S. 513</a></span>.  The Court remarks that the question presented "reaches us on a somewhat peculiar wavelength," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/485/case.html#514">466 U. S. 514</a></span>, but that is scarcely a reason for transmitting the answer on an equally peculiar wavelength.</p>\n<p>In my view, the problem results from the Court\'s attempt to treat what is here, and in other contexts always has been, a pure question of fact, as something more than a fact -- a so-called "constitutional fact."  The Court correctly points out that independent appellate review of facts underlying constitutional claims has been sanctioned by previous decisions of this Court where</p>\n<p>"a conclusion of law as to a Federal right and a finding of fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the Federal question, to analyze the facts."</p>\n<p><em>Fiske v. Kansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/380/case.html">274 U.

But in other contexts, we have always felt perfectly at ease leaving state-of-mind determinations, such as the actual knowledge and recklessness determinations involved here, to triers of fact with only deferential appellate review -- for example, in criminal cases, where the burden of proving those facts is even greater than the "clear and convincing" standard applicable under New York Times. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 466 U. S. 518</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Presumably, any doctrine of "independent review" of facts exists not so that an appellate court may inexorably place its thumb on the scales in favor of the party claiming the constitutional right, but so that perceived shortcomings of the trier of fact, by way of bias or some other factor may be compensated for. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  But to me, the only shortcoming here is an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 466 U. S. 519</a></p><p> appellate court\'s inability to make the determination which the Court mandates today -- the <em>de novo</em> determination about the state of mind of a particular author at a particular time.  Although there well may be cases where the "actual malice" determination can be made on the basis of objectively reviewable facts in the record, it seems to me that, just as often, it is made, as here, on the basis of an evaluation of the credibility of the testimony of the author of the defamatory statement.  I am at a loss to see how appellate courts can even begin to make such determinations.  In any event, surely such determinations are best left to the trial judge.</p>\n<p>It is, of course, true, as the Court recognizes, that,</p>\n<p>"where particular speech falls close to the line separating the lawful and the unlawful, the possibility of mistaken factfinding -- inherent in all litigation -- will create the danger that the legitimate utterance will be penalized."</p>\n<p><em>Speiser v.

But the <em>New York Times</em> rule adequately addresses the need to shield protected speech from the risk of erroneous factfinding by placing the burden of proving "actual malice" on the party seeking to penalize expression.  I agree with Justice Harlan who, in commenting on the inappropriateness of <em>de novo</em> fact review of the "actual malice" determination, concluded that he could not</p>\n<p>"discern in those First Amendment considerations that led us to restrict the States\' powers to regulate defamation of public officials any additional interest that is not served by the actual malice rule of <em>New York Times, supra,</em> but is substantially promoted by utilizing [an appellate court] as the ultimate arbiter of factual disputes in those libel cases where no unusual factors, such as allegations of harassment or the existence of a jury verdict resting on erroneous instructions . . . are present."</p>\n<p><em>Time, Inc. v.

Because it is not clear to me that the <em>de novo</em> findings of appellate courts, with only bare records before them, are likely to be any more reliable than the findings reached by trial judges, I cannot join the majority\'s sanctioning of factual second-guessing by appellate courts.  I believe that the primary result of the Court\'s holding today will not be greater protection for First Amendment values, but rather only lessened confidence in the judgments of lower courts and more entirely fact-bound appeals.</p>\n<p>I continue to adhere to the view expressed in <em>Pullman-Standard v.

S. 287</a></span> (1982), that Rule 52(a)</p>\n<p>"does not make exceptions or purport to exclude certain categories of factual findings from the obligation of a court of appeals to accept a district court\'s findings unless clearly erroneous."</p>\n<p>There is no reason to depart from that rule here, and I would therefore reverse and remand this case to the Court of Appeals so that it may apply the "clearly erroneous" standard of review to the factual findings of the District Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In attempting to justify independent appellate review of the "actual malice" determination, the majority draws an analogy to other cases which have attempted to define categories of unprotected speech, such as obscenity and child pornography cases, <em>New York v. Ferber,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html">458 U. S. 747</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html#774">458 U. S. 774</a></span>, n. 28 (1982); <em>Miller v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html">413 U. S. 15</a></span> (1973); <em>Roth v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U. S. 476</a></span> (1957), and cases involving words inciting anger or violence, <em>Hess v. Indiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/105/case.html">414 U. S. 105</a></span> (1973) (per curiam); <em>Street v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/576/case.html">394 U. S. 576</a></span> (1969); <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/case.html">315 U. S. 568</a></span> (1942).  To my mind, however, those cases more clearly involve the kind of mixed questions of fact and law which call for <em>de novo</em> appellate review than do the <em>New York Times</em> "actual malice" cases, which simply involve questions of pure historical fact.</p>\n<p>For example, with respect to the obscenity cases, appellate courts perhaps are just as competent as are triers of fact to make determinations about whether material appeals to "prurient interests," whether it depicts sexual conduct in a "patently offensive" way, and whether the material lacks serious artistic value, <em>Miller v. California, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#24">413 U. S. 24</a></span>.  In the words-inciting-violence cases, the necessary determinations, equally capable of <em>de novo</em> appellate review, are whether words are "<em>likely to provoke the <em>average</em> person to retaliation,\'" <em>Street v. New York, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/576/case.html#592">394 U. S. 592</a></span> (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/case.html#574">315 U. S. 574</a></span>), or whether the "rational inference from the import of the language" is that it is "likely to produce <em>imminent</em> disorder."  <em>Hess v. Indiana, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/105/case.html#109">414 U. S. 109</a></span>.  None of those cases requires the kind of pure historical factual determination that the <em>New York Times</em> cases require a determination as to the actual subjective state of mind of a <em>particular</em> person at a <em>particular</em> time.\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court correctly points out that, in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> we conducted independent appellate review of the facts underlying the "actual malice" determination.  It is notable, however, that <em>New York Times</em> came to this Court from a state court after a jury trial, and thus presented the strongest case for independent factfinding by this Court.  The factfinding process engaged in by a jury rendering a general verdict is much less evident to the naked eye, and thus more suspect than the factfinding process engaged in by a trial judge who makes written findings as here.  Justifying independent review of facts found by a jury is easier, because of the absence of a distinct "yes" or "no" in a general jury verdict as to a particular factual inquiry and because of the extremely narrow latitude allowed appellate courts to review facts found by a jury at common law.  Thus it is not surprising to me that early cases espousing the notion of independent appellate review of "constitutional facts," such as <em>Fiske v. Kansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/380/case.html">274 U. S. 380</a></span> (1927), and <em>New York Times,</em> should have arisen out of the context of jury verdicts, and that they then were perhaps only reflexively applied in other quite different contexts without further analysis.  <em>See Time, Inc. v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/279/case.html">401 U. S. 279</a></span> (1971) (involving appellate review of a District Court\'s directed verdict).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
