L. B. that <i>Mayer </i>points to the disposition proper in this case: Her parental termination appeal must be treated as the Court has treated petty offense appeals, and Mississippi may not withhold the transcript she needs to gain review of the order ending her parental status. The Court\'s decisions concerning access to judicial processes, commencing with <i>Griffin </i>and running through <i>Mayer, </i>reflect both equal protection and due process concerns. See <i>Ross </i>v. <i>Moffitt, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/600/case.html">417 U. S. 600</a>, 608609. In these cases, "[d]ue process and equal protection principles converge." <i>Bearden </i>v. <i>Georgia, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/660/case.html">461 U. S. 660</a>, 665. A "precise rationale" has not been composed, <i>Ross, </i>417 U. S., at 608, because cases of this order "cannot be resolved by resort to easy slogans or pigeonhole analysis," <i>Bearden, </i>461 U. S., at 666. Nevertheless, "[m]ost decisions in this area," the Court has recognized, "res[t] on an equal protection framework," id., at 665, as M. L. B.\'s plea heavily does, for due process does not independently require that the State provide a right to appeal. Placing this case within the framework established by the Court\'s past decisions in this area, the Court inspects the character and intensity of the individual interest at stake, on the one hand, and the State\'s justification for its exaction, on the other. See id., at 666-667.</p><p>As in the case of the indigent petty offender charged in <i>Mayer, </i>the stakes for M. L. B. are large. Parental status termination is "irretrievabl[y] destructi[ ve]" of the most fundamental family relationship. <i>Santosky, </i>455 U. S., at 753. And the risk of error, Mississippi\'s experience shows, is considerable. Mississippi has, consistent with <i>Santosky, </i>adopted a "clear and convincing proof" standard for parental status termination cases, but the Chancellor\'s order in this case simply recites statutory language; it describes no evidence, and otherwise details no reasons for finding M. L. B. "clear[ly] and convincing[ly]" unfit to be a parent. Only a transcript can reveal the sufficiency, or insufficiency, of the evidence to support that stern judgment. Mississippi\'s countervailing interest in offsetting the costs of its court system is unimpressive when measured against the stakes for M. L. B. The record discloses that, in the tightly circumscribed category of parental status termination cases, appeals are few, and not likely to impose an undue burden on the State. Moreover, it would be anomalous to recognize a right to a transcript needed to appeal a misdemeanor conviction-though trial counsel may be flatly denied such a defendant-but hold, at the same time, that a transcript need not be prepared for M. L. B.-though were her defense sufficiently complex, state-paid counsel, as <i>Lassiter </i>instructs, would be designated for her. While the Court does not question the general rule, stated in <i>Ortwein, </i>410 U. S., at 660, that fee re-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="105">105</a></p><p>quirements ordinarily are examined only for rationality, the Court\'s cases solidly establish two exceptions to that rule. The basic right to participate in political processes as voters and candidates cannot be limited to those who can pay for a license. See, <i>e. g., Harper </i>v. <i>Virginia Bd. of Elections, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/663/case.html">383 U. S. 663</a>. Nor may access to judicial processes in cases criminal or "quasi criminal" in nature, <i>Mayer, </i>404 U. S., at 196, turn on ability to pay. The Court places decrees forever terminating parental rights in the category of cases in which the State may not "bolt the door to equal justice." <i>Griffin, </i>351 U. S., at 24 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment). Pp. 119-124.</p><p>(e) Contrary to respondents\' contention, cases in which the Court has held that government need not provide funds so that people can exercise even fundamental rights, see, <i>e. g., Lyng </i>v. <i>Automobile Workers, 485 </i>U. S. 360, 363, n. 2, 370-374, are inapposite here. Complainants in those cases sought state aid to subsidize their privately initiated action or to alleviate the consequences of differences in economic circumstances that existed apart from state action. M. L. B.\'s complaint is of a different order. She is endeavoring to defend against the State\'s destruction of her family bonds, and to resist the brand associated with a parental unfitness adjudication. Like a defendant resisting criminal conviction, she seeks to be spared from the State\'s devastatingly adverse action. That is the very reason this Court has paired her case with <i>Mayer, </i>not with <i>Ortwein </i>or <i>Kras. </i>Also rejected is respondents\' suggestion that <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U. S. 229</a>, 242, effectively overruled the <i>Griffin </i>line of cases in 1976 by rejecting the notion "that a law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government to pursue, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one race than of another." That this Court has not so conceived the meaning and effect of <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis </i>is demonstrated by <i>Bearden, </i>461 U. S., at 664-665, in which the Court adhered in 1983 to <i>"Griffin\'s </i>principle of \'equal justice.\'\'\' The Court recognized in <i>Griffin </i>that "a law nondiscriminatory on its face may be grossly discriminatory in operation," 351 U. S., at 17, n. 11, and explained in <i>Williams </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/235/case.html">399 U. S. 235</a>, 242, that an Illinois statute it found unconstitutional in that case "in operative effect expose[d] only indigents to the risk of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum." Like the sanction in <i>Williams, </i>the Mississippi prescription here at issue is not merely disproportionate in impact, but wholly contingent on one\'s ability to pay, thereby "visit[ing] different consequences on two categories of persons." <i>Ibid. </i>A failure rigidly to restrict <i>Griffin </i>to cases typed "criminal" will not result in the opening of judicial floodgates, as respondents urge. This Court has repeatedly distinguished parental status termination decrees from mine run civil actions</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="106">106</a></p><p>on the basis of the unique deprivation termination decrees work: permanent destruction of all legal recognition of the parental relationship. <i>Lassiter </i>and <i>Santosky </i>have not served as precedent in other areas, and the Court is satisfied that the label "civil" should not entice it to leave undisturbed the Mississippi courts\' disposition of this case. Cf. <i>In re </i>Gault, <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/1/case.html">387 U. S. 1</a>, 50. Pp. 124-128.</p><p>(f) Thus, Mississippi may not withhold from M. L. B.

J. filed suit in Chancery Court in Mississippi, seeking to terminate the parental rights of M. L. B. and to gain court approval for adoption of the children by their stepmother, J. P. J. The complaint alleged that M. L. B. had not maintained reasonable visitation and was in arrears on child support payments. M. L. B. counterclaimed, seeking primary custody of both children and contending that S. L. J. had not permitted her reasonable visitation, despite a provision in the divorce decree that he do so.</p><p>After taking evidence on August 18, November 2, and December 12, 1994, the Chancellor, in a decree filed December 14, 1994, terminated all parental rights of the natural mother, approved the adoption, and ordered that J.

Twice reciting a segment of the governing Mississippi statute, Miss. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 93-15103(3)(e) (1994), the Chancellor declared that there had been a "substantial erosion of the relationship between the natural mother, [M. L.

S. 12</a>, 16 (1956). Concerning access to appeal in general, and transcripts needed to pursue appeals in particular, <i>Griffin </i>is the foundation case.</p><p><i>Griffin </i>involved an Illinois rule that effectively conditioned thoroughgoing appeals from criminal convictions on the defendant\'s procurement of a transcript of trial proceedings. See <i>id., </i>at 13-14, and nn. 2, 3 (noting, <i>inter alia, </i>that "mandatory record," which an indigent defendant could obtain free of charge, did not afford the defendant an opportunity to seek review of trial errors). Indigent defendants, other than those sentenced to death, were not excepted from the rule, so in most cases, defendants without means to pay for a transcript had no access to appellate review at all. Although the Federal Constitution guarantees no right to appellate review, <i>id., </i>at 18, once a State affords that right, <i>Griffin </i>held, the State may not "bolt the door to equal justice," id., at 24 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment).</p><p>The plurality in <i>Griffin </i>recognized "the importance of appellate review to a correct adjudication of guilt or innocence." <i>Id., </i>at 18. "[T]o deny adequate review to the poor," the plurality observed, "means that many of them may lose their life, liberty or property because of unjust convictions which appellate courts would set aside." <i>Id., </i>at 19. Judging the Illinois rule inconsonant with the Fourteenth Amendment, the <i>Griffin </i>plurality drew support from the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. <i>Id., </i>at 13, 18.</p><p>Justice Frankfurter, concurring in the judgment in <i>Griffin, </i>emphasized and explained the decision\'s equal protection underpinning:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Of course a State need not equalize economic conditions ....

Summarizing the <i>Griffin </i>line of decisions regarding an indigent defendant\'s access to appellate review of a conviction,4 we said in <i>Rinaldi </i>v. <i>Yeager, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/305/case.html">384 U.

"The invidiousness of the discrimination that exists when criminal procedures are made available only to those who can pay," the Court said in <i>Mayer, </i>"is not erased by any differences in the sentences that may be imposed." 404 U. S., at 197. Petty offenses could entail serious collateral consequences, the <i>Mayer </i>Court noted. <i>Ibid. </i>The <i>Griffin </i>principle, <i>Mayer </i>underscored, "is a fiat prohibition," 404 U.

An impecunious party, the Court ruled, whether found guilty of a felony or conduct only "quasi criminal in nature," id., at 196, "cannot be denied a record of sufficient completeness to permit proper [appellate] consideration of his claims," id., at 198 (internal quotation marks omitted).5</p><p>In contrast to the "fiat prohibition" of "bolted doors" that the <i>Griffin </i>line of cases securely established, the right to</p><p>5 <i>Griffin </i>did not impose an inflexible requirement that a State provide a full trial transcript to an indigent defendant pursuing an appeal.

S. 12</a>, 20 (1956) (State need not purchase a stenographer\'s transcript in every case where an indigent defendant cannot buy it; State "Supreme Court may find other means of affording adequate and effective appellate review to indigent defendants."). In <i>Draper </i>v. <i>Washington, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/487/case.html">372 U. S. 487</a> (1963), we invalidated a state rule that tied an indigent defendant\'s ability to obtain a transcript at public expense to the trial judge\'s finding that the defendant\'s appeal was not frivolous. <i>Id., </i>at 498-500. We emphasized, however, that the <i>Griffin </i>requirement is not rigid. "Alternative methods of reporting trial proceedings," we observed, "are permissible if they place before the appellate court an equivalent report of the events at trial from which the appellant\'s contentions arise." 372 U. S., at 495. Moreover, we held, an indigent defendant is entitled only to those parts of the trial record that are "germane to consideration of the appeal." <i>Ibid.; </i>see also <i>Mayer </i>v. <i>Chicago, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/189/case.html">404 U.

In <i>Ross </i>v. <i>Moffitt, </i>however, we held that neither the Due Process Clause nor the Equal Protection Clause requires a State to provide counsel at state expense to an indigent prisoner pursuing a discretionary appeal in the state system or petitioning for review in this Court. 417 U.

In <i>Boddie </i>v. <i>Connecticut, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/371/case.html">401 U. S. 371</a> (1971), we held that the State could not deny a divorce to a married couple based on their inability to pay approximately $60 in court costs. Crucial to our decision in <i>Boddie </i>was the fundamental interest at stake. "[G]iven the basic position of the marriage relationship in this society\'s hierarchy of values and the concomitant state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving this relationship," we said, due process "prohibit[s] a State from denying, solely because of inability to pay, access to its courts to individuals who seek judicial dissolution of their marriages." <i>Id., </i>at 374; see also <i>Little </i>v. <i>Streater, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/1/case.html">452 U.

We next stated, however, that "[w]hen an appeal is afforded, ... it cannot be granted to some litigants and capriciously or arbitrarily denied to others without violating the Equal Protection Clause." <i>Ibid. </i>Oregon\'s double-bond requirement failed equal protection measurement, we concluded, because it raised a substantial barrier to appeal for a particular class of litigants-tenants facing eviction-a barrier "faced by no other civil litigant in Oregon." <i>Id., </i>at 79.

The Court recalled in <i>Kras </i>that "[o]n many occasions we have recognized the fundamental importance ... under our Constitution" of "the associational interests that surround the establishment and dissolution of thee] [marital] relationship." <i>Id., </i>at 444.6 But bankruptcy discharge entails no "funda-</p><p>6 As examples, the Court listed: <i>Eisenstadt </i>v. <i>Baird, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html">405 U.

But tellingly, the Court has consistently set apart from the mine run of cases those involving state controls or intrusions on family relationships.

S. 745</a> (1982).</p><p><i>Lassiter </i>concerned the appointment of counsel for indigent persons seeking to defend against the State\'s termination of their parental status. The Court held that appointed counsel was not routinely required to assure a fair adjudication; instead, a case-by-case determination of the need for counsel would suffice, an assessment to be made "in the first instance by the trial court, subject ... to appellate review." 452 U. S., at 32.</p><p>For probation-revocation hearings where loss of conditional liberty is at issue, the <i>Lassiter </i>Court observed, our precedent is not doctrinaire; due process is provided, we have held, when the decision whether counsel should be appointed is made on a case-by-case basis. See <i>Gagnon </i>v. <i>Scarpelli, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/778/case.html">411 U. S. 778</a>, 790 (1973). In criminal prosecutions that do not lead to the defendant\'s incarceration, however, our precedent recognizes no right to appointed counsel. See <i>Scott </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i>440 U.

Parental termination cases, the <i>Lassiter </i>Court concluded, are most appropriately ranked with probation-revocation hearings: While the Court declined to recognize an automatic right to appointed counsel, it said that an appointment would be due when warranted by the character and difficulty of the case.

The object of the proceeding is "not simply to infringe upon [the parent\'s] interest," the Court recognized, "but to end it"; thus, a decision against the parent "work[s] a unique kind of deprivation." <i>Lassiter, </i>452 U.

For that reason, "[a] parent\'s interest in the accuracy and justice of the decision ... is ... a commanding one." <i>Ibid.; </i>see also <i>id., </i>at 39 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("A termination of parental rights is both total and irrevocable.

See <i>Rivera, </i>483 U. S., at 579-582. In drawing this distinction, the Court found it enlightening that state legislatures had similarly separated the two proceedings: Most jurisdictions applied a "preponderance of the evidence" standard in paternity cases, while 38 jurisdictions, at the time <i>Santosky </i>was decided, required a higher standard of proof in proceedings to terminate parental rights.

L. B. access to an appeal-available but for her inability to advance required costs-before she is forever branded unfit for affiliation with her children? Respondents urge us to classify M. L. B.\'s case with the generality of civil cases, in which indigent persons have no constitutional right to proceed <i>in </i>forma pauperis. See <i>supra, </i>at 114-116. M. L. B., on the other hand, maintains that the accusatory state action she is trying to fend off12 is barely distinguishable from criminal condemnation in view of the magnitude and permanence of the loss she faces. Cf. <i>In re Gault, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/1/case.html">387 U.

See also <i>Santosky, </i>455 U.

S. 189</a> (1971), see <i>supra, </i>at 111-112, and rule that Mississippi may not withhold the transcript M. L. B. needs to gain review of the order ending her parental status. Guided by <i>Lassiter </i>and <i>Santosky, </i>and other decisions acknowledging the primacy of the parent-child relationship, <i>e. g., Stanley </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i>405 U. S., at 651; <i>Meyer </i>v. <i>Nebraska, </i>262 U. S., at 399, we agree that the <i>Mayer </i>decision points to the disposition proper in this case.</p><p>We observe first that the Court\'s decisions concerning access to judicial processes, commencing with <i>Griffin </i>and running through <i>Mayer, </i>reflect both equal protection and due process concerns. See <i>Ross </i>v. <i>Moffitt, </i>417 U. S., at 608-609. As we said in <i>Bearden </i>v. <i>Georgia, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/660/case.html">461 U. S. 660</a>, 665 (1983), in the Court\'s <i>Griffin-line </i>cases, "[d]ue process and equal protection principles converge." The equal protection concern relates to the legitimacy of fencing out would-be appellants based solely on their inability to pay core costs. See <i>Griffin, </i>351 U. S., at 23 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment) (cited <i>supra, </i>at 110-111). The due process concern homes in on the essential fairness of the state-ordered proceedings anterior to adverse state action. See <i>Ross, </i>417 U. S., at 609. A "precise rationale" has not been composed, id., at 608, because cases of this order "cannot be resolved by resort to easy slogans or pigeonhole analysis," <i>Bearden, </i>461 U. S., at 666. Nevertheless, "[m]ost decisions in this area," we have recognized, "res[t] on an equal protection framework," id., at 665, as M. L. B.\'s plea heavily does, for, as we earlier observed, see <i>supra, </i>at 110, due process does not independently require that the State provide a right to appeal. We place this case within the framework established by our past decisions in this area. In line with those decisions, we inspect the character and intensity of the individual interest at stake, on the one hand, and the State\'s</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="121">121</a></p><p>justification for its exaction, on the other. See <i>Bearden, 461 </i>U. S., at 666-667.</p><p>We now focus on <i>Mayer </i>and the considerations linking that decision to M. L. B.\'s case. <i>Mayer, </i>described <i>supra, </i>at 111-112, applied <i>Griffin </i>to a petty offender, fined a total of $500, who sought to appeal from the trial court\'s judgment. See <i>Mayer, </i>404 U. S., at 190. An "impecunious medical student," <i>id., </i>at 197, the defendant in <i>Mayer </i>could not pay for a transcript. We held that the State must afford him a record complete enough to allow fair appellate consideration of his claims. The defendant in <i>Mayer </i>faced no term of confinement, but the conviction, we observed, could affect his professional prospects and, possibly, even bar him from the practice of medicine. <i>Ibid. </i>The State\'s pocketbook interest in advance payment for a transcript, we concluded, was unimpressive when measured against the stakes for the defendant. <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Similarly here, the stakes for petitioner M. L. B.-forced dissolution of her parental rights-are large, " \'more substantial than mere loss of money.\'" <i>Santosky, </i>455 U. S., at 756 (quoting <i>Addington </i>v. <i>Texas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html">441 U. S. 418</a>, 424 (1979)). In contrast to loss of custody, which does not sever the parentchild bond, parental status termination is "irretrievabl[y] destructi[ve]" of the most fundamental family relationship. <i>Santosky, </i>455 U. S., at 753. And the risk of error, Mississippi\'s experience shows, is considerable. See <i>supra, </i>at 109, n.3.</p><p>Consistent with <i>Santosky, </i>Mississippi has, by statute, adopted a "clear and convincing proof" standard for parental status termination cases. Miss. Code Ann. \xc2\xa793-15-109 (Supp. 1996). Nevertheless, the Chancellor\'s termination order in this case simply recites statutory language; it describes no evidence, and otherwise details no reasons for finding M. L. B. "clear[ly] and convincing[ly]" unfit to be a parent. See <i>supra, </i>at 107-108. Only a transcript can reveal to judicial minds other than the Chancellor\'s the suffi-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="122">122</a></p><p>ciency, or insufficiency, of the evidence to support his stern judgment.</p><p>The countervailing government interest, as in <i>Mayer, </i>is financial. Mississippi urges, as the justification for its appeal cost prepayment requirement, the State\'s legitimate interest in offsetting the costs of its court system. Brief for Respondents 4, 8, n. 1, 27-30. But in the tightly circumscribed category of parental status termination cases, cf. <i>supra, </i>at 118, n. 11, appeals are few, and not likely to impose an undue burden on the State. See Brief for Petitioner 20, 25 (observing that only 16 reported appeals in Mississippi from 1980 until 1996 referred to the State\'s termination statute, and only 12 of those decisions addressed the merits of the grant or denial of parental rights); cf. Brief for Respondents 28 (of 63,765 civil actions filed in Mississippi Chancery Courts in 1995, 194 involved termination of parental rights; of cases decided on appeal in Mississippi in 1995 (including Court of Appeals and Supreme Court cases), 492 were first appeals of criminal convictions, 67 involved domestic relations, 16 involved child custody). Mississippi\'s experience with criminal appeals is noteworthy in this regard. In 1995, the Mississippi Court of Appeals disposed of 298 first appeals from criminal convictions, Sup. Ct. of Miss. Ann. Rep. 42 (1995); of those appeals, only seven were appeals from misdemeanor convictions, ibid., notwithstanding our holding in <i>Mayer </i>requiring <i>in forma pauperis </i>transcript access in petty offense prosecutions.13</p><p>13 Many States provide for <i>in forma pauperis </i>appeals, including transcripts, in civil cases generally. See, <i>e. </i>g., Alaska Rule App. Proc. 209(a)(3) (1996); Conn. Rule App. Proc. 4017 (1996); D. C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 15712 (1995); Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 31-3220(5) (1996); Ill.

See <i>supra, </i>at 110-112. That equal access right holds for petty offenses as well as for felonies. But counsel at state expense, we have held, is a constitutional requirement, even in the first instance, only when the defendant faces time in confinement. See <i>supra, </i>at 113. When deprivation of parental status is at stake, however, counsel is sometimes part of the process that is due. See <i>Lassiter, </i>452 U. S., at 31-32. It would be anomalous to recognize a right to a transcript needed to appeal a misdemeanor conviction-though trial counsel may be flatly denied-but hold, at the same time, that a transcript need not be prepared for M. L. B.-though were her defense sufficiently complex, state-paid counsel, as <i>Lassiter </i>instructs, would be designated for her.</p><p>In aligning M. L. B.\'s case and <i>Mayer-parental </i>status termination decrees and criminal convictions that carry no jail time-for appeal access purposes, we do not question the general rule, stated in <i>Ortwein, </i>that fee requirements ordinarily are examined only for rationality. See <i>supra, </i>at 115-116. The State\'s need for revenue to offset costs, in the mine run of cases, satisfies the rationality requirement, see <i>Ortwein, </i>410 U.

In accord with the substance and sense of our decisions in <i>Lassiter </i>and <i>Santosky, </i>see <i>supra, </i>at 117-120, we place decrees forever terminating parental rights in the category of cases in which the State may not "bolt the door to equal justice," <i>Griffin, </i>351 U.

M. L. B.\'s complaint is of a different order. She is endeavoring to defend against the State\'s destruction of her family bonds, and to resist the brand associated with a parental unfitness adjudication. Like a defendant resisting criminal conviction, she seeks to be spared from the State\'s devastatingly adverse action. That is the very reason we have paired her case with <i>Mayer, </i>not with <i>Ortwein </i>or <i>Kras, </i>discussed <i>supra, </i>at 114-116.</p><p>Respondents also suggest that <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis, 426 </i>U. S. 229 (1976), is instructive because it rejects the notion "that a law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="126">126</a></p><p>within the power of government to pursue, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one race than of another," id., at 242. "This must be all the more true," respondents urge, "with respect to an allegedly disparate impact on a class [here, the poor] that, unlike race, is not suspect." Brief for Respondents 31.</p><p><i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis, </i>however, does not have the sweeping effect respondents attribute to it. That case involved a verbal skill test administered to prospective Government employees. "[A] far greater proportion of blacks-four times as many-failed the test than did whites." 426 U. S., at 237. But the successful test takers included members of both races, as did the unsuccessful examinees. Disproportionate impact, standing alone, the Court held, was insufficient to prove unconstitutional racial discrimination. Were it otherwise, a host of laws would be called into question, "a whole range of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes that may be more burdensome to the poor and to the average black than to the more affluent white." <i>Id., </i>at 248.</p><p>To comprehend the difference between the case at hand and cases controlled by <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis,15 </i>one need look no further than this Court\'s opinion in <i>Williams </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/235/case.html">399 U. S. 235</a> (1970). <i>Williams </i>held unconstitutional an Illinois law under which an indigent offender could be continued in confinement beyond the maximum prison term specified by statute if his indigency prevented him from satisfying the monetary portion of the sentence. The Court described that law as "\'nondiscriminatory on its face,\'" and recalled that the law found incompatible with the Constitution in <i>Griffin </i>had been so characterized. 399 U. S., at 242 (quoting <i>Griffin, </i>351 U. S., at 17, n. 11); see <i>Griffin, </i>351 U. S., at 17, n. 11</p><p>15 See Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/case.html">442 U. S. 256</a> (1979); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/252/case.html">429 U.

But the <i>Williams </i>Court went on to explain that "the Illinois statute in operative effect exposes <i>only indigents </i>to the risk of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum." 399 U. S., at 242 (emphasis added). Sanctions of the <i>Williams </i>genre, like the Mississippi prescription here at issue, are not merely <i>disproportionate </i>in impact. Rather, they are wholly contingent on one\'s ability to pay, and thus "visi[t] different consequences on two categories of persons," <i>ibid.; </i>they apply to all indigents and do not reach anyone outside that class.</p><p>In sum, under respondents\' reading of <i>Washington </i>v.</p><p><i>Davis, </i>our overruling of the <i>Griffin </i>line of cases would be two decades overdue. It suffices to point out that this Court has not so conceived the meaning and effect of our 1976 "disproportionate impact" precedent. See <i>Bearden </i>v. <i>Georgia, </i>461 U. S., at 664-665 (adhering in 1983 to <i>"Griffin\'s </i>principle of \'equal justice\' ").16</p><p>Respondents and the dissenters urge that we will open floodgates if we do not rigidly restrict <i>Griffin </i>to cases typed "criminal." See <i>post, </i>at 141-144 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Brief for Respondents 27-28. But we have repeatedly noticed what sets parental status termination decrees apart from mine run civil actions, even from other domestic relations matters such as divorce, paternity, and child custody. See <i>supra, </i>at 117-120, and n. 11. To recapitulate, termination decrees "wor[k] a unique kind of deprivation." <i>Lassiter, </i>452 U. S., at 27.

I do not think, however, that the new-found constitutional right to free transcripts in civil appeals can be</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="130">130</a></p><p>effectively restricted to this case. The inevitable consequence will be greater demands on the States to provide free assistance to would-be appellants in all manner of civil cases involving interests that cannot, based on the test established by the majority, be distinguished from the admittedly important interest at issue here. The cases on which the majority relies, primarily cases requiring appellate assistance for indigent criminal defendants, were questionable when decided, and have, in my view, been undermined since. Even accepting those cases, however, I am of the view that the majority takes them too far. I therefore dissent.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Petitioner requests relief under both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, though she does not specify how either Clause affords it. The majority accedes to petitioner\'s request. But, carrying forward the ambiguity in the cases on which it relies, the majority does not specify the source of the relief it grants. Those decisions are said to "reflect both equal protection and due process concerns." <i>Ante, </i>at 120. And, while we are told that "cases of this order \'cannot be resolved by resort to easy slogans or pigeonhole analysis,\'" <i>ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Bearden </i>v. <i>Georgia, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/660/case.html">461 U. S. 660</a>, 666 (1983)), the majority nonetheless acknowledges that "\'[m]ost decisions in this area ... reset] on an equal protection framework,\'" <i>ante, </i>at 120 (quoting <i>Bearden, supra, </i>at 665). It then purports to "place this case within the framework established by our past decisions in this area." <i>Ante, </i>at 120. It is not clear to me whether the majority disavows any due process support for its holding. (Despite the murky disclaimer, the majority discusses numerous cases that squarely relied on due process considerations.) I therefore analyze petitioner\'s claim under both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. If neither Clause affords petitioner the right to a free, civil-appeal transcript, I assume that no amalgam of the two does.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="131">131</a></p><p>A</p><p>We have indicated on several occasions in this century that the interest of parents in maintaining their relationships with their children is "an important interest that \'undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\'" <i>Lassiter </i>v. <i>Department of Social Servs. of Durham Cty., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/18/case.html">452 U.

Assuming that petitioner\'s interest may not be impinged without due process of law, I do not think that the Due Process Clause requires the result the majority reaches.</p><p>Petitioner\'s largest obstacle to a due process appeal <i>gratis </i>is our oft-affirmed view that due process does not oblige States to provide for any appeal, even from a criminal conviction. See, <i>e. g., Griffin </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/12/case.html">351 U. S. 12</a>, 18 (1956) (plurality opinion) (noting that "a State is not required by the Federal Constitution to provide appellate courts or a right to appellate review at all" (citation omitted)); <i>McKane </i>v. <i>Durston, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/153/684/case.html">153 U. S. 684</a>, 687 (1894) ("A review by an appellate court of the final judgment in a criminal case, however grave the offence of which the accused is convicted, was not at common law and is not now a necessary element of due process of law. It is wholly within the discretion of the State to allow or not to allow such a review. A citation of authorities upon the point is unnecessary"). To be sure, we have indicated, beginning with <i>Griffin </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i>that where an appeal is provided, States may be prohibited from erecting barriers to those unable to pay. As I described last Term in my concurring opinion in <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>Casey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/518/343/case.html">518 U. S. 343</a>, 368373 (1996), however, I believe that these cases are best understood as grounded in equal protection analysis, and thus make no inroads on our longstanding rule that States that accord due process in a hearing-level tribunal need not provide further review.</p><p>The majority reaffirms that due process does not require an appeal. <i>Ante, </i>at 110, 120. Indeed, as I noted above, it</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="132">132</a></p><p>is not clear that the majority relies on the Due Process Clause at all. The majority does discuss, however, one case in which the Court stated its holding in terms of due process:</p><p><i>Boddie </i>v. <i>Connecticut, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/371/case.html">401 U. S. 371</a> (1971). In <i>Boddie, </i>the Court held violative of due process a Connecticut statute that exacted fees averaging $60 from persons seeking marital dissolution. Citing the importance of the interest in ending a marriage, and the State\'s monopoly over the mechanisms to accomplish it, we explained that, "at a minimum" and "absent a countervailing state interest of overriding significance, persons forced to settle their claims of right and duty through the judicial process must be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard." <i>Id., </i>at 377. <i>Boddie </i>has little to do with this case. It, "of course, was not concerned with post-hearing review." <i>Ortwein </i>v. <i>Schwab, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/656/case.html">410 U. S. 656</a>, 659 (1973). Rather, the concern in <i>Boddie </i>was that indigent persons were deprived of "fundamental rights" with no hearing whatsoever. Petitioner, in contrast, received not merely a hearing, but in fact enjoyed procedural protections above and beyond what our parental termination cases have required. She received both notice and a hearing before a neutral, legally trained decisionmaker. She was represented by counsel-even though due process does not in every case require the appointment of counsel. See <i>Lassiter, supra, </i>at 24. Through her attorney, petitioner was able to confront the evidence and witnesses against her. And, in accordance with <i>Santosky </i>v. <i>Kramer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html">455 U. S. 745</a>, 769 (1982), the Chancery Court was required to find that petitioner\'s parental unfitness was proved by clear and convincing evidence. Indeed, petitioner points to no hearinglevel process to which she was entitled that she did not receive.</p><p>Given the many procedural protections afforded petitioner, I have little difficulty concluding that "due process has ... been accorded in the tribunal of first instance." <i>Ohio ex rel. Bryant </i>v. <i>Akron Metropolitan Park Dist., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/281/74/case.html">281 U.

Due process has never compelled an appeal where, as here, its rigors are satisfied by an adequate hearing. Those cases in which the Court has required States to alleviate financial obstacles to process beyond a hearing-though sometimes couched in due process terms-have been based on the equal protection proposition that if the State chooses to provide for appellate review, it " \'can no more discriminate on account of poverty than on account of religion, race, or color.\'" <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>Casey, supra, </i>at 371 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (quoting <i>Griffin </i>v. <i>Illinois, supra, </i>at 17 (plurality opinion)) (footnote omitted). There seems, then, no place in the Due Process Clause-certainly as an original matter, and even as construed by this Court-for the constitutional "right" crafted by the majority today. I turn now to the other possible source: The Equal Protection Clause.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>As I stated last Term in <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>Casey, </i>I do not think that the equal protection theory underlying the <i>Griffin </i>line of cases remains viable. See 518 U. S., at 373-378. There, I expressed serious reservations as to the continuing vitality of <i>Bounds </i>v. <i>Smith, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/817/case.html">430 U. S. 817</a> (1977) (requiring prison authorities to provide prisoners with adequate law libraries or legal assistance). As it did in <i>Bounds, </i>the Court today not only adopts the equal protection theory of <i>Griffin </i>v. <i>Illi</i>nois-which was dubious <i>ab initio </i>and which has been undermined since-but extends it. Thus, much of what I said in <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>Casey </i>bears repeating here.</p><p>In <i>Griffin, </i>the State of Illinois required all criminal appellants whose claims on appeal required review of a trial transcript to obtain it themselves. The plurality thought that this "discriminate[d] against some convicted defendants on account of their poverty," 351 U. S., at 18 (plurality opinion). Justice Harlan, in dissent, perceived a troubling shift in this Court\'s equal protection jurisprudence. The Court, he noted, did not "dispute either the necessity for a bill of excep-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="134">134</a></p><p>tions or the reasonableness of the general requirement that the trial transcript, if used in its preparation, be paid for by the appealing party." <i>Id., </i>at 35. But, because requiring each would-be appellant to bear the costs of appeal hit the poor harder, the majority divined "an invidious classification between the \'rich\' and the \'poor.\'" <i>Ibid. </i>Disputing this early manifestation of the "disparate impact" theory of equal protection, Justice Harlan argued:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[N]o economic burden attendant upon the exercise of a privilege bears equally upon all, and in other circumstances the resulting differentiation is not treated as an invidious classification by the State, even though discrimination against \'indigents\' by name would be unconstitutional." <i>Ibid.</i></p></blockquote><p>Justice Harlan offered the example of a state university that conditions an education on the payment of tuition. If charging tuition did not create a discriminatory classification, then, Justice Harlan wondered, how did any other reasonable exaction by a State for a service it provides? "The resulting classification would be invidious in all cases, and an invidious classification offends equal protection regardless of the seriousness of the consequences." <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis deleted). The issue in <i>Griffin </i>was not whether Illinois had made a reasonable classification, but whether the State acted reasonably in failing to remove disabilities that existed wholly independently of state action. To Justice Harlan this was not an inquiry typically posed under the Equal Protection Clause.</p><p>In <i>Douglas </i>v. <i>California, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/353/case.html">372 U. S. 353</a> (1963), Justice Harlan again confronted what Justice Clark termed the Court\'s "fetish for indigency," id., at 359 (dissenting opinion). Regarding a law limiting the appointment of appellate counsel for indigents, Justice Harlan pointed out that "[l]aws such as these do not deny equal protection to the less fortunate for one essential reason: the Equal Protection Clause does not impose on the States \'an affirmative duty to lift the handi-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="135">135</a></p><p>caps flowing from differences in economic circumstances.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 362 (dissenting opinion) (footnote omitted).</p><p>Justice Harlan\'s views were accepted by the Court in <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U. S. 229</a> (1976), in which "[w]e rejected a disparate impact theory of the Equal Protection Clause altogether." <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>Casey, supra, </i>at 375 (concurring opinion). We spurned the claim that "a law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government to pursue, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one race than of another." 426 U. S., at 242. Absent proof of discriminatory purpose, official action did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment <i>"solely </i>because it has a racially disparate impact." <i>Id., </i>at 239 (emphasis in original). Hearkening back to Justice Harlan\'s dissents in <i>Griffin </i>and <i>Douglas, </i>we recognized that</p><blockquote><p>\n"[a] rule that a statute designed to serve neutral ends is nevertheless invalid, absent compelling justification, if in practice it benefits or burdens one race more than another would be far reaching and would raise serious questions about, and perhaps invalidate, a whole range of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes that may be more burdensome to the poor and to the average black than to the more affluent white." 426 U. S., at 248 (footnote omitted).</p></blockquote><p>The lesson of <i>Davis </i>is that the Equal Protection Clause shields only against purposeful discrimination: A disparate impact, even upon members of a racial minority, the classification of which we have been most suspect, does not violate equal protection. The Clause is not a panacea for perceived social or economic inequity; it seeks to "guarante[e] equal laws, not equal results." <i>Personnel Administrator of Mass.</i></p><p>Since <i>Davis, </i>we have regularly required more of an equal protection claimant than a showing that state action has a</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="136">136</a></p><p>harsher effect on him or her than on others. See, <i>e. g., Harris </i>v. <i>McRae, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/297/case.html">448 U. S. 297</a>, 324, n. 26 (1980) ("The equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment prohibits only purposeful discrimination, and when a facially neutral federal statute is challenged on equal protection grounds, it is incumbent upon the challenger to prove that Congress selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of, not merely in spite of, its adverse effects upon an identifiable group" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); see also <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>Casey, </i>518 U. S., at 375 (concurring opinion) (citing cases). Our frequent pronouncements that the Fourteenth Amendment is not violated by disparate impact have spanned challenges to statutes alleged to affect disproportionately members of one race, <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis, supra; </i>members of one sex, <i>Personnel Administrator </i>v. <i>Feeney, supra; </i>and poor persons seeking to exercise protected rights, <i>Harris </i>v. <i>McRae, supra; Maher </i>v. <i>Roe, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/464/case.html">432 U. S. 464</a>, 470-471 (1977).</p><p>The majority attempts to avoid what I regard as the irresistible force of the <i>Davis </i>line of cases, but I am unconvinced by the effort. The majority states that persons in cases like those cited above "sought state aid to subsidize their privately initiated action or to alleviate the consequences of differences in economic circumstances that existed apart from state action." <i>Ante, </i>at 125. Petitioner, in apparent contrast, "is endeavoring to defend against the State\'s destruction of her family bonds, and to resist the brand associated with a parental unfitness adjudication." <i>Ibid. </i>She, "[l]ike a defendant resisting criminal conviction, ... seeks to be spared from the State\'s devastatingly adverse action." <i>Ibid. </i>But, also like a defendant resisting criminal conviction, petitioner is not constitutionally entitled to post-trial process. See <i>ante, </i>at 110, 120. She defended against the "destruction of her family bonds" in the Chancery Court hearing at which she was accorded all the process this Court has required of the States in parental termination cases. She now desires "state aid to subsidize [her] privately initi-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="137">137</a></p><p>ated" appeal-an appeal that neither petitioner nor the majority claims Mississippi is required to provide-to overturn the determination that resulted from that hearing. I see no principled difference between a facially neutral rule that serves in some cases to prevent persons from availing themselves of state employment, or a state-funded education, or a state-funded abortion-each of which the State may, but is not required to, provide-and a facially neutral rule that prevents a person from taking an appeal that is available only because the State chooses to provide it.</p><p>Nor does <i>Williams </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/235/case.html">399 U. S. 235</a> (1970), a case decided six years earlier, operate to limit <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis. Williams </i>was yet another manifestation of the "equalizing" notion of equal protection that this Court began to question in <i>Davis. </i>See <i>Williams, supra, </i>at 260 (Harlan, J., concurring in result). To the extent its reasoning survives <i>Davis, </i>I think that <i>Williams </i>is distinguishable. Petitioner Williams was incarcerated beyond the maximum statutory sentence because he was unable to pay the fine imposed as part of his sentence. We found the law that permitted prisoners to avoid extrastatutory imprisonment only by paying their fines to violate the Equal Protection Clause. Even though it was" \'nondiscriminatory on its face,\' " the law "work[ed] an invidious discrimination" as to Williams and all other indigents because they could not afford to pay their fines. 399 U. S., at 242. The majority concludes that the sanctions involved in <i>Williams </i>are analogous to "the Mississippi prescription here at issue," in that both do not have merely a disparate impact, "they apply to all indigents and do not reach anyone outside that class." <i>Ante, </i>at 127. Even assuming that Williams\' imprisonment gave rise to an equal protection violation, however, M. L. B.\'s circumstances are not comparable. M. L. B.\'s parental rights were terminated-the analog to Williams\' extended imprisonment-because the Chancery Court found, after a hearing, that she was unfit to remain her children\'s mother, not because she was indigent. Her indigency only prevented her from tak-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="138">138</a></p><p>ing advantage of procedures above and beyond those required by the Constitution-in the same way that indigency frequently prevents persons from availing themselves of a variety of state services.1</p><p>The Griffin line of cases ascribed to-one might say announced-an equalizing notion of the Equal Protection Clause that would, I think, have startled the Fourteenth Amendment\'s Framers. In those cases, the Court did not find, nor did it seek, any purposeful discrimination on the part of the state defendants. That their statutes had disproportionate effect on poor persons was sufficient for us to find a constitutional violation. In <i>Davis, </i>among other cases, we began to recognize the potential mischief of a disparate impact theory writ large, and endeavored to contain it. In this case, I would continue that enterprise. Mississippi\'s requirement of prepaid transcripts in civil appeals seeking to contest the sufficiency of the evidence adduced at trial is facially neutral; it creates no classification. The transcript rule reasonably obliges would-be appellants to bear the costs of availing themselves of a service that the State chooses, but is not constitutionally required, to provide.2 Any ad-</p><p>1 Similarly, <i>Harper </i>v. <i>Virginia Ed. of Elections, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/663/case.html">383 U. S. 663</a> (1966), struck down a poll tax that directly restricted the exercise of a right found in that case to be fundamental-the right to vote in state elections. The fee that M. L. B. is unable to pay does not prevent the exercise of a fundamental right directly: The fundamental interest identified by the majority is not the right to a civil appeal, it is rather the right to maintain the parental relationship.</p><p>2 Petitioner suggests that Mississippi\'s $2 per page charge exceeds the actual cost of transcription. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 8. She stops short of asserting that the charge is unreasonable or irrational. While not conclusive, I note that Mississippi\'s transcript charge falls comfortably within the range of charges throughout the Nation. See, <i>e. </i>g., Ariz. Rev. Stat.

Even were I convinced that the cases on which the majority today relies ought to be retained, I could not agree with the majority\'s extension of them.</p><p>The interest at stake in this case differs in several important respects from that at issue in cases such as <i>Griffin. </i>Petitioner\'s interest in maintaining a relationship with her children is the subject of a civil, not criminal, action. While certain civil suits may tend at the margin toward criminal cases, and criminal cases may likewise drift toward civil suits, the basic distinction between the two finds root in the Constitution and has largely retained its vitality in our jurisprudence. In dissent in <i>Boddie </i>v. <i>Connecticut, </i>Justice Black stated that "in <i>Griffin </i>the Court studiously and carefully refrained from saying one word or one sentence suggesting that the rule there announced to control rights of criminal defendants would control in the quite different field of civil cases." 401 U. S., at 390. The Constitution provides for a series of protections of the unadorned liberty interest at stake in criminal proceedings. These express protections include the Fifth Amendment\'s guarantee of grand jury indictment, and protection against double jeopardy and selfincrimination; the Sixth Amendment\'s guarantees of a speedy and public jury trial, of the ability to confront witnesses, and of compulsory process and assistance of counsel; and the Eighth Amendment\'s protections against excessive bail and fines, and against cruel and unusual punishment. This Court has given content to these textual protections, and has identified others contained in the Due Process Clause. These protections are not available to the typical</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="140">140</a></p><p>civil litigant. Even where the interest in a civil suit has been labeled "fundamental," as with the interest in parental termination suits, the protections extended pale by comparison. A party whose parental rights are subject to termination is entitled to appointed counsel, but only in certain circumstances. See <i>Lassiter, </i>452 U. S., at 31-32. His or her rights cannot be terminated unless the evidence meets a standard higher than the preponderance standard applied in the typical civil suit, but the standard is still lower than that required before a guilty verdict. See <i>Santosky </i>v. <i>Kramer, </i>455 U. S., at 769-770.</p><p>That said, it is true enough that civil and criminal cases do not always stand in bold relief to one another. <i>Mayer </i>v. <i>Chicago, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/189/case.html">404 U. S. 189</a> (1971), marks a particularly discomfiting point along the border between the civil and criminal areas. Based on <i>Griffin, </i>the Court determined there that an indigent defendant had a constitutional right to a free transcript in aid of appealing his conviction for violating city ordinances, which resulted in a $500 fine and no imprisonment. In <i>Scott </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/367/case.html">440 U. S. 367</a> (1979), we concluded that an indigent defendant charged with a crime that was not punishable by imprisonment was not entitled to appointed counsel. And yet, in <i>Lassiter, supra, </i>we held that, in some cases, due process required provision of assistance of counsel before the termination of parental rights. The assertion that civil litigants have no right to the free transcripts that all criminal defendants enjoy is difficult to sustain in the face of our holding that some civil litigants are entitled to the assistance of counsel to which some criminal defendants are not. It is at this unsettled (and unsettling) place that the majority lays the foundation of its holding. See <i>ante, </i>at 120-124. The majority\'s solution to the "anamol[yJ" that a misdemeanant receives a free transcript but no trial counsel, while a parental-rights terminee receives (sometimes) trial counsel, but no transcript, works an extension of <i>Mayer. </i>I</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="141">141</a></p><p>would answer the conundrum differently: Even if the <i>Griffin </i>line were sound, <i>Mayer </i>was an unjustified extension that should be limited to its facts, if not overruled.</p><p>Unlike in <i>Scott </i>and <i>Lassiter, </i>the Court gave short shrift in <i>Mayer </i>to the distinction, as old as our Constitution, between crimes punishable by imprisonment and crimes punishable merely by fines. See <i>Lassiter, supra, </i>at 26-27; <i>Scott, supra, </i>at 373. Even though specific text-based constitutional protections have been withheld in cases not involving the prospect of imprisonment, the Court found the difference of no moment in <i>Mayer. </i>The Court reasoned that "[t]he invidiousness of the discrimination that exists when criminal procedures are made available only to those who can pay is not erased by any differences in the sentences that may be imposed." 404 U. S., at 197. We reap today what we sowed then. If requiring payment for procedures (e. g., appeals) that are not themselves required is invidious discrimination no matter what sentence results, it is difficult to imagine why it is not invidious discrimination no matter what results and no matter whether the procedures involve a criminal or civil case. See <i>supra, </i>at 135. To me this points up the difficulty underlying the entire <i>Griffin </i>line. Taking the <i>Griffin </i>line as a given, however, and in the absence of any obvious limiting principle, I would restrict it to the criminal appeals to which its authors, see <i>Boddie </i>v. <i>Connecticut, 401 </i>U. S., at 389 (Black, J., dissenting), sought to limit it.</p><p>The distinction between criminal and civil cases-if blurred at the margins-has persisted throughout the law. The distinction that the majority seeks to draw between the case we confront today and the other civil cases that we will surely face tomorrow is far more ephemeral. If all that is required to trigger the right to a free appellate transcript is that the interest at stake appear to us to be as fundamental as the interest of a convicted misdemeanant, several kinds of civil suits involving interests that seem fundamental</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="142">142</a></p><p>enough leap to mind. Will the Court, for example, nowextend the right to a free transcript to an indigent seeking to appeal the outcome of a paternity suit? 3 To those who wish to appeal custody determinations? 4 How about persons against whom divorce decrees are entered? 5 Civil suits that arise out of challenges to zoning ordinances with an impact on families? 6 Why not foreclosure actions-or at least fore-</p><p>3 In <i>Little </i>v. <i>Streater, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/1/case.html">452 U.

The Court observed that "[a]part from the putative father\'s pecuniary interest in avoiding a substantial support obligation and liberty interest threatened by the possible sanctions for noncompliance, at issue is the creation of a parent-child relationship. This Court frequently has stressed the importance of familial bonds, whether or not legitimized by marriage, and accorded them constitutional protection. Just as the termination of such bonds demands procedural fairness, so too does their imposition." <i>Id., </i>at 13 (citations omitted). <i>Little\'s </i>description of the interest at stake in a paternity suit seems to place it on par with the interest here.</p><p>Justice Blackmun, dissenting in <i>Lassiter </i>v. <i>Department of Social Servs. of Durham Cty., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/18/case.html">452 U.

(Emphasis deleted.)</p><p>As the majority indicates, <i>ante, </i>at 118, n. 11, we have distinguishedin my view unpersuasively-between the requirements of due process in paternity suits and in termination suits. See <i>Rivera </i>v. <i>Minnich, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/574/case.html">483 U. S. 574</a> (1987).

The holdings of <i>Santosky </i>and <i>Lassiter-both </i>of which involved parental termination-have not, we are told, been applied to other areas of law. <i>Ante, </i>at 128. This is not comforting. Both <i>Santosky </i>and <i>Lassiter </i>are cases that determined the requirements of due process (not equal protection) in the parental rights termination area. As the Court has said countless times, the requirements of due process vary considerably with the interest involved and the action to which it is subject. It is little wonder, then, that the specific due process requirements for one sort of action are not readily transferable to others. I have my doubts that today\'s opinion will be so confined. In the first place, it is not clear whether it is an equal protection or a due process opinion. Moreover, the principle on which it appears to rest hardly seems capable of stemming the tide. Petitioner is permitted a free appellate transcript because the interest that underlies her civil claim compares favorably to the interest of the misdemeanant facing a $500 fine and unknown professional difficulties in <i>Mayer </i>v. <i>Chicago. </i>Under the rule announced today, I do not see how a civil litigant could constitutionally be denied a free transcript in any case that involves an interest that is arguably as important as the interest in <i>Mayer </i>(which would appear to include all the types of cases that I mention above, and perhaps many others).8 What is more, it must be remembered that <i>Griffin </i>did not merely invent</p><p>7 Cf. <i>Lindsey </i>v. <i>Normet, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/56/case.html">405 U.

Mississippi pointed out in its brief that of these civil actions, "39,475 were domestic relations cases," "1027 involved custody or visitation, and 6080 were paternity cases."

See, <i>e. g., Bounds, </i>430 U. S., at 822 (right to prison law libraries or legal assistance); <i>Douglas, </i>372 U. S., at 356 (right to free appellate counsel). I fear that the growth of <i>Griffin </i>in the criminal area may be mirrored in the civil area.</p><p>In brushing aside the distinction between criminal and civil cases-the distinction that has constrained <i>Griffin </i>for 40 years-the Court has eliminated the last meaningful limit on the free-floating right to appellate assistance. From <i>Mayer, </i>an unfortunate outlier in the <i>Griffin </i>line, has sprung the <i>M. L. B. </i>line, and I have no confidence that the majority\'s assurances that the line starts and ends with this case will hold true.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>As the majority points out, many States already provide for <i>in forma pauperis </i>civil appeals, with some making special allowances for parental termination cases. I do not dispute the wisdom or charity of these heretofore voluntary allocations of the various States\' scarce resources. I agree that, for many-if not most-parents, the termination of their right to raise their children would be an exaction more dear than any other. It seems perfectly reasonable for States to choose to provide extraconstitutional procedures to ensure that any such termination is undertaken with care. I do not agree, however, that a State that has taken the step, not required by the Constitution, of permitting appeals from termination decisions somehow violates the Constitution when it charges reasonable fees of all would-be appellants. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
