S. 48</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In 1956, Congress enacted the Bank Holding Company Act to control the future expansion of bank holding companies and to require divestment of their nonbanking interests. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Act, however, authorizes the Federal Reserve Board (Board) to allow holding companies to acquire or retain ownership in companies whose activities are "so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In 1972, the Board amended its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="49">Page 450 U. S. 49</a></p><p> regulations to enlarge the category of activities that it would regard as "closely related to banking," and therefore permissible for bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries.  Specifically, the Board determined that the services of an investment adviser to a closed-end investment company may be such a permissible activity.  The question presented by this case is whether the Board had the statutory authority to make that determination.</p>\n<p>The Board\'s determination, which was implemented by an amendment to its "Regulation Y," permits bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries to act as an investment adviser as that term is defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Although the statutory definition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="50">Page 450 U. S. 50</a></p><p> is a detailed one, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the typical relationship between an investment adviser and an investment company can be briefly described.  Investment companies, by pooling the resources of small investors under the guidance of one manager, provide those investors with diversification and expert management. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Investment advisers generally organize and manage investment companies pursuant to a contractual arrangement with the company. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In return for a management fee, the adviser </p><p><a class="page-number" name="51">Page 450 U. S. 51</a></p><p> selects the company\'s investment portfolio and supervises most aspects of its business. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Board issued an interpretive ruling in connection with its amendment to Regulation Y.  That ruling distinguished "open-end" investment companies (commonly referred to as "mutual funds") from "closed-end" investment companies.  The ruling explained that</p>\n<p>"a mutual fund is an investment company, which, typically, is continuously engaged in the issuance of its shares and stands ready at any time to redeem the securities as to which it is the issuer; a closed-end investment company typically does not issue shares after its initial organization except at infrequent intervals and does not stand ready to redeem its shares. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]"</p>\n<p>Because open-end investment companies will redeem their shares, they must constantly issue securities to prevent shrinkage of assets. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In contrast, the capital structure of a closed-end company is similar to that of other corporations; if its shareholders wish to sell, they must do so in the marketplace.  Without any obligation to redeem, closed-end companies need not continuously seek new capital. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="52">Page 450 U. S. 52</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Board\' interpretive ruling expressed the opinion that a bank holding company may not lawfully sponsor, organize, or control an open-end investment company, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] but the Board perceived no objection to sponsorship of a closed-end investment company provided that certain restrictions are observed. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Among those restrictions is a requirement that the investment company may not primarily or frequently engage in the issuance, sale, and distribution of securities; a requirement that the investment adviser may not have any ownership interest in the investment company, or extend credit to it; and a requirement that the adviser may not underwrite or otherwise participate in the sale or distribution of the investment company\'s securities. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 450 U. S. 53</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Respondent Investment Company Institute, a trade association of open-end investment companies, commenced this litigation challenging as in excess of the Board\'s statutory authority the determination that investment adviser services are "closely related" to banking.  Both in proceedings before the Board and in a direct review proceeding in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, respondent based this challenge on the Banking Act of 1933, commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act, in which Congress placed restrictions on the securities-related business of banks in order to protect their depositors. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals rejected respondent\'s argument that Regulation Y, as amended, violated the Glass-Steagall Act, relying on the fact that the prohibitions of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21 of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 450 U. S. 54</a></p><p> that Act [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] apply only to banks, rather than to bank holding companies or their nonbanking subsidiaries.  196 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 606 F.2d 1004.  The court nevertheless concluded that \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act did not authorize the regulation.  The court reasoned that the legislative history of the Act demonstrates that Congress did not intend the Bank Holding Company Act to restrict the scope of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Because the court read the legislative history to indicate that Congress perceived the Glass-Steagall Act as an effort to effect as complete a separation as possible between the securities business and the commercial banking business, the court read a similar intent into the Bank Holding Company Act.  The Court of Appeals believed that activities permitted by the challenged regulation were not consistent with the congressional intent to effect this separation.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari because of the importance of the Court of Appeals holding.  444 U.S. 1070.  We are persuaded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 450 U. S. 55</a></p><p> that the language of both the Bank Holding Company Act and the Glass-Steagall Act, as well as our interpretation of the Glass-Steagall Act in <em>Investment Company Institute v. Camp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/617/case.html">401 U. S. 617</a></span> (1971), supports the Board.  Moreover, contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, we are persuaded that the regulation is consistent with the legislative history of both statutes.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The services of an investment adviser are not significantly different from the traditional fiduciary functions of banks.  The principal activity of an investment adviser is to manage the investment portfolio of its advisee -- to invest and reinvest the funds of the client.  Banks have engaged in that sort of activity for decades. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  As executor, trustee, or managing agent of funds committed to its custody, a bank regularly buys and sells securities for its customers.  Bank trust departments manage employee benefits trusts, institutional and corporate agency accounts, and personal trust and agency accounts. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Moreover, for over 50 years, banks have performed these tasks for trust funds consisting of commingled funds of customers. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  These common trust funds administered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="56">Page 450 U. S. 56</a></p><p> by banks would be regulated as investment companies by the Investment Company Act of 1940 were they not exempted from the Act\'s coverage. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The Board\'s conclusion that the services performed by an investment adviser are "so closely related to banking . . . as to be a proper incident thereto" is therefore supported by banking practice and by a normal reading of the language of \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8). [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>The Board\'s determination of what activities are "closely related" to banking is entitled to the greatest deference. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 450 U. S. 57</a></p><p> Such deference\' is particularly appropriate in this case because the regulation under attack is merely a general determination that investment advisory services which otherwise satisfy the restrictions imposed by the Board\'s interpretive ruling constitute an activity that is so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Because the authority for any specific investment advisory relationship must be preceded by a further determination by the Board that the relationship can be expected to provide benefits for the public, the Board will have the opportunity to ensure that no bank holding company exceeds the bounds of a bank\'s traditional fiduciary function of managing customers\' accounts. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Thus, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="58">Page 450 U. S. 58</a></p><p> unless the Glass-Stegall Act requires a contrary conclusion, the Board\'s interpretation of the plain language of the Bank Company Holding Act must be upheld.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent\'s principal attack on the Board\'s general determination that investment adviser services are so closely related as to be a proper incident to banking proceeds from the premise that, if such services were performed by a bank, the bank would violate \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Respondent therefore argues that such services may </p><p><a class="page-number" name="59">Page 450 U. S. 59</a></p><p> never be regarded as a "proper incident" that could be performed by a bank affiliate. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  We reject both the premise and the conclusion of this argument.  The performance of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="60">Page 450 U. S. 60</a></p><p> investment advisory services by a bank would not necessarily violate \xc2\xa7 16 or \xc2\xa7 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Moreover, bank affiliates may be authorized to engage in certain activities that are prohibited to banks themselves. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="61">Page 450 U. S. 61</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is familiar history that the Glass-Steagall Act was enacted in 1933 to protect bank depositors from any repetition of the widespread bank closings that occurred during the Great Depression. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Congress was persuaded that speculative activities, partially attributable to the connection between commercial banking and investment banking, had contributed to the rash of bank failures. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  The legislative history reveals that securities firms affiliated with banks had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="62">Page 450 U. S. 62</a></p><p> engaged in perilous underwriting operations, stock speculation, and maintaining a market for the bank\'s own stock, often with the bank\'s resources. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  Congress sought to separate national banks, as completely as possible, from affiliates engaged in such activities. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>Sections 16 and 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act approach the legislative goal of separating the securities business from the banking business from different directions.  The former places a limit on the power of a bank to engage in securities transactions; the latter prohibits a securities firm from engaging in the banking business.  Section 16 expressly prohibits a bank from "underwriting" any issue of a security or purchasing any security for its own account.  The Board\'s interpretive ruling here expressly prohibits a bank holding company or its subsidiaries from participating in the "sale or distribution" of securities of any investment company for which it acts as investment adviser.  12 CFR \xc2\xa7 225.125(h) (1980).  The ruling also prohibits bank holding companies and their subsidiaries from purchasing securities of the investment company for which it acts as investment adviser.  \xc2\xa7 225.125(g). [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Therefore, if the restrictions imposed by the Board\'s interpretive ruling are followed, investment advisory services -- even if performed by a bank -- would not violate the requirements of \xc2\xa7 16.</p>\n<p>We are also satisfied that a bank\'s performance of such services would not necessarily violate \xc2\xa7 21.  In contrast to \xc2\xa7 16, \xc2\xa7 21 prohibits certain kinds of securities firms from engaging in banking.  The \xc2\xa7 21 prohibition applies to any organization "engaged in the business of issuing, underwriting, selling, or distributing" securities.  Such a securities firm may not engage at the same time "to any extent whatever in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="63">Page 450 U. S. 63</a></p><p> the business of. receiving deposits."  The management of a customer\'s investment portfolio -- even when the manager has the power to sell securities owned by the customer -- is not the kind of selling activity that Congress contemplated when it enacted \xc2\xa7 21.  If it were, the statute would prohibit banks from continuing to manage investment accounts in a fiduciary capacity or as an agent for an individual.  We do not believe Congress intended that such a reading be given \xc2\xa7 21. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  Rather, \xc2\xa7 21 presented the converse situation of \xc2\xa7 16, and was intended to require securities firms such as underwriters or brokerage houses to sever their banking connections.  It surely was not intended to require banks to abandon an accepted banking practice that was subjected to regulation under \xc2\xa7 16. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>Even if we were to assume that a bank would violate the Glass-Steagall Act by engaging in certain investment advisory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 450 U. S. 64</a></p><p> services, it would. not follow that a bank holding company could never perform such services.  In both the Glass-Steagall Act itself and in the Bank Holding Company Act, Congress indicated that a bank affiliate may engage in activities that would be impermissible for the bank itself. Thus, \xc2\xa7 21 of Glass-Steagall entirely prohibits the same firm from engaging in banking and in the underwriting business, whereas \xc2\xa7 20 does not prohibit bank affiliation with a securities firm unless that firm is "engaged principally" in activities such as underwriting. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Further, \xc2\xa7 4(c)(7) of the Bank Holding Company Act, which authorizes holding companies to purchase and own shares of investment companies, permits investment activity by a holding company that is impermissible for a bank itself. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  Finally, inasmuch as the Bank Holding Company Act requires divestment only of nonbanking interests, the \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) exception would be unnecessary if it applied only to services that a bank could legally perform.  Thus even if the Glass-Steagall Act did prohibit banks from acting as investment advisers, that prohibition would not necessarily preclude the Board from determining that such adviser services would be permissible under \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8).</p>\n<p>In all events, because all that is presently at issue is the Board\'s preliminary authorization of such services, rather than approval of any specific advisory relationship, speculation about possible conflicts with the Glass-Steagall Act is plainly not a sufficient basis for totally rejecting the Board\'s carefully considered determination.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our conclusions with respect to the Glass-Steagall Act are in no way altered by consideration of our decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/617/case.html">Investment</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 450 U.

The Court there held that a regulation issued by the Comptroller of the Currency purporting to authorize banks to operate mutual funds violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act.  The mutual fund under review in that case was the functional equivalent of an open-end investment company. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  Because the authorization at issue in this case is expressly limited to closed-end investment companies, the holding in <em>Camp</em> is clearly not dispositive.  Respondent argues, however, that both the Court\'s reasoning in <em>Camp</em> and its description of the "more subtle hazards" created by the performance of investment advisory services by a bank are inconsistent with the Board\'s action.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>In <em>Camp,</em> the Court relied squarely on the literal language of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act.  After noting that \xc2\xa7 16 prohibited the underwriting by a national bank of any issue of securities and the purchase for its own account of shares of stock of any corporation, and that \xc2\xa7 21 prohibited corporations from both receiving deposits and engaging in issuing, underwriting, selling, or distributing securities, the Court recognized that the statutory language plainly applied to a bank\'s sale of redeemable and transferable "units of participation" in a common investment fund operated by the bank.  401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/617/case.html#634">401 U. S. 634</a></span>.  Because the Court held that the bank was the underwriter of the fund\'s units of participation within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 450 U. S. 66</a></p><p> <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/617/case.html#622">401 U. S. 622</a></span>-623, the Comptroller attempted to avoid the reach of \xc2\xa7 16 by arguing that the units of participation were not "securities" within the meaning of the Glass-Steagall Act.  The Court\'s contrary determination led inexorably to the conclusion that \xc2\xa7 16 had been violated.</p>\n<p>This case presents an entirely different issue.  No one could dispute the fact that the shares in a closed-end investment company are securities.  But as we have indicated, such securities are not issued, sold, or underwritten by the investment adviser.  In contrast to the bank\'s activities in issuing, underwriting, selling, and redeeming the units of participation in the <em>Camp</em> case, in this case, the Board\'s interpretive ruling expressly prohibits such activity. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Camp</em> recognized that, in enacting the Glass-Steagall Act, Congress contemplated other hazards in addition to the danger of banks using bank assets in imprudent securities investments. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  But none of these "more subtle hazards" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 450 U. S. 67</a></p><p> would be present were a bank to act as an investment adviser to a closed-end investment company subject to the restrictions imposed by the Board.  Those restrictions would prevent the bank from extending credit to the investment company, and would also preclude the promotional pressures that are inherent in the investment banking business. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  In addition to the fact that the bank could not underwrite or sell the stock of the closed-end investment company, that company, unlike a mutual fund, would not be constantly involved in the search for new capital to cover the redemption of other stock.  The advisory fee earned by the bank would provide little incentive to the bank or its holding company to engage in promotional activities. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 450 U. S. 68</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Our obligation to accord deference to the Board\'s interpretive ruling provides added support to our conclusion that the Board\'s regulation avoids the potential hazards involved in any association between a bank affiliate and a closed-end investment company. In <em>Camp,</em> the Court emphasized that the Comptroller of the Currency had provided no guidance as to the effect of the Glass-Steagall Act on the proposed activity. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  Whereas, in <em>Camp,</em> the Court was deprived of administrative "expertise that can enlighten and rationalize the search for the meaning and intent of Congress," 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/617/case.html#628">401 U. S. 628</a></span>, in this case, the regulatory action by the Board recognized and addressed the concerns that led to the enactment of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Contrary to respondent\'s argument, the <em>Camp</em> decision therefore affirmatively supports the Board\'s action in this case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals rested its conclusion that the Board had exceeded its statutory authority on a review of the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8).  As originally enacted in 1956, the section referred to activities "closely related to the business of banking."  In 1970, when the Act was amended to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 450 U. S. 69</a></p><p> extend its coverage to holding companies controlling just one bank, the words "business of" were deleted from \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8), thereby making the section refer merely to activities "closely related to banking."  The conclusion of the Court of Appeals did not, however, place special reliance on this modest change.  Rather, the Court of Appeals was persuaded that, in 1956, Congress believed that the Glass-Steagall Act had been enacted in 1933 to "divorc[e] investment from commercial banking," and that the 1970 amendment to \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) did not alter the intent expressed by the 1956 Congress.  196 U.S.App.D.C. at 110, 606 F.2d at 1017.</p>\n<p>Congress did intend the Bank Holding Company Act to maintain and even to strengthen Glass-Steagall\'s restrictions on the relationship between commercial and investment banking.  Part of the motivation underlying the requirement that bank holding companies divest themselves of nonbanking interests was the desire to provide a measure of regulation missing from the Glass-Steagall Act. [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  In 1956, the only provision of the Glass-Steagall Act which regulated bank holding companies was \xc2\xa7 19(e) of the Act, which provided that a bank holding company could not obtain a permit from the Federal Reserve Board entitling it to vote the shares of a bank subsidiary unless it agreed to divest itself within five years of any interest in a company formed for the purpose of, or "engaged principally" in, the issuance or underwriting of securities. [<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  This provision was largely ineffectual, because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 450 U. S. 70</a></p><p> bank holding companies were not subject to the divestiture requirement as long as they did not vote their bank subsidiary shares. [<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>]  Thus, bank holding companies were able to avoid Glass-Steagall\'s general purpose of separating as completely as possible commercial from investment banking in a way not available to other bank affiliates or banks themselves.  The inadequacy of \xc2\xa7 19(e) therefore lay not in the type of affiliation with securities-related firms permitted to bank holding companies but in the ability of holding companies to avoid any restrictions on affiliation by simply not voting their shares.  To the extent that Congress strengthened the Glass-Steagall Act, it did so by closing this loophole, rather than by imposing further restrictions on the permissible securities-related business of bank affiliates. [<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]  The clear evidence of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="71">Page 450 U. S. 71</a></p><p> congressional purpose in 1956 to remedy the inadequacy of \xc2\xa7 19(e) of the 1933 Act does not support the conclusion that Congress also intended \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) to be read as totally prohibiting bank holding companies from being "engaged" in any securities-related activities; on the contrary, it is more accurately read as merely completing the job of severing the connection between bank holding companies and affiliates "principally engaged" in the securities business. [<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]</p>\n<p>To invalidate the Board\'s regulation, the Court of Appeals had to assume that the activity of managing investments for a customer had been regarded by Congress as an aspect of investment banking, rather than an aspect of commercial banking.  But the Congress that enacted the Glass-Steagall Act did not take such an expansive view of investment banking. [<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>]  Investment advisers and closed-end investment companies are not "principally engaged" in the issuance or the underwriting of securities within the meaning of the Glass-Steagall Act, even if they are so engaged within the meaning of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21. [<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>]  Nothing in the legislative history of the Bank Holding Company Act persuades us that Congress, in 1956, intended to effect a more complete separation between commercial and investment banking than the separation that the Glass-Steagall Act had achieved with respect to banks in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21 and had sought unsuccessfully to achieve with respect to bank holding companies in \xc2\xa7 19(e). [<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="72">Page 450 U. S. 72</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A review of the 1970 Amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act only strengthens this conclusion. [<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]  On its face, the 1970 amendment to \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) would appear to have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="73">Page 450 U. S. 73</a></p><p> broadened the Board\'s authority to determine when an activity is sufficiently related to banking to be permissible for a nonbanking subsidiary of a bank holding company. [<a href="#F51" name="T51">Footnote 51</a>]  The initial versions of both the House and the Senate bills changed the "closely related" test of \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) to a "functionally related" test. [<a href="#F52" name="T52">Footnote 52</a>]  The Conference Committee\'s final version of the bill, however, retained the "closely related" language of the 1956 Act. [<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>]  Whether this indicated that \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) was to have the same scope as it did under the 1956 Act is difficult to discern. [<a href="#F54" name="T54">Footnote 54</a>]  For purposes of this case, however, we need </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 450 U. S. 74</a></p><p> not reconcile the conflicting views as to whether the 1970 amendment expanded the scope of \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8), because no one disputes that the Board\'s discretion is at least as broad under the 1970 Amendments as it was under the 1956 Act.  Therefore, our conclusion that nothing in the 1956 Act or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended to prohibit bank holding companies from acting as investment advisers to closed-end investment companies should also apply to the 1970 Amendments unless Congress specifically indicated that such services should not be authorized by the Board.  Not only is there no such specific evidence, there is affirmative evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>The legislative history of the 1970 Amendments indicates that Congress did not intend the 1970 Amendments to have any effect on the prohibitions of the Glass-Steagall Act.  The Senate chairman of the Conference Committee assured his fellow Senators that the conference bill was intended neither to enlarge nor to restrict the prohibitions contained </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 450 U. S. 75</a></p><p> in the Glass-Steagall Act. [<a href="#F55" name="T55">Footnote 55</a>]  Moreover, the Senate Report refers to investment services, but declines to state that the Board could not approve under \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) "bank sponsored mutual funds." [<a href="#F56" name="T56">Footnote 56</a>]  The House\'s version of the bill rigidly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 450 U. S. 76</a></p><p> confined the Board\'s discretion in certain areas by including a "laundry list" of activities which the Board could not approve.  Included in this list was a prohibition of bank holding company acquisition of shares of any company engaged in "the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution," of securities, "whether or not any such interests ar redeemable." [<a href="#F57" name="T57">Footnote 57</a>]  The Conference Committee deleted this list.  This deletion indicates a rejection of the House\'s restrictive approach in favor of the Senate\'s more flexible attitude toward the Board\'s exercise of its discretion. [<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>]  Thus, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="77">Page 450 U. S. 77</a></p><p> as we read the legislative history of the 1970 Amendments, Congress did not intend the Bank Holding Company Act to limit the Board\'s discretion to approve securities-related activity as closely related to banking beyond the prohibitions already contained in the Glass-Steagall Act. [<a href="#F59" name="T59">Footnote 59</a>]  This case is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="78">Page 450 U. S. 78</a></p><p> therefore one that is best resolved by deferring to the Board\'s expertise in determining what activities are encompassed within the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p>Because we have concluded that the Board\'s decision to permit bank holding companies to act as investment advisers for closed-end investment companies is consistent with the language of the Bank Holding Company Act, and because such services are not prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act, we hold that the amendment to Regulation Y does not exceed the Board\'s statutory authority.

The legislative history of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 indicated that the Amendments were not intended to cut back on the discretion afforded the Board.  As Senator Bennett, a member of the Conference Committee, indicated, the 1970 Amendments maintained</p>\n<p>"maximum flexibility for the Federal Reserve Board to determine the activities in which a bank holding company and its subsidiaries may engage. . . ."</p>\n<p>116 Cong.Rec. 42432 (1970).  <em>See</em> <a href="#F58" name="T58">n</a> 58, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F15" name="T15">n</a> 15, <em>supra.</em>  We agree with the Court of Appeals that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21 apply only to banks, and not to bank holding companies.  Section 21 prohibits firms engaged in the securities business from also receiving deposits.  Bank holding companies do not receive deposits, and the language of \xc2\xa7 21 cannot be read to include within its prohibition separate organizations related by ownership with a bank, which does receive deposits.  As the following colloquy, cited by the Court of Appeals, between Senator Glass, cosponsor of the bill, and Senator Robinson, indicates, the drafters of the bill agreed with this construction:</p>\n<p>"Mr. GLASS. . . .  Here [\xc2\xa7 21], we prohibit the large private banks, whose chief business is investment business, from receiving deposits.  We separate them from the deposit banking business."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Mr. ROBINSON of Arkansas. That means, if they wish to receive deposits, they must have separate institutions for that purpose?"</p>\n<p>"Mr. GLASS. Yes."</p>\n<p>77 Cong.Rec. 3730 (1933).  Section 16, which prohibits a national bank from "underwriting" any issue of a security, by its terms, applies only to banks.  Although respondent contended here and in the Court of Appeals that the bank and its holding company should be treated as a single entity for purposes of applying \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21, the structure of the Glass-Steagall Act indicates to the contrary.  Sections 16 and 21 flatly prohibit banks from engaging in the underwriting business.  Organizations affiliated with banks, however, are dealt with by other sections of the Act.  Section 19(e), 48 Stat. 188, repealed in pertinent part, 80 Stat. 242, prohibited bank holding companies from voting the shares of a bank subsidiary unless the holding company divested itself of any interest in a subsidiary formed for the purpose of or "engaged principally" in the issuance or underwriting of securities.  More importantly, \xc2\xa7 20 of the Act, 48 Stat. 188, prohibits national banks or state bank members of the Federal Reserve System from owning securities affiliates, defined in \xc2\xa7 2(b), 48 Stat. 162, that are "engaged principally" in the issuance or underwriting of securities.  Thus, the structure of the Act reveals a congressional intent to treat banks separately from their affiliates.  The reading of the Act urged by respondent would render \xc2\xa7 20 meaningless.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent also argues that the regulation authorizes banks, as well as bank holding companies and nonbank subsidiaries, to act as investment advisers.  The operative definition of "bank holding company" in the Board\'s interpretive ruling includes "their bank and nonbank subsidiaries."  12 CFR \xc2\xa7 225.125(c) (1980).  Respondent contends that banks have relied on the interpretive ruling as authorization for them to sponsor investment companies.  Brief for Respondent 13-18.  The simple answer to this argument is that not only does the interpretive ruling confer no authorization to undertake any activities, but also the Board does not have the power to confer such authorization on banks.  As the Board\'s opinion in this case stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he Board\'s regulation was adopted pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, and authorizes investment advisory activity to be conducted by a nonbanking subsidiary of the holding company.  The authority of national banks or state member banks to furnish investment advisory services does not derive from the Board\'s regulation; such authority would exist independently of the Board\'s regulation, and its scope is to be determined by a particular bank\'s primary supervisory agency."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert 61a.  Thus, the regulation applies only to bank holding companies.  Although the interpretive ruling applies to banks, that ruling contains only restrictions on the activity permitted by the regulation.  The Board\'s opinion explained that the restrictions contained in the interpretive ruling were intended to apply to banks when the investment advisory function was performed by a holding company or its nonbanking subsidiaries.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This imposition of restrictions on banks prevented bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries from evading the restrictions by allowing subsidiary banks to perform the restricted activities.  Whether banks are mistakenly relying on the Board\'s interpretive ruling to derive permission to act as investment advisers is not relevant to the determination of the Board\'s power to enact the challenged regulation.  We do note that, at the time of the Court of Appeals decision, the Board represented that no bank had sought the Board\'s approval for an investment adviser service that is a prerequisite to acting pursuant to Board authority.  <em>See</em> 196 U.S.App.D.C. at 107, n. 26, 606 F.2d at 1014, n. 26.  Thus, although in the discussion to follow, we refer to bank affiliation with investment companies, this reference is only for purposes of addressing respondent\'s argument that banks would violate the Glass-Steagall Act by serving as investment advisers to closed-end investment companies.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent also contends that the Board\'s regulation violates \xc2\xa7 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act.  The Court of Appeals did not consider the \xc2\xa7 20 argument, but the respondent has submitted this contention to answer the Board\'s argument that \xc2\xa7 20 is the only relevant section of the Glass-Steagall Act for purposes of determining what services bank holding companies may provide.  Section 20 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"[N]o [national bank] shall be affiliated . . . with any corporation, association, business trust or other similar organization engaged principally in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution at wholesale or retail or through syndicate participation of stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or other securities."</p>\n<p>48 Stat. 188, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 377.  Although "affiliate," as originally defined in \xc2\xa7 2(b) of the Glass-Steagall Act, did not include holding companies, <em>see</em> 48 Stat. 162, Congress, in 1966, amended the statute to bring holding companies within the definition of "affiliate," and thereby within the reach of \xc2\xa7 20.  80 Stat. 242, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 221a(b)(4).  In <em>Board of Governors v. Agnew,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/441/case.html">329 U. S. 441</a></span> (1947), the Court recognized the difference in the extent of prohibition of securities-related activities reflected in the use of the word "engaged" in \xc2\xa7 21, as opposed to the use of the words "engaged principally" in \xc2\xa7 20.  Thus, a less stringent standard should apply to determine whether a holding company has violated \xc2\xa7 20 than is applied to a determination of whether a bank has violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21.  Nevertheless, the Board\'s regulation goes beyond the less stringent standard by prohibiting any involvement by the bank holding company or its subsidiaries in the underwriting or selling of the securities of the investment company.  Moreover, the distinction here between closed-end and open-end investment companies is crucial.  If, as respondent contends, the closed-end company\'s initial issuance of stock were sufficient to render the company "principally engaged" in the issuance of securities, then all corporations, including banks, would at some point be engaged principally in the issuance of securities.  We cannot accept this premise.  Moreover, given our rejection of this premise, it follows that the investment adviser to such a company is clearly not engaged principally in the issuance of securities.  To a certain extent, our conclusions <em>infra</em> with respect to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21 subsume the argument that the regulation is inconsistent with \xc2\xa7 20.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T27" name="F27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>Representative Steagall, cosponsor of the bill, stated in debate:</p>\n<p>"[T]he purpose of this legislation is to protect the people of the United States in the right to have banks in which their deposits will be safe.

Further, depositors of the bank might lose money on investments purchased in reliance on the relationship between the bank and its affiliate.  The pressure on banks to prevent this loss of public confidence could induce the bank to make unsound loans to the affiliate or to companies in whose stock the affiliate has invested.  Moreover, the association between the commercial and investment bank could result in the commercial bank\'s reputation for prudence and restraint being attributed, without justification, to an enterprise selling stocks and securities.  Furthermore, promotional considerations might induce banks to make loans to customers to be used for the purchase of stocks, and might impair the ability of the commercial banker to render disinterested advice.  401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/617/case.html#630">401 U.

The Court of Appeals also cited legislative history indicating that the Board was to have a "limited" authority to administer the \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) exception.  <em>See</em> Control and Regulation of Bank Holding Companies:  Hearings on H.R. 2674 before the House Committee on Banking and Currency, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 14 (1955); Control of Bank Holding Companies:  Hearings on S. 880, S. 2350, and H.R. 6277 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 76 (1955).  The fact that the scope of the Board\'s discretion was to be limited sheds no light on the question of Congress\' view of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Moreover, although the Court of Appeals relied, as indicative of congressional intent regarding the scope of \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8), on the Senate Report\'s omission of any securities-related activities from the listing of activities clearly falling within the \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) exception, 196 U.S.App.D.C. at 110, 606 F.2d at 1017, the Senate Report, after listing those obviously related activities, goes on to indicate the importance of the Board\'s role in approving other such activities.  <em>See</em> 1955 Senate Report at 13;  <a href="#F23" name="T23">n</a> 23, <em>supra.</em>  Finally, the Court of Appeals found significance in the repeal of \xc2\xa7 19(e) of Glass-Steagall in 1966 and the Senate Report\'s indication that \xc2\xa7 19(e) "serve[d] no substantial purpose" after passage of the 1956 Act.  1966 Senate Report at 12.  At the same time as Congress repealed \xc2\xa7 19(e), however, it amended the definition of "affiliate" in \xc2\xa7 2(b) of the Glass-Steagall Act to include bank holding companies, so that the restrictions applying to affiliates contained in \xc2\xa7 20 of the Act then applied to bank holding companies as well.  80 Stat. 242.  Furthermore, the fact that \xc2\xa7 19(e) served no purpose after the passage of the 1956 Act merely indicates that Congress was successful in its attempt to close the loophole left by Congress in the Glass-Steagall Act.  It does not indicate that the 1956 Congress sought to impose more substantial restrictions than those contained in \xc2\xa7 19(e), or that the 1956 Congress misperceived the scope of those restrictions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T50" name="F50">Footnote 50</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> S.Rep.

This view was not shared by all of the Senate Members of the Conference Committee, however.  Senator Bennett criticized the Conference Report as an inaccurate indication of the conference\'s intent, and expressed his belief that the conference intended to broaden the power of the Board to determine what activities are closely related to banking.  116 Cong.Rec. 42432-42437 (1970).  Senator Bennett indicated that the proposed term "functionally related" was no broader than the retained term "closely related," and that the removal of the phrase "of a financial, fiduciary, or insurance nature" was intended to reflect an expansion of the Board\'s discretion.  <em>Id.</em> at 42432-42433.  <em>See also id.</em> at 42422 (remarks of Sen.

I have one question I should like to ask the chairman of the committee."</p>\n<p>"Both the Senate and House bills contained, in section 4(c)(8), substantially similar language reiterating the existing law embodied in the Glass-Steagall Act which provides, essentially, for separation of commercial banking and the securities business.  This language does not appear in the bill agreed to by the conferees.  I wonder whether there was any intention to imply that the very securities-related activities forbidden to banks directly may nevertheless be engaged in by bank holding companies or their nonbanking affiliates."</p>\n<p>"Mr. SPARKMAN.  The answer to the Senator\'s question is that there clearly was not.  As it now stands, the Glass-Steagall Act broadly prohibits both banks and their affiliates from engaging in what we commonly understand to be the securities business.  There are some specific exceptions, of course, but I can assure you that we did not mean to enlarge or contract them here.  We regarded that general prohibition as being so clearly applicable to the subjects of this bill as to make a restatement of it unnecessary.  The provision to which you referred is already complicated enough.  In short, we did not intend to amend or modify, directly or indirectly, any limitations on the activities of banks, bank holding companies or any of their affiliates, now contained in the Glass-Steagall Act.  If Congress is to change that longstanding, fundamental statement of public policy, we will have to do so in other legislation.  I hope there is no longer any misconception on that point."</p>\n<p>"Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey.  It is reassuring, indeed, to know that the Glass-Steagall Act has not been disturbed in any way, and that there is no intention at all here to do so."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 42430.  <em>See also</em> 1970 Senate Report at 15.  By the time Congress was considering the 1970 Amendments, the definition of "affiliate" contained in \xc2\xa7 2(b) of the Glass-Steagall Act had been amended to include bank holding companies, so that the prohibitions contained in \xc2\xa7 20 of Glass-Steagall had become applicable to bank holding companies.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T56" name="F56">Footnote 56</a>]</p>\n<p>1970 Senate Report at 15.  The Report notes that the Senate version of the bill prohibited bank holding companies from holding shares in companies "engaged principally in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution at wholesale or retail or through syndicate participation of stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or securities."  The Report recognized that this provision was a restatement of the prohibition already contained in the Glass-Steagall Act.  The Report goes on to state:</p>\n<p>"The inclusion of this provision is not intended to prejudice the rights of banks or bank holding companies or their affiliates to engage in such of these activities as may be permitted under existing law or which may become permissible under this legislation or under any future legislation.  In particular, the language is not intended to inhibit the underwriting of revenue bonds nor operating commingled or managing agency accounts (bank sponsored mutual funds) which activities have already been specifically approved in legislation previously reported by this committee and passed by the Senate, if such legislation is finally enacted, if these activities are allowed under the amendments being made by this legislation, or if the activities are permitted by the courts."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  When the 1970 Amendments were passed, the status of bank-sponsored mutual funds under the Glass-Steagall Act was unsettled.

In light of the indications in the Senate Report that the Senate did not intend \xc2\xa74(c)(8) to foreclose the Board from approving bank-sponsored mutual funds, <em>see</em> n.  <a href="#F56" name="T56">56</a> <em>supra,</em> and accompanying text, the Senate colloquy cited by the Court of Appeals lends scant support to the theory that Congress misunderstood the scope of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Moreover, the language deleted from the Senate bill\'s version of \xc2\xa74(c)(8) to which Senators Sparkman and Williams were referring contained the "principally engaged" standard contained in \xc2\xa7 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, and not the more complete prohibition contained in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 16 and 21.  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F54" name="T54">54</a> 55, <em>supra.</em>  Furthermore, if Congress was confused about the scope of the Glass-Steagall Act, it may have believed that the statute permitted more than is actually the case.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F55" name="T55">n</a> 55, <em>supra.</em>  Finally, given the flexible approach to \xc2\xa7 4(c)(8) which prevailed in the 1970 amendments, we must presume that Congress did not intend to adopt a rigid and fixed construction of the Glass-Steagall Act, but rather intended that the prevailing view of Glass-Steagall should guide the Board\'s discretion.</p>\n<p>We also disagree with the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that the policies underlying the 1970 Amendments would be frustrated by permitting bank holding companies to act as investment advisers to closed-end investment companies.  <em>See</em> 196 U.S.App.D.C. at 116, 606 F.2d at 1023.  The first policy, the fear that bank holding companies would improperly further the interests of the nonbanking subsidiary, is adequately protected by the Board\'s interpretive ruling.  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F38" name="T38">38-44</a> <em>supra,</em> and accompanying text.  Furthermore, given our conclusion that the 1970 Amendments, at the very least, did not cut back on the discretion granted the Board under the 1956 Act, we believe that, to the extent that Congress addressed in the 1970 Amendments the second policy, the prevention of centralization of economic power, it did so by eliminating the one bank holding company loophole, and not by limiting Board discretion to determine what activities are closely related to banking.  1970 Senate Report at 2-4; 1969 House Report at 2.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
