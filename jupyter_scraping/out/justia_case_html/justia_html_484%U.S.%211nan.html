After petitioner left the store, a fight occurred in which the accomplice and the storekeeper\'s mother were both killed.  Petitioner was convicted of murder and armed robbery, and sentenced to death.  His conviction and sentence were affirmed by the South Carolina Supreme Court in 1982.  <em>State v. Yates,</em> 280 S.C. 29, 310 S.E.2d 805, <em>cert. denied,</em> 462 U.S. 1124 (1983).</p>\n<p>At his trial, petitioner testified that the victim had not even entered the store before he left, and that he had not intended to kill or to harm anyone.  The jury, however, was instructed "that malice is implied or presumed from the use of a deadly weapon." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  A few months after petitioner\'s conviction was affirmed, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that it was error to give such an instruction.  <em>See State v. Elmore,</em> 279 S.C. 417, 308 S.E.2d 781 (1983).  Thereafter, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus from the South Carolina Supreme Court, arguing that the burden-shifting instruction given at his trial was unconstitutional under the state court\'s reasoning in <em>Elmore</em> and under our decision in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/510/case.html">442 U. S. 510</a></span> (1979).  While the application for habeas corpus was pending, we decided another </p><p><a class="page-number" name="213">Page 484 U. S. 213</a></p><p> case involving a burden-shifting instruction, <em>Francis v. Franklin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/307/case.html">471 U. S. 307</a></span> (1985), and petitioner promptly called that decision to the attention of the State Supreme Court.  The court denied the writ without opinion.</p>\n<p>Petitioner then sought a writ of certiorari in this Court.  We summarily vacated the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court and remanded the case "for further consideration in light of <em>Francis v. Franklin.</em>"  <em>Yates v. Aiken,</em> 474 U.S. 896 (1985).  On remand, the state court determined that the jury instruction at petitioner\'s trial "suffered from the same infirmities present in <em>Elmore</em> and addressed in <em>Francis v. Franklin.</em>"  290 S.C. 231, 233, 349 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1986).  Nevertheless, the court held that petitioner was not entitled to relief.  As an explanation for its holding, the court stated that its decision in <em>Elmore</em> should not be applied retroactively to invalidate a conviction that was final when <em>Elmore</em> was decided.  The opinion did not consider whether the decision in <em>Francis v. Franklin</em> might apply retroactively, and also did not discuss our decision in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana,</em> on which petitioner had relied.</p>\n<p>In dissent, Justice Finney reasoned that <em>Elmore</em> and <em>Francis v. Franklin</em> should be applied retroactively, because an instruction that shifts the burden of proof on an element of the offense -- particularly in a capital case -- substantially impairs the truthfinding function of the jury.  Moreover, he reasoned, given our decision in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana</em> in 1979, the case did not represent a significant change in the law.

We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our order remanding the case for further consideration in the light of <em>Francis v. Franklin</em> was predicated entirely on the fact that petitioner\'s challenge to the jury instruction asserted a substantial federal question.  Our opinion in <em>Francis</em> explained why a challenge of this kind is supported by the Federal Constitution:</p>\n<p>"The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment"</p>\n<p>"protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged."</p>\n<p><em>In re Winship,</em> [397 U.S. 358,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html#364">397 U.

United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html">401 U.

Under this theory, the Attorney General argues, petitioner would not be entitled to the benefit of our ruling in <em>Franklin.</em></p>\n<p>We have already endorsed Justice Harlan\'s retroactivity analysis for cases pending on direct appeal, <em>see Griffith v.

To decide this case, however, it is not necessary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="216">Page 484 U.

As he explained in <em>Desist:</em></p>\n<p>"The theory that the habeas petitioner is entitled to the law prevailing at the time of his conviction is, however, one which is more complex than the Court has seemingly recognized.  First, it is necessary to determine whether a particular decision has really announced a \'new\' rule at all, or whether it has simply applied a well-established constitutional principle to govern a case which is closely analogous to those which have been previously considered in the prior case law. . . .  One need not be a rigid partisan of Blackstone to recognize that many, though not all, of this Court\'s constitutional decisions are grounded upon fundamental principles whose content does not change dramatically from year to year, but whose meanings are altered slowly and subtly as generation succeeds generation.  In such a context, it appears very difficult to argue against the application of the \'new\' rule in all habeas cases, since one could never say with any assurance that this Court would have ruled differently at the time the petitioner\'s conviction became final."</p>\n<p>394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#263">394 U. S. 263</a></span>-264.</p>\n<p>This reasoning, which we previously have endorsed, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] is controlling in this case, because our decision in <em>Francis</em> was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 484 U.
