JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In this case, brought under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, we consider the elements and prerequisites for recovery of damages by students who were suspended from public elementary and secondary schools without procedural due process.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the students are entitled to recover substantial nonpunitive damages even if their suspensions were justified, and even if they do not prove that any other actual injury was caused by the denial of procedural due process.  We disagree, and hold that, in the absence of proof of actual injury, the students are entitled to recover only nominal damages.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent Jarius Piphus was a freshman at Chicago Vocational High School during the 1973-1974 school year.  On January 23, 1974, during school hours, the school principal saw Piphus and another student standing outdoors on school property passing back and forth what the principal described as an irregularly shaped cigarette.  The principal approached the students unnoticed and smelled what he believed was the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="249">Page 435 U. S. 249</a></p><p> strong odor of burning marihuana.  He also saw Piphus try to pass a packet of cigarette papers to the other student.  When the students became aware of the principal\'s presence, they threw the cigarette into a nearby hedge.</p>\n<p>The principal took the students to the school\'s disciplinary office and directed the assistant principal to impose the "usual" 20-day suspension for violation of the school rule against the use of drugs. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The students protested that they had not been smoking marihuana, but to no avail.  Piphus was allowed to remain at school, although not in class, for the remainder of the school day while the assistant principal tried, without success, to reach his mother.</p>\n<p>A suspension notice was sent to Piphus\' mother, and, a few days later, two meetings were arranged among Piphus, his mother, his sister, school officials, and representatives from a legal aid clinic.  The purpose of the meetings was not to determine whether Piphus had been smoking marihuana, but rather to explain the reasons for the suspension.  Following an unfruitful exchange of views, Piphus and his mother, as guardian <em>ad litem,</em> filed suit against petitioners in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 and its jurisdictional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="250">Page 435 U. S. 250</a></p><p> counterpart, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343, charging that Piphus had been suspended without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, together with actual and punitive damages in the amount Of $3,000. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Piphus was readmitted to school under a temporary restraining order after eight days of his suspension.</p>\n<p>Respondent Silas Brisco was in the sixth grade at Clara Barton Elementary School in Chicago during the 1973-1974 school year.  On September 11, 1973, Brisco came to school wearing one small earring.  The previous school year, the school principal had issued a rule against the wearing of earrings by male students because he believed that this practice denoted membership in certain street gangs and increased the likelihood that gang members would terrorize other students.  Brisco was reminded of this rule, but he refused to remove the earring, asserting that it was a symbol of black pride, not of gang membership.</p>\n<p>The assistant principal talked to Brisco\'s mother, advising her that her son would be suspended for 20 days if he did not remove the earring.  Brisco\'s mother supported her son\'s position, and a 20-day suspension was imposed.  Brisco and his mother, as guardian <em>ad litem,</em> filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343, charging that Brisco had been suspended without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The complaint </p><p><a class="page-number" name="251">Page 435 U. S. 251</a></p><p> sought declaratory and injunctive relief, together with actual and punitive damages in the amount of $5,000. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Brisco was readmitted to school during the pendency of proceedings,for a preliminary injunction after 17 days of his suspension.</p>\n<p>Piphus\' and Brisco\'s cases were consolidated for trial and submitted on stipulated records.  The District Court held that both students had been suspended without procedural due process. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  It also held that petitioners were not entitled to qualified immunity from damages under the second branch of <em>Wood v. Strickland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/308/case.html">420 U. S. 308</a></span> (1975), because they "should have known that a lengthy suspension without any adjudicative hearing of any type" would violate procedural due process.  App. to Pet. for Cert.  A14. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Despite these holdings, the District Court declined to award damages because:</p>\n<p>"Plaintiffs put no evidence in the record to quantify their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="252">Page 435 U. S. 252</a></p><p> damages, and the record is completely devoid of any evidence which could even form the basis of a speculative inference measuring the extent of their injuries.  Plaintiffs\' claims for damages therefore fail for complete lack of proof."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The court also stated that the students were entitled to declaratory relief and to deletion of the suspensions from their school records, but, for reasons that are not apparent, the court failed to enter an order to that effect.  Instead, it simply dismissed the complaints.  No finding was made as to whether respondents would have been suspended if they had received procedural due process.</p>\n<p>On respondents\' appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.  545 F.2d 30 (1976).  It first held that the District Court erred in not granting declaratory and injunctive relief.  It also held that the District Court should have considered evidence submitted by respondents after judgment that tended to prove the pecuniary value of each day of school that they missed while suspended.  The court said, however, that respondents would not be entitled to recover damages representing the value of missed school time if petitioners showed on remand</p>\n<p>"that there was just cause for the suspension[s] and that therefore [respondents] would have been suspended even if a proper hearing had been held."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 32.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court of Appeals held that even if the District Court found on remand that respondents\' suspensions were justified, they would be entitled to recover substantial "nonpunitive" damages simply because they had been denied procedural due process.  <em>Id.</em> at 31.  Relying on its earlier </p><p><a class="page-number" name="253">Page 435 U. S. 253</a></p><p> decision in <em>Hostrop v. Board of Junior College Dist. No. 515,</em> 523 F.2d 569 (CA7 1975), <em>cert. denied,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/963/case.html">425 U. S. 963</a></span> (1976), the court stated that such damages should he awarded "even if, as in the case at bar, there is no proof of individualized injury to the plaintiff, such as mental distress. . . ."  545 F.2d at 31.  We granted certiorari to consider whether, in an action under \xc2\xa7 1983 for the deprivation of procedural due process, a plaintiff must prove that he actually was injured by the deprivation before he may recover substantial "nonpunitive" damages.  430 U.S. 964 (1977).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Title 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1979, derived from \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, provides:</p>\n<p>"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."</p>\n<p>The legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983, elsewhere detailed, <em>e.g., Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#172">365 U.

S. 238</a></span>-242 (1972), demonstrates that it was intended to "[create] a species of tort liability" in favor of persons who are deprived of "rights, privileges, or immunities secured" to them by the Constitution.  <em>Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html">424 U. S. 409</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#417">424 U. S. 417</a></span> (1976).</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend that the elements and prerequisites for recovery of damages under this "species of tort liability" should parallel those for recovery of damages under the common law of torts.  In particular, they urge that the purpose of an award of damages under \xc2\xa7 1983 should be to compensate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 435 U. S. 254</a></p><p> persons for injuries that are caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights; and, further, that plaintiffs should be required to prove not only that their rights were violated, but also that injury was caused by the violation, in order to recover substantial damages.  Unless respondents prove that they actually were injured by the deprivation of procedural due process, petitioners argue, they are entitled at most to nominal damages.</p>\n<p>Respondents seem to make two different arguments in support of the holding below.  First, they contend that substantial damages should be awarded under \xc2\xa7 1983 for the deprivation of a constitutional right whether or not any injury was caused by the deprivation.  This, they say, is appropriate both because constitutional rights are valuable, in and of themselves, and because of the need to deter violations of constitutional rights.  Respondents believe that this view reflects accurately that of the Congress that enacted \xc2\xa7 1983.  Second, respondents argue that, even if the purpose of a \xc2\xa7 1983 damages award is, as petitioners contend, primarily to compensate persons for injuries that are caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights, every deprivation of procedural due process may be <em>presumed</em> to cause some injury.  This presumption, they say, should relieve them from the necessity of proving that injury actually was caused.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Insofar as petitioners contend that the basic purpose of a \xc2\xa7 1983 damages award should be to compensate persons for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights, they have the better of the argument.  Rights, constitutional and otherwise, do not exist in a vacuum.  Their purpose is to protect persons from injuries to particular interests, and their contours are shaped by the interests they protect.</p>\n<p>Our legal system\'s concept of damages reflects this view of legal rights.  "The cardinal principle of damages in Anglo </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 435 U. S. 255</a></p><p> American law is that of <em>compensation</em> for the injury caused to plaintiff by defendant\'s breach of duty."  2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 25.1, p. 1299 (1956) (emphasis in original). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Court implicitly has recognized the applicability of this principle to actions under \xc2\xa7 1983 by stating that damages are available under that section for actions "found . . . to have been violative of . . . constitutional rights <em>and to he caused compensable injury. . . .</em>"  <em>Wood v.

S. 408</a></span>-409 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).  The lower federal courts appear generally to agree that damages awards under \xc2\xa7 1983 should be determined by the compensation principle. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Members of the Congress that enacted \xc2\xa7 1983 did not address directly the question of damages, but the principle that damages are designed to compensate persons for injuries caused by the deprivation of rights hardly could have been foreign to the many lawyers in Congress in 1871. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Two other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 435 U. S. 256</a></p><p> sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 appear to incorporate this principle, and no reason suggests itself for reading \xc2\xa7 1983 differently. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  To the extent that Congress intended that awards under \xc2\xa7 1983 should deter the deprivation of constitutional rights, there is no evidence that it meant to establish a deterrent more formidable than that inherent in the award of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="257">Page 435 U. S. 257</a></p><p> compensatory damages.  <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#442">424 U. S. 442</a></span> (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>It is less difficult to conclude that damages awards under \xc2\xa7 1983 should be governed by the principle of compensation than it is to apply this principle to concrete cases. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  But over the centuries, the common law of torts has developed a set of rules to implement the principle that a person should be compensated fairly for injuries caused by the violation of his legal rights.  These rules, defining the elements of damages </p><p><a class="page-number" name="258">Page 435 U. S. 258</a></p><p> and the prerequisites for their recovery, provide the appropriate starting point for the inquiry under \xc2\xa7 1983 as well. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>It is not clear, however, that common law tort rules of damages will provide a complete solution to the damages issue in every \xc2\xa7 1983 case.  In some cases, the interests protected by a particular branch of the common law of torts may parallel closely the interests protected by a particular constitutional right.  In such cases, it may be appropriate to apply the tort rules of damages directly to the \xc2\xa7 1983 action.  <em>See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co.,</em> 398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/144/case.html#231">398 U. S. 231</a></span>-232 (BRENNAN, J., concurring and dissenting).  In other cases, the interests protected by a particular constitutional right may not also be protected by an analogous branch of the common law of torts.  <em>See Monroe v. Pape,</em> 365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#196">365 U.

In those cases, the task will be the more difficult one of adapting common law rules of damages to provide fair compensation for injuries caused by the deprivation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p>Although this task of adaptation will be one of some delicacy -- as this case demonstrates -- it must be undertaken.  The purpose of \xc2\xa7 1983 would be defeated if injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights went uncompensated simply because the common law does not recognize an analogous cause of action.  <em>Cf.

We agree with Mr. Justice Harlan that</p>\n<p>"the experience of judges in dealing with private [tort] claims supports the conclusion that courts of law are capable of making the types of judgment concerning causation and magnitude of injury necessary to accord meaningful compensation for invasion of [constitutional] rights."</p>\n<p><em>Bivens v.

With these principles in mind, we now turn to the problem of compensation in the case at hand.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides:</p>\n<p>"[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. . . ."</p>\n<p>This Clause "raises no impenetrable barrier to the taking of a person\'s possessions," or liberty, or life.  <em>Fuentes v.

S. 81</a></span> (1972).  Procedural due process rules are meant to protect persons not from the deprivation, but from the mistaken or unjustified deprivation of life, liberty, or property.  Thus, in deciding what process constitutionally is due in various contexts, the Court repeatedly has emphasized that "procedural due process rules are shaped by the risk of error inherent in the truthfinding process. . . ."  <em>Mathews v.

The court thought that, in such a case, the failure to accord procedural due process could not properly be viewed as the cause of the suspensions.  <em>Ibid.; cf. Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v.

We do not understand the parties to disagree with this conclusion.  Nor do we. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The parties do disagree as to the further holding of the Court of Appeals that respondents are entitled to recover substantial -- although unspecified -- damages to compensate them for "the injury which is <em>inherent in the nature of the </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="261">Page 435 U. S. 261</a></em></p><p><em> wrong,\'" 545 F.2d at 31, even if their suspensions were justified and even if they fail to prove that the denial of procedural due process actually caused them some real, if intangible, injury.  Respondents, elaborating on this theme, submit that the holding is correct because injury fairly may be "presumed" to flow from every denial of procedural due process.  Their argument is that, in addition to protecting against unjustified deprivations, the Due Process Clause also guarantees the "feeling of just treatment" by the government.  <em>Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/123/case.html">341 U.

They contend that the deprivation of protected interests without procedural due process, even where the premise for the deprivation is not erroneous, inevitably arouses strong feelings of mental and emotional distress in the individual who is denied this "feeling of just treatment."  They analogize their case to that of defamation <em>per se,</em> in which "the plaintiff is relieved from the necessity of producing any proof whatsoever that he has been injured" in order to recover substantial compensatory damages.  C. McCormick, Law of Damages \xc2\xa7 116, p. 423 (1935). [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="262">Page 435 U. S. 262</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Petitioners do not deny that a purpose of procedural due process is to convey to the individual a feeling that the government has dealt with him fairly, as well as to minimize the risk of mistaken deprivations of protected interests.  They go so far as to concede that, in a proper case, persons in respondents\' position might well recover damages for mental and emotional distress caused by the denial of procedural due process.  Petitioners\' argument is the more limited one that such injury cannot be presumed to occur, and that plaintiffs at least should be put to their proof on the issue, as plaintiffs are in most tort actions.</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioners in this respect.  As we have observed in another context, the doctrine of presumed damages in the common law of defamation <em>per se</em> "is an oddity of tort law, for it allows recovery of purportedly compensatory damages without evidence of actual loss."  <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html">418 U. S. 323</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html#349">418 U. S. 349</a></span> (1974).  The doctrine has been defended on the grounds that those forms of defamation that are actionable <em>per se</em> are virtually certain to cause serious injury to reputation, and that this kind of injury is extremely difficult to prove.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html#373">418 U. S. 373</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html#376">418 U. S. 376</a></span> (WHITE, J., dissenting). [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Moreover, statements that are defamatory <em>per se,</em> by their very nature, are likely to cause mental and emotional distress, as well as injury to reputation, so there arguably is little reason to require proof of this kind of injury either. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="263">Page 435 U. S. 263</a></p><p> But these considerations do not support respondents\' contention that damages should be presumed to flow from every deprivation of procedural due process.</p>\n<p>First, it is not reasonable to assume that every departure from procedural due process, no matter what the circumstances or how minor, inherently is as likely to cause distress as the publication of defamation <em>per se</em> is to cause injury to reputation and distress.  Where the deprivation of a protected interest is substantively justified but procedures are deficient in some respect, there may well be those who suffer no distress over the procedural irregularities.  Indeed, in contrast to the immediately distressing effect of defamation <em>per se,</em> a person may not even know that procedures were deficient until he enlists the aid of counsel to challenge a perceived substantive deprivation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, where a deprivation is justified but procedures are deficient, whatever distress a person feels may be attributable to the justified deprivation, rather than to deficiencies in procedure.  But as the Court of Appeals held, the injury caused by a justified deprivation, including distress, is not properly compensable under \xc2\xa7 1983. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  This ambiguity in causation, which is absent in the case of defamation <em>per se,</em> provides additional need for requiring the plaintiff to convince the trier of fact that he actually suffered distress because of the denial of procedural due process itself.</p>\n<p>Finally, we foresee no particular difficulty in producing evidence that mental and emotional distress actually was caused by the denial of procedural due process itself.  Distress is a personal injury familiar to the law, customarily proved by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="264">Page 435 U. S. 264</a></p><p> showing the nature and circumstances of the wrong and its effect on the plaintiff. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  In sum, then, although mental and emotional distress caused by the denial of procedural due process itself is compensable under \xc2\xa7 1983, we hold that neither the likelihood of such injury nor the difficulty of proving it is so great as to justify awarding compensatory damages without proof that such injury actually was caused.</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals believed, and respondents urge, that cases dealing with awards of damages for racial discrimination, the denial of voting rights, and the denial of Fourth Amendment rights support a presumption of damages where procedural due process is denied. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Many of the cases relied upon do not help respondents, because they held or implied that some actual, if intangible, injury must be proved before compensatory damages may be recovered.  Others simply did not address the issue. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  More importantly, the elements and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="265">Page 435 U. S. 265</a></p><p> prerequisites for recovery of damages appropriate to compensate injuries caused by the deprivation of one constitutional right are not necessarily appropriate to compensate injuries caused by the deprivation of another.  As we have said, <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/247/case.html#258">435 U. S. 258</a></span>-259, these issues must be considered with reference to the nature of the interests protected by the particular constitutional right in question.  For this reason, and without intimating an opinion as to their merits, we do not deem the cases relied upon to be controlling. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="266">Page 435 U.

This holding, which respondents do not challenge, necessarily assumes that the District Court can determine what the outcome would have been if respondents had received their hearing.

In <em>Basista v.

Because it was unclear whether the plaintiff had waived his claim for compensatory damages, that issue was left open upon remand.  <em>Id.</em> at 88.  In <em>Sexton v.
