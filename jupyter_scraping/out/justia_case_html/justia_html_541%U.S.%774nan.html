Respondent Z.\xc2\xa0J. Gifts D\xe2\x80\x934, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C. (hereinafter ZJ), opened an adult bookstore in a place not zoned for adult businesses.  Instead of applying for a license, ZJ filed suit attacking the ordinance as facially unconstitutional.  The Federal District Court rejected ZJ\xe2\x80\x99s claims, but the Tenth Circuit held, as relevant here, that state law does not assure the constitutionally required \xe2\x80\x9cprompt final judicial <em>decision</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The ordinance meets the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that such a licensing scheme assure prompt judicial review of an administrative decision denying a license.

The city concedes that <em>Freedman</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/index.html">380 U. S. 51</a>, 59, in listing constitutionally necessary \xe2\x80\x9csafeguards\xe2\x80\x9d applicable to a motion picture censorship statute, spoke of the need to assure a \xe2\x80\x9cprompt final judicial decision,\xe2\x80\x9d but adds that Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s controlling plurality opinion in <em>FW/PBS, Inc.</em> v. <em>Dallas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/215/index.html">493 U. S. 215</a>, which addressed an adult business licensing scheme, did not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cdecision,\xe2\x80\x9d instead speaking only of the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>possibility of prompt judicial review,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 228 (emphasis added).  Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s <em>FW/PBS</em> opinion, however, points out that <em>Freedman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review\xe2\x80\x9d safeguard is meant to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cundue delay,\xe2\x80\x9d 493 U. S., at 228, which includes <em>judicial</em>, as well as <em>administrative,</em> delay.  A delay in issuing a judicial decision, no less than a delay in obtaining access to a court, can prevent a license from being \xe2\x80\x9cissued within a reasonable period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Nothing in the opinion suggests the contrary.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0However, the Court accepts the city\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Colorado law satisfies any \xe2\x80\x9cprompt judicial determination\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, agreeing that the Court should modify <em>FW/PBS,</em> withdrawing its implication that <em>Freedman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s special judicial review rules\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.,</em> strict time limits\xe2\x80\x94apply in this case.  Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review\xe2\x80\x9d rules suffice to assure a prompt judicial <em>decision,</em> as long as the courts remain sensitive to the need to prevent First Amendment harms and administer those procedures accordingly.  And whether the courts do so is a matter normally fit for case-by-case determination rather than a facial challenge.  Four considerations support this conclusion.  First, ordinary court procedural rules and practices give reviewing courts judicial tools sufficient to avoid delay-related First Amendment harm.  Indeed, courts may arrange their schedules to \xe2\x80\x9caccelerate\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings, and higher courts may grant expedited review.  Second, there is no reason to doubt state judges\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to exercise these powers wisely so as to avoid serious threats of delay-induced First Amendment harm.  And federal remedies would provide an additional safety valve in the event of any such problem.  Third, the typical First Amendment harm at issue here differs from that at issue in <em>Freedman</em>, diminishing the need in the typical case for procedural rules imposing special decisionmaking time limits.  Unlike in <em>Freedman</em>, this ordinance does not seek to <em>censor</em> material.  And its licensing scheme applies reasonably objective, nondiscretionary criteria unrelated to the content of the expressive materials that an adult business may sell or display.  These criteria are simple enough to apply and their application simple enough to review that their use is unlikely in practice to suppress totally any specific item of adult material in the community.  And the criteria\xe2\x80\x99s simple objective nature means that in the ordinary case, judicial review, too, should prove simple, hence expeditious.  Finally, nothing in <em>FW/PBS</em> or <em>Freedman</em> requires a city or State to place judicial review safeguards all in the city ordinance that sets forth a licensing scheme.

See <em>FW/PBS, Inc.</em> v. <em>Dallas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/215/index.html">493 U.

We conclude that the ordinance before us, considered on its face, is consistent with the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s demands.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Littleton, Colorado, has enacted an \xe2\x80\x9cadult business\xe2\x80\x9d ordinance that requires an \xe2\x80\x9cadult bookstore, adult novelty store or adult video store\xe2\x80\x9d to have an \xe2\x80\x9cadult business license.\xe2\x80\x9d  Littleton City Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x932, 3\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x934 (2003), App. to Brief for Petitioner 13a\xe2\x80\x9320a, 23a.  The ordinance defines \xe2\x80\x9cadult business\xe2\x80\x9d; it requires an applicant to provide certain basic information about the business; it insists upon compliance with local \xe2\x80\x9cadult business\xe2\x80\x9d (and other) zoning rules; it lists eight specific circumstances the presence of which requires the city to deny a license; and it sets forth time limits (typically amounting to about 40 days) within which city officials must reach a final licensing decision.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x932, 3\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x933, 3\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x935, 3\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x937, 3\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x938, <em>id.</em>, at 13a\xe2\x80\x9330a.

Gifts D\xe2\x80\x934, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C. (hereinafter ZJ), opened a store that sells \xe2\x80\x9cadult books\xe2\x80\x9d in a place not zoned for adult businesses.  Compare Tr. of Oral Arg. 13 (store \xe2\x80\x9cwithin 500 feet of a church and day care center\xe2\x80\x9d) with \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x933(B), App. to Brief for Petitioner 21a (forbidding adult businesses at such locations).  Instead of applying for an adult business license, ZJ brought this lawsuit attacking Littleton\xe2\x80\x99s ordinance as unconstitutional on its face.  The Federal District Court rejected ZJ\xe2\x80\x99s claims; but on appeal the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit accepted two of them, 311 F.\xc2\xa03d 1220, 1224 (2002).  The court held that Colorado law \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not assure that [the city\xe2\x80\x99s] license decisions will be given expedited [judicial] review\xe2\x80\x9d; hence it does not assure the \xe2\x80\x9cprompt final judicial <em>decision</em>\xe2\x80\x9d that the Constitution demands.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1238.  It also held unconstitutional another ordinance provision (not now before us) on the ground that it threatened lengthy administrative delay\xe2\x80\x94a problem that the city believes it has cured by amending the ordinance.  Compare <em>id.</em>, at 1233\xe2\x80\x931234, with \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x937, App. to Brief for Petitioner 27a\xe2\x80\x9328a, and Brief for Petitioner 3.  Throughout these proceedings, ZJ\xe2\x80\x99s store has continued to operate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The city has asked this Court to review the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review\xe2\x80\x9d determination, and we granted certiorari in light of lower court uncertainty on this issue.

First, this Court, in applying the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s procedural requirements to an \xe2\x80\x9cadult business\xe2\x80\x9d licensing scheme in <em>FW/PBS, </em>found that the First Amendment required such a scheme to provide an applicant with \xe2\x80\x9c<em>prompt access</em>\xe2\x80\x9d to judicial review of an administrative denial of the license, but that the First Amendment did not require assurance of a \xe2\x80\x9cprompt judicial <em>determination</em>\xe2\x80\x9d of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s legal claim.  Second, in any event, Colorado law satisfies any \xe2\x80\x9cprompt judicial determination\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  We reject the first argument, but we accept the second.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The city\xe2\x80\x99s claim that its licensing scheme need not provide a \xe2\x80\x9cprompt judicial determination\xe2\x80\x9d of an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s legal claim rests upon its reading of two of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases, <em>Freedman </em>and <em>FW/PBS. </em> In <em>Freedman</em>,<em> </em>the Court considered the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s application to a \xe2\x80\x9cmotion picture censorship statute\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a statute that required an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98owner or lessee\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of a film, prior to exhibiting a film, to submit the film to the Maryland State Board of Censors and obtain its approval.  380 U. S., at 52, and n.\xc2\xa01 (quoting Maryland statute).  It said, \xe2\x80\x9ca noncriminal process which requires the prior submission of a film to a censor avoids constitutional infirmity only if it takes place under procedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of a censorship system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 58.  The Court added that those safeguards must include (1) strict time limits leading to a speedy administrative decision and minimizing any \xe2\x80\x9cprior restraint\xe2\x80\x9d-type effects, (2) burden of proof rules favoring speech, and (3) (using language relevant here) a \xe2\x80\x9cprocedure\xe2\x80\x9d that will \xe2\x80\x9c<em>assure a prompt final judicial decision</em>, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possibly erroneous denial of a license.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 58\xe2\x80\x9359 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>FW/PBS</em>, the Court considered the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s application to a city ordinance that \xe2\x80\x9cregulates sexually oriented businesses through a scheme incorporating zoning, licensing, and inspections.\xe2\x80\x9d  493 U. S., at 220\xe2\x80\x93221.  A Court majority held that the ordinance violated the First Amendment because it did not impose strict administrative time limits of the kind described in <em>Freedman</em>.  In doing so, three Members of the Court wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cthe full procedural protections set forth in <em>Freedman</em> are not required,\xe2\x80\x9d but that nonetheless such a licensing scheme must comply with <em>Freedman\xe2\x80\x99</em>s \xe2\x80\x9ccore policy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including (1) strict administrative time limits and (2) (using language somewhat different from <em>Freedman\xe2\x80\x99</em>s) \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the possibility of prompt judicial review in the event that the license is erroneously denied.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  493 U. S., at 228 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (emphasis added).  Three other Members of the Court wrote that all <em>Freedman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>safeguards should apply, including <em>Freedman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that \xe2\x80\x9ca prompt judicial determination must be available.\xe2\x80\x9d  493 U. S., at 239 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).  Three Members of the Court wrote in dissent that <em>Freedman\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>requirements did not apply at all.  See 493 U. S., at 244\xe2\x80\x93245 (White, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>id.</em>, at 250 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The city points to the differing linguistic descriptions of the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review\xe2\x80\x9d requirement set forth in these opinions.  It concedes that <em>Freedman,</em> in listing constitutionally necessary \xe2\x80\x9csafeguards,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke of the need to assure a \xe2\x80\x9cprompt final judicial decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  380 U. S., at 59.  But it adds that Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s controlling plurality opinion in <em>FW/PBS</em> did not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cdecision,\xe2\x80\x9d instead speaking only of the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>possibility of prompt judicial review.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  493 U. S.<em>,</em> at 228 (emphasis added); see also <em>id.</em>, at 229 (\xe2\x80\x9can avenue for prompt judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 230 (\xe2\x80\x9cavailability of prompt judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d).<font b="1">  This difference in language between <em>Freedman</em> and <em>FW/PBS</em>, says the city, makes a major difference: The First Amendment, as applied to an \xe2\x80\x9cadult business\xe2\x80\x9d licensing scheme, demands only an assurance of speedy access to the courts, not an assurance of a speedy court decision.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, however, the city\xe2\x80\x99s argument makes too much of too little.  While Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s <em>FW/PBS </em>plurality opinion makes clear that only <em>Freedman\xe2\x80\x99</em>s \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d requirements apply in the context of \xe2\x80\x9cadult business\xe2\x80\x9d licensing schemes, it does not purport radically to alter the nature of those \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d requirements.  To the contrary, the opinion, immediately prior to its reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review\xe2\x80\x9d safeguard, says:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe core policy underlying <em>Freedman</em> is that the license for a First Amendment-protected business must be issued within a reasonable period of time, because undue delay results in the unconstitutional suppression of protected speech.  Thus, the first two <em>[Freedman]</em> safeguards are essential \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  493 U. S., at 228.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThese words, pointing out that <em>Freedman\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review\xe2\x80\x9d safeguard is meant to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cundue delay,\xe2\x80\x9d 493 U. S., at 228, include <em>judicial</em>, as well as <em>administrative, </em>delay.  A delay in issuing a judicial decision, no less than a delay in obtaining access to a court, can prevent a license from being \xe2\x80\x9cissued within a reasonable period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Nothing in the opinion suggests the contrary.  Thus we read that opinion\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cprompt judicial review,\xe2\x80\x9d together with the similar reference in Justice Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s separate opinion (joined by two other Justices), see <em>id.</em>, at 239, as encompassing a prompt judicial decision.  And we reject the city\xe2\x80\x99s arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find the second argument more convincing.  In effect that argument concedes the constitutional importance of assuring a \xe2\x80\x9cprompt\xe2\x80\x9d judicial decision.  It concedes as well that the Court, illustrating what it meant by \xe2\x80\x9cprompt\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Freedman</em>, there set forth a \xe2\x80\x9cmodel\xe2\x80\x9d that involved a \xe2\x80\x9chearing one day after joinder of issue\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cdecision within two days after termination of the hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  380 U. S., at 60.  But the city says that here the First Amendment nonetheless does not require it to impose 2- or 3-day time limits; the First Amendment does not require special \xe2\x80\x9cadult business\xe2\x80\x9d judicial review rules; and the First Amendment does not insist that Littleton write detailed judicial review rules into the ordinance itself.  In sum, Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review\xe2\x80\x9d rules offer adequate assurance, not only that <em>access</em> to the courts can be promptly obtained, but also that a judicial <em>decision</em> will be promptly forthcoming.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Littleton, in effect, argues that we should modify  <em>FW/PBS, </em>withdrawing its implication that <em>Freedman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s special judicial review rules apply in this case.  And we accept that argument.  In our view, Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary judicial review procedures suffice as long as the courts remain sensitive to the need to prevent First Amendment harms and administer those procedures accordingly.  And whether the courts do so is a matter normally fit for case-by-case determination rather than a facial challenge.  We reach this conclusion for several reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, ordinary court procedural rules and practices, in Colorado as elsewhere, provide reviewing courts with judicial tools sufficient to avoid delay-related First Amendment harm.  Indeed, where necessary, courts may arrange their schedules to \xe2\x80\x9caccelerate\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings.  Colo. Rule Civ. Proc. 106(a)(4)(VIII) (2003).  And higher courts may quickly review adverse lower court decisions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Goebel</em> v. <em>Colorado Dept. of Institutions</em>, 764 P.\xc2\xa02d 785, 792 (Colo. 1988) (en banc) (granting \xe2\x80\x9cexpedited review\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, we have no reason to doubt the willingness of Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s judges to exercise these powers wisely so as to avoid serious threats of delay-induced First Amendment harm.  We presume that courts are aware of the constitutional need to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cundue delay result[ing] in the unconstitutional suppression of protected speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FW/PBS</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 228; see also, <em>e.g., Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/738/index.html">420 U. S. 738</a>, 756 (1975).  There is no evidence before us of any special Colorado court-related problem in this respect.  And were there some such problems, federal remedies would provide an additional safety valve.  See Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the typical First Amendment harm at issue here differs from that at issue in <em>Freedman, </em>diminishing the need in the typical case for special procedural rules imposing special 2- or 3-day decisionmaking time limits.  <em>Freedman </em>considered a Maryland statute that created a Board of Censors, which had to decide whether a film was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pornographic,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d tended to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98debase or corrupt morals,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and lacked \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whatever other merits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  380 U. S., at 52\xe2\x80\x9353, n.\xc2\xa02 (quoting Maryland statute).  If so, it denied the permit and the film could not be shown.  Thus, in <em>Freedman</em>, the Court considered a scheme with rather subjective standards and where a denial likely meant complete censorship.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, the ordinance at issue here does not seek to <em>censor</em> material.  And its licensing scheme applies reasonably objective, nondiscretionary criteria unrelated to the content of the expressive materials that an adult business may sell or display.  The ordinance says that an adult business license \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall</em>\xe2\x80\x9d be denied if the applicant (1) is underage; (2) provides false information; (3) has within the prior year had an adult business license revoked or suspended; (4) has operated an adult business determined to be a state law \xe2\x80\x9cpublic nuisance\xe2\x80\x9d within the prior year; (5) (if a corporation) is not authorized to do business in the State; (6) has not timely paid taxes, fees, fines, or penalties; (7) has not obtained a sales tax license (for which zoning compliance is required, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 16\xe2\x80\x9317); or (8) has been convicted of certain crimes within the prior five years.  \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x938(A), App. to Brief for Petitioner 28a\xe2\x80\x9329a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These objective criteria are simple enough to apply and their application simple enough to review that their use is unlikely in practice to suppress totally the presence of any specific item of adult material in the Littleton community.  Some license applicants will satisfy the criteria even if others do not; hence the community will likely contain outlets that sell protected adult material.  A supplier of that material should be able to find outlets; a potential buyer should be able to find a seller.  Nor should zoning requirements suppress that material, for a constitutional zoning system seeks to determine <em>where</em>, not <em>whether, </em>protected adult material can be sold.  See <em>Renton</em> v. <em>Playtime Theatres, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/41/index.html">475 U. S. 41</a>, 46 (1986).  The upshot is that Littleton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cadult business\xe2\x80\x9d licensing scheme does \xe2\x80\x9cnot present the grave \xe2\x80\x98dangers of a censorship system.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FW/PBS</em>, 493 U. S., at 228 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (quoting <em>Freedman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 58).  And the simple objective nature of the licensing criteria means that in the ordinary case, judicial review, too, should prove simple, hence expeditious.  Where that is not so\xe2\x80\x94where, for example, censorship of material, as well as delay in opening an additional outlet, is improperly threatened\xe2\x80\x94the courts are able to act to prevent that harm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, nothing in <em>FW/PBS</em> or in <em>Freedman</em> requires a city or a State to place judicial review safeguards all in the city ordinance that sets forth a licensing scheme.  <em>Freedman</em> itself said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow or whether Maryland is to incorporate the required procedural safeguards in the statutory scheme is, of course, for the State to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d  380 U. S., at 60.  This statement is not surprising given the fact that many cities and towns lack the state-law legal authority to impose deadlines on state courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These four sets of considerations, taken together, indicate that Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary rules of judicial review are adequate\xe2\x80\x94at least for purposes of this facial challenge to the ordinance.  Where (as here and as in <em>FW/PBS</em>) the regulation simply conditions the operation of an adult business on compliance with neutral and nondiscretionary criteria, cf. <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and does not seek to censor content, an adult business is not entitled to an unusually speedy judicial decision of the <em>Freedman</em> type.  Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s rules provide for a flexible system of review in which judges can reach a decision promptly in the ordinary case, while using their judicial power to prevent significant harm to First Amendment interests where circumstances require.  Of course, those denied licenses in the future remain free to raise special problems of undue delay in individual cases as the ordinance is applied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Tenth Circuit is </p>\n<p align="left">Reversed.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961518">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF STEVENS, J.<br/>\nCITY OF LITTLETON V.

The former is an aspect of the routine operation of a municipal government.  The latter is a species of content-based prior restraint.  Cf. <em>Graff </em>v. <em>Chicago,</em> 9 F.\xc2\xa03d 1309, 1330\xe2\x80\x931333 (CA7 1993) (Flaum, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The First Amendment is, of course, implicated whenever a city requires a bookstore, a newsstand, a theater, or an adult business to obtain a license before it can begin to operate.  For that reason, as Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor explained in her plurality opinion in <em>FW/PBS, Inc.</em> v. <em>Dallas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/215/index.html">493 U. S. 215</a>, 226 (1990), a licensing scheme for businesses that engage in First Amendment activity must be accompanied by adequate procedural safeguards to avert \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility that constitutionally protected speech will be suppressed.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion also recognized that the full complement of safeguards that are necessary in cases that \xe2\x80\x9cpresent the grave \xe2\x80\x98dangers of a censorship system\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cnot required\xe2\x80\x9d in the ordinary adult-business licensing scheme.  <em>Id.,</em> at 228 (quoting <em>Freedman</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/index.html">380 U. S. 51</a>, 58 (1965)).  In both contexts, \xe2\x80\x9cundue delay results in the unconstitutional suppression of protected speech,\xe2\x80\x9d 493 U. S.<em>,</em> at 228, and <em>FW/PBS</em> therefore requires both that the licensing decision be made promptly and that there be \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility of prompt judicial review in the event that the license is erroneously denied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But application of neutral licensing criteria is a \xe2\x80\x9cministerial action\xe2\x80\x9d that regulates speech, rather than an exercise of discretionary judgment that prohibits speech.  <em>Id.,</em> at 229.  The decision to deny a license for failure to comply with these neutral criteria is therefore not subject to the presumption of invalidity that attaches to the \xe2\x80\x9cdirect censorship of particular expressive material.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion accordingly declined to require that the licensor, like the censor, either bear the burden of going to court to effect the denial of a license or otherwise assume responsibility for ensuring a prompt judicial determination of the validity of its decision.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today reinterprets <em>FW/PBS</em>\xe2\x80\x99s references to \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility of prompt judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d as the equivalent of <em>Freedman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprompt judicial decision\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  <em>Ante,</em> at 3\xe2\x80\x936.  I fear that this misinterpretation of <em>FW/PBS</em> may invite other, more serious misinterpretations with respect to the content of that requirement.  As the Court applies it in this case, assurance of a \xe2\x80\x9cprompt judicial decision\xe2\x80\x9d means little more than assurance of the <em>possibility</em> of a prompt decision\xe2\x80\x94the same possibility of promptness that is available whenever a person files suit subject to \xe2\x80\x9cordinary court procedural rules and practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 7.  That possibility will generally be sufficient to guard against the risk of undue delay in obtaining a remedy for the erroneous application of neutral licensing criteria.  But the mere possibility of promptness is emphatically insufficient to guard against the dangers of unjustified suppression of speech presented by a censorship system of the type at issue in <em>Freedman</em>, and is certainly not what <em>Freedman</em> meant by \xe2\x80\x9cprompt judicial decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>FW/PBS</em> recognized that differences between ordinary licensing schemes and censorship systems warrant imposition of different procedural protections, including different requirements with respect to which party must assume the burden of taking the case to court, as well as the risk of judicial delay.  I would adhere to the views there expressed, and thus do not join Part II\xe2\x80\x93A of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  I do, however, join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and Parts I and II\xe2\x80\x93B of its opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961517">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n541 U.

S. 215</a>, 250 (1990) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part): the pandering of sex is not protected by the First Amendment.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution does not require a State or municipality to permit a business that intentionally specializes in, and holds itself forth to the public as specializing in, performance or portrayal of sex acts, sexual organs in a state of arousal, or live human nudity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 258.  This represents the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s long understanding of the First Amendment, recognized and adopted by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/463/index.html">383 U.

I agree that this scheme is unlike full-blown censorship, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939, so that the ordinance does not need a strict timetable of the kind required by <em>Freedman</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/index.html">380 U. S. 51</a> (1965), to survive a facial challenge.  I write separately to emphasize that the state procedures that make a prompt judicial determination possible need to align with a state judicial practice that provides a prompt disposition in the state courts.  The emphasis matters, because although Littleton\xe2\x80\x99s ordinance is not as suspect as censorship, neither is it as innocuous as common zoning.  It is a licensing scheme triggered by the content of expressive materials to be sold.  See <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Alameda Books, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/535/425/index.html">535 U. S. 425</a>, 448 (2002) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThese ordinances are content based, and we should call them so\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 455\xe2\x80\x93457 (Souter, J., dissenting).  Because the sellers may be unpopular with local authorities, there is a risk of delay in the licensing and review process.  If there is evidence of foot-dragging, immediate judicial intervention will be required, and judicial oversight or review at any stage of the proceedings must be expeditious.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
