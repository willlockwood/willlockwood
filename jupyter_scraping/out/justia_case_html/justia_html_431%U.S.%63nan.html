Without further questioning, the judge accepted the plea on an "Adjudication" form, which, <em>inter alia,</em> recited that respondent had pleaded guilty to attempted safe robbery "freely, understandingly and voluntarily," with full awareness of the consequences, and "without undue . . . compulsion . . . duress, [or] promise of leniency."

S. 65</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The respondent, Gary Darrell Allison, an inmate of a North Carolina penitentiary, petitioned a Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus.  The court dismissed his petition without a hearing, and the Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that, in the circumstances of this case, summary dismissal was improper.  We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Allison was indicted by a North Carolina grand jury for breaking and entering, attempted safe robbery, and possession of burglary tools.  At his arraignment, where he was represented by court-appointed counsel, he initially pleaded not guilty.  But after learning that his codefendant planned to plead guilty, he entered a guilty plea to a single count of attempted safe robbery, for which the minimum prison sentence was 10 years and the maximum was life.  N.C.Gen.Stat. \xc2\xa7 14-89.1 (1969).</p>\n<p>In accord with the procedure for taking guilty pleas then in effect in North Carolina, the judge in open court read from a printed form 13 questions, generally concerning the defendant\'s understanding of the charge, its consequences, and the voluntariness of his plea.  Allison answered "yes" or "no" to each question, and the court clerk transcribed those responses on a copy of the form, which Allison signed.  So far as the record shows, there was no questioning beyond this routine; no inquiry was made of either defense counsel or prosecutor.  Two questions from the form are of particular relevance to the issues before us:   Question No. 8 -- "Do you </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 431 U. S. 66</a></p><p> understand that upon your plea of guilty you could be imprisoned for as much as minimum [<em>sic</em>] of 10 years to life?" to which Allison answered "Yes"; and Question No. 11 -- "Has the Solicitor, or your lawyer, or any policeman, law officer or anyone else made any promises or threat to you to influence you to plead guilty in this case?" to which Allison answered "No."</p>\n<p>The trial judge then accepted the plea by signing his name at the bottom of the form under a text entitled "Adjudication," which recited the three charges for which Allison had been indicted, that he had been fully advised of his rights, was in fact guilty, and pleaded guilty to attempted safe robbery "freely, understandingly and voluntarily," with full awareness of the consequences, and "without undue . . . compulsion . . . duress, [or] promise of leniency." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Three days later, at a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 431 U.

S. 68</a></p><p> Allison filed a <em>pro se</em> petition in a Federal District Court seeking a writ of habeas corpus.  The petition alleged:</p>\n<p>"[H]is guilty plea was induced by an unkept promise, and therefore was not the free and willing choice of the petitioner, and should be set aside by this Court.  An unkept bargain which has induced a guilty plea is grounds for relief.  <em>Santobello v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/404/257/case.html">404 U.

The petition went on to explain and support this allegation as follows:</p>\n<p>"The petitioner was led to believe and did believe, by Mr. Pickard [Allison\'s attorney], that he Mr. N. Glenn </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 431 U. S. 69</a></p><p> Pickard had talked the case over with the Solicitor and the Judge, and that, if the petitioner would plea[d] guilty, that he would only get a 10-year sentence of penal servitude.  This conversation, where the petitioner was assured that, if he plea[ded] guilty, he would only get ten years was witnessed by another party other than the petitioner and counsel."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The petitioner believing that he was only going to get a ten-year active sentence, allowed himself to be pled guilty to the charge of attempted safe robbery, and was shocked by the Court with a 17-21 year sentence."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The petitioner was promised by his Attorney, who had consulted presumably with the Judge and Solicitor, that he was only going to get a ten-year sentence, and therefore because of this unkept bargain, he is entitled to relief in this Court."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The petitioner is aware of the fact that he was questioned by the trial Judge prior to sentencing, but as he thought he was only going to get ten years, and had been instructed to answer the questions, so that the Court would accept the guilty plea, this fact does not preclude him from raising this matter, especially since he was not given the promised sentence by the Court."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>". . .  The fact that the Judge, said that he could get more, did not affect the belief of the petitioner that he was only going to get a ten-year sentence."</p>\n<p>The petitioner here, Warden Blackledge, filed a motion to dismiss and attached to it the "transcript" of the plea hearing, consisting of nothing more than the printed form filled in by the clerk and signed by Allison and the state court judge.  The motion contended that the form conclusively showed that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 431 U. S. 70</a></p><p> Allison had chosen to plead guilty knowingly, voluntarily, and with full awareness of the consequences.  The Federal District Court agreed that the printed form "conclusively shows that [Allison] was carefully examined by the Court before the plea was accepted.  Therefore, it must stand."  Pet. for Cert. 18.  Construing Allison\'s petition as alleging merely that his lawyer\'s prediction of the severity of the sentence turned out to be inaccurate, the District Court found no basis for relief and, accordingly, dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p>One week later, Allison filed a petition for rehearing.  He contended that his statements during the guilty plea proceeding in the state court were "evidentiary, but NOT conclusory" (App 17); that, if true the allegations in his petition entitled him to relief; and that he deserved a chance to establish their truth.  Apparently impressed by these arguments and recognizing that Allison was alleging more than a mere "prediction" by his lawyer, the District Court referred the rehearing petition to a United States Magistrate, who directed Allison to submit evidence in support of his allegations.  After an inconclusive exchange of correspondence, the Magistrate concluded that, despite "ample opportunity," Allison had failed to comply with the directive, and recommended that the petition for rehearing be denied.  The District Court accepted the Magistrate\'s recommendation and denied the petition.  A motion for reconsideration was also denied.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.  It held that Allison\'s allegation of a broken promise, as amplified by the explanation that his lawyer instructed him to deny the existence of any promises, was not foreclosed by his responses to the form questions at the state guilty plea proceeding.  The appellate court reasoned that, when a <em>pro se,</em> indigent prisoner makes allegations that, if proved, would entitle him to habeas corpus relief, he should not be required to prove his allegations in advance of an evidentiary hearing, at least in the absence of counteraffidavits conclusively proving their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="71">Page 431 U. S. 71</a></p><p> falsity.  The case was therefore remanded for an evidentiary hearing.  533 F.2d 894.</p>\n<p>The petitioner warden sought review in this Court, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(1), and we granted certiorari, 429 U.S. 814, to consider the significant federal question presented.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Whatever might be the situation in an ideal world, the fact is that the guilty plea and the often concomitant plea bargain are important components of this country\'s criminal justice system.  Properly administered, they can benefit all concerned.  The defendant avoids extended pretrial incarceration and the anxieties and uncertainties of a trial; he gains a speedy disposition of his case, the chance to acknowledge his guilt, and a prompt start in realizing whatever potential there may be for rehabilitation.  Judges and prosecutors conserve vital and scarce resources.  The public is protected from the risks posed by those charged with criminal offenses who are at large on bail while awaiting completion of criminal proceedings. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>These advantages can be secured, however, only if dispositions by guilty plea are accorded a great measure of finality.  To allow indiscriminate hearings in federal postconviction proceedings, whether for federal prisoners under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2255 or state prisoners under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2241-2254, would eliminate the chief virtues of the plea system -- speed, economy, and finality.  And there is reason for concern about that prospect.  More often than not, a prisoner has everything to gain and nothing to lose from filing a collateral attack upon his guilty plea.  If he succeeds in vacating the judgment of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="72">Page 431 U. S. 72</a></p><p> conviction, retrial may be difficult.  If he convinces a court that his plea was induced by an advantageous plea agreement that was violated, he may obtain the benefit of its terms.  A collateral attack may also be inspired by "a mere desire to be freed temporarily from the confines of the prison."  <em>Price v. Johnston,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/266/case.html">334 U.

And a prisoner in custody after pleading guilty, no less than one tried and convicted by a jury, is entitled to avail himself of the writ in challenging the constitutionality of his custody.</p>\n<p>In <em>Machibroda v. United States, supra,</em> the defendant had pleaded guilty in federal court to bank robbery charges and been sentenced to 40 years in prison.  He later filed a \xc2\xa7 2255 motion alleging that his plea had been induced by an Assistant United States Attorney\'s promises that his sentence would not exceed 20 years, that the prosecutor had admonished him not to tell his lawyer about the agreement, and that the trial judge had wholly failed to inquire whether the guilty plea was made voluntarily before accepting it.  This Court noted that the allegations, if proved, would entitle the defendant to relief, and that they raised an issue of fact that could not be resolved simply on the basis of an affidavit from the prosecutor denying the allegations.  Because those allegations "related primarily to purported occurrences outside the courtroom and upon which the record could, therefore, cast no real light," 368 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/487/case.html#494">368 U.

The defendant there, having waived counsel, had also pleaded guilty to federal bank robbery charges.

The motion included supporting factual allegations, as well as hospital records documenting some of the contentions.</p>\n<p>Although noting that, in collaterally attacking a plea of guilty, a prisoner "may not ordinarily repudiate" statements made to the sentencing judge when the plea was entered, the Court observed that no procedural device for the taking of guilty pleas is so perfect in design and exercise as to warrant a <em>per se</em> rule rendering it "uniformly invulnerable to subsequent challenge."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/213/case.html#214">411 U.

Because the record of the plea hearing did not, in view of the allegations made, "<em>conclusively show that the prisoner [was] entitled to no relief,\'" 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2255, the Court ruled that the prisoner should be given an evidentiary hearing. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>These cases do not in the least reduce the force of the original plea hearing.  For the representations of the defendant, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 431 U.

Solemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.  The subsequent presentation of conclusory allegations unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal, as are contentions that, in the face of the record, are wholly incredible.  <em>Machibroda, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/487/case.html#495">368 U.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The allegations in this case were not in themselves so "vague [or] conclusory," <em>Machibroda,</em> 368 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/487/case.html#495">368 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  But he did not stop there.  He proceeded to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 431 U. S. 76</a></p><p> elaborate upon this claim with specific factual allegations.  The petition indicated exactly what the terms of the promise were; when, where, and by whom the promise had been made; and the identity of one witness to its communication.  The critical question is whether these allegations, when viewed against the record of the plea hearing, were so "palpably incredible," <em>ibid.,</em> so "patently frivolous or false," <em>Herman v. Claudy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/116/case.html">350 U. S. 116</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/116/case.html#119">350 U. S. 119</a></span>, as to warrant summary dismissal.  In the light of the nature of the record of the proceeding at which the guilty plea was accepted, and of the ambiguous status of the process of plea bargaining at the time the guilty plea was made, we conclude that Allison\'s petition should not have been summarily dismissed.</p>\n<p>Only recently has plea bargaining become a visible practice accepted as a legitimate component in the administration of criminal justice.  For decades, it was a <em>sub rosa</em> process shrouded in secrecy and deliberately concealed by participating defendants, defense lawyers, prosecutors, and even judges. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Indeed, it was not until our decision in <em>Santobello v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/257/case.html">404 U. S. 257</a></span>, that lingering doubts about the legitimacy of the practice were finally dispelled. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Allison was arraigned a mere 37 days after the <em>Santobello</em> decision was announced, under a North Carolina procedure that had not been modified in light of <em>Santobello</em> or earlier </p><p><a class="page-number" name="77">Page 431 U. S. 77</a></p><p> decisions of this Court [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] recognizing the process of plea bargaining. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  That procedure itself reflected the atmosphere of secrecy which then characterized plea bargaining generally.  No transcript of the proceeding was made.  The only record was a standard printed form.  There is no way of knowing whether the trial judge in any way deviated from or supplemented the text of the form.  The record is silent as to what statements Allison, his lawyer, or the prosecutor might have made regarding promised sentencing concessions.  And there is no record at all of the sentencing hearing three days later, at which one of the participants might well have made a statement shedding light upon the veracity of the allegations Allison later advanced.</p>\n<p>The litany of form questions followed by the trial judge at arraignment nowhere indicated to Allison (or indeed to the lawyers involved) that plea bargaining was a legitimate practice that could be freely disclosed in open court.  Neither lawyer was asked to disclose any agreement that had been reached, or sentencing recommendation that had been promised.  The process thus did nothing to dispel a defendant\'s belief that any bargain struck must remain concealed -- a belief here allegedly reinforced by the admonition of Allison\'s lawyer himself that disclosure could jeopardize the agreement.  Rather than challenging respondent\'s counsel\'s contention at oral argument in this Court that "at that time in North Carolina plea bargains were never disclosed in response to such a question on such a form," Tr. of Oral Arg. 25, counsel for the petitioners conceded at oral argument that "[t]hat form was a minimum inquiry."  <em>Id.</em> at 49.</p>\n<p>Although "[l]ogically the general inquiry should elicit information about plea bargaining, . . . it seldom has in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="78">Page 431 U. S. 78</a></p><p> past."  Advisory Committee Notes to 1974 Amendment of Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11, 18 U.S.C.App. p. 1304 (1970 ed., Supp. V). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Particularly if, as Allison alleged, he was advised by counsel to conceal any plea bargain, his denial that any promises had been made might have been a courtroom ritual more sham than real. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  We thus cannot conclude that the allegations in Allison\'s habeas corpus petition, when measured against the "record" of the arraignment, were so "patently false or frivolous" [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] as to warrant summary dismissal. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="79">Page 431 U. S. 79</a></p><p></p>\n<p>North Carolina has recently undertaken major revisions of its plea-bargaining procedures, in part to prevent the very kind of problem now before us. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Plea bargaining is expressly legitimated.  N.C.Gen.Stat. \xc2\xa7 15A-1021, and Official Commentary (1975).  The judge is directed to advise the defendant that courts have approved plea bargaining, and he may thus admit to any promises without fear of jeopardizing an advantageous agreement or prejudicing himself in the judge\'s eyes.  <em>See</em> Brief for Respondent, App. D.  Specific inquiry about whether a plea bargain has been struck is then made not only of the defendant, but also of his counsel and the prosecutor.  N.C.Gen.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 15A-1023(a), (c) (1975).  Finally, the entire proceeding is to be transcribed verbatim.  \xc2\xa7 15A-1026, as amended (Int. Supp. 1976). [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Had these commendable procedures been followed in the present case, Allison\'s petition would have been cast in a very different light.  The careful explication of the legitimacy of plea bargaining. the questioning of both lawyers, and the verbatim record of their answers at the guilty plea proceedings would almost surely have shown whether any bargain did </p><p><a class="page-number" name="80">Page 431 U. S. 80</a></p><p> exist and, if so, insured that it was not ignored. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  But the salutary reforms recently implemented by North Carolina highlight even more sharply the deficiencies in the record before the District Court in the present case. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>This is not to say that every set of allegations not on its face without merit entitles a habeas corpus petitioner to an evidentiary hearing.  As in civil cases generally, there exists a procedure whose purpose is to test whether facially adequate allegations have sufficient basis in fact to warrant plenary presentation of evidence.  That procedure is, of course, the motion for summary judgment.  Upon remand, the warden will be free to make such a motion, supporting it with whatever proof he wishes to attach. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  If he chooses to do so, Allison will then be required either to produce some contrary proof indicating that there is a genuine issue of fact to be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="81">Page 431 U. S. 81</a></p><p> resolved by the District Court or to explain his inability to provide such proof.  Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 56(e), (f).</p>\n<p>Moreover, as is now expressly provided in the Rules Governing Habeas Corpus Cases, the district judge (or a magistrate to whom the case may be referred) [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] may employ a variety of measures in an effort to avoid the need for an evidentiary hearing.  Under Rule 6, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] a party may request and the judge may direct that discovery take place, and "there may be instances in which discovery would be appropriate [before an evidentiary hearing, and would show such a hearing] to be unnecessary. . . ."

Under Rule 7, [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] the judge can direct expansion of the record to include ay appropriate material that</p>\n<p>"enable the judge to dispose of some habeas petitions not dismissed on the pleadings, without the time and expense required for an evidentiary hearing.

But Allison is</p>\n<p>"entitled to careful consideration and plenary processing of [his claim,] including full opportunity for presentation of the relevant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 431 U.

The parol evidence rule has as its very purpose the exclusion of evidence designed to repudiate provisions in a written integration of contractual terms.  Yet even a written contractual provision declaring that the contract contains the complete agreement of the parties, and that no antecedent or extrinsic representations exist, does not conclusively bar subsequent proof that such additional agreements exist and should be given force.  The provision denying the existence of such agreements, of course, carries great weight, but it can be set aside by a court on the grounds of fraud, mistake, duress, "or on some ground that is sufficient for setting aside other contracts."  3 A.

Official Commentary, <em>supra,</em> n. 17 ("If the procedures of plea negotiation are on the record and accurately reflect the things (legitimately) done, the basis for later challenge is effectively minimized").  Indeed, a petitioner challenging a plea given pursuant to procedures like those now mandated in North Carolina will necessarily be asserting that not only his own transcribed responses, but those given by two lawyers, were untruthful.  Especially as it becomes routine for prosecutors and defense lawyers to acknowledge that plea bargains have been made, such a contention will entitle a petitioner to an evidentiary hearing only in the most extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>This is not to suggest that a plea of guilty entered pursuant to procedures like those in effect at Allison\'s arraignment is necessarily vulnerable to collateral attack.  It is simply to say that procedures like those now in effect in North Carolina serve (1) to prevent the occurrence of constitutional errors in the arraignment process, and (2) to discourage the filing of baseless petitions for habeas corpus and facilitate speedy but fair disposition of those that are filed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, it would seem easier for the State than for an indigent, untutored prisoner to obtain affidavits from the principals, particularly given the potential availability of discovery, <em>see</em> <a href="#F23" name="T23">n</a> 23, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 636(b)(2), (3) authorize magistrates to assist "a district judge in the conduct of pretrial or discovery proceedings in civil or criminal actions," and preliminarily to review "applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses. . . ."

But before dismissing facially adequate allegations short of an evidentiary hearing, ordinarily a district judge should seek as a minimum to obtain affidavits from all persons likely to have first-hand knowledge of the existence of any plea agreement.  <em>See Walters v. Harris,</em> 460 F.2d at 992.  "<em>When the issue is one of credibility, resolution on the basis of affidavits can rarely be conclusive, but that is not to say they may not be helpful.\'"  Advisory Committee Note to Rule 7, Rules Governing Habeas Corpus Cases, 28 U.S.C. p. 269 (1976 ed.), quoting <em>Raines v.

S. 70</a></span>, did not provide such an opportunity.  The Magistrate directed Allison to obtain a notarized statement from his codefendant, who allegedly had heard Allison\'s attorney make the promise as to sentence.  Allison was confined in prison and without legal assistance.  The codefendant was confined in a different prison.  In these circumstances, the Magistrate imposed upon Allison a novel and formless burden of supplying proof, without the benefit of compulsory process and without any intimation that dismissal would follow if that burden were not met.  It can thus hardly be said that Allison was granted a "full opportunity for presentation of the relevant facts" or that his petition received "careful consideration and plenary processing."</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court, and write briefly only to emphasize the importance of finality to a system of justice. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/63/case.html">*</a></span>  Our traditional concern for "persons whom society has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 431 U. S. 85</a></p><p> grievously wronged and for whom belated liberation is little enough compensation," <em>Fay v. Noia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/391/case.html">372 U. S. 391</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/391/case.html#441">372 U. S. 441</a></span> (1963), has resulted in a uniquely elaborate system of appeals and collateral review, even in cases in which the issue presented has little or nothing to do with innocence of the accused.  The substantial societal interest in both innocence and finality of judgments is subordinated in many instances to formalisms.</p>\n<p>The case before us today is not necessarily an example of abuse of the system.  It is an example, however, of how finality can be frustrated by failure to adhere to proper procedures at the trial court level.  I do not prejudge the ultimate result in this case by saying that respondent\'s guilty plea may well have been made knowingly and voluntarily.  The case is here, five years after respondent\'s conviction, and following review by the North Carolina courts, the United States District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, primarily because the record before us leaves room for some doubt as to the reliability of the procedure followed with respect to the guilty plea.  All that we have in the record, as a basis for testing the possible merit of respondent\'s petition, are answers to a printed form certified by the trial judge.  We do not know whether anything was said by the judge, the prosecutor, or counsel for respondent, other than the questions read from the form and the monosyllabic answers by respondent.  There was no transcript of the proceedings.</p>\n<p>As the Court\'s opinion indicates, there is every reason to believe that, if a procedure similar to that prescribed by the new North Carolina statute is followed, a contention such as that made by respondent will justify an evidentiary hearing "only in the most extraordinary circumstances."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/63/case.html#80">431 U. S. 80</a></span> n.19.  If all participants in the process to the plea stage are mindful of the importance of adhering carefully to prescribed procedures and of preserving a full record thereof, the causes of justice and finality both will be served.</p>\n<p>* The importance of finality to the criminal defendant and to society was well put by Mr. Justice Harlan:</p>\n<p>"Both the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error, but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community."</p>\n<p><em>Sanders v.
