Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  Diamond v. Chakrabarty, \n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 303\n, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry whether such action was new \xe2\x80\x9cwith markedly different characteristics from any found in nature,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 310.  Myriad did not create or alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA.  It found an important and useful gene, but groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the \xc2\xa7101 inquiry.  See Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., \n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 127\n.

Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s patent descriptions highlight the problem with its claims: They detail the extensive process of discovery, but extensive effort alone is insufficient to satisfy \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x99s demands.  Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s claims are not saved by the fact that isolating DNA from the human genome severs the chemical bonds that bind gene molecules together.  The claims are not expressed in terms of chemical composition, nor do they rely on the chemical changes resulting from the isolation of a particular DNA section.  Instead, they focus on the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  Finally, Myriad argues that the Patent and Trademark Office\xe2\x80\x99s past practice of awarding gene patents is entitled to deference, citing J.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc., \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124\n, a case where Congress had endorsed a PTO practice in subsequent legislation.

(Myriad), discovered the precise location and sequence of two human genes, mutations of which can substantially increase the risks of breast and ovarian cancer.  Myriad obtained a number of patents based upon its discovery.  This case involves claims from three of them and requires us to resolve whether a naturally occurring segment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is patent eligible under \n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101 by virtue of its isolation from the rest of the human genome.  We also address the patent eligibility of synthetically created DNA known as complementary DNA (cDNA), which contains the same protein-coding information found in a segment of natural DNA but omits portions within the DNA segment that do not code for proteins.  For the reasons that follow, we hold that a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated, but that cDNA is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring.  We, therefore, affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGenes form the basis for hereditary traits in living organisms.  See generally Association for Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and Trademark Office, 702 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 181, 192\xe2\x80\x93211 (SDNY 2010).  The human ge- nome consists of approximately 22,000 genes packed into 23 pairs of chromosomes.  Each gene is encoded as DNA, which takes the shape of the familiar \xe2\x80\x9cdouble helix\xe2\x80\x9d that Doctors James Watson and Francis Crick first described in 1953.  Each \xe2\x80\x9ccross-bar\xe2\x80\x9d in the DNA helix consists of two chemically joined nucleotides.  The possible nucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), each of which binds naturally with another nucleotide: A pairs with T; C pairs with G.  The nucleotide cross-bars are chemically connected to a sugar-phosphate backbone that forms the outside framework of the DNA helix.  Sequences of DNA nucleotides contain the information necessary to create strings of amino acids, which in turn are used in the body to build proteins.  Only some DNA nucleotides, however, code for amino acids; these nucleotides are known as \xe2\x80\x9cexons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nucleotides that do not code for amino acids, in contrast, are known as \xe2\x80\x9cintrons.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCreation of proteins from DNA involves two principal steps, known as transcription and translation.  In transcription, the bonds between DNA nucleotides separate, and the DNA helix unwinds into two single strands.  A single strand is used as a template to create a complementary ribonucleic acid (RNA) strand.  The nucleotides on the DNA strand pair naturally with their counterparts, with the exception that RNA uses the nucleotide base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).  Transcription results in a single strand RNA molecule, known as pre-RNA, whose nucleotides form an inverse image of the DNA strand from which it was created.  Pre-RNA still contains nucleotides corresponding to both the exons and introns in the DNA molecule.  The pre-RNA is then naturally \xe2\x80\x9cspliced\xe2\x80\x9d by the physical removal of the introns.  The resulting product is a strand of RNA that contains nucleotides corresponding only to the exons from the original DNA strand.  The exons-only strand is known as messenger RNA (mRNA), which creates amino acids through translation.  In translation, cellular structures known as ribosomes read each set of three nucleotides, known as codons, in the mRNA.  Each codon either tells the ribosomes which of the 20 possible amino acids to synthesize or provides a stop signal that ends amino acid production.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDNA\xe2\x80\x99s informational sequences and the processes that create mRNA, amino acids, and proteins occur naturally within cells.  Scientists can, however, extract DNA from cells using well known laboratory methods.  These methods allow scientists to isolate specific segments of DNA\xe2\x80\x94for instance, a particular gene or part of a gene\xe2\x80\x94which can then be further studied, manipulated, or used.  It is also possible to create DNA synthetically through processes similarly well known in the field of genetics.  One such method begins with an mRNA molecule and uses the natural bonding properties of nucleotides to create a new, synthetic DNA molecule.  The result is the inverse of the mRNA\xe2\x80\x99s inverse image of the original DNA, with one important distinction: Because the natural creation of mRNA involves splicing that removes introns, the synthetic DNA created from mRNA also contains only the exon sequences.  This synthetic DNA created in the laboratory from mRNA is known as complementary DNA (cDNA).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tChanges in the genetic sequence are called mutations.  Mutations can be as small as the alteration of a single nucleotide\xe2\x80\x94a change affecting only one letter in the genetic code.  Such small-scale changes can produce an entirely different amino acid or can end protein production altogether.  Large changes, involving the deletion, rearrangement, or duplication of hundreds or even millions of nu- cleotides, can result in the elimination, misplacement, or duplication of entire genes.  Some mutations are harmless, but others can cause disease or increase the risk of disease.  As a result, the study of genetics can lead to valu- able medical breakthroughs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case involves patents filed by Myriad after it made one such medical breakthrough.  Myriad discovered the precise location and sequence of what are now known as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  Mutations in these genes can dramatically increase an individual\xe2\x80\x99s risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.  The average American woman has a 12- to 13-percent risk of developing breast cancer, but for women with certain genetic mutations, the risk can range between 50 and 80 percent for breast cancer and between 20 and 50 percent for ovarian cancer.  Before Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, scientists knew that heredity played a role in establishing a woman\xe2\x80\x99s risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, but they did not know which genes were associated with those cancers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMyriad identified the exact location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes on chromosomes 17 and 13.  Chromosome 17 has approximately 80 million nucleotides, and chro- mosome 13 has approximately 114 million.  Association for Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and Trademark Office, 689 F.\xc2\xa03d 1303, 1328 (CA Fed. 2012).  Within those chromosomes, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are each about 80,000 nucleotides long.  If just exons are counted, the BRCA1 gene is only about 5,500 nucleotides long; for the BRCA2 gene, that number is about 10,200.  Ibid.  Knowledge of the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes allowed Myriad to determine their typical nucleotide sequence.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That information, in turn, enabled Myriad to develop medical tests that are useful for detecting mutations in a patient\xe2\x80\x99s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and thereby assessing whether the patient has an increased risk of cancer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOnce it found the location and sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, Myriad sought and obtained a number of patents.  Nine composition claims from three of those patents are at issue in this case.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See id., at 1309, and n.\xc2\xa01 (noting composition claims).  Claims 1, 2, 5, and 6 from the \xe2\x80\x99282 patent are representative.  The first claim asserts a patent on \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n isolated DNA coding for a BRCA1 polypeptide,\xe2\x80\x9d which has \xe2\x80\x9cthe amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 822.  SEQ ID NO:2 sets forth a list of 1,863 amino acids that the typical BRCA1 gene encodes.  See id., at 785\xe2\x80\x93790.  Put differently, claim 1 asserts a patent claim on the DNA code that tells a cell to produce the string of BRCA1 amino acids listed in SEQ ID NO:2.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tClaim 2 of the \xe2\x80\x99282 patent operates similarly.  It claims \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he isolated DNA of claim 1, wherein said DNA has the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 822.  Like SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:1 sets forth a long list of data, in this instance the sequence of cDNA that codes for the BRCA1 amino acids listed in claim 1.  Importantly, SEQ ID NO:1 lists only the cDNA exons in the BRCA1 gene, rather than a full DNA sequence contain- ing both exons and introns.  See id., at 779 (stating that SEQ ID NO:1\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMOLECULE TYPE:\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9ccDNA\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a re- sult, the Federal Circuit recognized that claim 2 asserts a patent on the cDNA nucleotide sequence listed in SEQ ID NO:1, which codes for the typical BRCA1 gene.  689 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1326, n.\xc2\xa09; id., at 1337 (Moore, J., concurring in part); id., at 1356 (Bryson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tClaim 5 of the \xe2\x80\x99282 patent claims a subset of the data in claim 1.  In particular, it claims \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n isolated DNA having at least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 1.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 822.  The practical effect of claim 5 is to assert a patent on any series of 15 nucleotides that exist in the typical BRCA1 gene.  Because the BRCA1 gene is thousands of nucleotides long, even BRCA1 genes with substantial mutations are likely to contain at least one segment of 15 nucleotides that correspond to the typical BRCA1 gene.  Similarly, claim 6 of the \xe2\x80\x99282 patent claims \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n isolated DNA having at least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 2.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  This claim operates similarly to claim 5, except that it references the cDNA-based claim 2.  The remaining claims at issue are similar, though several list common mutations rather than typical BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences.  See ibid.

The University of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory (GDL) and others provided genetic testing services to women.  Petitioner Dr. Harry Ostrer, then a researcher at New York University School of Medicine, routinely sent his patients\xe2\x80\x99 DNA samples to GDL for testing.  After learning of GDL\xe2\x80\x99s testing and Ostrer\xe2\x80\x99s activities, Myriad sent letters to them asserting that the genetic testing infringed Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s patents.  App. 94\xe2\x80\x9395 (Ostrer letter).  In response, GDL agreed to stop testing and informed Ostrer that it would no longer accept patient samples.  Myriad also filed patent infringement suits against other entities that performed BRCA testing, resulting in settlements in which the defendants agreed to cease all allegedly infringing activity.  689 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1315.

All three judges agreed that only petitioner Ostrer had standing.  They reasoned that Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s actions against him and his stated ability and willingness to begin BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing if Myr- iad\xe2\x80\x99s patents were invalidated were sufficient for Article III standing.  689 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1323; id., at 1337 (opinion of Moore, J.); id., at 1348 (opinion of Bryson, J.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith respect to the merits, the court held that both isolated DNA and cDNA were patent eligible under \xc2\xa7101.  The central dispute among the panel members was whether the act of isolating DNA\xe2\x80\x94separating a specific gene or sequence of nucleotides from the rest of the chromosome\xe2\x80\x94is an inventive act that entitles the individual who first isolates it to a patent.  Each of the judges on the panel had a different view on that question.  Judges Lourie and Moore agreed that Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s claims were patent eligible under \xc2\xa7101 but disagreed on the rationale.  Judge Lourie relied on the fact that the entire DNA molecule is held together by chemical bonds and that the covalent bonds at both ends of the segment must be severed in order to isolate segments of DNA.  This process technically creates new molecules with unique chemical compositions.  See id., at 1328 (\xe2\x80\x9cIsolated DNA .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is a free-standing portion of a larger, natural DNA molecule.  Isolated DNA has been cleaved (i.e., had covalent bonds in its backbone chemically severed) or synthesized to consist of just a fraction of a naturally occurring DNA molecule\xe2\x80\x9d).  Judge Lourie found this chemical alteration to be dispositive, because isolating a particular strand of DNA creates a nonnaturally occurring molecule, even though the chemical alteration does not change the information-transmitting quality of the DNA.  See id., at 1330 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe claimed isolated DNA molecules are distinct from their natural existence as portions of larger entities, and their informational content is irrelevant to that fact.  We recognize that biologists may think of molecules in terms of their uses, but genes are in fact materials having a chemical nature\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, he rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that isolated DNA was ineligible for patent protection as a product of nature.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJudge Moore concurred in part but did not rely exclusively on Judge Lourie\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that chemically breaking covalent bonds was sufficient to render isolated DNA patent eligible.  Id., at 1341 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent the majority rests its conclusion on the chemical differences between [naturally occurring] and isolated DNA (breaking the covalent bonds), I cannot agree that this is sufficient to hold that the claims to human genes are directed to patentable subject matter\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, Judge Moore also relied on the United States Patent and Trademark Office\xe2\x80\x99s (PTO) practice of granting such patents and on the reliance interests of patent holders.  Id., at 1343.  However, she acknowledged that her vote might have come out differently if she \xe2\x80\x9cwere deciding this case on a blank canvas.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, Judge Bryson concurred in part and dissented in part, concluding that isolated DNA is not patent eli- gible.  As an initial matter, he emphasized that the breaking of chemical bonds was not dispositive: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no magic to a chemical bond that requires us to recognize a new prod- uct when a chemical bond is created or broken.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1351.  Instead, he relied on the fact that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he nucleotide sequences of the claimed molecules are the same as the nucleotide sequences found in naturally occurring human genes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1355.  Judge Bryson then concluded that genetic \xe2\x80\x9cstructural similarity dwarfs the significance of the structural differences between isolated DNA and naturally occurring DNA, especially where the structural differences are merely ancillary to the breaking of covalent bonds, a process that is itself not inventive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  More- over, Judge Bryson gave no weight to the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s position on patentability because of the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s position that \xe2\x80\x9cthe PTO lacks substantive rulemaking authority as to issues such as patentability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1357.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the judges expressed different views concerning the patentability of isolated DNA, all three agreed that patent claims relating to cDNA met the patent eligibility requirements of \xc2\xa7101.

In- stead, Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes within chromosomes 17 and 13.

In Chakrabarty, scientists added four plasmids to a bacterium, which enabled it to break down various components of crude oil.  447 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 305, and n.\xc2\xa01.  The Court held that the modified bacterium was patentable.  It explained that the patent claim was \xe2\x80\x9cnot to a hitherto unknown natural phenomenon, but to a nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter\xe2\x80\x94a product of human ingenuity \xe2\x80\x98having a distinctive name, character [and] use.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 309\xe2\x80\x93310 (quoting Hartranft v.

In this case, by contrast, Myriad did not create anything.  To be sure, it found an important and useful gene, but separating that gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGroundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the \xc2\xa7101 inquiry.  In Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., \n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 127 (1948)\n, this Court considered a composition patent that claimed a mixture of naturally occurring strains of bacteria that helped leguminous plants take nitrogen from the air and fix it in the soil.  Id., at 128\xe2\x80\x93129.  The ability of the bacteria to fix nitrogen was well known, and farmers commonly \xe2\x80\x9cinoculated\xe2\x80\x9d their crops with them to improve soil nitrogen levels.  But farmers could not use the same inoculant for all crops, both because plants use different bacteria and because certain bacteria inhibit each other.  Id., at 129\xe2\x80\x93130.  Upon learning that several nitrogen-fixing bacteria did not inhibit each other, however, the patent applicant combined them into a single inoculant and obtained a patent.  Id., at 130.  The Court held that the composition was not patent eligible because the patent holder did not alter the bacteria in any way.  Id., at 132 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no way in which we could call [the bacteria mixture a product of invention] unless we borrowed invention from the discovery of the natural principle itself\xe2\x80\x9d).  His patent claim thus fell squarely within the law of nature exception.  So do Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s.  Myriad found the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but that discovery, by itself, does not render the BRCA genes \xe2\x80\x9cnew .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. composition[s] of matter,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101, that are patent eligible.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s patent descriptions highlight the problem with its claims.  For example, a section of the \xe2\x80\x99282 patent\xe2\x80\x99s Detailed Description of the Invention indicates that Myriad found the location of a gene associated with increased risk of breast cancer and identified mutations of that gene that increase the risk.  See  App. 748\xe2\x80\x93749.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In subsequent language Myriad explains that the location of the gene was unknown until Myriad found it among the approximately eight million nucleotide pairs contained in a subpart of chromosome 17.  See Ibid.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The \xe2\x80\x99473 and \xe2\x80\x99492 patents contain similar language as well.  See id., at 854, 947.  Many of Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s patent descriptions simply detail the \xe2\x80\x9citerative process\xe2\x80\x9d of discovery by which Myriad narrowed the possible locations for the gene sequences that it sought.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See, e.g., id., at 750.  Myriad seeks to import these extensive research efforts into the \xc2\xa7101 patent-eligibility inquiry.  Brief for Respondents 8\xe2\x80\x9310, 34.  But extensive effort alone is insufficient to satisfy the demands of \xc2\xa7101.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor are Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s claims saved by the fact that isolating DNA from the human genome severs chemical bonds and thereby creates a nonnaturally occurring molecule.  Myr- iad\xe2\x80\x99s claims are simply not expressed in terms of chemical composition, nor do they rely in any way on the chemi- cal changes that result from the isolation of a particular section of DNA.  Instead, the claims understandably focus on the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  If the patents depended upon the creation of a unique molecule, then a would-be infringer could arguably avoid at least Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s patent claims on entire genes (such as claims 1 and 2 of the \xe2\x80\x99282 patent) by isolating a DNA sequence that included both the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and one additional nucleotide pair.  Such a molecule would not be chemically identical to the molecule \xe2\x80\x9cinvented\xe2\x80\x9d by Myriad.  But Myriad obviously would resist that outcome because its claim is concerned primarily with the information contained in the genetic sequence, not with the specific chemical composition of a particular molecule.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, Myriad argues that the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s past practice of awarding gene patents is entitled to deference, citing J.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc., \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124 (2001)\n.  See Brief for Respondents 35\xe2\x80\x9339, 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  We disagree.  J. E. M. held that new plant breeds were eligible for utility patents under \xc2\xa7101 notwithstanding separate statutes providing special protections for plants, see \n\n7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72321 et\xc2\xa0seq.

After analyzing the text and structure of the relevant statutes, the Court mentioned that the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences had determined that new plant breeds were patent eligible under \xc2\xa7101 and that Congress had recognized and endorsed that position in a subsequent Patent Act amendment.  534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 144\xe2\x80\x93145 (citing In\xc2\xa0re Hibberd, 227 USPQ 443 (1985) and \n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7119(f)).  In this case, however, Congress has not endorsed the views of the PTO in subsequent legislation.  While Myriad relies on Judge Moore\xe2\x80\x99s view that Congress endorsed the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s position in a single sentence in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004, see Brief for Respondents 31, n.\xc2\xa08; 689 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1346, that Act does not even mention genes, much less isolated DNA.  \xc2\xa7634, \n\n118Stat.\n101 (\xe2\x80\x9cNone of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this Act may be used to issue patents on claims directed to or encompassing a human organism\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurther undercutting the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s practice, the United States argued in the Federal Circuit and in this Court that isolated DNA was not patent eligible under \xc2\xa7101, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20\xe2\x80\x9333, and that the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s practice was not \xe2\x80\x9ca sufficient reason to hold that isolated DNA is patent-eligible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 26.

That may be so, but the lab technician unquestionably creates something new when cDNA is made.  cDNA retains the naturally occurring exons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA from which it was derived.  As a result, cDNA is not a \xe2\x80\x9cproduct of nature\xe2\x80\x9d and is patent eligible under \xc2\xa7101, except insofar as very short series of DNA may have no intervening introns to remove when creating cDNA.  In that situation, a short strand of cDNA may be indistinguishable from natural DNA.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is important to note what is not implicated by this decision.  First, there are no method claims before this Court.  Had Myriad created an innovative method of manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, it could possibly have sought a method pat- ent.  But the processes used by Myriad to isolate DNA were well understood by geneticists at the time of Myriad\xe2\x80\x99s patents \xe2\x80\x9cwere well understood, widely used, and fairly uniform insofar as any scientist engaged in the search for a gene would likely have utilized a similar approach,\xe2\x80\x9d 702 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 202\xe2\x80\x93203, and are not at issue in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, this case does not involve patents on new applications of knowledge about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  Judge Bryson aptly noted that, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s the first party with knowledge of the [BRCA1 and BRCA2] sequences, Myriad was in an excellent position to claim applications of that knowledge.  Many of its unchallenged claims are limited to such applications.\xe2\x80\x9d  689 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1349.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor do we consider the patentability of DNA in which the order of the naturally occurring nucleotides has been altered.  Scientific alteration of the genetic code presents a different inquiry, and we express no opinion about the application of \xc2\xa7101 to such endeavors.

In rare instances, a side effect ofa viral infection of a cell can be the random incorporation of fragments of the resulting cDNA, known as a pseudogene, into the genome.  Such pseudogenes serve no purpose; they are not expressed in protein creation because they lack genetic sequences to direct protein expression.  See J. Watson et\xc2\xa0al., Molecular Biology of the Gene 142, 144, fig. 7\xe2\x80\x935 (6th ed. 2008).  Perhaps not surprisingly, given pseudogenes\xe2\x80\x99 apparently random origins, petitioners \xe2\x80\x9chave failed to demonstrate that the pseudogene consists of the same sequence as the BRCA1 cDNA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Association for Molecular Pathology v.
