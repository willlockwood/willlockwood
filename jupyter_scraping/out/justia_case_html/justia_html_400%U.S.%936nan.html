Petitioner Spires was also charged with two counts of selling LSD. All petitioners were found guilty on each count charged against them. The District Judge did not make a specific finding that the possession of LSD was for the purposes of sale, but the Court of Appeals concluded that the evidence was overwhelming that the possession was for purposes of sale. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/427/1066/">427 F.2d 1066</a>, 1071. </p><p> We distort the record when we treat the case as \'possession\' of a drug for purposes of manufacture. We deal with a drug after it was manufactured and held for sale. The charge of \'possession\' made in the indictment was therefore \'possession\' as defined in the 1965 Act. The power to pardon is reserved for the Executive. Accordingly I would deny certiorari and I dissent from a remand of the case. </p><p> Mr. Justice WHITE and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN also dissent and would deny certiorari.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
