FLORES et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x93289.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 20, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 25, 2009<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p align="left">A group of English Language-Learner (ELL) students and their parents (plaintiffs) filed a class action, alleging that Arizona, its State Board of Education, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction (defendants) were providing inadequate ELL instruction in the Nogales Unified School District (Nogales), in violation of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), which requires States to take \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action to overcome language barriers\xe2\x80\x9d in schools, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71703(f).  In 2000, the Federal District Court entered a declaratory judgment, finding an EEOA violation in Nogales because the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not related to the actual costs of ELL instruction in Nogales.   The District Court subsequently extended relief statewide and, in the years following, entered a series of additional orders and injunctions.  The defendants did not appeal any of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders.  In 2006, the state legislature passed HB 2064, which, among other things, increased ELL incremental funding.  The incremental funding increase required District Court approval, and the Governor asked the state attorney general to move for accelerated consideration of the bill.  The State Board of Education, which joined the Governor in opposing HB 2064, the State, and the plaintiffs are respondents here.  The Speaker of the State House of Representatives and the President of the State Senate (Legislators) intervened and, with the superintendent (collectively, petitioners), moved to purge the contempt order in light of HB 2064.  In the alternative, they sought relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5).  The District Court denied their motion to purge the contempt order and declined to address the Rule 60(b)(5) claim.  The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on whether changed circumstances warranted Rule 60(b)(5).  On remand, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion, holding that HB 2064 had not created an adequate funding system.  Affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that Nogales had not made sufficient progress in its ELL programming to warrant relief.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The superintendent has standing.

Inmates of Suffolk County Jail</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/367/index.html">502 U. S. 367</a>, 384, serves a particularly important function in \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 380.  Injunctions in institutional reform cases often remain in force for many years, during which time changed circumstances may warrant reexamination of the original judgment.  Injunctions of this sort may also raise sensitive federalism concerns, which are heightened when, as in these cases, a federal-court decree has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities.  Finally, institutional reform injunctions bind state and local officials to their predecessors\xe2\x80\x99 policy preferences and may thereby \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Frew </em>v. <em>Hawkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/431/index.html">540 U. S. 431</a>, 441.  Because of these features of institutional reform litigation, federal courts must take a \xe2\x80\x9cflexible approach\xe2\x80\x9d to Rule 60(b)(5) motions brought in this context, <em>Rufo</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 381, ensuring that \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibility for discharging the State\xe2\x80\x99s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials\xe2\x80\x9d when circumstances warrant, <em>Frew</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 442.  Courts must remain attentive to the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [federal law] or \xe2\x80\xa6 flow from such a violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milliken </em>v<em>. Bradley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/267/index.html">433 U. S. 267</a>, 282.  Thus, a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the EEOA violation underlying the 2000 order has been remedied.  If it has, the order\xe2\x80\x99s continued enforcement is unnecessary and improper.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5) analysis just described.

The Court of Appeals explained that situations in which changed circumstances warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief are \xe2\x80\x9clikely rare,\xe2\x80\x9d and that, to succeed, petitioners had to show that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to \xe2\x80\x9csweep away\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s incremental funding determination.  The Court of Appeals also incorrectly reasoned that federalism concerns were substantially lessened here because the State and the State Board of Education wanted the injunction to remain in place.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 inquiry was also too narrow, focusing almost exclusively on the sufficiency of ELL incremental funding.  It attributed undue significance to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure to appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 order and in doing so, failed to engage in the flexible changed circumstances inquiry prescribed by <em>Rufo</em>.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 inquiry was, effectively, an inquiry into whether the 2000 order had been satisfied.  But satisfaction of an earlier judgment is only one of Rule 60(b)(5)\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated bases for relief.  Petitioners could obtain relief on the independent basis that prospective enforcement of the order was \xe2\x80\x9cno longer equitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  To determine the merits of this claim, the Court of Appeals should have ascertained whether the 2000 order\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing enforcement was supported by an ongoing EEOA violation.  Although the EEOA requires a State to take \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action,\xe2\x80\x9d it entrusts state and local authorities with choosing how to meet this obligation.  By focusing solely on ELL incremental funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended this mandate.  And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d through a particular funding mechanism, it improperly substituted its own policy judgments for those of the state and local officials entrusted with the decisions.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion reveals similar errors.  Rather than determining whether changed circumstances warranted relief from the 2000 order, it asked only whether petitioners had satisfied that order through increased ELL incremental funding.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Because the Court of Appeals and the District Court misperceived the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry, this case must be remanded for a proper examination of at least four factual and legal changes that may warrant relief. Pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9334.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0After the 2000 order was entered, Arizona moved from a \xe2\x80\x9cbilingual education\xe2\x80\x9d methodology of ELL instruction to \xe2\x80\x9cstructured English immersion\xe2\x80\x9d (SEI).  Research on ELL instruction and findings by the State Department of Education support the view that SEI is significantly more effective than bilingual education.  A proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis should entail further factual findings regarding whether Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 implementation of SEI is a \xe2\x80\x9cchanged circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d warranting relief.  Pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0 Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), which represents another potentially significant \xe2\x80\x9cchanged circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d   Although compliance with NCLB will not necessarily constitute \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d under the EEOA, NCLB is relevant to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Rule 60(b)(5) motion in four principal ways: It prompted the State to make significant structural and programming changes in its ELL programming; it significantly increased federal funding for education in general and ELL programming in particular; it provided evidence of the progress and achievement of Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 ELL students through its assessment and reporting requirements; and it marked a shift in federal education policy.  Pp.\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii)\xc2\xa0Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 superintendent instituted significant structural and management reforms which, among other things, reduced class sizes, improved student/teacher ratios, and improved the quality of teachers.  Entrenched in the incremental funding framework, the lower courts failed to recognize that these changes may have brought Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even without sufficient incremental funding to satisfy the 2000 order.  This was error.  Because the EEOA focuses on the quality of educational programming and services to students, not the amount of money spent, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant ELL programming in ways other than through increased incremental funding.  A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL students.  Pp. 29\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iv)\xc2\xa0There was an overall increase in education funding available in Nogales.  The Court of Appeals foreclosed the possibility that petitioners could show that this overall increase was sufficient to support EEOA-compliant ELL programming.  This was clear legal error.  The EEOA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d requirement does not necessarily require a particular level of funding, and to the extent that funding is relevant, the EEOA does not require that the money come from a particular source.  Thus, the District Court should evaluate whether the State\xe2\x80\x99s general education funding budget, in addition to local revenues, currently supports EEOA-compliant ELL programming in Nogales.  Pp.\xc2\xa032\xe2\x80\x9334.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0On remand, if petitioners press their objection to the injunction as it extends beyond Nogales, the lower courts should consider whether the District Court erred in entering statewide relief.  The record contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district other than Nogales failed to provide equal educational opportunities to ELL students, and respondents have not explained how the EEOA can justify a statewide injunction here.  The state attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s concern that a \xe2\x80\x9cNogales only\xe2\x80\x9d remedy would run afoul of the Arizona Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s equal-funding requirement did not provide a valid basis for a statewide <em>federal</em> injunction, for it raises a state-law question to be determined by state authorities.  Unless the District Court concludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA statewide, it should vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71703(f), which requires a State \xe2\x80\x9cto take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 2000, the District Court entered a declaratory judgment with respect to Nogales, and in 2001, the court extended the order to apply to the entire State.  Over the next eight years, petitioners repeatedly sought relief from the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders, but to no avail.  We granted certiorari after the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), and we now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explain, the District Court and the Court of Appeals misunderstood both the obligation that the EEOA imposes on States and the nature of the inquiry that is required when parties such as petitioners seek relief under Rule 60(b)(5) on the ground that enforcement of a judgment is \xe2\x80\x9cno longer equitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Both of the lower courts focused excessively on the narrow question of the adequacy of the State\xe2\x80\x99s incremental funding for ELL instruction instead of fairly considering the broader question whether, as a result of important changes during the intervening years, the State was fulfilling its obligation under the EEOA by other means.  The question at issue in these cases is not whether Arizona must take \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d to overcome the language barriers that impede ELL students.  Of course it must.  But petitioners argue that Arizona is now fulfilling its statutory obligation by new means that reflect new policy insights and other changed circumstances.  Rule 60(b)(5) provides the vehicle for petitioners to bring such an argument.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1992, a group of students enrolled in the ELL program in Nogales and their parents (plaintiffs) filed suit in the District Court for the District of Arizona on behalf of \xe2\x80\x9call minority \xe2\x80\x98at risk\xe2\x80\x99 and limited English proficient children \xe2\x80\xa6 now or hereafter, enrolled in the Nogales Unified School District \xe2\x80\xa6 as well as their parents and guardians.\xe2\x80\x9d  172 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1225, 1226 (2000).

At a hearing in February 2006, a new attorney general opposed the superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s request for a stay of the December 2005 order imposing sanctions and fines, and filed a proposed distribution of the accrued fines.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2006, after accruing over $20 million in fines, the state legislature passed HB 2064, which was designed to implement a permanent funding solution to the problems identified by the District Court in 2000.  Among other things, HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding (with a 2-year per-student limit on such funding) and created two new funds\xe2\x80\x94a structured English immersion fund and a compensatory instruction fund\xe2\x80\x94to cover additional costs of ELL programming.  Moneys in both newly created funds were to be offset by available federal moneys.  HB 2064 also instituted several programming and structural changes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Governor did not approve of HB 2064\xe2\x80\x99s funding provisions, but she allowed the bill to become law without her signature.  Because HB 2064\xe2\x80\x99s incremental ELL funding increase required court approval to become effective, the Governor requested the attorney general to move for accelerated consideration by the District Court.  In doing so, she explained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]fter nine months of meetings and three vetoes, it is time to take this matter to a federal judge.  I am convinced that getting this bill into court now is the most expeditious way ultimately to bring the state into compliance with federal law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Flores</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, 516 F.\xc2\xa03d 1140, 1153, n.\xc2\xa016 (CA9 2008).  The State Board of Education joined the Governor in opposing HB 2064.  Together, the State Board of Education, the State of Arizona, and the plaintiffs are respondents here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the principal defendants in the action siding with the plaintiffs, the Speaker of the State House of Representatives and the President of the State Senate (Legislators) filed a motion to intervene as representatives of their respective legislative bodies.  App. 55.  In support of their motion, they stated that although the attorney general had a \xe2\x80\x9clegal duty\xe2\x80\x9d to defend HB 2064, the attorney general had shown \xe2\x80\x9clittle enthusiasm\xe2\x80\x9d for advancing the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s interests.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57.  Among other things, the Legislators noted that the attorney general \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to take an appeal of the judgment entered in this case in 2000 and has failed to appeal any of the injunctions and other orders issued in aid of the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 60.  The District Court granted the Legislators\xe2\x80\x99 motion for permissive intervention, and the Legislators and superintendent (together, petitioners here) moved to purge the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s contempt order in light of HB 2064.  Alternatively, they moved for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) based on changed circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 2006, the District Court denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion, concluding that HB 2064 was fatally flawed in three respects.  First, while HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding by approximately $80 per student, the court held that this increase was not rationally related to effective ELL programming.  Second, the court concluded that imposing a 2-year limit on funding for each ELL student was irrational.  Third, according to the court, HB 2064 violated federal law by using federal funds to \xe2\x80\x9csupplant\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9csupplement\xe2\x80\x9d state funds.

Emphasizing that Rule 60(b)(5) is not a substitute for a timely appeal, and characterizing the original declaratory judgment order as centering on the adequacy of ELL incremental funding, the Court of Appeals explained that relief would be appropriate only if petitioners had shown \xe2\x80\x9ceither that there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in Arizona\xe2\x80\x9d or that Arizona had altered its funding model.  <em>Id</em>., at 1169.  The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioners had made neither showing, and it rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 other arguments, including the claim that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), 115 Stat. 1702, as added, 20 U.

States and local governments have limited funds.  When a federal court orders that money be appropriated for one program, the effect is often to take funds away from other important programs.  See <em>Jenkins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 131 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cA structural reform decree eviscerates a State\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary authority over its own program and budgets and forces state officials to reallocate state resources and funds\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the dynamics of institutional reform litigation differ from those of other cases.

A flexible approach allows courts to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibility for discharging the State\xe2\x80\x99s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials\xe2\x80\x9d when the circumstances warrant.  <em>Frew</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 442.  In applying this flexible approach, courts must remain attentive to the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [federal law] or does not flow from such a violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milliken </em>v<em>.

Rather than applying a flexible standard that seeks to return control to state and local officials as soon as a violation of federal law has been remedied, the Court of Appeals used a heightened standard that paid insufficient attention to federalism concerns.  And rather than inquiring broadly into whether changed conditions in Nogales provided evidence of an ELL program that complied with the EEOA, the Court of Appeals concerned itself only with determining whether increased ELL funding complied with the original declaratory judgment order.  The court erred on both counts.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals began its Rule 60(b)(5) discussion by citing the correct legal standard, see 516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1163 (noting that relief is appropriate upon a showing of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a significant change either in factual conditions or in law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d), but it quickly strayed.

This statement is flatly incorrect, as even respondents acknowledge.  Brief for Respondent State of Arizona et\xc2\xa0al. 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Precisely because different state actors have taken contrary positions in this litigation, federalism concerns are elevated.  And precisely because federalism concerns are heightened, a flexible approach to Rule 60(b)(5) relief is critical.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the objects of the decree have been attained\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, when EEOA compliance has been achieved\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cresponsibility for discharging the State\xe2\x80\x99s obligations [must be] returned promptly to the State and its officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Frew</em>, 540 U.

In large part, this was driven by the significance the Court of Appeals attributed to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure to appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s original order.  The Court of Appeals explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe central idea\xe2\x80\x9d of that order was that without sufficient ELL incremental funds, \xe2\x80\x9cELL programs would necessarily be inadequate.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1167\xe2\x80\x931168.

By confining the scope of its analysis to that of the original order, it insulated the policies embedded in the order\xe2\x80\x94specifically, its incremental funding requirement\xe2\x80\x94from challenge and amendment.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  But those policies were supported by the very officials who could have appealed them\xe2\x80\x94the state defendants\xe2\x80\x94and, as a result, were never subject to true challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of focusing on the failure to appeal, the Court of Appeals should have conducted the type of Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry prescribed in <em>Rufo.  </em>This inquiry makes no reference to the presence or absence of a timely appeal.  It takes the original judgment as a given and asks only whether \xe2\x80\x9ca significant change either in factual conditions or in law\xe2\x80\x9d renders continued enforcement of the judgment \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental to the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rufo</em>, 502 U. S.<em>,</em> at 384.  It allows a court to recognize that the longer an injunction or consent decree stays in place, the greater the risk that it will improperly interfere with a State\xe2\x80\x99s democratic processes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals purported to engage in a \xe2\x80\x9cchanged circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry, but it asked only whether changed circumstances affected ELL funding and, more specifically, ELL incremental funding.  Relief was appropriate, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, only if petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate[d] either that there [we]re no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98base plus incremental costs\xe2\x80\x99 educational funding model was so altered that focusing on ELL-specific incremental costs funding has become irrelevant and inequitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1169.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This was a Rule 60(b)(5) \xe2\x80\x9cchanged circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry in name only.  In reality, it was an inquiry into whether the deficiency in ELL incremental funding that the District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied.  And this, effectively, was an inquiry into whether the original order had been satisfied.  Satisfaction of an earlier judgment is <em>one</em> of the enumerated bases for Rule 60(b)(5) relief\xe2\x80\x94but it is not the only basis for such relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a judgment where \xe2\x80\x9c[i] the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; [ii] it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; <em>or</em> [iii] applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Use of the disjunctive \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d makes it clear that each of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s three grounds for relief is independently sufficient and therefore that relief may be warranted even if petitioners have not \xe2\x80\x9csatisfied\xe2\x80\x9d the original order.  As petitioners argue, they may obtain relief if prospective enforcement of that order \xe2\x80\x9cis no longer equitable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To determine the merits of this claim, the Court of Appeals needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement of the original order was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law (here, the EEOA).  See <em>Milliken</em>, 433 U. S., at 282.  It failed to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As previously noted, the EEOA, while requiring a State to take \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action to overcome language barriers,\xe2\x80\x9d 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71703(f), \xe2\x80\x9cleave[s] state and local educational authorities a substantial amount of latitude in choosing\xe2\x80\x9d how this obligation is met.  <em>Castaneda</em>, 648 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1009.  Of course, any educational program, including the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d mandated by the EEOA, requires funding, but funding is simply a means, not the end.   By focusing so intensively on Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s incremental ELL funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the EEOA\xe2\x80\x99s mandate.  And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d through a particular funding mechanism, the Court of Appeals improperly substituted its own educational and budgetary policy judgments for those of the state and local officials to whom such decisions are properly entrusted.  Cf. <em>Jenkins</em>, 515 U. S., at 131 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cFederal courts do not possess the capabilities of state and local governments in addressing difficult educational problems\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The underlying District Court opinion reveals similar errors.  In an August 2006 remand order, a different Ninth Circuit panel had instructed the District Court to hold an evidentiary hearing \xe2\x80\x9cregarding whether changed circumstances required modification of the original court order or otherwise had a bearing on the appropriate remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  204 Fed. Appx., at 582.  The Ninth Circuit panel<em> </em>observed that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal courts must be sensitive to the need for modification [of permanent injunctive relief] when circumstances change.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court failed to follow these instructions.  Instead of determining whether changed circumstances warranted modification of the original order, the District Court asked only whether petitioners had satisfied the original declaratory judgment order through increased incremental funding.  See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1165 (explaining that a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cmere amelioration\xe2\x80\x9d of the specific deficiencies noted in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s original order was \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>compliance</em> would require a funding system that rationally relates funding available to the actual costs of all elements of ELL instruction\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The District Court stated: \xe2\x80\x9cIt should be noted that the Court finds the same problems today that it saw last year, because HB 2064 is the same, the problems themselves are the same.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Id</em>., at 1161.  The District Court thus rested its postremand decision on its preremand analysis of HB 2064.  It disregarded the remand instructions to engage in a broad and flexible Rule 60(b)(5) analysis as to whether changed circumstances warranted relief.  In taking this approach, the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent defends the narrow approach of the lower courts with four principal conclusions that it draws from the record.  All of these conclusions, however, are incorrect and mirror the fundamental error of the lower courts\xe2\x80\x94a fixation on the issue of incremental funding and a failure to recognize the proper scope of a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the dissent concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Rule 60(b)(5) \xe2\x80\x98changes\xe2\x80\x99 upon which the District Court focused\xe2\x80\x9d were not limited to changes in funding, and included \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98changed teaching methods\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98changed administrative systems.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 12.

But it neither focused on these changes nor made up-to-date factual findings.  To the contrary, the District Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cit would be premature to make an assessment of some of these changes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Accordingly, of the 28 findings of fact that the court proceeded to make, the first 20 addressed funding directly and exclusively.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1161\xe2\x80\x931163.  The last eight addressed funding indirectly\xe2\x80\x94discussing reclassification rates because of their relevance to HB 2064\xe2\x80\x99s funding restrictions for ELL and reclassified students.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1163\xe2\x80\x931165.

We fail to see this conclusion\xe2\x80\x99s relevance to this Rule 60(b)(5) motion, where the question is whether any change in factual or legal circumstances renders continued enforcement of the original order inequitable.  As the dissent itself acknowledges, petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cpointed to three sets of changed circumstances [in their Rule 60(b)(5) motion] which, in their view, showed that the judgment and the related orders were no longer necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 11.  In addition to \xe2\x80\x9cincreases in the amount of funding available to Arizona school districts,\xe2\x80\x9d these included \xe2\x80\x9cchanges in the method of English-learning instruction,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cchanges in the administration of the Nogales school district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the dissent concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe type of issue upon which the District Court and Court of Appeals focused\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the incremental funding issue\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clies at the heart of the statutory demand for equal educational opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 13.  In what we interpret to be a restatement of this point, the dissent also concludes that sufficient funding (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>the \xe2\x80\x98resource\xe2\x80\x99 issue</em>\xe2\x80\x9d) and the presence or absence of an EEOA violation (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>the statutory subsection (f) issue</em>\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9c<em>are one and the same</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 14 (emphasis in original).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn focusing upon the one,\xe2\x80\x9d the dissent asserts, \xe2\x80\x9cthe District Court and Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, these two issues are decidedly not<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c<em>one and the same</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] <em> Ibid</em>.

Funding is merely one tool that may be employed to achieve the statutory objective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the dissent concludes that the District Court did not order increased ELL incremental funding and did not dictate state and local budget priorities.  <em>Post</em>, at 15.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s point\xe2\x80\x94and it is a very small one\xe2\x80\x94is that the District Court did not set a specific amount that the legislature was required to appropriate.  The District Court did, however, hold the State in contempt and impose heavy fines because the legislature did not provide sufficient funding.  These orders unquestionably imposed important restrictions on the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s ability to set budget priorities.</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the lower courts\xe2\x80\x94like the dissent\xe2\x80\x94misperceived both the nature of the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the inquiry called for under Rule 60(b)(5), these cases must be remanded for a proper examination of at least four important factual and legal changes that may warrant the granting of relief from the judgment: the State\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of a new ELL instructional methodology, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of NCLB, structural and management reforms in Nogales, and increased overall education funding.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s original declaratory judgment order, ELL instruction in Nogales was based primarily on \xe2\x80\x9cbilingual education,\xe2\x80\x9d which teaches core content areas in a student\xe2\x80\x99s native language while providing English instruction in separate language classes.  In November 2000, Arizona voters passed Proposition 203, which mandated statewide implementation of a \xe2\x80\x9cstructured English immersion\xe2\x80\x9d (SEI) approach.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93294, p. 369a.  Proposition 203 defines this methodology as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Sheltered English immersion\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98structured English immersion\xe2\x80\x99 means an English language acquisition process for young children in which nearly all classroom instruction is in English but with the curriculum and presentation designed for children who are learning the language\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

It required that all school districts and charter schools select one of the adopted SEI models, \xc2\xa715\xe2\x80\x93756.02(A), and it created an \xe2\x80\x9cOffice of English language acquisition services\xe2\x80\x9d to aid school districts in implementation of the models.  \xc2\xa715\xe2\x80\x93756.07(1).

It reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment that the best way to raise the level of education nationwide is by granting state and local officials flexibility to develop and implement educational programs that address local needs, while holding them accountable for the results.  NCLB implements this approach by requiring States receiving federal funds to define performance standards and to make regular assessments of progress toward the attainment of those standards.  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76311(b)(2).  NCLB conditions the continued receipt of funds on demonstrations of \xe2\x80\x9cadequate yearly progress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As relevant here, Title III (the English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act) requires States to ensure that ELL students \xe2\x80\x9cattain English proficiency, develop high levels of academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and student academic achievement standards as all children are expected to meet.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76812(1).  It requires States to set annual objective achievement goals for the number of students who will annually progress toward proficiency, achieve proficiency, and make \xe2\x80\x9cadequate yearly progress\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to academic achievement, \xc2\xa76842(a), and it holds local schools and agencies accountable for meeting these objectives, \xc2\xa76842(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that through compliance with NCLB, the State has established compliance with the EEOA.  They note that when a State adopts a compliance plan under NCLB\xe2\x80\x94as the State of Arizona has\xe2\x80\x94it must provide adequate assurances that ELL students will receive assistance \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve at high levels in the core academic subjects so that those children can meet the same \xe2\x80\xa6 standards as all children are expected to meet.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76812(2).  They argue that when the Federal Department of Education approves a State\xe2\x80\x99s plan\xe2\x80\x94as it has with respect to Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it offers definitive evidence that the State has taken \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action to overcome language barriers\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the EEOA.  \xc2\xa71703(f).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals concluded, and we agree, that because of significant differences in the two statutory schemes, compliance with NCLB will not necessarily constitute \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d under the EEOA.  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1172\xe2\x80\x931176.  Approval of a NCLB plan does not entail substantive review of a State\xe2\x80\x99s ELL programming or a determination that the programming results in equal educational opportunity for ELL students.  See \xc2\xa76823.  Moreover, NCLB contains a saving clause, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in this part shall be construed in a manner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a civil right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76847.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This does not mean, however, that NCLB is not relevant to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Rule 60(b)(5) motion.  To the contrary, we think it is probative in four principal ways.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  First, it prompted the State to institute significant structural and programming changes in its delivery of ELL education,[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] leading the Court of Appeals to observe that \xe2\x80\x9cArizona has significantly improved its ELL infrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1154.  These changes should not be discounted in the Rule 60(b)(5) analysis solely because they do not require or result from increased funding.  Second, NCLB significantly increased federal funding for education in general and ELL programming in particular.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  These funds should not be disregarded just because they are not state funds.  Third, through its assessment and reporting requirements, NCLB provides evidence of the progress and achievement of Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 ELL students.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  This evidence could provide persuasive evidence of the current effectiveness of Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 ELL programming.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth and finally, NCLB marks a shift in federal education policy.  See Brief for Petitioner Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives et al. 7\xe2\x80\x9316.  NCLB grants States \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d to adopt ELL programs they believe are \xe2\x80\x9cmost effective for teaching English.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76812(9).  Reflecting a growing consensus in education research that increased funding alone does not improve student achievement,[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] NCLB expressly refrains from dictating funding levels.  Instead, it focuses on the demonstrated progress of students through accountability reforms.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The original declaratory judgment order, in contrast, withdraws the authority of state and local officials to fund and implement ELL programs that best suit Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 needs, and measures effective programming solely in terms of adequate incremental funding.  This conflict with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination of federal policy may constitute a significantly changed circumstance, warranting relief.  See Railway Employees</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/364/642/index.html">364 U.

These reforms were led by Kelt Cooper, the Nogales superintendent from 2000 to 2005, who \xe2\x80\x9cadopted policies that ameliorated or eliminated many of the most glaring inadequacies discussed by the district court.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 F. 3d, at 1156.  Among other things, Cooper \xe2\x80\x9creduce[d] class sizes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly improv[ed] student/teacher ratios,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cimproved teacher quality,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpioneered a uniform system of textbook and curriculum planning,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clargely eliminated what had been a severe shortage of instructional materials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1156\xe2\x80\x931157.  The Court of Appeals recognized that by \xe2\x80\x9c[u]sing careful financial management and applying for \xe2\x80\x98all funds available,\xe2\x80\x99 Cooper was able to achieve his reforms with limited resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1157.  But the Court of Appeals missed the legal import of this observation\xe2\x80\x94that these reforms might have brought Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even without sufficient ELL incremental funding to satisfy the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s original order.  Instead, the Court of Appeals concluded that to credit Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s reforms would \xe2\x80\x9cpenaliz[e]\xe2\x80\x9d Nogales \xe2\x80\x9cfor doing its best to make do, despite Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with the terms of the judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d and would \xe2\x80\x9cabsolve the state from providing adequate ELL incremental funding as required by the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1168.  The District Court similarly discounted Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s achievements, acknowledging that Nogales was \xe2\x80\x9cdoing substantially better than it was in 2000,\xe2\x80\x9d but concluding that because the progress resulted from management efforts rather than increased funding, its progress was \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting at best.\xe2\x80\x9d  480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Entrenched in the framework of incremental funding, both courts refused to consider that Nogales could be taking \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d to address language barriers even without having satisfied the original order.  This was error.  The EEOA seeks to provide \xe2\x80\x9cequal educational opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9call children enrolled in public schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71701(a).  Its ultimate focus is on the quality of educational programming and services provided to students, not the amount of money spent on them.  Accordingly, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant programming by means other than increased funding\xe2\x80\x94for example, through Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s structural, curricular, and accountability-based reforms.  The weight of research suggests that these types of local reforms, much more than court-imposed funding mandates, lead to improved educational opportunities.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Cooper even testified that, without the structural changes he imposed, \xe2\x80\x9cadditional money\xe2\x80\x9d would not \xe2\x80\x9chave made any difference to th[e] students\xe2\x80\x9d in Nogales.  Addendum to Reply Brief for Petitioner Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives et al. 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals discounted Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s reforms for other reasons as well.  It explained that while they \xe2\x80\x9cdid ameliorate many of the specific examples of resource shortages that the district court identified in 2000,\xe2\x80\x9d they did not \xe2\x80\x9cresult in such success as to call into serious question [Nogales\xe2\x80\x99] need for increased incremental funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1169.  Among other things, the Court of Appeals referred to \xe2\x80\x9cthe persistent achievement gaps documented in [Nogales\xe2\x80\x99] AIMS test data\xe2\x80\x9d between ELL students and native speakers, <em>id.</em>, at 1170, but any such comparison must take into account other variables that may explain the gap.  In any event, the EEOA requires \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d to remove language barriers, \xc2\xa71703(f), not the equalization of results between native and nonnative speakers on tests administered in English\xe2\x80\x94a worthy goal, to be sure, but one that may be exceedingly difficult to achieve, especially for older ELL students.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also referred to the subpar performance of Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 high schools.  There is no doubt that Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 high schools represent an area of weakness, but the District Court made insufficient factual findings to support a conclusion that the high schools\xe2\x80\x99 problems stem from a failure to take \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action,\xe2\x80\x9d and constitute a violation of the EEOA.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The EEOA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d requirement grants States broad latitude to design, fund, and implement ELL programs that suit local needs and account for local conditions.  A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL students.</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A fourth potentially important change is an overall increase in the education funding available in Nogales.  The original declaratory judgment order noted five sources of funding that collectively financed education in the State: (1) the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbase level\xe2\x80\x9d funding, (2) ELL incremental funding, (3) federal grants, (4) regular district and county taxes, and (5) special voter-approved district and county taxes called \xe2\x80\x9coverrides.\xe2\x80\x9d  172 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1227.  All five sources have notably increased since 2000.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Notwithstanding these increases, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim that overall education funds were sufficient to support EEOA-compliant programming in Nogales.  The court reasoned that diverting base-level education funds would necessarily hurt other state educational programs, and was not, therefore, an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98appropriate\xe2\x80\x99 step.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>,</em> at 1171.  In so doing, it foreclosed the possibility that petitioners could establish changed circumstances warranting relief through an overall increase in education funding available in Nogales.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This was clear legal error.  As we have noted, the EEOA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d requirement does not necessarily require any particular level of funding, and to the extent that funding is relevant, the EEOA certainly does not require that the money come from any particular source.  In addition, the EEOA plainly does not give the federal courts the authority to judge whether a State or a school district is providing \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d instruction in other subjects.  That remains the province of the States and the local schools.  It is unfortunate if a school, in order to fund ELL programs, must divert money from other worthwhile programs, but such decisions fall outside the scope of the EEOA.  Accordingly, the analysis of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Rule 60(b)(5) motion should evaluate whether the State\xe2\x80\x99s budget for general education funding, in addition to any local revenues,[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] is currently supporting EEOA-compliant ELL programming in Nogales.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the lower courts engaged in an inadequate Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, and because the District Court failed to make up-to-date factual findings, the analysis of the lower courts was incomplete and inadequate with respect to all of the changed circumstances just noted.  These changes are critical to a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, however, as they may establish that Nogales is no longer in violation of the EEOA and, to the contrary, is taking \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d to remove language barriers in its schools.   If this is the case, continued enforcement of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s original order is inequitable within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5), and relief is warranted.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn, finally, to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s entry of statewide relief.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  The Nogales district, which is situated along the Mexican border, is one of 239 school districts in the State of Arizona.  Nogales students make up about one-half of one per cent of the entire State\xe2\x80\x99s school population.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The record contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district other than Nogales failed (much less continues to fail) to provide equal educational opportunities to ELL students.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93294, pp. 177a\xe2\x80\x93178a.  Nor have respondents explained how the EEOA could justify a statewide injunction when the only violation claimed or proven was limited to a single district.  See <em>Jenkins</em>, 515 U. S., at 89\xe2\x80\x9390; <em>Milliken</em>, 433 U. S., at 280.  It is not even clear that the District Court had jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction when it is not apparent that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94a class of Nogales students and their parents\xe2\x80\x94had standing to seek such relief.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only explanation proffered for the entry of statewide relief was based on an interpretation of the Arizona Constitution.  We are told that the former attorney general<font b="1"> \xe2\x80\x9caffirmatively urged a statewide remedy because a \xe2\x80\x98Nogales only\xe2\x80\x99 remedy would run afoul of the Arizona Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of \xe2\x80\x98a general and uniform public school system.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Flores et\xc2\xa0al. 38 (quoting Ariz. Const., Art. 11, \xc2\xa71(A) (some internal quotation marks omitted)).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This concern did not provide a valid basis for a statewide <em>federal</em> injunction.  If the state attorney general believed that a federal injunction requiring increased ELL spending in one district necessitated, as a matter of state law, a similar increase in every other district in the State, the attorney general could have taken the matter to the state legislature or the state courts.  But the attorney general did not do so.  Even if she had, it is not clear what the result would have been.  It is a question of state law, to be determined by state authorities, whether the equal funding provision of the Arizona Constitution would require a statewide funding increase to match Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 ELL funding, or would leave Nogales as a federally compelled exception.  By failing to recognize this, and by entering a statewide injunction that intruded deeply into the State\xe2\x80\x99s budgetary processes based solely on the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of state law, the District Court obscured accountability for the drastic remedy that it entered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When it is unclear whether an onerous obligation is the work of the Federal or State Government, accountability is diminished.  See <em>New York </em>v<em>. United States, </em>505 U. S.<em> </em>144, 169 (1992).  Here, the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly prevent[ed] the citizens of the State from addressing the issue [of statewide relief] through the processes provided by the State\xe2\x80\x99s constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hawaii</em> v. <em>Office of Hawaiian Affairs</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 12).  Assuming that petitioners, on remand, press their objection to the statewide extension of the remedy, the District Court should vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales unless the court concludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA on a statewide basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no question that the goal of the EEOA\xe2\x80\x94overcoming language barriers\xe2\x80\x94is a vitally important one, and our decision will not in any way undermine efforts to achieve that goal.  If petitioners are ultimately granted relief from the judgment, it will be because they have shown that the Nogales School District is doing exactly what this statute requires\xe2\x80\x94taking \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d to teach English to students who grew up speaking another language.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the cases for the District Court to determine whether, in accordance with the standards set out in this opinion, petitioners should be granted relief from the judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We have previously held that Congress may validly abrogate the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity only by doing so (1) unequivocally and (2) pursuant to certain valid grants of constitutional authority.

With respect to the second requirement, we have held that statutes enacted pursuant to \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment must provide a remedy that is \xe2\x80\x9ccongruent and proportional\xe2\x80\x9d to the injury that Congress intended to address.  See <em>City of Boerne</em> v. <em>Flores</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/507/index.html">521 U. S. 507</a>, 520 (1997).  Prior to <em>City of Boerne</em>, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the EEOA, which was enacted pursuant to \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71702(a)(1), (b), validly abrogates the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity.

That issue is not before us in these cases.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We do not agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s standing is limited\xe2\x80\x9d to seeking vacatur of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders \xe2\x80\x9conly as they run against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1165.  Had the superintendent sought relief based on satisfaction of the judgment, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion might have been correct.  But as discussed <em>infra, </em>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Rule 60(b)(5) claim is not based on satisfaction of the judgment.  Their claim is that continued enforcement of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders would be inequitable.  This claim implicates the orders in their entirety, and not solely as they run against the superintendent.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent is quite wrong in contending that these are not institutional reform cases because they involve a statutory, rather than a constitutional claim, and because the orders of the District Court do not micromanage the day-to-day operation of the schools.  <em>Post</em>, at 26 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.).  For nearly a decade, the orders of a federal district court have substantially restricted the ability of the State of Arizona to make basic decisions regarding educational policy, appropriations, and budget priorities.  The record strongly suggests that some state officials have welcomed the involvement of the federal court as a means of achieving appropriations objectives that could not be achieved through the ordinary democratic process.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Because of these features, these cases implicate all of the unique features and risks of institutional reform litigation.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent conveniently dismisses the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 statements  by characterizing any error that exists as \xe2\x80\x9cone of tone, not of law,\xe2\x80\x9d and by characterizing our discussion as reading them out of context.  <em>Post</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  But we do read these statements in context\xe2\x80\x94in the context of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 overall treatment of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Rule 60(b)(5) arguments\xe2\x80\x94and it is apparent that they accurately reflect the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 excessively narrow understanding of the role of Rule 60(b)(5).</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This does not mean, as the dissent misleadingly suggests, see <em>post</em>, at 22, that we are faulting the Court of Appeals for declining to decide whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s original order was correct in the first place.  On the contrary, as we state explicitly in the paragraph following this statement, our criticism is that the Court of Appeals did not engage in the changed-circumstances inquiry prescribed by <em>Rufo</em> v. <em>Inmates of Suffolk County Jail</em>, 502 U.

As the Court of Appeals itself recognized, NCLB does not provide a private right of action.  See 516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1175.  \xe2\x80\x9cWithout [statutory intent], a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html">532 U.

The first\xe2\x80\x94<em>Castaneda</em> v. <em>Pickard</em>, 648 F.\xc2\xa02d 989 (CA5 1981)\xe2\x80\x94sets out a three-part test for \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under that test, a State must (1) formulate a sound English language instruction educational plan, (2) implement that plan, and (3) achieve adequate results.  See <em>id</em>., at 1009\xe2\x80\x931010.  Whether or not this test provides much concrete guidance regarding the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action,\xe2\x80\x9d the test does not focus on incremental funding or on the provision of resources more generally.</p>\n<p>\n\nThe second source cited by the dissent\xe2\x80\x94curiously\xe2\x80\x94is a speech given by President Nixon in which he urged prompt action by Congress on legislation imposing a moratorium on new busing orders and on the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1972.  See <em>post</em>, at 13 (citing Address to the Nation on Equal Educational Opportunity and Busing, 8 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 590, 591 (1972)).

The judgment held that the State of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s plan for funding its English Language Learner program was arbitrary, and therefore the State had failed to take \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its\xe2\x80\x9d Spanish-speaking public school students \xe2\x80\x9cin its instructional programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U.

The State of Arizona, the Arizona Board of Education, and the original plaintiffs in the case (representing students from Nogales, Arizona) opposed the superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 60(b)(5) motion.  They are respondents here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court, after taking evidence and holding eight days of hearings, considered all the changed circumstances that the parties called to its attention.  The court concluded that some relevant \xe2\x80\x9cchanges\xe2\x80\x9d had taken place.  But the court ultimately found those changes insufficient to warrant setting aside the original judgment.  The Court of Appeals, in a carefully reasoned 41-page opinion, affirmed that district court determination.  This Court now sets the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision aside.  And it does so, it says, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe lower courts focused excessively on the narrow question of the adequacy of the State\xe2\x80\x99s incremental funding for [English-learning] instruction instead of <em>fairly considering </em>the broader question, whether, as a result of important changes during the intervening years, the State was fulfilling its obligation\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act \xe2\x80\x9cby other means.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaches its ultimate conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that the lower courts did not \xe2\x80\x9c<em>fairly consider</em>\xe2\x80\x9d the changed circumstances\xe2\x80\x94in a complicated way.  It begins by placing this case in a category it calls \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  It then sets forth special \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform litigation\xe2\x80\x9d standards applicable when courts are asked to modify judgments and decrees entered in such cases.  It applies those standards, and finds that the lower courts committed error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I disagree with the Court for several reasons.  For one thing, the \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform\xe2\x80\x9d label does not easily fit this case.  For another, the review standards the Court enunciates for \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform\xe2\x80\x9d cases are incomplete and, insofar as the Court applies those standards here, they effectively distort Rule 60(b)(5)\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.  Finally, my own review of the record convinces me that the Court is wrong regardless.  <em>The lower courts did \xe2\x80\x9cfairly consider\xe2\x80\x9d every change in circumstances that the parties called to their attention.  </em>The record more than adequately supports this conclusion.  In a word, I fear that the Court misapplies an inappropriate procedural framework, reaching a result that neither the record nor the law adequately supports.  In doing so, it risks denying schoolchildren the English-learning instruction necessary \xe2\x80\x9cto overcome language barriers that impede\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9cequal participation.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71703(f).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand my disagreement with the Court, it is unfortunately necessary to examine the record at length and in detail.  I must initially focus upon the Court\xe2\x80\x99s basic criticism of the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 analysis, namely that the lower courts somehow lost sight of the forest for the trees.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, those courts\xe2\x80\x94as well as this dissent\xe2\x80\x94wrongly focused upon a subsidiary matter, \xe2\x80\x9cincremental\xe2\x80\x9d English-learning program \xe2\x80\x9cfunding,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than the basic matter, whether \xe2\x80\x9cchanges\xe2\x80\x9d had cured, or had come close to curing, the violation of federal law that underlay the original judgment.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, it is as if a district court, faced with a motion to dissolve a school desegregation decree, focused only upon the school district\xe2\x80\x99s failure to purchase 50 decree-required school buses, instead of discussing the basic question, whether the schools had become integrated without need for those 50 buses.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus the Court writes that the lower courts focused so heavily on the original decree\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cincremental funding\xe2\x80\x9d requirement that they failed to ask whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe State was fulfilling its obligation under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law \xe2\x80\x9cby other means.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  And the Court frequently criticizes the Court of Appeals for having \xe2\x80\x9cfocused almost exclusively on the sufficiency of incremental funding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15; for \xe2\x80\x9cconfining the scope of its analysis to\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cincremental funding requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16; for having \xe2\x80\x9casked only whether changed circumstances affected [English-learning] funding and, more specifically \xe2\x80\xa6 incremental funding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17; for inquiring only \xe2\x80\x9cinto whether the deficiency in \xe2\x80\xa6 incremental funding that the District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> and (in case the reader has not yet gotten the point) for \xe2\x80\x9cfocusing so intensively on Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s incremental \xe2\x80\xa6 funding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante.</em>, at 18.  The Court adds that the District Court too was wrong to have \xe2\x80\x9casked only whether petitioners had satisfied the original declaratory judgment order through increased incremental funding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem with this basic criticism is that the State\xe2\x80\x99s provision of adequate resources to its English-learning students, <em>i.e.</em>, what the Court refers to as \xe2\x80\x9cincremental funding,\xe2\x80\x9d has always been the basic contested issue in this case.  That is why the lower courts continuously focused attention directly upon it.  In the context of this case they looked directly at the forest, not the trees.  To return to the school desegregation example, the court focused upon the heart of the matter, the degree of integration, and not upon the number of buses the school district had purchased.  A description of the statutory context and the history of this case makes clear that the Court cannot sensibly drive a wedge (as it wishes to do) between what it calls the \xe2\x80\x9cincremental funding\xe2\x80\x9d issue and the uncured failure to comply with the requirements of federal law.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lawsuit filed in this case charged a violation of subsection (f) of \xc2\xa7204 of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 515, 20 U.

In 1992, they filed the present lawsuit against the State of Arizona, its Board of Education, and the superintendent, claiming that the State had violated subsection (f), not by failing to adopt proper English-learning programs, but by failing \xe2\x80\x9cto provide <em>financial and other resources </em>necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to make those programs a practical reality for Spanish-speaking students.

In particular, they said, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he cost\xe2\x80\x9d of programs that would allow those students to learn effectively, say, to read English at a proficient level, \xe2\x80\x9cfar exceeds the only financial assistance the State theoretically provides.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 7, \xc2\xb620(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The students sought a declaration that the State had \xe2\x80\x9csystematically \xe2\x80\xa6 failed or refused to provide fiscal as well as other resources sufficient to enable\xe2\x80\x9d the Nogales School District and other \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated [school] districts\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish and maintain\xe2\x80\x9d successful programs for English learners.  <em>Id.</em>, at 10, \xc2\xb628.  And they sought an appropriate injunction requiring the provision of such resources.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state defendants answered the complaint.  And after resolving disagreements on various subsidiary issues, see <em>id</em>., at 19\xe2\x80\x9330, the parties proceeded to trial on the remaining disputed issue in the case, namely whether the State and its education authorities \xe2\x80\x9c<em>adequately fund and oversee</em>\xe2\x80\x9d their English-learning program.  172 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1225, 1226 (Ariz. 2000) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In January 2000, after a three-day bench trial, the District Court made 64 specific factual findings, including the following:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1) The State assumes that its school districts need (and will obtain from local and statewide sources) funding equal to a designated \xe2\x80\x9cbase level amount\xe2\x80\x9d per child\xe2\x80\x94reflecting the funding required to educate a \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d student, 516 F.\xc2\xa03d 1140, 1147 (CA9 2008)\xe2\x80\x94along with an additional amount needed to educate each child with special educational needs, including those children who are not yet proficient in English.  172 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1227\xe2\x80\x931228.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2) In the year 2000, the \xe2\x80\x9cbase level amount\xe2\x80\x9d the State assumed necessary to educate a typical child amounted to roughly $3,174 (in year 2000 dollars).  <em>Id.</em>, at 1227.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3) A cost study conducted by the State in 1988 showed that, at that time, English-learning programming cost school districts an additional $424 per English-learning child.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1228.  Adjusted for inflation to the year 2000, the extra cost per student of the State\xe2\x80\x99s English-learning program was $617 per English-learning child.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4) In the year 2000, the State\xe2\x80\x99s funding formula provided school districts with only $150 to pay for the $617 in extra costs per child that the State assumed were needed to pay for its English-learning program.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1229.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record contains no suggestion that Nogales, or any other school district, could readily turn anywhere but to the State to find the $467 per-student difference between the amount the State assumed was needed and the amount that it made available.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1230.  Nor does the record contain any suggestion that Nogales or any other school district could have covered additional costs by redistributing \xe2\x80\x9cbase level,\xe2\x80\x9d typical-child funding it received.  (In the year 2000 Arizona, compared with other States, provided the third-lowest amount of funding per child.  U. S.

The court added that the State\xe2\x80\x99s provision of financial resources was \xe2\x80\x9cnot reasonably calculated to effectively implement\xe2\x80\x9d the English-learning program chosen by the State.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Hence, the State had failed to take \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d to teach English to non-English-speaking students, in that it had failed (in <em>Castaneda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s words) to provide the \xe2\x80\x9cpractices, resources, and personnel\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to make its chosen educational theory a \xe2\x80\x9creality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1238\xe2\x80\x931239; see also \xc2\xa71703(f); <em>Castaneda</em>, 648 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1010.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court consequently entered judgment in the students\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  The court later entered injunctions (1) requiring the State to \xe2\x80\x9cprepare a cost study to establish the proper appropriation to effectively implement\xe2\x80\x9d the State\xe2\x80\x99s own English-learning program, and (2) requiring the State to develop a funding mechanism that would bear <em>some</em> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>reasonabl[e]</em>\xe2\x80\x9d or<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c<em>rational</em> relatio[n] to the actual funding needed\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that non-English-speaking students would \xe2\x80\x9cachieve mastery\xe2\x80\x9d of the English language.  See, <em>e.g., </em>160 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1043, 1045, 1047 (Ariz. 2000); No. CV\xe2\x80\x9392\xe2\x80\x93596\xe2\x80\x93TUCACM, 2001 WL 1028369, *2 (D. Ariz., June 25, 2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State neither appealed nor complied with the 2000 declaratory judgment or any of the injunctive orders.  When, during the next few years, the State failed to produce either a study of the type ordered or a funding program rationally related to need for financial resources, the court imposed a series of fines upon the State designed to lead the State to comply with its orders.  405 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1112, 1120 (Ariz. 2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In early 2006, the state legislature began to consider HB 2064, a bill that, among other things, provided for the creation of a \xe2\x80\x9cTask Force\xe2\x80\x9d charged to develop \xe2\x80\x9ccost-efficient\xe2\x80\x9d methods for teaching English.  The bill would also increase the appropriation for teaching English to students who needed to learn it (though it prohibited the spending of any increase upon any particular student for more than two years).  In March 2006, the petitioners here (the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction, the President of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Senate, and the Speaker of its House of Representatives) asked the District Court (1) to consider whether HB 2064, as enacted, would satisfy its judgment and injunctive orders, (2) to forgive the contempt fine liability that the State had accrued, and (3) to dissolve the injunctive orders and grant relief from the 2000 judgment.

The moving parties asserted that \xe2\x80\x9cArizona has poured money\xe2\x80\x9d into Nogales as a result of various funding changes, <em>id.</em>, at 5.  They pointed to a 0.6% addition to the state sales tax; the dedication of a portion of the State\xe2\x80\x99s share of Indian gaming proceeds to Arizona school districts; to the increase in federal funding since 2001; and to HB 2064\xe2\x80\x99s increase in state-provided funding.  <em>Id.</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x938.  The parties said that, in light of these \xe2\x80\x9cdramatic\xe2\x80\x9d additions to the funding available for education in Arizona, the court should \xe2\x80\x9cdeclare the judgment and orders satisfied, and \xe2\x80\xa6 relieve defendants from the judgment and orders under Rule 60(b)(5).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 2006, the District Court held that HB 2064 by itself did not adequately satisfy the court\xe2\x80\x99s orders; it denied the request to forgive the fines; but it did not decide the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Rule 60(b)(5) motion.  In August 2006, the Court of Appeals ordered the District Court to decide that motion, and, in particular, to consider whether changes to \xe2\x80\x9cthe landscape of educational funding \xe2\x80\xa6 required modification of the original court order or otherwise had a bearing on the appropriate remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  204 Fed. Appx. 580, 582 (CA9 2006) (memorandum).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In January 2007, the District Court held a hearing that lasted eight days and produced an evidentiary transcript of 1,684 pages.  The hearing focused on the changes that the petitioners said had occurred and justified setting aside the original judgment.  The petitioners pointed to three sets of changed circumstances\xe2\x80\x94all related to \xe2\x80\x9cpractices, resources, and personnel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which, in their view, showed that the judgment and the related orders were no longer necessary.  They argued that the changes had brought the State into compliance with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  The three sets of changes consisted of (1) increases in the amount of funding available to Arizona school districts; (2) changes in the method of English-learning instruction; and (3) changes in the administration of the Nogales school district.  These changes, the petitioners said, had cured the resource-linked deficiencies that were noted in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 judgment, 172 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1239, and rendered enforcement of the judgment and related orders unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on the hearing and the briefs, the District Court again found that HB 2064 by itself did not cure the \xe2\x80\x9cresource\xe2\x80\x9d problem; it found that all of the changes, resource-related and otherwise, including the new teaching and administrative methods, taken together, were not sufficient to warrant setting aside the judgment or the injunctive orders; and it denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion for relief.  480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1157, 1164\xe2\x80\x931167 (Ariz. 2007).  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions, setting forth its reasons, as I have said, in a lengthy and detailed opinion.  The state superintendent, along with the Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and the President of the Arizona Senate, sought certiorari, and we granted the petition.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Five conclusions follow from the description of the case I have just set forth.  First, the Rule 60(b)(5) \xe2\x80\x9cchanges\xe2\x80\x9d upon which the District Court focused included the \xe2\x80\x9cchanged teaching methods\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cchanged administrative systems\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court criticizes the District Court for ignoring.  Compare<em> ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9325, 29\xe2\x80\x9331, with Parts III\xe2\x80\x93A, III\xe2\x80\x93C, <em>infra</em>.  Those changes were, in the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view, related to the \xe2\x80\x9cfunding\xe2\x80\x9d issue, for those changes reduced the need for increased funding.  See Motion to Purge, p.\xc2\xa07.  I concede that the majority of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings focused on funding, see <em>ante</em>, at 20.  But where is the <em>legal error</em>, given that the opinion clearly shows that the District Court considered, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98focus[ed]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d upon, and wrote about <em>all</em> the matters petitioners raised?  <em>Ibid.;</em> 480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1160\xe2\x80\x931161. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the District Court and the Court of Appeals focused more heavily upon \xe2\x80\x9cincremental funding\xe2\x80\x9d costs, see <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9320, for the <em>reason</em> that the State\xe2\x80\x99s provision for those costs\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, its provision of the resources necessary to run an adequate English-learning program\xe2\x80\x94was the basic contested issue at the 2000 trial and the sole basis for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of a statutory violation.  172 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1226.  That is, the sole subsection (f) dispute in the case originally was whether the State provides the \xe2\x80\x9cpractices, resources, and personnel necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to implement its English-learning program.  <em>Castaneda</em>, 648 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1010.  To be sure, as the Court points out, changes other than to the State\xe2\x80\x99s funding system could demonstrate that Nogales was receiving the necessary resources.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9325.  But given the centrality of \xe2\x80\x9cresources\xe2\x80\x9d to the case, it is hardly surprising that the courts below scrutinized the State\xe2\x80\x99s provision of \xe2\x80\x9cincremental funding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>but without ignoring</em> the other related changes to which petitioners pointed, such as changes in teaching methods and administration (all of which the District Court rejected as insufficient).  See Part III, <em>infra</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the type of issue upon which the District Court and Court of Appeals focused lies at the heart of the statutory demand for equal educational opportunity.  A State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide the \xe2\x80\x9cpractices, resources, and personnel necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to eliminate the educational burden that accompanies a child\xe2\x80\x99s inability to speak English is precisely what the statute forbids.  See <em>Castaneda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1010 (emphasizing the importance of providing \xe2\x80\x9cresources\xe2\x80\x9d); Nixon Address 593 (referring to the importance of providing \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial support\xe2\x80\x9d).  And no one in this case suggests there is no need for those resources, <em>e.g.</em>, that there are no extra costs associated with English-learning education irrespective of the teaching method used.  English-learning students, after all, not only require the instruction in \xe2\x80\x9cacademic content areas\xe2\x80\x9d like math and science that \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d students require, but they also need to increase their proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing English.  This language-acquisition instruction requires particular textbooks and other instructional materials, teachers trained in the school\xe2\x80\x99s chosen method for teaching English, special assessment tests, and tutoring and other individualized instruction\xe2\x80\x94all of which resources cost money.  Brief for Tucson Unified School District et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 10\xe2\x80\x9313; Structured English Immersion Models of the Arizona English Language Learners Task Force, http://www.ade.state.az.us/ ELLTaskForce/\n2008/SEIModels05\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x9308.pdf (describing Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that English-learning students receive four hours of language-acquisition instruction per day from specially trained teachers using designated English-learning materials); Imazeki, Assessing the Costs of Adequacy in California Public Schools, 3 Educ. Fin. &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y 90, 100 (2008) (estimating that English-learning students require 74% more resources than typical students).  That is why the petitioners, opposed as they are to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and orders, admitted to the District Court that English learners \xe2\x80\x9cneed extra help and that costs extra money.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1161.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, <em>the \xe2\x80\x9cresource\xe2\x80\x9d issue</em> that the District Court focused upon when it decided the Rule 60(b)(5) motion, and <em>the statutory subsection (f) issue</em> that lies at the heart of the court\xe2\x80\x99s original judgment (and the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 original complaint) are not <em>different </em>issues, as the Court claims.  See <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  Rather in all essential respects <em>they are one and the same issue.</em>  In focusing upon the one, the District Court and Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other.  For all practical purposes, changes that would have proved sufficient to show the statutory violation cured would have proved sufficient to warrant setting aside the original judgment and decrees, and vice versa.  And in context, judges and parties alike were fully aware of the modification/violation relationship.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Intervenor-Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Closing Argument Memorandum, No. CV\xe2\x80\x9392\xe2\x80\x93596\xe2\x80\x93TUC\xe2\x80\x93RCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt. No. 631, p. 1 (arguing that factual changes had led to \xe2\x80\x9csatisf[action]\xe2\x80\x9d of the judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To say, as the Court does, that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]unding is merely one tool that may be employed to achieve the statutory objective,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 22, while true, is beside the point.  Of course, a State might violate the Act in other ways.  But one way in which a State can violate the Act is to fail to provide necessary \xe2\x80\x9cpractices, resources, and personnel.\xe2\x80\x9d  And that is the way the District Court found that the State had violated the Act here.  Thus, whatever might be true of some other case, in this case the failure to provide adequate resources and the underlying subsection (f) violation were one and the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, the Court is wrong when it suggests that the District Court ordered \xe2\x80\x9cincreased incremental funding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19; when it faults the District Court for effectively \xe2\x80\x9cdictating state or local budget priorities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11; when it claims that state officials welcomed the result \xe2\x80\x9cas a means of achieving appropriations objectives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa03; and when it implies that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders required the State to provide a \xe2\x80\x9cparticular level of funding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 33.  The District Court ordered the State to produce a plan that set forth a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crational\xe2\x80\x9d relationship between the needs of English-learning students and the resources provided to them.  The orders expressed no view about what <em>kind</em> of English-learning program the State should use.  Nor did the orders say anything about the <em>amount </em>of \xe2\x80\x9cappropriations\xe2\x80\x9d that the State must provide, <em>ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa03, or about any \xe2\x80\x9cparticular funding mechanism,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18, that the State was obligated to create.  Rather, the District Court left it up to the State \xe2\x80\x9cto recommend [to the legislature] the level of funding necessary to support the programs that it determined to be the most effective.\xe2\x80\x9d  160 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1044.  It ordered no more than that the State (<em>whatever</em> kind of program it decided to use) must see that the chosen program benefits from a funding system that is not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary and capricious,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead \xe2\x80\x9cbear[s] a rational relationship\xe2\x80\x9d to the resources needed to implement the State\xe2\x80\x99s method.  No. CV\xe2\x80\x9392\xe2\x80\x93596\xe2\x80\x93TUCACM, 2001 WL 1028369, *2.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Part I shows that there is nothing suspicious or unusual or unlawful about the lower courts having focused primarily upon changes related to the resources Arizona would devote to English-learning education (while also taking account of <em>all</em> the changes the petitioners raised).  Thus the Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>basic</em> criticism of the lower court decisions is without foundation.  I turn next to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the standards of review the Court finds applicable to \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform\xe2\x80\x9d litigation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand my concern about the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of standards, it is important to keep in mind the well-known standards that ordinarily govern the evaluation of Rule 60(b)(5) motions.  The Rule by its terms permits modification of a judgment or order (1) when \xe2\x80\x9cthe judgment has been satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) \xe2\x80\x9creleased,\xe2\x80\x9d or (3) \xe2\x80\x9cdischarged;\xe2\x80\x9d when the judgment or order (4) \xe2\x80\x9cis based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated;\xe2\x80\x9d or (5) \xe2\x80\x9capplying [the judgment] prospectively is no longer equitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  No one can claim that the second, third, or fourth grounds are applicable here.  The relevant judgment and orders have not been released or discharged; nor is there any relevant earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated.  Thus the only Rule 60(b)(5) questions are whether the judgment and orders have been satisfied, or, if not, whether their continued application is \xe2\x80\x9cequitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, as I have explained, in context these come down to the same question: Is continued enforcement inequitable because the defendants have satisfied the 2000 declaratory judgment or at least have come close to doing so, and, given that degree of satisfaction, would it work unnecessary harm to continue the judgment in effect?  See <em>supra</em>, at 14.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To show sufficient inequity to warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief, a party must show that \xe2\x80\x9ca significant change either in factual conditions or in law\xe2\x80\x9d renders continued enforcement of the judgment or order \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental to the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rufo</em>, 502 U. S., at 384.  The party can claim that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statutory or decisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 388; see also <em>Railway Employees</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/364/642/index.html">364 U. S. 642</a>, 651 (1961).  Or the party can claim that relevant facts have changed to the point where continued enforcement of the judgment, order, or decree as written would work, say, disproportionately serious harm.  See <em>Rufo</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 384 (modification may be appropriate when changed circumstances make enforcement \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially more onerous\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunworkable because of unforeseen obstacles\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower courts, that <em>Rufo</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cflexible standard\xe2\x80\x9d for relief applies.  The Court also acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower courts, that this \xe2\x80\x9cflexible standard\xe2\x80\x9d does not itself define the inquiry a court passing on a Rule 60(b)(5) motion must make.  To give content to this standard, the Court refers to <em>Milliken</em> v. <em>Bradley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/267/index.html">433 U. S. 267</a>, 282 (1977), in which this Court said that a decree cannot seek to \xe2\x80\x9celiminat[e] a condition that does not violate\xe2\x80\x9d federal law or \xe2\x80\x9cflow from such a violation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, and to <em>Frew</em> v. <em>Hawkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/431/index.html">540 U. S. 431</a>, 441 (2004), in which this Court said that a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>consent decree</em>\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9climited to reasonable and necessary implementations of federal law\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  The Court adds that in an \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform litigation\xe2\x80\x9d case, a court must also take account of the need not to maintain decrees in effect for too long a time, <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, the need to take account of \xe2\x80\x9csensitive federalism concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11, and the need to take care lest \xe2\x80\x9cconsent decrees\xe2\x80\x9d reflect collusion between private plaintiffs and state defendants at the expense of the legislative process, <em>ante</em>, at 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking these cases and considerations together, the majority says the critical question for the lower courts is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether ongoing enforcement of the original order was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law (here [subsection (f)]).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  If not\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, if a current violation of federal law cannot be detected\xe2\x80\x94then \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98responsibility for discharging the State\xe2\x80\x99s obligations [must be] returned promptly to the State.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One problem with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of its standards is that insofar as the considerations it mentions are widely accepted, the lower courts fully acknowledged and followed them.  The decisions below, like most Rule 60(b)(5) decisions, reflect the basic factors the Court mentions.  The lower court opinions indicate an awareness of the fact that equitable decrees are subject to a \xe2\x80\x9cflexible standard\xe2\x80\x9d permitting modification when circumstances, factual or legal, change significantly.  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1163; 480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1165 (citing <em>Rufo</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 383).  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <em>Castaneda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>interpretation of subsection (f), 648 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1009, along with its efforts to provide state officials wide discretionary authority (about the level of funding and the kind of funding plan), show considerable sensitivity to \xe2\x80\x9cfederalism concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d  And given the many years (at least seven) of state non-compliance, it is difficult to see how the decree can have remained in place too long.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is the decree at issue here a \xe2\x80\x9cconsent decree\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is normally understood in the institutional litigation context.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9313.  The State did consent to a few peripheral matters that have nothing to do with the present appeal.  App. 19\xe2\x80\x9330.  But the State vigorously contested the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 basic original claim, namely, that the State failed to take resource-related \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d within the terms of subsection (f).  The State presented proofs and evidence to the District Court designed to show that no violation of federal law had occurred, and it opposed entry of the original judgment and every subsequent injunctive order, save the relief sought by petitioners here.  I can find no evidence, beyond the Court\xe2\x80\x99s speculation, showing that some state officials have \xe2\x80\x9cwelcomed\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cas a means of achieving appropriations objectives that could not [otherwise] be achieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa03.  But even were that so, why would such a fact matter here more than in any other case in which some state employees believe a litigant who sues the State is right?  I concede that the State did not appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s original order or the ensuing injunctions.  But the fact that litigants refrain from appealing does not turn a litigated judgment into a \xe2\x80\x9cconsent decree.\xe2\x80\x9d  At least, I have never before heard that term so used.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of standards raises a far more serious problem.  In addition to the standards I have discussed, <em>supra</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, our precedents recognize <em>other,</em> here outcome-determinative, hornbook principles that apply when a court evaluates a Rule 60(b)(5) motion.   The Court omits some of them.  It mentions but fails to apply others.  As a result, I am uncertain, and perhaps others will be uncertain, whether the Court has set forth a correct and workable method for analyzing a Rule 60(b)(5) motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, a basic principle of law that the Court does not mention\xe2\x80\x94a principle applicable in this case as in others\xe2\x80\x94is that, in the absence of special circumstances (<em>e.g.</em>, plain error), a judge need not consider issues or factors that the parties themselves do not raise.  That principle of law is longstanding, it is reflected in Blackstone, and it perhaps comes from yet an earlier age.  3 Commentaries on the Laws of England 455 (1768) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is a practice unknown to our law\xe2\x80\x9d when examining the decree of an inferior court, \xe2\x80\x9cto examine the justice of the \xe2\x80\xa6 decree by evidence that was never produced below\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Clements</em> v. <em>Macheboeuf</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/418/index.html">92 U. S. 418</a>, 425 (1876) (\xe2\x80\x9cMatters not assigned for error will not be examined\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Savage</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/382/index.html">92 U. S. 382</a>, 388 (1876) (where a party with the \xe2\x80\x9cburden \xe2\x80\xa6 to establish\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccharge \xe2\x80\xa6 fails to introduce any \xe2\x80\xa6 evidence to support it, the presumption is that the charge is without any foundation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>McCoy</em> v. <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Technology</em>, 950 F.\xc2\xa02d 13, 22 (CA1 1991) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in the district court cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9c[o]verburdened trial judges cannot be expected to be mind readers\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we have recognized, it would be difficult to operate an adversary system of justice without applying such a principle.  See <em>Duignan</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/274/195/index.html">274 U. S. 195</a>, 200 (1927).  But the majority repeatedly considers precisely such claims.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 26\xe2\x80\x9329 (considering significant matters not raised below); <em>ante</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9336 (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, a hornbook Rule 60(b)(5) principle, which the Court mentions, <em>ante</em>, at 10, is that the party seeking relief from a judgment or order \xe2\x80\x9c<em>bears the burden</em> of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants\xe2\x80\x9d that relief.  <em>Rufo</em>, 502 U. S., at 383 (emphasis added); cf. <em>Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools</em> v. <em>Dowell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/237/index.html">498 U. S. 237</a>, 249 (1991) (party moving for relief from judgment must make a \xe2\x80\x9csufficient showing\xe2\x80\x9d of change in circumstances).  But the Court does not apply that principle.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 30\xe2\x80\x9331, and n. 22 (holding that movants potentially <em>win </em>because of <em>failure</em> of record to show that English-learning problems do <em>not </em>stem from causes other than funding); see also <em>ante</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327 (criticizing lower courts for failing to consider argument not made).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court ignores the well-established distinction between a Rule 60(b)(5) request to <em>modify</em> an order and a request to set an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside\xe2\x80\x94a distinction that this Court has previously emphasized.  Cf. <em>Rufo</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 389, n.\xc2\xa012 (emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not have before us the question whether the entire decree should be vacated\xe2\x80\x9d).  Courts normally do the latter only if the \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d seeking \xe2\x80\x9cto have\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cdecree set aside entirely\xe2\x80\x9d shows \xe2\x80\x9cthat the decree has served its purpose, and there is no longer any need for the injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 J. Moore et\xc2\xa0al., Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Practice \xc2\xa760.47 [2][c] (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Moore).  Instead of applying the distinction, the majority says that the Court of Appeals \xe2\x80\x9cstrayed\xe2\x80\x9d when it referred to situations in which changes justified setting an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98likely rare.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the Court says nothing about the well-established principle that a party moving under Rule 60(b)(5) for relief that amounts to having a \xe2\x80\x9cdecree set aside entirely\xe2\x80\x9d must show <em>both</em> (1) that the decree\xe2\x80\x99s objects have been \xe2\x80\x9cattained,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Frew</em>, 540 U. S., at 442, <em>and</em> (2) that it is unlikely, in the absence of the decree, that the unlawful acts it prohibited will again occur.  This Court so held in <em>Dowell</em>, a case in which state defendants sought relief from a school desegregation decree on the ground that the district was presently operating in compliance with the Equal Protection Clause.  The Court agreed with the defendants that \xe2\x80\x9ca finding by the District Court that the Oklahoma City School District was being operated in compliance with \xe2\x80\xa6 the Equal Protection Clause\xe2\x80\x9d was indeed relevant to the question whether relief was appropriate.  498 U. S., at 247.  But the Court added that, to show entitlement to relief, the defendants must <em>also</em> show that \xe2\x80\x9cit was unlikely that the [school board] would return to its former ways.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Only then would the \xe2\x80\x9cpurposes of the desegregation litigation ha[ve] been fully achieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The principle, as applicable here, simply underscores petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure to show that the \xe2\x80\x9cchanges\xe2\x80\x9d to which they pointed were sufficient to warrant entirely setting aside the original court judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, the majority mentions, but fails to apply, the basic Rule 60(b)(5) principle that a party cannot dispute the legal conclusions of the judgment from which relief is sought.  A party cannot use a Rule 60(b)(5) motion as a substitute for an appeal, say, by attacking the legal reasoning underlying the original judgment or by trying to show that the facts, as they were originally, did not then justify the order\xe2\x80\x99s issuance.  <em>Browder</em> v. <em>Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/257/index.html">434 U. S. 257</a>, 263, n. 7 (1978); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/106/index.html">286 U. S. 106</a>, 119 (1932) (party cannot claim that injunction could not lawfully have been applied \xe2\x80\x9cto the conditions that existed at its making\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor can a party require a court to retrace old legal ground, say, by re-making or rejustifying its original \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional decision every time an effort [is] made to enforce or modify\xe2\x80\x9d an order.  <em>Rufo</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 389\xe2\x80\x93390 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Frew</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 438 (rejecting argument that federal court lacks power to enforce an order \xe2\x80\x9cunless the court first identifies, at the enforcement stage, a violation of federal law\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the original judgment rested upon a finding that the State had failed to provide Nogales with adequate <em>funding</em> \xe2\x80\x9cresources,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Castaneda</em>, 648 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1010, in violation of subsection (f)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  How then can the Court fault the lower courts for first and foremost seeking to determine whether Arizona had developed a plan that would provide Nogales with adequate <em>funding</em> resources?  How can it criticize the lower courts for having \xe2\x80\x9cinsulated the policies embedded in the order \xe2\x80\xa6 from challenge and amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, for having failed to appreciate that \xe2\x80\x9cfunding is simply a means, not the end\xe2\x80\x9d of the statutory requirement, <em>ante</em>, at 18, and for having misperceived \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the obligation imposed by the\xe2\x80\x9d Act, <em>ante</em>, at 23?  When the Court criticizes the Court of Appeals for \xe2\x80\x9cmisperceiving \xe2\x80\xa6 the nature of the obligation imposed\xe2\x80\x9d by the Act, <em>ibid.</em>, when it second-guesses finding after finding of the District Court, see Part III, <em>infra</em>, when it early and often suggests that Arizona may well comply despite lack of a rational funding plan (and without discussing how the changes it mentions could show compliance), see <em>ante</em>, at 15, 18, what else is it doing but putting \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff [or] the court \xe2\x80\xa6 to the unnecessary burden of re-establishing what has once been decided\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Railway Employees</em>, 364 U. S., at 647.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sixth, the Court mentions, but fails to apply, the well-settled legal principle that appellate courts, including this Court, review district court denials of Rule 60(b) motions (of the kind before us) for abuse of discretion.  See <em>Browder</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 263, n.\xc2\xa07; <em>Railway Employees</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 648\xe2\x80\x93650.  A reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for that of the district court.  See <em>National Hockey League</em> v. <em>Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/639/index.html">427 U. S. 639</a>, 642 (1976) <em>(per curiam);</em> see also <em>Calderon</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/538/index.html">523 U. S. 538</a>, 567\xe2\x80\x93568 (1998) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] high degree of deference to the court exercising discretionary authority is the hallmark of [abuse of discretion] review\xe2\x80\x9d).  Particularly where, as here, entitlement to relief depends heavily upon fact-related determinations, the power to review the district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cought seldom to be called into action,\xe2\x80\x9d namely only in the rare instance where the Rule 60(b) standard \xe2\x80\x9cappears to have been misapprehended or grossly misapplied.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Universal Camera Corp.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/474/index.html">340 U. S. 474</a>, 490\xe2\x80\x93491 (1951).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s bare assertion that a court abuses its discretion when it fails to order warranted relief, <em>ante</em>, at 10, fails to account for the deference due to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have just described Rule 60(b)(5) standards that concern (1) the obligation (or lack of obligation) upon a court to take account of considerations the parties do not raise; (2) burdens of proof; (3) the distinction between setting aside and modifying a judgment; (4) the need to show that a decree\xe2\x80\x99s basic objectives have been attained; (5) the importance of not requiring relitigation of previously litigated matters; and (6) abuse of discretion review.   Does the Court intend to ignore one or more of these standards or to apply them differently in cases involving what it calls \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform litigation\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If so, the Court will find no support for its approach in the cases to which it refers, namely <em>Rufo</em>, <em>Milliken</em>, and <em>Frew</em>.  <em>Rufo</em> involved a motion to modify a complex court-monitor-supervised decree designed to prevent overcrowding in a local jail.  The Court stressed the fact that the modification did not involve setting aside the entire decree.  502 U. S., at 389, n.\xc2\xa012.  It made clear that the party seeking relief from an institutional injunction \xe2\x80\x9cbears the burden of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants\xe2\x80\x9d that relief.  <em>Id.</em>, at 383.  And it rejected the argument that a reviewing court must determine, in every case, whether an ongoing violation of federal law exists.  <em>Id.</em>, at 389, 390, and n.\xc2\xa012 (<em>refusing to require a new </em>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>constitutional decision every time an effort [is] made to enforce or modify</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em> a judgment or decree</em> (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Frew</em> addressed the question whether the Eleventh Amendment permits a federal district court to enforce a <em>consent</em> decree against state officials seeking to bring the State into compliance with federal law.  540 U. S., at 434\xe2\x80\x93435.  The Court unanimously held that it does; and in doing so, the Court rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that a federal court may only enforce such an order if it \xe2\x80\x9cfirst identifies \xe2\x80\xa6 a violation of federal law\xe2\x80\x9d existing at the time that enforcement is sought.  <em>Id.</em>, at 438.  Rather, the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98federal courts are not reduced to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d entering judgments or orders \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98and hoping for compliance,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 440, but rather retain the power to enforce judgments in order \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that \xe2\x80\xa6 the objects\xe2\x80\x9d of the court order are met, <em>id.</em>, at 442.  It also emphasized, like <em>Dowell</em>, that relief is warranted only when \xe2\x80\x9cthe objects of the decree have been attained.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 442.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What of <em>Milliken?</em> <em>Milliken</em> involved direct review (rather than a motion for relief) of a district court\xe2\x80\x99s order requiring the Detroit school system to implement a host of remedial programs, including counseling and special reading instruction, aimed at schoolchildren previously required to attend segregated schools.  433 U. S., at 269, 272.  The Court said that a court decree must aim at \xe2\x80\x9celiminating a condition\xe2\x80\x9d that violates federal law or which \xe2\x80\x9cflow[s] from\xe2\x80\x9d such a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 282.  And it unanimously found that the remedy at issue <em>was lawful</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases confirm the unfortunate fact that the Court has failed fully to apply the six essential principles that I have mentioned.  If the Court does not intend any such modifications of these traditional standards, then, as I shall show, it must affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision.  But if it does intend to modify them, as stated or in application, it now applies a new set of new rules that are <em>not</em> faithful to our cases and which will create the dangerous possibility that orders, judgments, and decrees long final or acquiesced in, will be unwarrantedly subject to perpetual challenge, offering defendants unjustifiable opportunities endlessly to relitigate underlying violations with the burden of proof imposed once again upon the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I recognize that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, to a degree, reflects one side of a scholarly debate about how courts should properly handle decrees in \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d Compare, in general, R. Sandler &amp; D. Schoenbrod, Democracy by Decree: What Happens When Courts Run Government (2003), with, <em>e.g.</em>, Chayes, The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1281, 1307\xe2\x80\x931309 (1976).  But whatever the merits of that debate, this case does not involve the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional litigation\xe2\x80\x9d that most commonly lies at its heart.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, M. Feeley &amp; E. Rubin, Judicial Policy Making and the Modern State: How the Courts Reformed America\xe2\x80\x99s Prisons (1998); but see <em>ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case does not involve schools, prisons, or mental hospitals that have failed to meet basic constitutional standards.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dowell</em>, 498 U. S., at 240\xe2\x80\x93241.  It does not involve a comprehensive judicial decree that governs the running of a major institution.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hutto</em> v. <em>Finney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/678/index.html">437 U. S. 678</a>, 683\xe2\x80\x93684 (1978).  It does not involve a highly detailed set of orders.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ramos</em> v. <em>Lamm</em>, 639 F.\xc2\xa02d 559, 585\xe2\x80\x93586 (CA10 1980).  It does not involve a special master charged with the task of supervising a complex decree that will gradually bring a large institution into compliance with the law.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ruiz</em> v. <em>Estelle</em>, 679 F.\xc2\xa02d 1115, 1160\xe2\x80\x931161 (CA5 1982).  Rather, it involves the more common complaint that a state or local government has failed to meet a federal statutory requirement.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Concilio de Salud Integral de Loiza, Inc.</em> v. <em>P\xc3\xa9rez-Perdomo</em>, 551 F.\xc2\xa03d 10, 16 (CA1 2008); <em>Association of Community Orgs. for Reform Now</em> v. <em>Edgar</em>, 56 F.\xc2\xa03d 791, 797\xe2\x80\x93798 (CA7 1995); <em>John B.</em> v. <em>Menke</em>, 176 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 786, 813\xe2\x80\x93814 (MD Tenn. 2001).  It involves a court imposition of a fine upon the State due to its lengthy failure to take steps to comply.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hook</em> v. <em>Arizona Dept. of Corrections</em>, 107 F.\xc2\xa03d 1397, 1404 (CA9 1997); <em>Alberti</em> v. <em>Klevenhagen</em>, 46 F.\xc2\xa03d 1347, 1360 (CA5 1995).  And it involves court orders that leave the State free to pursue the English-learning program of its choice while insisting only that the State come up with a funding plan that is rationally related to the program it chooses.  This case is more closely akin to <em>Goldberg</em> v. <em>Kelly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/254/index.html">397 U. S. 254</a> (1970) (in effect requiring legislation to fund welfare-related \xe2\x80\x9cdue process\xe2\x80\x9d hearings); cf. <em>id.</em>, at 277\xe2\x80\x93279 (Black, J., dissenting), than it is to the school busing cases that followed <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/483/index.html">347 U.

In the opinions below, I can find no misapplication of the legal standards relevant to this case.  To the contrary, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion is true to the record and fair to the decision of the District Court.  And the majority is wrong to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Court\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of the lower courts cannot rest upon what they did do, namely examine directly whether Arizona had produced a rational funding program, it must rest upon what it believes they did not do, namely adequately consider the other changes in English-learning instruction, administration, and the like to which petitioners referred.  Indeed, the Court must believe this, for it orders the lower courts, on remand, to conduct a \xe2\x80\x9cproper examination\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cfour important factual and legal changes that may warrant the granting of relief from the judgment:\xe2\x80\x9d (1) the \xe2\x80\x9cadoption of a new \xe2\x80\xa6 instructional methodology\xe2\x80\x9d for teaching English; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment\xe2\x80\x9d of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U.

The State\xe2\x80\x99s Director of English Acquisition, Irene Moreno, described the new method as \xe2\x80\x9cthe most effective\xe2\x80\x9d way to teach English.  Tr. 19 (Jan. 9, 2007).  An educational consultant, Rosalie Porter, agreed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 witnesses also described a new assessment test, the Arizona English Language Learner Assessment, <em>id.</em>, at 50\xe2\x80\x9351; they described new curricular models that would systematize instructional methods, <em>id.</em>, at 78; they explained that all teachers would eventually be required to obtain an \xe2\x80\x9cendorsement\xe2\x80\x9d demonstrating their expertise in the chosen instructional method, see Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, No. CV\xe2\x80\x9392\xe2\x80\x93596\xe2\x80\x93TUC\xe2\x80\x93RCC (D.

Ariz.), Dkt. No. 703, p.\xc2\xa04.  The Court of Appeals, too, in its opinion acknowledged that the dispute \xe2\x80\x9cmay finally be nearing resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1180.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But, at the same time, the District Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9cmany of the new standards are still evolving.\xe2\x80\x9d  480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1160.  It found that \xe2\x80\x9cit would be premature to make an assessment of some of these changes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  And it held that, all in all, the changes were not yet sufficient to warrant relief.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1167.  The Court of Appeals upheld the findings and conclusions as within the discretionary powers of the District Court, adding that the evidence showing that significantly more students were completing the program was \xe2\x80\x9cnot reliable.\xe2\x80\x9d  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1157.  What \xe2\x80\x9cfurther factual findings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 25, are needed?  As I have explained, the District Court was not obligated to relitigate the case.  See <em>supra</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  And it <em>did</em> find that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State has changed its primary model\xe2\x80\x9d of English-learning instruction \xe2\x80\x9cto structured English immersion.\xe2\x80\x9d  480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1161.  How can the majority conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cfurther factual findings\xe2\x80\x9d are necessary?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps the majority does not mean to suggest that the lower courts failed properly to examine these changes in teaching methods.  Perhaps it means to express its belief that the lower courts reached the wrong conclusion.  After all, the Court refers to a \xe2\x80\x9cdocumented, academic support for the view that\xe2\x80\x9d structured English immersion \xe2\x80\x9cis significantly more effective than bilingual education.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is difficult to see how the majority can substitute its judgment for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on this question, however, for that judgment includes a host of subsidiary fact-related determinations that warrant deference.  <em>Railway Employees</em>, 364 U. S., at 647\xe2\x80\x93648 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere there is . . .  a balance of imponderables there must be wide discretion in the District Court\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, despite considerable evidence showing improvement, there was also considerable evidence the other way, evidence that supported the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cpremature\xe2\x80\x9d to set aside the judgment of violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The methodological change was introduced in Arizona in late 2000, and in Nogales it was a work in progress, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o one degree or another,\xe2\x80\x9d as of June 2005.  Tr. 10 (Jan. 12, 2007); <em>ante</em>, at 25.  As of 2006, the State\xe2\x80\x99s newest structured English immersion models had not yet taken effect.  Tr. 138 (Jan. 17, 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re getting ready to hopefully put down some models for districts to choose from\xe2\x80\x9d).  The State had adopted its new assessment test only the previous year.  App. 164\xe2\x80\x93165.  The testimony about the extent to which Nogales had adopted the new teaching system was unclear and conflicting.  Compare Tr. 96 (Jan. 9, 2007) with Tr. 10 (Jan. 12, 2007).  And, most importantly, there was evidence that the optimistic improvement in the number of students completing the English-learning program was considerably overstated.  See Tr. 37 (Jan. 18, 2007) (stating that the <em>assessment test</em> used in 2005 and 2006, when dramatic improvements had been reported, <em>was significantly less \xe2\x80\x9crigorous\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently had been replaced</em>).  The State\xe2\x80\x99s own witnesses were unable firmly to conclude that the new system had so far produced significantly improved results.  Tr. 112\xe2\x80\x93113 (Jan. 11, 2007) (stating that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>at some point</em>\xe2\x80\x9d it would be possible to tell how quickly the new system leads to English proficiency (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Faced with this conflicting evidence, the District Court concluded that it was \xe2\x80\x9cpremature\xe2\x80\x9d to dissolve the decree on the basis of changes in teaching (and related standards and assessment) methodology.  Given the underlying factual disputes (about, <em>e.g.</em>, the reliability of the testing method), how can this Court now hold that the District Court, and the appellate court that affirmed its conclusions, were legally wrong?</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second change that the Court says the lower courts should properly \xe2\x80\x9cexamine\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9cenactment\xe2\x80\x9d of the No Child Left Behind Act.  <em>Ante</em>, at 25.  The Court concedes, however, that both courts did address the only argument about that \xe2\x80\x9cenactment\xe2\x80\x9d that the petitioners made, namely, that \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance\xe2\x80\x9d with that new law automatically constitutes compliance with subsection (f)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98appropriate action\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 73 (arguing that the new law \xe2\x80\x9cpreempts\xe2\x80\x9d subsection (f)).  And the Court today agrees (as do I) that the lower courts properly rejected that argument.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the Court suggests that the lower courts wrongly failed to take account of four other ways in which the new Act is \xe2\x80\x9cprobative,\xe2\x80\x9d namely (1) its prompting \xe2\x80\x9csignificant structural and programming\xe2\x80\x9d changes, (2) its increases in \xe2\x80\x9cfederal funding,\xe2\x80\x9d (3) \xe2\x80\x9cits assessment and reporting requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d and (4) its \xe2\x80\x9cshift in federal education policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9328.  In fact, the lower courts did take account of the changes in structure, programming, and funding (including federal funding) relevant to the English-learning program in Nogales and elsewhere in the State.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>; Parts III\xe2\x80\x93C and III\xe2\x80\x93D, <em>infra</em>.  But, I agree with the Court that the District Court did not explicitly relate its discussion to the new Act nor did it take account of what the majority calls a \xe2\x80\x9cshift in federal education policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court failed to do what the Court now demands for one simple reason.  No one (with the possible exception of the legislators, who hint at the matter in their reply brief filed in this Court) has ever argued that the District Court should take account of any such \xe2\x80\x9cchange.\xe2\x80\x9d   But see <em>ante</em>, at 26, and n.\xc2\xa012.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have explained, see <em>supra</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, it is well-established that a district court rarely commits legal error when it fails to take account of a \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d that no one called to its attention or fails to reply to an argument that no one made.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dowell</em>, 498 U. S., at 249 (party seeking relief from judgment must make a \xe2\x80\x9csufficient showing\xe2\x80\x9d).  A district court must construe fairly the arguments made to it; but it is not required to conjure up questions never squarely presented.  That the <em>Court of Appeals </em>referred to an argument resembling the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new assertion does not change the underlying legal fact.  The District Court committed no legal error in failing to consider it.  The Court of Appeals could properly reach the same conclusion.  And the Government, referring to the argument here, does not ask for reversal or remand on that, or on any other, basis.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is not surprising, since the lower courts have consistently and explicitly held that \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility cannot be used to relieve the moving party of its burden to establish that\xe2\x80\x9d dissolution is warranted.  <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>United States Dept. of Housing and Urban Development</em>, 220 F.\xc2\xa03d 241, 248 (CA4 2000); <em>Marshall</em> v. <em>Board of Ed., Bergenfield, N.\xc2\xa0J.</em>, 575 F.\xc2\xa02d 417, 423\xe2\x80\x93424 (CA3 1978).  There is no basis for treating this case in this respect as somehow exceptional, particularly since publicly available documents indicate that, in any event, Nogales is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reaching its own goals under Title III\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26, n.\xc2\xa012; FY 2008 Statewide District/Charter Determinations for the Title III AMAOs (rev.

Again, the Court cannot mean that the lower courts failed to \xe2\x80\x9cexamine\xe2\x80\x9d these arguments, for the District Court heard extensive evidence on the matter.   The Court itself refers to some (but only <em>some</em>) of the evidence introduced on this point, namely the testimony of Kelt Cooper, the former Nogales district superintendent, who said that his administrative policies had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ameliorated or eliminated many of the most glaring inadequacies\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 program.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court also refers to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s and Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusions about the matter.  480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1160 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe success or failure of the children of\xe2\x80\x9d Nogales \xe2\x80\x9cshould not depend on\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cone person\xe2\x80\x9d); 516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1156\xe2\x80\x931157 (recognizing that Nogales had achieved \xe2\x80\x9creforms with limited resources\xe2\x80\x9d but also pointing to evidence showing that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are still significant resource constraints,\xe2\x80\x9d and affirming the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s similar conclusion).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather the Court claims that the lower courts improperly \xe2\x80\x9cdiscounted\xe2\x80\x9d this evidence.  <em>Ante</em>, at 30.  But what does the Court mean by \xe2\x80\x9cdiscount\xe2\x80\x9d?  It cannot mean that the lower courts failed to take account of the possibility that these changes \xe2\x80\x9cmight have brought Nogales[\xe2\x80\x99]\xe2\x80\x9d program into \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance\xe2\x80\x9d with subsection (f).  After all, that is precisely what the petitioners below argued.  Intervenor-Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Closing Argument Memorandum, No. CV\xe2\x80\x9392\xe2\x80\x93596\xe2\x80\x93TUC\xe2\x80\x93RCC (D.

Instead the Court must mean that the lower courts should have given significantly more weight to the changes, <em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>the Court disagrees with the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion about the likely effect these changes will have on the success of Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 English-learning programs (hence, on the need for the judgment and orders to remain in effect).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is difficult to understand the legal basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement about this fact-related matter.  The evidence before the District Court was mixed.  It consisted of some evidence showing administrative reform and managerial improvement in Nogales.  <em>Ante</em>, at 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  At the same time other evidence, to which the Court does not refer, shows that these reforms did not come close to curing the problem.  The record shows, for example, that the graduation rate in 2005 for English-learning students (59%) was significantly below the average for all students (75%).  App. 195.  It shows poor performance by English-learning students, compared with English-speaking students, on Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s content-based standardized tests.  See Appendix A, <em>infra</em>.  This was particularly true at Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 sole high school\xe2\x80\x94which Arizona ranked 575th out of its 629 schools on an educational department survey, 516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1159\xe2\x80\x94where only 28% of ELL students passed those standardized tests.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record also contains testimony from Guillermo Zamudio, who in 2005 succeeded Cooper as Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 superintendent, and who described numerous relevant \xe2\x80\x9cresource-related\xe2\x80\x9d deficiencies: Lack of funding meant that Nogales had to rely upon long-term substitute and \xe2\x80\x9cemergency certified\xe2\x80\x9d teachers without necessary training and experience.

And Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 funding needs forced it to pay a starting base salary to its teachers about 14% below the state average, making it difficult to recruit qualified teachers.  <em>Id</em>., at 48<em>.</em>  Finally, Zamudio said that Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 lack of resources would likely lead in the near future to the cancellation of certain programs, including a remedial reading program, <em>id.</em>, at 56, and would prevent the school district from providing appropriate class sizes and tutoring, which he characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cessential and necessary for us to be able to have our students learn English,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 75\xe2\x80\x9378.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court, faced with all this evidence, found the management and structural \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d insufficient to warrant dissolution of its decree.  How can the Court say that this conclusion is unreasonable?  What is the legal basis for concluding that the District Court acted beyond the scope of its lawful authority?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, the Court does not even try to claim that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is unreasonable.  Rather it enigmatically says that the District Court made \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient factual findings\xe2\x80\x9d to support the conclusion that an ongoing violation of law exists.  <em>Ante</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  By \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court does not mean nonexistent.  See 480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1163\xe2\x80\x931164.  Nor can it mean that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s findings were skimpy or unreasonable.  That court simply drew conclusions on the basis of evidence it acknowledged was mixed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1160\xe2\x80\x931161.  What is wrong with those findings, particularly if viewed with appropriate deference? </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At one point the Court says that there \xe2\x80\x9care many possible causes\xe2\x80\x9d of Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 difficulties and that the lower courts failed to  \xe2\x80\x9ctake into account other variables that may explain\xe2\x80\x9d the ongoing deficiencies.  <em>Ante</em>, at 32 and n.\xc2\xa020.  But to find a flaw here is to claim that the plaintiffs have failed to negate the possibility that these other causes, not the State\xe2\x80\x99s resource failures, explain Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 poor performance.  To say this is to ignore well-established law that accords deference to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s fact-related judgments.  See <em>supra</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements reflect the acknowledgment that the evidence below was mixed.  Given that acknowledgment, it is clear that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that petitioners had not shown sufficient \xe2\x80\x9cchanged circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it was petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 job, as the moving party, to show that compliance with federal law has been achieved.  Where \xe2\x80\x9cother variables\xe2\x80\x9d make it difficult to conclude that a present violation does or does not exist, what error does the District Court commit if it concludes that the moving party has failed to satisfy that burden?</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fourth \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court suggests the lower courts did not properly \xe2\x80\x9cexamine\xe2\x80\x9d consists of an \xe2\x80\x9coverall increase in the education funding available in Nogales.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 32.  Again, the Court is wrong to suggest that the District Court failed fully to examine the matter, for despite the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertions to the contrary, it made a number of \xe2\x80\x9cup-to-date factual findings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 33, on the matter, see 480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1161\xe2\x80\x931164.  Those findings reflect that the State had developed an educational plan that raised the \xe2\x80\x9cbase level amount\xe2\x80\x9d for the typical student from $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to $3,570 in 2006 (in constant 2006 dollars), <em>ante</em>, at 32, n. 21; and that plan increased the additional (<em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cweighted\xe2\x80\x9d) amount that would be available per English-learning student from $182 to $349 (in 2006 dollars).  The State contended that this new plan, with its explanation of how the money needed would be forthcoming from federal, as well as from state, sources, met subsection (f)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement for \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d (as related to \xe2\x80\x9cresources\xe2\x80\x9d) and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s own insistence upon a mechanism that rationally funded those resources.  See Appendix B, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once again the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfactual-finding\xe2\x80\x9d criticism seems, in context, to indicate its disagreement with the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 resolution of this argument.  That is to say, the Court seems to disagree with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that, even with the new funding, the State failed to show that adequate resources for English-learning programs would likely be forthcoming; hence the new plan was not \xe2\x80\x9crationally related\xe2\x80\x9d to the underlying resource problem.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record, however, adequately supports the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  For one thing, the funding plan demonstrates that, in 2006, 69% of the available funding was targeted at \xe2\x80\x9cbase level\xe2\x80\x9d education, see Appendix B, <em>infra</em>, <em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>it was funding available to provide students with basic educational services like instruction in mathematics, science, and so forth.  See Tr. 110 (Jan. 12, 2007).  The District Court found that this funding likely would not become available for English-learning programs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How is that conclusion unreasonable?  If these funds are provided for the provision of only basic services, how can the majority now decide that a school district\xe2\x80\x94particularly a poor school district like Nogales\xe2\x80\x94would be able to cover the additional expenses associated with English-learning education while simultaneously managing to provide for its students\xe2\x80\x99 basic educational needs? Indeed, the idea is particularly impractical when applied to a district like Nogales, which has a high percentage of students who need extra resources.  See 516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1145 (approximately 90% of Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 students were, or had been, enrolled in the English-learning program in 2006).  Where the vast majority of students in a district are those who \xe2\x80\x9cneed extra help\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9ccosts extra money,\xe2\x80\x9d it is difficult to imagine where one could find an untapped stream of funding that could cover those additional costs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 witnesses conceded that the State had not yet determined the likely costs to school districts of teaching English learners using the structured English immersion method.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Tr. 199\xe2\x80\x93200 (Jan. 17, 2007).  The legislators reported that the State had recently asked a task force to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine\xe2\x80\x9d the extra costs associated with implementing the structured English immersion model.  Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Appellate Brief in No. 07\xe2\x80\x9315603 etc. (CA9), p.\xc2\xa031.  But that task force had not yet concluded its work.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, the District Court doubted that the federal portion of the funding identified by the petitioners would be available for English-learning programs.  It characterized certain federal grant money, included in the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 calculus of available funds, as providing only \xe2\x80\x9cshort-term\xe2\x80\x9d assistance, 480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1161.  And testimony at the evidentiary hearing indicated that some of the funds identified by petitioners might not in fact be available to Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 schools.  See Tr. 59\xe2\x80\x9361 (Jan. 10, 2007).  It also noted that certain funds were restricted, meaning that no particular English-learning child could benefit from them for more than two years\xe2\x80\x94despite the fact that English-learning students in Nogales on average spend four to five years in that program.  480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1163\xe2\x80\x931164 (Nogales will have to \xe2\x80\x9cdilute\xe2\x80\x9d the funds provided to cover students who remain English learners for more than two years).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the court pointed to federal law, which imposes a restriction forbidding the State to use a large portion of (what the State\xe2\x80\x99s plan considered to be) available funds in the manner the State proposed, <em>i.e.</em>, to \xe2\x80\x9csupplant,\xe2\x80\x9d or substitute for, the funds the State would otherwise have spent on the program.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1162; see also 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76314(a)(2)(B), 6315(b)(3), 6613(f), 6825(g).  The District Court concluded that the State\xe2\x80\x99s funding plan was in large part unworkable in light of this restriction.  In reaching this conclusion, the District Court relied in part upon the testimony of Thomas Fagan, a former United States Department of Education employee and an \xe2\x80\x9cexpert\xe2\x80\x9d on this type of federal funding.  Fagan testified that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s plan was a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98blatant violation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the relevant laws, which could result in a loss to the State of over $600 million in federal funds\xe2\x80\x94including those federal funds the State\xe2\x80\x99s plan would provide for English learners.  480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1163.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court says that the analysis I have just described, and in which the court engaged, amounts to \xe2\x80\x9cclear legal error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 33.  What error?  Where is the error?  The Court does say earlier in its opinion that the lower courts \xe2\x80\x9cshould not\xe2\x80\x9d have \xe2\x80\x9cdisregarded\xe2\x80\x9d the relevant federal (<em>i.e.</em>, No Child Left Behind Act) funds \xe2\x80\x9cjust because they are not state funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 27.  But the District Court did <em>not </em>disregard those funds \xe2\x80\x9cjust because they are not state funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor did it \xe2\x80\x9cforeclos[e] the possibility that petitioners could\xe2\x80\x9d show entitlement to relief by pointing to \xe2\x80\x9can overall increase in education funding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 33.  Rather, the District Court treated those increased funds as potentially unavailable, primarily because their use as planned would violate federal law and would thereby threaten the State with total loss of the stream of federal funding it planned to use.  It concluded that the State\xe2\x80\x99s plan amounted to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a blatant violation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of federal law, and remarked that \xe2\x80\x9cthe potential loss of federal funds is substantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1163.  Is there a better reason for \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d those funds?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court may have other \xe2\x80\x9cerrors\xe2\x80\x9d in mind as well.  It does say, earlier in its opinion, that some believe that \xe2\x80\x9cincreased funding <em>alone</em> does not improve student achievement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 28 (emphasis added), and it refers to nine studies that suggest that increased funding does not always help.  See <em>ante</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9331, nn. 17\xe2\x80\x9319; see also Brief for Education-Policy Scholars as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 7\xe2\x80\x9311 (discussing such scholarship).  I do not know what this has to do with the matter.  But if it is relevant to today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the Court should also refer to the many studies that cast doubt upon the results of the studies it cites.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, H. Ladd &amp; J. Hansen, Making Money Matter: Financing America\xe2\x80\x99s Schools 140\xe2\x80\x93147 (1999); Hess, Understanding Achievement (and Other) Changes Under Chicago School Reform, 21 Educ. Eval. &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y Analysis 67, 78 (1999); Card &amp; Payne, School Finance Reform, The Distribution of School Spending, and the Distribution of Student Test Scores, 83 J. Pub. Econ. 49, 67 (2002); see also Rebell, Poverty, \xe2\x80\x9cMeaningful\xe2\x80\x9d Educational Opportunity, and the Necessary Role of the Courts, 85 N.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1467, 1480 (2007); R. Greenwald, L. Hedges &amp; R. Laine, The Effect of School Resources on Student Achievement, 66 Rev. Educ. Res. 361, 362 (1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, the relation of a funding plan to improved performance is not an issue for this Court to decide through footnote references to the writings of one side of a complex expert debate.  The question here is whether the State has shown that its new funding program amounts to a \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d that satisfies subsection (f)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement.  The District Court found it did not.  Nothing this Court says casts doubt on the legal validity of that conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s remaining criticisms are not well founded.  The Court, for example, criticizes the Court of Appeals for having referred to the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwarrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief as \xe2\x80\x98<em>likely rare,</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for having said the petitioners would have to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>sweep away</em>\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfunding determination\xe2\x80\x9d in order to prevail, for having spoken of the \xe2\x80\x9clandscape\xe2\x80\x9d as not being \xe2\x80\x9cso <em>radically changed</em> as to justify relief from judgment without compliance,\xe2\x80\x9d and for having somewhat diminished the \xe2\x80\x9cclose[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d of its review for \xe2\x80\x9cfederalism concerns\xe2\x80\x9d because the State and its Board of Education \xe2\x80\x9cwish the injunction to remain in place.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (first, second, and fourth emphases added; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, does not explain the context in which the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 statements appeared.  That court used its first phrase (\xe2\x80\x9clikely rare\xe2\x80\x9d) to refer to the <em>particular kind </em>of modification that the State sought, namely complete relief from the original judgment, even if the judgment\xe2\x80\x99s objective was not yet fully achieved.  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1167; cf. Moore \xc2\xa760.47 [2][c].  As far as I know it is indeed \xe2\x80\x9crare\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ca prior judgment is so undermined by later circumstances as to render its continued enforcement inequitable\xe2\x80\x9d even though compliance with the judgment\xe2\x80\x99s legal determination has not occurred.  516 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1167.  At least, the Court does not point to other instances that make it common.  Uses of the word \xe2\x80\x9csweeping\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cradica[l] change\xe2\x80\x9d in context refer to the deference owed to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 legal determination.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1168 (describing the 2000 order\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbasic determination\xe2\x80\x9d that English-learning \xe2\x80\x9cprograms require substantial state funding in addition to that spent on basic educational programming\xe2\x80\x9d).  If there is an error (which I doubt, see <em>supra</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9323) the error is one of tone, not of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do I see any legal error that could have made a difference when the Court of Appeals said it should downplay the importance of federalism concerns because some elements of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s state government support the judgment.  I do not know the legal basis for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reference to this recalibration of judicial distance as \xe2\x80\x9cflatly incorrect,\xe2\x80\x9d but, if it is wrong, I still do not see how recalibrating the recalibration could matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision to set aside the lower court decisions rests upon (1) a mistaken effort to drive a wedge between (a) review of funding plan changes and (b) review of changes that would bring the State into compliance with federal law, Part I, <em>supra;</em> (2) a misguided attempt to show that the lower courts applied the wrong legal standards, Part II, <em>supra; </em>(3) a mistaken belief that the lower courts made four specific fact-based errors, Part III, <em>supra;</em> and (4) a handful of minor criticisms, Part IV, <em>supra</em> and this page.  By tracing each of these criticisms to its source in the record, I have tried to show that each is unjustified.  Whether taken separately or together, they cannot warrant setting aside the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99\ndecision.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a totally separate matter, the Court says it is \xe2\x80\x9cunclear\xe2\x80\x9d whether the District Court improperly ordered statewide injunctive relief instead of confining that relief to Nogales.  And it orders the District Court to vacate the injunction \xe2\x80\x9cinsofar as it extends beyond Nogales\xe2\x80\x9d unless the court finds that \xe2\x80\x9cArizona is violating\xe2\x80\x9d subsection (f) \xe2\x80\x9con a statewide basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 36.   </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is the legal support for this part of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion?  Prior to the appearance of this case in this Court, no one asked for that modification.  Nothing in the law, as far as I know, makes the relief somehow clearly erroneous.  Indeed, as the majority recognizes, the reason that the injunction runs statewide is that the State of Arizona, the defendant in the litigation, <em>asked the Court to enter that relief.</em>  The State pointed in support to a state constitutional provision requiring educational uniformity.  See <em>ante</em>, at 35.  There is no indication that anyone disputed whether the injunction should have statewide scope.  A statewide program harmed Nogales\xe2\x80\x99 students, App. 13\xe2\x80\x9314, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb640, 42; and the State wanted statewide relief.  What in the law makes this relief erroneous?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority says that the District Court must consider this matter because \xe2\x80\x9c[p]etitioners made it clear at oral argument that they wish to argue that the extension of the remedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 34, n. 23.  I find the matter less clear.  I would direct the reader to the oral argument transcript, which reads in part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Starr: What was entered here in this order, which makes it so extraordinary, is that the entire State funding mechanism has been interfered with by the order.

I think it was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit that applied only to Nogales to the whole State, but the State attorney general wanted that done.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Starr: But we should be able now to\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJustice Scalia: But that\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s water over the dam.  That\xe2\x80\x99s not what this suit is about now.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.</p>\n<p align="left">\nRegardless, what is the legal basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s order telling the District Court it <em>must</em> reconsider the matter?  There is no clear error.  No one has asked the District Court for modification.  And the scope of relief is primarily a question for the District Court.  <em>Swann</em> v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/1/index.html">402 U. S. 1</a>, 15 (1971) (\xe2\x80\x9cOnce a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the length of the opinions indicates, this case requires us to read a highly detailed record.  Members of this Court have reached different conclusions about what that record says.  But there is more to the case than that.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, even if one sees this case as simply a technical record-reading case, the disagreement among us shows why this Court should ordinarily hesitate to hear cases that require us to do no more than to review a lengthy record simply to determine whether a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s fact-based determinations are correct.  Cf. <em>Universal Camera</em>, 340 U. S., at 488 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] court may [not] displace\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cchoice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo</em>\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Graver Tank &amp; Mfg.

In such cases, appellate courts are closer to the fray, better able to reach conclusions that are true to the record, and are more likely to treat trial court determinations fairly and with respect\xe2\x80\x94as is clearly so here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, insofar as the Court goes beyond the technical record-based aspects of this case and applies a new review framework, it risks problems in future cases.  The framework it applies is incomplete and lacks clear legal support or explanation.  And it will be difficult for lower courts to understand and to apply that framework, particularly if it rests on a distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform litigation\xe2\x80\x9d and other forms of litigation.  Does the Court mean to say, for example, that courts must, on their own, go beyond a party\xe2\x80\x99s own demands and relitigate an underlying legal violation whenever that party asks for modification of an injunction?  How could such a rule work in practice?  See <em>supra, </em>at 21\xe2\x80\x9323.  Does the Court mean to suggest that there are other special, strict pro-defendant rules that govern review of district court decisions in \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform cases\xe2\x80\x9d?  What precisely are those rules?  And when is a case an \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform\xe2\x80\x9d case?  After all, as I have tried to show, see <em>supra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, the case before us cannot easily be fitted onto the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Procrustean \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional reform\xe2\x80\x9d bed.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court may mean its opinion to express an attitude, cautioning judges to take care when the enforcement of federal statutes will impose significant financial burdens upon States.  An attitude, however, is not a rule of law.  Nor does any such attitude point towards vacating the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion here.  The record makes clear that the District Court did take care.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15. And the Court of Appeals too proceeded with care, producing a detailed opinion that is both true to the record and fair to the lower court and to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submissions as well.  I do not see how this Court can now require lower court judges to take yet greater care, to proceed with even greater caution, while at the same time expecting those courts to enforce the statute as Congress intended.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we cannot and should not fail to acknowledge the underlying subject matter of this proceeding.  The case concerns the rights of Spanish-speaking students, attending public school near the Mexican border, to learn English in order to live their lives in a country where English is the predominant language.  In a Nation where nearly 47 million people (18% of the population) speak a language other than English at home, U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Admin., Census Bureau, Census 2000 Brief: Language Use and English-Speaking Ability 2 (Oct. 2003), it is important to ensure that those children, without losing the cultural heritage embodied in the language of their birth, nonetheless receive the English-language tools they need to participate in a society where that second language \xe2\x80\x9cserves as the fundamental medium of social interaction\xe2\x80\x9d and democratic participation.  Rodr\xc3\xadguez, Language and Participation, 94 Cal. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 687, 693 (2006).  In that way linguistic diversity can complement and support, rather than undermine, our democratic institutions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 688.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At least, that is what Congress decided when it set federal standards that state officials must meet.  In doing so, without denying the importance of the role of state and local officials, it also created a role for federal judges, including judges who must see that the States comply with those federal standards.  Unfortunately, for reasons I have set forth, see Part II, <em>supra</em>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will make it more difficult for federal courts to enforce those federal standards.  Three decades ago, Congress put this statutory provision in place to ensure that our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s school systems will help non-English-speaking schoolchildren overcome the language barriers that might hinder their participation in our country\xe2\x80\x99s schools, workplaces, and the institutions of everyday politics and government, <em>i.e.</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9carenas through which most citizens live their daily lives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rodr\xc3\xadguez, <em>supra</em>, at 694.  I fear that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision will increase the difficulty of overcoming barriers that threaten to divide us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons set forth in this opinion, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left"> APPENDIXES</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p>\n\nPERFORMANCE ON CONTENT-BASED ASSESSMENT TESTS\xe2\x80\x94SPRING 2006[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1"><f f="Century Schoolbook">MATH</f></font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\nGRADE</p>\n<p>\n\nELL STUDENTS PASSING EXAM</p>\n<p>\n\nNON-ELL AND RECLASSIFIED STUDENTS PASSING EXAM</p>\n<p>\n\n3</p>\n<p>\n\n54%</p>\n<p>\n\n94%</p>\n<p>\n\n4</p>\n<p>\n\n44%</p>\n<p>\n\n91%</p>\n<p>\n\n5</p>\n<p>\n\n53%</p>\n<p>\n\n88%</p>\n<p>\n\n6</p>\n<p>\n\n23%</p>\n<p>\n\n82%</p>\n<p>\n\n7</p>\n<p>\n\n40%</p>\n<p>\n\n82%</p>\n<p>\n\n8</p>\n<p>\n\n28%</p>\n<p>\n\n70%</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">READING</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\nGRADE</p>\n<p>\n\nELL STUDENTS PASSING EXAM</p>\n<p>\n\nNON-ELL AND PASSING EXAM</p>\n<p>\n\n3</p>\n<p>\n\n40%</p>\n<p>\n\n92%</p>\n<p>\n\n4</p>\n<p>\n\n19%</p>\n<p>\n\n83%</p>\n<p>\n\n5</p>\n<p>\n\n22%</p>\n<p>\n\n81%</p>\n<p>\n\n6</p>\n<p>\n\n14%</p>\n<p>\n\n76%</p>\n<p>\n\n7</p>\n<p>\n\n13%</p>\n<p>\n\n74%</p>\n<p>\n\n8</p>\n<p>\n\n31%</p>\n<p>\n\n73%</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">WRITING</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\nGRADE</p>\n<p>\n\nELL STUDENTS PASSING EXAM</p>\n<p>\n\nNON-ELL AND PASSING EXAM</p>\n<p>\n\n3</p>\n<p>\n\n52%</p>\n<p>\n\n82%</p>\n<p>\n\n4</p>\n<p>\n\n52%</p>\n<p>\n\n87%</p>\n<p>\n\n5</p>\n<p>\n\n34%</p>\n<p>\n\n80%</p>\n<p>\n\n6</p>\n<p>\n\n71%</p>\n<p>\n\n97%</p>\n<p>\n\n7</p>\n<p>\n\n66%</p>\n<p>\n\n98%</p>\n<p>\n\n8</p>\n<p>\n\n49%</p>\n<p>\n\n94%</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">FUNDING AVAILABLE TO NOGALES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, PER STUDENT[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1"><f f="Century Schoolbook">TYPE</f></font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n1999\xe2\x80\x932000</p>\n<p>\n\n2000\xe2\x80\x932001</p>\n<p>\n\n2001\xe2\x80\x932002</p>\n<p>\n\n2002\xe2\x80\x932003</p>\n<p>\n\n2003\xe2\x80\x932004</p>\n<p>\n\n2004\xe2\x80\x932005</p>\n<p>\n\n2005\xe2\x80\x932006</p>\n<p>\n\n2006\xe2\x80\x932007</p>\n<p>\n\nBase level</p>\n<p>\n\n$2,593</p>\n<p>\n\n$2,618</p>\n<p>\n\n$2,721</p>\n<p>\n\n$2,788</p>\n<p>\n\n$2,858</p>\n<p>\n\n$2,929</p>\n<p>\n\n$3,039</p>\n<p>\n\n$3,173</p>\n<p>\n\nELL funds</p>\n<p>\n\n$156</p>\n<p>\n\n$157</p>\n<p>\n\n$163</p>\n<p>\n\n$321</p>\n<p>\n\n$329</p>\n<p>\n\n$337</p>\n<p>\n\n$349</p>\n<p>\n\n$365</p>\n<p>\n\nOther state ELL funds</p>\n<p>\n\n$0</p>\n<p>\n\n$0</p>\n<p>\n\n$0</p>\n<p>\n\n$126</p>\n<p>\n\n$83</p>\n<p>\n\n$64</p>\n<p>\n\n$0</p>\n<p>\n\n$74</p>\n<p>\n\nFederal Title I funds</p>\n<p>\n\n$439</p>\n<p>\n\n$448</p>\n<p>\n\n$467</p>\n<p>\n\n$449</p>\n<p>\n\n$487</p>\n<p>\n\n$638</p>\n<p>\n\n$603</p>\n<p>\n\n$597</p>\n<p>\n\nFederal Title II funds</p>\n<p>\n\n$58</p>\n<p>\n\n$63</p>\n<p>\n\n$74</p>\n<p>\n\n$101</p>\n<p>\n\n$109</p>\n<p>\n\n$91</p>\n<p>\n\n$92</p>\n<p>\n\n$87</p>\n<p>\n\nFederal Title III (ELL) funds</p>\n<p>\n\n$0</p>\n<p>\n\n$0</p>\n<p>\n\n$0</p>\n<p>\n\n$67</p>\n<p>\n\n$89</p>\n<p>\n\n$114</p>\n<p>\n\n$118</p>\n<p>\n\n$121</p>\n<p>\n\nState and federal grants</p>\n<p>\n\n$58</p>\n<p>\n\n$56</p>\n<p>\n\n$59</p>\n<p>\n\n$47</p>\n<p>\n\n$207</p>\n<p>\n\n$214</p>\n<p>\n\n4205</p>\n<p>\n\n$109</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">TOTAL[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n$3,302</p>\n<p>\n\n$3,342</p>\n<p>\n\n$3,484</p>\n<p>\n\n$3,899</p>\n<p>\n\n$4,162</p>\n<p>\n\n$4,387</p>\n<p>\n\n$4,406</p>\n<p>\n\n$4,605[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\nConstant dollars (2006)[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n$3,866</p>\n<p>\n\n$3,804</p>\n<p>\n\n$3,904</p>\n<p>\n\n$4,272</p>\n<p>\n\n$4,442</p>\n<p>\n\n$4,529</p>\n<p>\n\n$4,406</p>\n<p>\n\n$4,477</p>\n<p>\n\nTotal ELL funds</p>\n<p>\n\n$156</p>\n<p>\n\n$147</p>\n<p>\n\n$163</p>\n<p>\n\n$514</p>\n<p>\n\n$501</p>\n<p>\n\n$515</p>\n<p>\n\n$467</p>\n<p>\n\n$639</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left"> \xc2\xa0App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93289, p. 311.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0516 F.\xc2\xa03d 1140, 1159 (CA9 2008); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93289, pp. 42\xe2\x80\x9343.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Nogales received less per-pupil funding in 2006 than the average provided by every State in the Nation.
