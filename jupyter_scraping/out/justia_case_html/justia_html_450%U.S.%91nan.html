The question presented is whether such violations must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, rather than by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In June, 1971, the Commission initiated a disciplinary proceeding against petitioner and certain of his wholly owned companies.  The proceeding against petitioner was brought pursuant to \xc2\xa7 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 450 U. S. 93</a></p><p> and \xc2\xa7 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] The Commission alleged that petitioner had violated numerous provisions of the federal securities laws in his management of several mutual funds registered under the Investment Company Act.</p>\n<p>After a lengthy evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge and review by the Commission in which the preponderance of the evidence standard was employed, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 450 U. S. 94</a></p><p> Commission held that, between December, 1965, and June, 1972, petitioner had violated antifraud, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] reporting, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] conflict of interest, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and proxy [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] provisions of the federal securities laws.  Accordingly, it entered an order permanently barring petitioner from associating with any investment adviser or affiliating with any registered investment company, and suspending him for one year from associating with any broker or dealer in securities. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner sought review of the Commission\'s order in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 450 U. S. 95</a></p><p> United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on a number of grounds, only one of which is relevant for our purposes.  Petitioner challenged the Commission\'s use of the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in determining whether he had violated antifraud provisions of the securities laws.  He contended that, because of the potentially severe sanctions that the Commission was empowered to impose and because of the circumstantial and inferential nature of the evidence that might be used to prove intent to defraud, the Commission was required to weigh the evidence against a clear and convincing standard of proof.  The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner\'s argument, holding that, in a disciplinary proceeding before the Commission, violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws may be established by a preponderance of the evidence.  603 F.2d 1126, 1143 (1979).  <em>See</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra.</em>  Because this was contrary to the position taken by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, <em>see Whitney v. SEC,</em> 196 U.S.App.D.C. 12, 604 F.2d 676 (1979); <em>Collins Securities Corp. v. SEC,</em> 183 U.S.App.D.C. 301, 562 F.2d 820 (1977), we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  446 U.S. 917 (1980).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Where Congress has not prescribed the degree of proof which must be adduced by the proponent of a rule or order to carry its burden of persuasion in an administrative proceeding, this Court has felt at liberty to prescribe the standard, for "[i]t is the kind of question which has traditionally been left to the judiciary to resolve."  <em>Woodby v. INS,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/276/case.html">385 U. S. 276</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/276/case.html#284">385 U. S. 284</a></span> (1966).  However, where Congress has spoken, we have deferred to "the traditional powers of Congress to prescribe rules of evidence and standards of proof in the federal courts" [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] absent countervailing constitutional constraints.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="96">Page 450 U. S. 96</a></p><p> <em>Vance v. Terrazas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/252/case.html">444 U. S. 252</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/252/case.html#265">444 U. S. 265</a></span> (1980).  For Commission disciplinary proceedings initiated pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80a-9(b) and \xc2\xa7 80b-3(f), we conclude that Congress has spoken, and has said that the preponderance of the evidence standard should be applied. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The securities laws provide for judicial review of Commission disciplinary proceedings in the federal courts of appeals [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and specify the scope of such review. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Because they do not indicate which standard of proof governs Commission adjudications, however, we turn to \xc2\xa7 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 554, which "applies . . . in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing," except in instances not relevant here. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Section 5(b), 5 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 450 U. S. 97</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 554(c)(2), makes the provisions of \xc2\xa7 7, 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 566, applicable to adjudicatory proceedings. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The answer to the question presented in this case turns, therefore, on the proper construction of \xc2\xa7 7. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The search for congressional intent begins with the language of the statute.  <em>Andrus v. Allard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/51/case.html">444 U. S. 51</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/51/case.html#56">444 U.

Section 7(c), 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 556 (d), states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"Except as otherwise provided by statute, the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof.  Any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the agency as a matter of policy shall provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.  A sanction may not be imposed or rule or order issued except on consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and <em>in accordance with</em> the reliable, probative, and <em>substantial evidence.</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>The language of the statute itself implies the enactment of a standard of proof.  By allowing sanctions to be imposed only when they are "in accordance with . . . <em>substantial</em> evidence," Congress implied that a sanction must rest on a <em>minimum quantity</em> of evidence.  The word "substantial" denotes quantity. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The phrase "in accordance with . . . substantial evidence" thus requires that a decision be based on a certain quantity of evidence.  Petitioner\'s contention that the phrase "reliable, probative, and substantial evidence" sets merely a standard of <em>quality</em> of evidence is, therefore, unpersuasive. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>The phrase "in accordance with" lends further support to a construction of \xc2\xa7 7(c) as establishing a standard of proof.  Unlike \xc2\xa7 10(e), the APA\'s explicit "Scope of review" provision that declares that agency action shall be held unlawful </p><p><a class="page-number" name="99">Page 450 U. S. 99</a></p><p> if "unsupported by substantial evidence," [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] \xc2\xa7 7(c) provides that an agency may issue an order only if that order is "supported by and <em>in accordance with</em> . . . substantial evidence" (emphasis added).  The additional words "in accordance with" [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] suggest that the adjudicating agency must weigh the evidence and decide, based on the weight of the evidence, whether a disciplinary order should be issued.  The language of \xc2\xa7 7(c), therefore, requires that the agency decision must be "in accordance with" the weight of the evidence, not simply supported by enough evidence "<em>to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\'"  <em>Consolo v. FMC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/607/case.html">383 U. S. 607</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/607/case.html#620">383 U. S. 620</a></span> (1966), quoting <em>NLRB v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/292/case.html">306 U. S. 292</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/292/case.html#300">306 U. S. 300</a></span> (1939).  Obviously, weighing evidence has relevance only if the evidence on each side is to be measured against a standard of proof which allocates the risk of error.  <em>See Addington v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html">441 U. S. 418</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html#423">441 U. S. 423</a></span> (1979).  Section 10(e), by contrast, does not permit the reviewing court to weigh the evidence, but only to determine that there is in the record "`such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\'" <em>Consolo v. FMC, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/607/case.html#620">383 U. S. 620</a></span>, quoting <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/305/197/case.html">Consolidated Edison Co. v.

It is not surprising, therefore, in view of the entirely different purposes of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7(c) and \xc2\xa7 10(e), that Congress intended the words "substantial evidence" to have different meanings in context.  Thus, petitioner\'s argument that \xc2\xa7 7(c) merely establishes the scope of judicial review of agency orders is unavailing. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>While the language of \xc2\xa7 7(c) suggests, therefore, that Congress intended the statute to establish a standard of proof, the language of the statute is somewhat opaque concerning the precise standard of proof to be used.  The legislative history, however, clearly reveals the Congress\' intent.  The original Senate version of \xc2\xa7 7(c) provided that "no sanction shall be imposed . . . except as supported by relevant, reliable, and probative evidence."  S. 7, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945).  After the Senate passed this version, the House passed the language of the statute as it reads today, and the Senate accepted the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 450 U. S. 101</a></p><p> amendment.  Any doubt as to the intent of Congress is removed by the House Report which expressly adopted a preponderance of the evidence standard:</p>\n<p>"[W]here a party having the burden of proceeding has come forward with a <em>prima facie</em> and substantial case, he will prevail unless his evidence is discredited or rebutted.  In any case, the agency must decide \'in accordance with the evidence.\'  Where there is evidence pro and con, the agency must weigh it and decide <em>in accordance with the preponderance.</em>  In short, these provisions require a conscientious and rational judgment on the whole record in accordance with the proofs adduced."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No.1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 37 (1946) (emphasis added). [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 450 U. S. 102</a></p><p> Nor is there any suggestion in the legislative history that a standard of proof higher than a preponderance of the evidence was ever contemplated, much less intended.  Congress was primarily concerned with the elimination of agency decisionmaking premised on evidence which was of poor quality -- irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, and nonprobative -- and of insufficient quantity -- less than a preponderance.  <em>See id.</em> at 36 37 and 45; S. Doc. No. 248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 32322 and 376-378 (1946);  <a href="#F21" name="T21">n</a> 21, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>The language and legislative history of \xc2\xa7 7(c) lead us to conclude, therefore, that \xc2\xa7 7(c) was intended to establish a standard of proof, and that the standard adopted is the traditional preponderance of the evidence standard. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 450 U. S. 103</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our view of congressional intent is buttressed by the Commission\'s longstanding practice of imposing sanctions according to the preponderance of the evidence.  As early as 1938, the Commission rejected the argument that in a proceeding to determine whether to suspend, expel, or otherwise sanction a brokerage firm and its principals for, <em>inter alia,</em> manipulation of security prices in violation of \xc2\xa7 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78i, a standard of proof greater than the preponderance of the evidence standard was required.  <em>In re White,</em> 3 S.E.C. 466, 539-540 (1938).  Use of the preponderance standard continued after passage of the APA, and persists today.  <em>E.g., In re Cea,</em> 44 S.E.C. 8, 25 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 450 U. S. 104</a></p><p> (1969); <em>In re Pollisky,</em> 43 S.E. C. 458, 459-460 (1967).  The Commission\'s consistent practice, which is in harmony with \xc2\xa7 7(c) and its legislative history, is persuasive authority that Congress intended that Commission disciplinary proceedings, subject to \xc2\xa7 7 of the APA, be governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard.  <em>See Andrus v.

The only substantive difference between \xc2\xa7 80b-3(f) and \xc2\xa7 80a-9(b) is that the former permits the Commission to impose sanctions on persons affiliated with an investment adviser and the latter on persons affiliated with an investment company.

Moreover, it is implausible to think that the drafters of the APA would place a scope of review standard in the middle of a statutory provision designed to govern evidentiary issues in adjudicatory proceedings.  Section 7 is entitled "Hearings; presiding employees; powers and duties; burden of proof; evidence; record as basis of decision."  It "is made up almost entirely of a specification of the various elements of trial procedure."  2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \xc2\xa7 10:07, p. 332 (2d ed.1979).  More specifically, \xc2\xa7 7(c) allocates the burden of proof (placing it on the proponent of a rule or order), provides for a broad rule governing admissibility of evidence, directs an agency to exclude "irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence," and delineates the evidentiary basis on which a "sanction may . . . be imposed."</p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s argument overlooks the different functions of initial decisionmaking and judicial review of it.  <em>See Charlton v.

There, the Court required the Immigration and Naturalization Service to establish facts in deportation proceedings by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.  The Court adopted this standard of proof because deportation proceedings were not subject to the APA, and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) did not prescribe a standard of proof, only the scope of judicial review.  The Court reached this conclusion after examining the language, legislative history, and purpose of \xc2\xa7 106(a)(4) and \xc2\xa7 242(b)(4) of the INA.  That both sections contained the words "reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence" has little bearing on the construction of somewhat different language in an entirely different statute.  The language, purpose, and legislative history of these sections of the INA differ in material respects from the language, purpose, and legislative history of \xc2\xa7 7(c).  Section 106(a)(4) was explicitly labeled a judicial review provision.  Section 242(b)(4) was also construed by the Court to be "addressed to reviewing courts," 385 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/276/case.html#283">385 U. S. 283</a></span>, in part because, at the time that the provision was adopted, there was no other scope of judicial review provision in the INA, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/276/case.html#284">385 U. S. 284</a></span>.  The APA, by contrast, was passed with an explicit judicial review provision, \xc2\xa7 10(e), and with a provision explicitly governing evidentiary matters before the agency, \xc2\xa7 7(c).  To the extent \xc2\xa7 242(b)(4) was viewed by the Court as representing a "yardstick for the administrative factfinder," the Court concluded that the provision was directed at the quality of evidence upon which an order could be based.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/276/case.html#283">385 U. S. 283</a></span>.  The language of \xc2\xa7 242(b)(4) differs from the language of \xc2\xa7 7(c), which includes the additional phrase "in accordance with."  Moreover, as explained above, the legislative history and purpose of \xc2\xa7 7(c) make clear that it was not limited to quality of evidence concerns or directed at all at judicial review.</p>\n<p>We thus accept Justice Clark\'s statement in dissent, with which the Court in <em>Woodby</em> did not disagree, that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7(c) and 10(e) of the APA have "traditionally been held satisfied when the agency decides on the preponderance of the evidence."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/276/case.html#289">385 U. S. 289</a></span>, n. 1.  Justice Clark\'s understanding of \xc2\xa7 7(c), as expressed in <em>Woodby,</em> is entitled to particular respect.  We have previously noted that the Attorney General\'s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act (1947) has been "given some deference by this Court because of the role played by the Department of Justice in drafting the legislation," <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/519/case.html#546">435 U. S. 546</a></span>, and Justice Clark was Attorney General both when the APA was passed and when the Manual was published.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL, with whom JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), acting under the antifraud provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, has imposed severe sanctions on petitioner.  He has been barred permanently from practicing his profession and also forced to divest himself of an investment at a substantial loss.  In making its findings of fraud and imposing these penalties, the SEC applied the "preponderance of the evidence" standard of proof.</p>\n<p>The Court today sustains the action of the SEC, holding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 450 U. S. 105</a></p><p> that \xc2\xa7 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 556(d), commands the use of this standard in disciplinary proceedings brought under the securities laws.  The Court recognizes, however, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/91/case.html#95">450 U. S. 95</a></span>-96, that the general provisions of the APA are applicable only when Congress has not intended that a different standard be used in the administration of a specific statute.  The critical inquiry thus is the identification of the standard of proof desired by Congress.</p>\n<p>The SEC acted in this case under \xc2\xa7 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80a-9(b), and \xc2\xa7 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80b-3(f).  Sanctions imposed under these sections are the functional equivalent of penalties for fraud.  At common law, it was plain that allegations of fraud had to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  <em>E.g., Addington v.

There is no evidence that Congress, when it adopted these Acts, intended to authorize the SEC to abandon the then-applicable standard of proof in fraud adjudications.  <em>See Whitney v. SEC,</em> 196 U.S.App.D.C. 12, 604 F.2d 676 (1979); <em>Collins Securities Corp. v. SEC,</em> 183 U.S.App.D.C. 301, 562 F.2d 820 (1977).</p>\n<p>The APA, upon which the Court relies, did not become law for some seven years after the enactment of the two statutes under which the SEC imposed these penalties.  Again, the Court points to no specific evidence that Congress intended the APA to supplant the burden of proof rule generally applicable when the securities laws were enacted.  Thus, the APA -- the <em>general</em> statute applicable only where a <em>specific</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="106">Page 450 U. S. 106</a></p><p> statute is not should have no bearing on the proof burden in this case.</p>\n<p>I imply no opinion on the question whether the evidence supports the SEC\'s allegations against petitioner.  It is clear, however, that the SEC\'s finding of fraud and its imposition of harsh penalties have resulted in serious stigma and deprivation.  <em>Cf. Addington v. Texas, supra.</em> <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/91/case.html">*</a></span>  In the absence of any specific demonstration of Congress\' purpose, we should not assume that Congress intended the SEC to apply a lower standard of proof than the prevailing common law standard for similar allegations.  With all respect, it seems to me that the Court\'s decision today lacks the sensitivity that traditionally has marked our review of the Government\'s imposition upon citizens of severe penalties and permanent stigma.</p>\n<p>* Petitioner has practiced the profession of investment adviser for many years. He has been forever barred from resuming that profession. Many penalties imposed under our criminal laws -- such as monetary fines and probation -- are far legs severe, and yet these can be imposed only under the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard of the criminal law.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
