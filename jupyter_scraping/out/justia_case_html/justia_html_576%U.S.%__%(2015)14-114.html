In the 1990s, several States sought to expand access to coverage by imposing a pair of insurance market regulations\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cguaranteed issue\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, which bars insurers from denying coverage to any person because of his health, and a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity rating\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, which bars insurers from charging a person higher premiums for the same reason.  The reforms achieved the goal of expanding access to coverage, but they also encouraged people to wait until they got sick to buy insurance.  The result was an economic \xe2\x80\x9cdeath spiral\xe2\x80\x9d: premiums rose, the number of people buying insurance declined, and insurers left the market entirely.  In 2006, however, Massachusetts discovered a way to make the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements work\xe2\x80\x94by requiring individuals to buy insurance and by providing tax credits to certain individuals to make insurance more affordable.  The combination of these three reforms\xe2\x80\x94insurance market regulations, a coverage mandate, and tax credits\xe2\x80\x94enabled Massachusetts to drastically reduce its uninsured rate.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The Affordable Care Act adopts a version of the three key reforms that made the Massachusetts system successful.  First, the Act adopts the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7300gg, 300gg\xe2\x80\x931.  Second, the Act generally requires individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the IRS, unless the cost of buying insurance would exceed eight percent of that individual\xe2\x80\x99s income.\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A.  And third, the Act seeks to make insurance more affordable by giving refundable tax credits to individuals with household incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line.  \xc2\xa736B.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In addition to those three reforms, the Act requires the creation of an \xe2\x80\x9cExchange\xe2\x80\x9d in each State\xe2\x80\x94basically, a marketplace that allows people to compare and purchase insurance plans.  The Act gives each State the opportunity to establish its own Exchange, but provides that the Federal Government will establish \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exchange\xe2\x80\x9d if the State does not.  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa718031, 18041.  Relatedly, the Act provides that tax credits \xe2\x80\x9cshall be allowed\xe2\x80\x9d for any \xe2\x80\x9capplicable taxpayer,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736B(a), but only if the taxpayer has enrolled in an insurance plan through \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State under [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa736B(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c).  An IRS regulation interprets that language as making tax credits available on \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d 26 CFR \xc2\xa71.36B\xe2\x80\x932, \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of whether the Exchange is established and operated by a State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or by HHS,\xe2\x80\x9d 45 CFR \xc2\xa7155.20.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Petitioners are four individuals who live in Virginia, which has a Federal Exchange.  They do not wish to purchase health insurance.  In their view, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Exchange does not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State under [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031],\xe2\x80\x9d so they should not receive any tax credits.  That would make the cost of buying insurance more than eight percent of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 income, exempting them from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage requirement.  As a result of the IRS Rule, however, petitioners <i>would </i>receive tax credits.  That would make the cost of buying insurance <i>less</i> than eight percent of their income, which would subject them to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Petitioners challenged the IRS Rule in Federal District Court.  The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that the Act unambiguously made tax credits available to individuals enrolled through a Federal Exchange.  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  The Fourth Circuit viewed the Act as ambiguous, and deferred to the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation under <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A.

But <i>Chevron</i> does not provide the appropriate framework here.  The tax credits are one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s key reforms and whether they are available on Federal Exchanges is a question of deep \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic and political significance\xe2\x80\x9d; had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly.  And it is especially unlikely that Congress would have delegated this decision to the <i>IRS</i>, which has no expertise in crafting health insurance policy of this sort.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">It is instead the Court\xe2\x80\x99s task to determine the correct reading of Section 36B.  If the statutory language is plain, the Court must enforce it according to its terms.  But oftentimes the meaning\xe2\x80\x94or ambiguity\xe2\x80\x94of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.  So when deciding whether the language is plain, the Court must read the words \xe2\x80\x9cin their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>FDA</i> v. <i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 120\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0When read in context, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State under [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031]\xe2\x80\x9d is properly viewed as ambiguous.  The phrase may be limited in its reach to State Exchanges.  But it could also refer to <i>all</i> Exchanges\xe2\x80\x94both State and Federal\xe2\x80\x94for purposes of the tax credits.  If a State chooses not to follow the directive in Section 18031 to establish an Exchange, the Act tells the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718041.  And by using the words \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d the Act indicates that State and Federal Exchanges should be the same.  But State and Federal Exchanges would differ in a fundamental way if tax credits were available only on State Exchanges\xe2\x80\x94one type of Exchange would help make insurance more affordable by providing billions of dollars to the States\xe2\x80\x99 citizens; the other type of Exchange would not.  Several other provisions in the Act\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g., </i>Section 18031(i)(3)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that all Exchanges create outreach programs to \xe2\x80\x9cdistribute fair and impartial information concerning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the availability of premium tax credits under section 36B\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94would make little sense if tax credits were not available on Federal Exchanges.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The argument that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d would be superfluous if Congress meant to extend tax credits to both State and Federal Exchanges is unpersuasive.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpreference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lamie</i> v. <i>United States Trustee</i>,\n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 526\n.  And rigorous application of that canon does not seem a particularly useful guide to a fair construction of the Affordable Care Act, which contains more than a few examples of inartful drafting.  The Court nevertheless must do its best, \xe2\x80\x9cbearing in mind the \xe2\x80\x98fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Utility Air Regulatory Group</i> v. <i>EPA</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Given that the text is ambiguous, the Court must look to the broader structure of the Act to determine whether one of Section 36B\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United Sav. Assn. of Tex.</i> v. <i>Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd.</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 365\n.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Here, the statutory scheme compels the Court to reject petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal Exchange, and likely create the very \xe2\x80\x9cdeath spirals\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress designed the Act to avoid.  Under petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading, the Act would not work in a State with a Federal Exchange.  As they see it, one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s three major reforms\xe2\x80\x94the tax credits\xe2\x80\x94would not apply.  And a second major reform\xe2\x80\x94the coverage requirement\xe2\x80\x94would not apply in a meaningful way, because so many individuals would be exempt from the requirement without the tax credits.  If petitioners are right, therefore, only one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s three major reforms would apply in States with a Federal Exchange.The combination of no tax credits and an ineffective coverage requirement could well push a State\xe2\x80\x99s individual insurance market into a death spiral.  It is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner.  Congress made the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements applicable in every State in the Nation, but those requirements only work when combined with the coverage requirement and tax credits.  It thus stands to reason that Congress meant for those provisions to apply in every State as well.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0The structure of Section 36B itself also suggests that tax credits are not limited to State Exchanges.  Together, Section 36B(a), which allows tax credits for any \xe2\x80\x9capplicable taxpayer,\xe2\x80\x9d and Section 36B(c)(1), which defines that term as someone with a household income between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line, appear to make anyone in the specified income range eligible for a tax credit.  According to petitioners, however, those provisions are an empty promise in States with a Federal Exchange.  In their view, an applicable taxpayer in such a State would be <i>eligible</i> for a tax credit, but the <i>amount</i> of that tax credit would always be zero because of two provisions buried deep within the Tax Code.  That argument fails because Congress \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(e)\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 plain-meaning arguments are strong, but the Act\xe2\x80\x99s context and structure compel the conclusion that Section 36B allows tax credits for insurance purchased on any Exchange created under the Act.  Those credits are necessary for the Federal Exchanges to function like their State Exchange counterparts, and to avoid the type of calamitous result that Congress plainly meant to avoid.

First, the Act bars insurers from taking a person\xe2\x80\x99s health into account when deciding whether to sell health insurance or how much to charge.  Second, the Act generally requires each person to maintain insurance coverage or make a payment to the Internal Revenue Service.

The Act gives each State the opportunity to establish its own Exchange, but provides that the Federal Government will establish the Exchange if the State does not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case is about whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s interlocking reforms apply equally in each State no matter who establishes the State\xe2\x80\x99s Exchange.  Specifically, the question pre-sented is whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s tax credits are available in States that have a Federal Exchange.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\n\n124Stat.\n119, grew out of a long history of failed health insurance reform.  In the 1990s, several States began experimenting with ways to expand people\xe2\x80\x99s access to coverage.  One common approach was to impose a pair of insurance market regulations\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cguaranteed issue\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, which barred insurers from denying coverage to any person because of his health, and a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity rating\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, which barred insurers from charging a person higher premiums for the same reason.  Together, those requirements were designed to ensure that anyone who wanted to buy health insurance could do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The guaranteed issue and community rating requirements achieved that goal, but they had an unintended consequence: They encouraged people to wait until they got sick to buy insurance.  Why buy insurance coverage when you are healthy, if you can buy the same coverage for the same price when you become ill?  This consequence\xe2\x80\x94known as \xe2\x80\x9cadverse selection\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94led to a second: Insurers were forced to increase premiums to account for the fact that, more and more, it was the sick rather than the healthy who were buying insurance.  And that consequence fed back into the first: As the cost of insurance rose, even more people waited until they became ill tobuy it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This led to an economic \xe2\x80\x9cdeath spiral.\xe2\x80\x9d  As premiums rose higher and higher, and the number of people buying insurance sank lower and lower, insurers began to leave the market entirely.  As a result, the number of people without insurance increased dramatically.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This cycle happened repeatedly during the 1990s.  For example, in 1993, the State of Washington reformed its individual insurance market by adopting the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.  Over the next three years, premiums rose by 78 percent and the number of people enrolled fell by 25 percent.  By 1999, 17 of the State\xe2\x80\x99s 19 private insurers had left the market, and the remaining two had announced their intention to do so.  Brief for America\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Plans as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For another example, also in 1993, New York adopted the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.  Over the next few years, some major insurers in the individual market raised premiums by roughly 40 percent.  By 1996, these reforms had \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively eliminated the commercial individual indemnity market in New York with the largest individual health insurer exiting the market.\xe2\x80\x9d  L.

Leida, The Impact of Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating Reforms on States\xe2\x80\x99 Individual Insurance Markets\xc2\xa038 (2012).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1996, Massachusetts adopted the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements and experienced similar results.  But in 2006, Massachusetts added two more reforms: The Commonwealth required individuals to buy insurance or pay a penalty, and it gave tax credits to certain individuals to ensure that they could afford the insurance they were required to buy.  Brief for Bipartisan Economic Scholars as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  The combination of these three reforms\xe2\x80\x94insurance market regulations, a coverage mandate, and tax credits\xe2\x80\x94reduced the uninsured rate in Massachusetts to 2.6 percent, by far the lowest in the Nation.

First, the Act adopts the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.  The Act provides that \xe2\x80\x9ceach health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. market in a State must accept every .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. individual in the State that applies for such coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x931(a).  The Act also bars insurers from charging higher premiums on the basis of a person\xe2\x80\x99s health.  \xc2\xa7300gg.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Act generally requires individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the IRS.\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A.  Congress recognized that, without an incentive, \xe2\x80\x9cmany individuals would wait to purchase health insurance until they needed care.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718091(2)(I).  So Congress adopted a coverage requirement to \xe2\x80\x9cminimize this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  In Congress\xe2\x80\x99s view, that coverage requirement was \xe2\x80\x9cessential to creating effective health insurance markets.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Congress also provided an exemption from the coverage requirement for anyone who has to spend more than eight percent of his income on health insurance.  26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75000A(e)(1)(A), (e)(1)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the Act seeks to make insurance more affordable by giving refundable tax credits to individuals with household incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line.  \xc2\xa736B.  Individuals who meet the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements may purchase insurance with the tax credits, which are provided in advance directly to the individual\xe2\x80\x99s insurer.  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa718081, 18082.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These three reforms are closely intertwined.  As noted, Congress found that the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements would not work without the coverage requirement.  \xc2\xa718091(2)(I).  And the coverage requirement would not work without the tax credits.  The reason is that, without the tax credits, the cost of buying insurance would exceed eight percent of income for a large number of individuals, which would exempt them from the coverage requirement.  Given the relationship between these three reforms, the Act provided that they should take effect on the same day\xe2\x80\x94January 1, 2014.

The tax credits are among the Act\xe2\x80\x99s key reforms, involving billions of dollars in spending each year and affecting the price of health insurance for millions of people.  Whether those credits are available on Federal Exchanges is thus a question of deep \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic and political significance\xe2\x80\x9d that is central to this statutory scheme; had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly.  <i>Utility Air Regulatory Group</i> v. <i>EPA</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 19) (quoting <i>Brown &amp; Williamson</i>, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 160).

See Brief for Petitioners 22; Brief for Respondents 22.  Section 18031 provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach State shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. establish an American Health Benefit Exchange .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718031(b)(1).  Although phrased as a requirement, the Act gives the States \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d by allowing them to \xe2\x80\x9celect\xe2\x80\x9d whether they want to establish an Exchange.  \xc2\xa718041(b).  If the State chooses not to do so, Section 18041 provides that the Secretary \xe2\x80\x9cshall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. establish and operate<i>such Exchange</i> within the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718041(c)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d Section 18041 instructs the Secretary to establish and operate the <i>same</i> Exchange that the State was directed to establish under Section 18031.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1661 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \xe2\x80\x9csuch\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cThat or those; having just been mentioned\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, State Exchanges and Fed-eral Exchanges are equivalent\xe2\x80\x94they must meet the same requirements, perform the same functions, and serve the same purposes.  Although State and Federal Exchanges are established by different sovereigns, Sections 18031 and 18041 do not suggest that they differ in any meaningful way.  A Federal Exchange therefore counts as \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange\xe2\x80\x9d under Section 36B.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, we must determine whether a Federal Exchange is \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of Section 36B.  At the outset, it might seem that a Federal Exchange cannot fulfill this requirement.  After all, the Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9ceach of the 50 States and the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a definition that does not include the Federal Government.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718024(d).  But when read in context, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a view to [its] place in the overall statutory scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d is not so clear.  <i>Brown &amp;Williamson</i>, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 133 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After telling each State to establish an Exchange, Section 18031 provides that all Exchanges \xe2\x80\x9cshall make available qualified health plans to qualified individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031(d)(2)(A).  Section 18032 then defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cqualified individual\xe2\x80\x9d in part as an individual who \xe2\x80\x9cresides in the State that established the Exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718032(f)(1)(A).  And that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem: If we give the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe State that established the Exchange\xe2\x80\x9d its most natural meaning, there would be <i>no</i> \xe2\x80\x9cqualified individuals\xe2\x80\x9d on Federal Exchanges.  But the Act clearly contemplates that there will be qualified individuals on <i>every</i> Exchange.  As we just mentioned, the Act requires all Exchanges to \xe2\x80\x9cmake available qualified health plans to qualified individuals\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94something an Exchange could not do if there were no such individuals.  \xc2\xa718031(d)(2)(A).  And the Act tells the Exchange, in deciding which health plans to offer, to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests of qualified individuals .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the State or States in which such Exchange operates\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94again, something the Exchange could not do if qualified individ-uals did not exist.  \xc2\xa718031(e)(1)(B).  This problem arises repeatedly throughout the Act.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, \xc2\xa718031(b)(2) (allowing a State to create \xe2\x80\x9cone Exchange .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for providing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. services to both qualified individuals and qualified small employers,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than creating separate Exchanges for those two groups).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These provisions suggest that the Act may not always use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d in its most natural sense.  Thus, the meaning of that phrase may not be as clear as it appears when read out of context.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, we must determine whether a Federal Exchange is established \xe2\x80\x9cunder [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031].\xe2\x80\x9d  This too might seem a requirement that a Federal Exchange cannot fulfill, because it is Section 18041 that tells the Secretary when to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish and operate such Exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  But here again, the way different provisions in the statute interact suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Act defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cExchange\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9can American Health Benefit Exchange established under section 18031.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x9391(d)(21).  If we import that definition into Section 18041, the Act tells the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish and operate such \xe2\x80\x98American Health Benefit Exchange established under section 18031.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  That suggests that Section 18041 authorizes the Secretary to establish an Exchange under Section 18031, not (or not only) under Section 18041.  Otherwise, the Federal Exchange, by definition, would not be an \xe2\x80\x9cExchange\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  See <i>Halbig</i>, 758 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 399\xe2\x80\x93400 (acknowledging that the Secretary establishes Federal Exchanges under Section 18031).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cunder [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031]\xe2\x80\x9d fits best with the statutory context.  All of the requirements that an Exchange must meet are in Section 18031, so it is sensible to regard all Exchanges as established under that provision.  In addition, every time the Act uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cExchange,\xe2\x80\x9d the definitional provision requires that we substitute the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established under section 18031.\xe2\x80\x9d  If Federal Exchanges were not established under Section 18031, therefore, literally none of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements would apply to them.  Finally, the Act repeatedly uses the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cestablished under [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031]\xe2\x80\x9d in situations where it would make no sense to distinguish between State and Federal Exchanges.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7125(f)(3)(A) (2012 ed., Supp. I) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98qualified benefit\xe2\x80\x99 shall not include any qualified health plan .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. offered through an Exchange established under [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031]\xe2\x80\x9d);\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76055(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I) (2012 ed.)

A Federal Exchange may therefore be considered one established \xe2\x80\x9cunder [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot of all this is that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State under [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031]\xe2\x80\x9d is properly viewed as ambiguous.  The phrase may be limited in its reach to State Exchanges.  But it is also possible that the phrase refers to <i>all</i> Exchanges\xe2\x80\x94both State and Federal\xe2\x80\x94at least for purposes of the tax credits.  If a State chooses not to follow the directive in Section 18031 that it establish an Exchange, the Act tells the Secretary to establish \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718041.  And by using the words \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d the Act indicates that State and Federal Exchanges should be the same.  But State and Federal Exchanges would differ in a fundamental way if tax credits were available only on State Exchanges\xe2\x80\x94one type of Exchange would help make insurance more affordable by providing billions of dollars to the States\xe2\x80\x99 citizens; the other type of Exchange would not.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The conclusion that Section 36B is ambiguous is further supported by several provisions that assume tax credits will be available on both State and Federal Exchanges.  For example, the Act requires all Exchanges to create outreach programs that must \xe2\x80\x9cdistribute fair and impartial information concerning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the availability of premium tax credits under section 36B.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718031(i)(3)(B).  The Act also requires all Exchanges to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish and make avail-able by electronic means a calculator to determine the actual cost of coverage after the application of any pre-mium tax credit under section 36B.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718031(d)(4)(G).  And the Act requires all Exchanges to report to the Treasury Secretary information about each health plan they sell, including the \xe2\x80\x9caggregate amount of any advance payment of such credit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny information .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. necessary to determine eligibility for, and the amount of, such credit,\xe2\x80\x9d and any \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nformation necessary to determine whether a taxpayer has received excess advance payments.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736B(f)(3).  If tax credits were not available on Federal Exchanges, these provisions would make little sense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners and the dissent respond that the words \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d would be unnecessary if Congress meant to extend tax credits to both State and Fed-eral Exchanges.

Here, the statutory scheme compels us to reject petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal Exchange, and likely create the very \xe2\x80\x9cdeath spirals\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress designed the Act to avoid.  See <i>New York State Dept. of Social Servs.</i> v. <i>Dublino</i>,\n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405\n\xe2\x80\x93420 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot interpret federal statutes to negate their own stated purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As discussed above, Congress based the Affordable Care Act on three major reforms: first, the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements; second, a requirement that individuals maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the IRS; and third, the tax credits for individuals with household incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line.  In a State that establishes its own Exchange, these three reforms work together to expand insurance coverage.  The guaranteed issue and community rating requirements ensure that anyone can buy insurance; the coverage requirement creates an incentive for people to do so before they get sick; and the tax credits\xe2\x80\x94it is hoped\xe2\x80\x94make insurance more affordable.  Together, those reforms \xe2\x80\x9cminimize .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. adverse selection and broaden the health in-surance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718091(2)(I).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading, however, the Act would operate quite differently in a State with a Federal Exchange.  As they see it, one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s three major reforms\xe2\x80\x94the tax credits\xe2\x80\x94would not apply.  And a second major reform\xe2\x80\x94the coverage requirement\xe2\x80\x94would not apply in a meaningful way.  As explained earlier, the coverage requirement applies only when the cost of buying health insurance (minus the amount of the tax credits) is less than eight percent of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s income.  26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75000A(e)(1)(A), (e)(1)(B)(ii).  So without the tax credits, the coverage requirement would apply to fewer individuals.  And it would be a <i>lot</i> fewer.  In 2014, approximately 87 percent of people who bought insurance on a Federal Exchange did so with tax credits, and virtually all of those people would become exempt.  HHS, A. Burke, A. Misra, &amp; S. Sheingold, Premium Affordability, Competition, and Choice in the Health Insurance Marketplace 5 (2014); Brief for Bipartisan Economic Scholars as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  If petitioners are right, therefore, only one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s three major reforms would apply in States with a Federal Exchange.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The combination of no tax credits and an ineffective coverage requirement could well push a State\xe2\x80\x99s individual insurance market into a death spiral.  One study predicts that premiums would increase by 47 percent and enrollment would decrease by 70 percent.  E. Saltzman &amp; C. Eibner, The Effect of Eliminating the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s Tax Credits in Federally Facilitated Marketplaces (2015).  Another study predicts that premiums would increase by 35 percent and enrollment would decrease by 69 percent.  L. Blumberg, M. Buettgens, &amp; J. Holahan, The Implications of a Supreme Court Finding for the Plaintiff in King vs. Burwell: 8.2 Million More Uninsured and 35% Higher Premiums (2015).  And those effects would not be limited to individuals who purchase insurance on the Exchanges.  Because the Act requires insurers to treat the entire individual market as a single risk pool,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718032(c)(1), premiums outside the Exchange would rise along with those inside the Exchange.  Brief for Bipartisan Economic Scholars as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner.  See <i>National Federation of Independent Business</i> v. <i>Sebelius</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 60) (\xe2\x80\x9cWithout the federal subsidies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress made the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements applicable in every State in the Nation.  But those requirements only work when combined with the coverage requirement and the tax credits.  So it stands to reason that Congress meant for those provisions to apply in every State as well.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners respond that Congress was not worried about the effects of withholding tax credits from States with Federal Exchanges because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress evidently believed it was offering states a deal they would not refuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 36.  Congress may have been wrong about the States\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to establish their own Exchanges, petitioners continue, but that does not allow this Court to rewrite the Act to fix that problem.  That is particularly true, petitioners conclude, because the States likely <i>would</i> have created their own Exchanges in the absence of the IRS Rule, which eliminated any incentive that the States had to do so.  <i>Id.,</i> at 36\xe2\x80\x9338.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 18041 refutes the argument that Congress believed it was offering the States a deal they would not refuse.  That section provides that, if a State elects not to establish an Exchange, the Secretary \xe2\x80\x9cshall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. establish and operate such Exchange within the State.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718041(c)(1)(A).  The whole point of that provision is to create a federal fallback in case a State chooses not to establish its own Exchange.  Contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument, Congress did not believe it was offering States a deal they would not refuse\xe2\x80\x94it expressly addressed what would happen if a State <i>did</i> refuse the deal.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, the structure of Section 36B itself suggests that tax credits are not limited to State Exchanges.  Section 36B(a) initially provides that tax credits \xe2\x80\x9cshall be allowed\xe2\x80\x9d for any \xe2\x80\x9capplicable taxpayer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 36B(c)(1) then defines an \xe2\x80\x9capplicable taxpayer\xe2\x80\x9d as someone who (among other things) has a household income between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line.  Together, these two provisions appear to make anyone in the specified income range eligible to receive a tax credit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">According to petitioners, however, those provisions are an empty promise in States with a Federal Exchange.  In their view, an applicable taxpayer in such a State would be <i>eligible</i> for a tax credit\xe2\x80\x94but the <i>amount</i> of that tax credit would always be zero.  And that is because\xe2\x80\x94diving several layers down into the Tax Code\xe2\x80\x94Section 36B says that the amount of the tax credits shall be \xe2\x80\x9can amount equal to the premium assistance credit amount,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa736B(a); and then says that the term \xe2\x80\x9cpremium assistance credit amount\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cthe sum of the premium assistance amounts determined under paragraph (2) with respect to all coverage months of the taxpayer occurring during the taxable year,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa736B(b)(1); and then says that the term \xe2\x80\x9cpremium assistance amount\xe2\x80\x9d is tied to the amount of the monthly premium for insurance purchased on \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State under [42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa736B(b)(2); and then says that the term \xe2\x80\x9ccoverage month\xe2\x80\x9d means any month in which the taxpayer has insurance through \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State under [\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa736B(c)(2)(A)(i).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have held that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,\n468 (2001)\n.  But in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view, Congress made the viability of the entire Affordable Care Act turn on the ultimate ancillary provision: a sub-sub-sub section of the Tax Code.  We doubt that is what Congress meant to do.  Had Congress meant to limit tax credits to State Exchanges, it likely would have done so in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9capplicable taxpayer\xe2\x80\x9d or in some other prominent manner.  It would not have used such a winding path of connect-the-dots provisions about the amount of the credit.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments about the plain meaning of Section 36B are strong.

For the reasons we have given, however, such reliance is appropriate in this case, and leads us to conclude that Section 36B allows tax credits for insurance purchased on any Exchange created under the Act.  Those credits are necessary for the Federal Exchanges to function like their State Exchange counterparts, and to avoid the type of calamitous result that Congress plainly meant to avoid.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In a democracy, the power to make the law rests with those chosen by the people.

Ordinary connotation does not always prevail, but the more unnatural the proposed interpretation of a law, the more compelling the contex-tual evidence must be to show that it is correct.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard of.

Because the Secretary is neither one of the 50 States nor the District of Columbia, that definition positively contradicts the eccentric theory that an Exchange established by the Secretary has been established by the State.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Far from offering the overwhelming evidence of meaning needed to justify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, other contextual clues undermine it at every turn.  To begin with, other parts of the Act sharply distinguish between the establishment of an Exchange by a State and the establishment of an Exchange by the Federal Government.  The States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to set up Exchanges comes from one provision, \xc2\xa718031(b); the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority comes from an entirely different provision, \xc2\xa718041(c).  Funding for States to establish Exchanges comes from one part of the law, \xc2\xa718031(a); funding for the Secretary to establish Exchanges comes from an entirely different part of the law, \xc2\xa718121.  States generally run state-created Ex-changes; the Secretary generally runs federally created Exchanges.  \xc2\xa718041(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c).  And the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s authority to set up an Exchange in a State depends upon the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c<i>[f]ailure</i> to establish [an] Exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718041(c) (emphasis added).  Provisions such as these destroy any pretense that a federal Exchange is in some sense also established by a State.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Reading the rest of the Act also confirms that, as relevant here, there are <i>only</i> two ways to set up an Exchange in a State: establishment by a State and establishment by the Secretary.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa718031(b), 18041(c).  So saying that an Exchange established by the Federal Government is \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d goes beyond giving words bizarre meanings; it leaves the limiting phrase \xe2\x80\x9cby the State\xe2\x80\x9d with no operative effect at all.  That is a stark violation of the elementary principle that requires an interpreter \xe2\x80\x9cto give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Montclair </i>v. <i>Ramsdell</i>,\n\n107 U.\xc2\xa0S. 147,\n152 (1883)\n.  In weighing this argument, it is well to remember the difference between giving a term a meaning that duplicates another part of the law, and giving a term no meaning at all.  Lawmakers sometimes repeat themselves\xe2\x80\x94whether out of a desire to add emphasis, a sense of belt-and-suspenders caution, or a lawyerly penchant for doublets (aid and abet, cease and desist, null and void).  Lawmakers do not, however, tend to use terms that \xe2\x80\x9chave no operation at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Marbury </i>v. <i>Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137, 174 (1803).  So while the rule against treating a term as a redundancy is far from categorical, the rule against treating it as a nullity is as close to absolute as interpretive principles get.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading does not merely give \xe2\x80\x9cby the State\xe2\x80\x9d a duplicative effect; it causes the phrase to have no effect whatever.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Making matters worse, the reader of the whole Act will come across a number of provisions beyond \xc2\xa736B that refer to the establishment of Exchanges by States.  Adopting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation means nullifying the term \xe2\x80\x9cby the State\xe2\x80\x9d not just once, but again and again throughout the Act.  Consider for the moment only those parts of the Act that mention an \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with tax credits:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">The formula for calculating the amount of the tax credit, as already explained, twice mentions \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736B(b)(2)(A), (c)(2)(A)(i).</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">The Act directs States to screen children for eligibility for \xe2\x80\x9c[tax credits] under section 36B\xe2\x80\x9d and for \xe2\x80\x9canyother assistance or subsidies available for coverage obtained through\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396w\xe2\x80\x933(b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(C).</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">The Act requires \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d to use a \xe2\x80\x9csecure electronic interface\xe2\x80\x9d to determine eligibility for (among other things) tax credits.  \xc2\xa71396w\xe2\x80\x933(b)(1)(D).</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">The Act authorizes \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d to make arrangements under which other state agencies \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine whether a State resident is eligible for [tax credits] under section 36B.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396w\xe2\x80\x933(b)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">The Act directs States to operate Web sites that allow anyone \xe2\x80\x9cwho is eligible to receive [tax credits] under section 36B\xe2\x80\x9d to compare insurance plans offered through \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396w\xe2\x80\x933(b)(4).</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">One of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions addresses the enrollment of certain children in health plans \xe2\x80\x9coffered through an Exchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d and then dis-cusses the eligibility of these children for tax credits.  \xc2\xa71397ee(d)(3)(B).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is bad enough for a court to cross out \xe2\x80\x9cby the State\xe2\x80\x9d once.  But seven times?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress did not, by the way, repeat \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State under [\xc2\xa718031]\xe2\x80\x9d by rote throughout the Act.  Quite the contrary, clause after clause of the law uses a more general term such as \xe2\x80\x9cExchange\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established under [\xc2\xa718031].\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa718031(k), 18033;\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76055.  It is common sense that any speaker who says \xe2\x80\x9cExchange\xe2\x80\x9d some of the time, but \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d the rest of the time, probably means something by the contrast.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Equating establishment \xe2\x80\x9cby the State\xe2\x80\x9d with establishment by the Federal Government makes nonsense of other parts of the Act.  The Act requires States to ensure (on pain of losing Medicaid funding) that any \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d uses a \xe2\x80\x9csecure electronic interface\xe2\x80\x9d to determine an individual\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for various benefits (including tax credits).\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396w\xe2\x80\x933(b)(1)(D).  How could a State control the type of electronic interface used by a federal Exchange?  The Act allows a State to control contracting decisions made by \xe2\x80\x9can Exchange established by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718031(f\xc2\xa0)(3).  Why would a State get to control the contracting decisions of a federal Exchange?  The Act also provides \xe2\x80\x9cAssistance to States to establish American Health Benefit Exchanges\xe2\x80\x9d and directs the Secretary to renew this funding \xe2\x80\x9cif the State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is making progress .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. toward .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. establishing an Exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718031(a).  Does a State that refuses to set up an Exchange still receive this funding, on the premise that Exchanges established by the Federal Government are really established by States?  It is presumably in order to avoid these questions that the Court concludes that federal Exchanges count as state Exchanges only \xe2\x80\x9cfor purposes of the tax credits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 13.  (Contrivance, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act!)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is probably piling on to add that the Congress that wrote the Affordable Care Act knew how to equate two different types of Exchanges when it wanted to do so.  The Act includes a clause providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] <i>territory</i> that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. establishes .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an Exchange .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be treated as a State\xe2\x80\x9d for certain purposes.  \xc2\xa718043(a) (emphasis added).  Tellingly, it does not include a comparable clause providing that the <i>Secretary</i> shall be treated as a State for purposes of \xc2\xa736B when <i>she</i> establishes an Exchange.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Faced with overwhelming confirmation that \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d means what it looks like it means, the Court comes up with argument after feeble argument to support its contrary interpretation.  None of its tries comes close to establishing the implausible conclusion that Congress used \xe2\x80\x9cby the State\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cby the State or not by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court emphasizes that if a State does not set up an Exchange, the Secretary must establish \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa718041(c).  It claims that the word \xe2\x80\x9csuch\xe2\x80\x9d implies that federal and state Exchanges are \xe2\x80\x9cthe same.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 13.  To see the error in this reasoning, one need only consider a parallel provision from our Constitution: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter <i>such Regulations</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa74, cl.\xc2\xa01 (emphasis added).  Just as the Affordable Care Act directs States to establish Exchanges while allowing the Secretary to establish \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exchange\xe2\x80\x9d as a fallback, the Elections Clause directs state legislatures to prescribe election regulations while allowing Congress to make \xe2\x80\x9csuch Regulations\xe2\x80\x9d as a fallback.  Would anybody refer to an election regulation made by Congress as a \xe2\x80\x9cregulation prescribed by the state legislature\xe2\x80\x9d?  Would anybody say that a federal election law and a state election law are in all respects equivalent?  Of course not.  The word \xe2\x80\x9csuch\xe2\x80\x9d does not help the Court one whit.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument also overlooks the rudimentary principle that a specific provision governs a general one.  Even if it were true that the term \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exchange\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa718041(c) implies that federal and state Exchanges are the same in general, the term \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa736B makes plain that they differ when it comes to tax credits in particular.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s next bit of interpretive jiggery-pokery involves other parts of the Act that purportedly presuppose the availability of tax credits on both federal and state Exchanges.  <i>Ante,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  It is curious that the Court is willing to subordinate the express words of the section that grants tax credits to the mere implications of other provisions with only tangential connections to tax credits.  One would think that interpretation would work the other way around.  In any event, each of the provisions mentioned by the Court is perfectly consistent with limiting tax credits to state Exchanges.  One of them says that the minimum functions of an Exchange include (alongside several tasks that have nothing to do with tax credits) setting up an electronic calculator that shows \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual cost of coverage after the application of any premium tax credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031(d)(4)(G).  What stops a federal Exchange\xe2\x80\x99s electronic calculator from telling a customer that his tax credit is zero?  Another provision requires an Exchange\xe2\x80\x99s outreach program to educate the public about health plans, to facilitate enrollment, and to \xe2\x80\x9cdistribute fair and impartial information\xe2\x80\x9d about enrollment and \xe2\x80\x9cthe availability of premium tax credits.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa718031(i)(3)(B).  What stops a federal Exchange\xe2\x80\x99s outreach program from fairly and impartially telling customers that no tax credits are available?  A third provision requires an Exchange to report information about each insurance plan sold\xe2\x80\x94including level of coverage, premium, name of the insured, and \xe2\x80\x9camount of any advance payment\xe2\x80\x9d of the tax credit.\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736B(f)(3).  What stops a federal Exchange\xe2\x80\x99s report from confirming that no tax credits have been paid out?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court persists that these provisions \xe2\x80\x9cwould make little sense\xe2\x80\x9d if no tax credits were available on federal Exchanges.  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.  Even if that observation were true, it would show only oddity, not ambiguity.  Laws often include unusual or mismatched provisions.  The Affordable Care Act spans 900 pages; it would be amazing if its provisions all lined up perfectly with each other.  This Court \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not revise legislation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. just because the text as written creates an apparent anomaly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Michigan</i> v. <i>Bay Mills Indian Community</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 10).  At any rate, the provisions cited by the Court are not particularly unusual.  Each requires an Exchange to perform a standardized series of tasks, some aspects of which relate in some way to tax credits.  It is entirely natural for slight mismatches to occur when, as here, lawmakers draft \xe2\x80\x9ca single statutory provision\xe2\x80\x9d to cover \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent kinds\xe2\x80\x9d of situations.  <i>Robers </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4).  Lawmakers need not, and often do not, \xe2\x80\x9cwrite extra language specifically exempting, phrase by phrase, applications in respect to which a portion of a phrase is not needed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Roaming even farther afield from \xc2\xa736B, the Court turns to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions about \xe2\x80\x9cqualified individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  Qualified individuals receive favored treatment on Exchanges, although customers who are not qualified individuals may also shop there.  See <i>Halbig </i>v. <i>Burwell</i>, 758 F.\xc2\xa03d 390, 404\xe2\x80\x93405 (CADC 2014).  The Court claims that the Act must equate federal and state establishment of Exchanges when it defines a qualified individual as someone who (among other things) lives in the \xe2\x80\x9cState that established the Exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718032(f\xc2\xa0)(1)(A).  Otherwise, the Court says, there would be no qualified individuals on federal Exchanges, contradicting (for example) the provision requiring every Exchange to takethe \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98interests of qualified individuals\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d into accountwhen selecting health plans.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11 (quoting \xc2\xa718031(e)(1)(b)).  Pure applesauce.  Imagine that a university sends around a bulletin reminding every professor to take the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of graduate students\xe2\x80\x9d into account when setting office hours, but that some professors teach only undergraduates.  Would anybody reason that the bulletin implicitly presupposes that every professor has \xe2\x80\x9cgraduate students,\xe2\x80\x9d so that \xe2\x80\x9cgraduate students\xe2\x80\x9d must really mean \xe2\x80\x9cgraduate or undergraduate students\xe2\x80\x9d?  Surely not.  Just as one naturally reads instructions aboutgraduate students to be inapplicable to the extent a particular professor has no such students, so too would one naturally read instructions about qualified individuals to be inapplicable to the extent a particular Exchange has no such individuals.  There is no need to rewrite the term \xe2\x80\x9cState that established the Exchange\xe2\x80\x9d in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cqualified individual,\xe2\x80\x9d much less a need to rewrite the separate term \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d in a separate part of the Act.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Least convincing of all, however, is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to uncover support for its interpretation in \xe2\x80\x9cthe structure of Section 36B itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 19.  The Court finds it strange that Congress limited the tax credit to state Exchanges in the formula for calculating the <i>amount</i> of the credit, rather than in the provision defining the range of taxpayers <i>eligible</i> for the credit.  Had the Court bothered to look at the rest of the Tax Code, it would have seen that the structure it finds strange is in fact quite common.  Consider, for example, the many provisions that initially make taxpayers of all incomes eligible for a tax credit, only to provide later that the amount of the credit is zero if the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s income exceeds a specified threshold.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724 (child tax credit); \xc2\xa732 (earned-income tax credit); \xc2\xa736 (first-time-homebuyer tax credit).  Or consider, for an even closer parallel, a neighboring provision that initially makes taxpayers of all States eligible for a credit, only to provide later that the amount of the credit may be zero if the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s State does not satisfy certain requirements.  See \xc2\xa735 (health-insurance-costs tax credit).  One begins to get the sense that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on reading things in context applies to \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State,\xe2\x80\x9d but to nothing else.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For what it is worth, lawmakers usually draft tax-credit provisions the way they do\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, the way they drafted \xc2\xa736B\xe2\x80\x94because the mechanics of the credit require it.  Many Americans move to new States in the middle of the year.  Mentioning state Exchanges in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccoverage month\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rather than (as the Court proposes) in the provisions concerning taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 eligibility for the credit\xe2\x80\x94accounts for taxpayers who live in a State with a state Exchange for a part of the year, but a State with a federal Exchange for the rest of the year.  In addition, \xc2\xa736B awards a credit with respect to insurance plans \xe2\x80\x9cwhich cover the taxpayer, <i>the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s spouse, or any dependent</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>of the taxpayer</i> and which were enrolled in through an Exchange established by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa736B(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  If Congress had mentioned state Exchanges in the provisions discussing taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 eligibility for the credit, a taxpayer who buys insurance from a federal Exchange would get no money, even if he has a spouse or dependent who buys insurance from a state Exchange\xe2\x80\x94say a child attending college in a different State.  It thus makes perfect sense for \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d to appear where it does, rather than where the Court suggests.  Even if that were not so, of course, its location would not make it any less clear.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court has not come close to presenting the compelling contextual case necessary to justify departing from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the law.  Quite the contrary, context only underscores the outlandishness of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Reading the Act as a whole leaves no doubt about the matter: \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d means what it looks like it means.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For its next defense of the indefensible, the Court turns to the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s design and purposes.  As relevant here, the Act makes three major reforms.  The guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements prohibit insurers from considering a customer\xe2\x80\x99s health when deciding whether to sell insurance and how much to charge, 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7300gg, 300gg\xe2\x80\x931; its famous individ-ual mandate requires everyone to maintain insurance coverage or to pay what the Act calls a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A(b)(1), and what we have nonetheless called a tax, see <i>National Federation of Independent Business </i>v. <i>Sebelius</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 39); and its tax credits help make insurance more affordable.  The Court reasons that Congress intended these three reforms to \xe2\x80\x9cwork together to expand insurance coverage\xe2\x80\x9d; and because the first two apply in every State, so must the third.  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This reasoning suffers from no shortage of flaws.  To begin with, \xe2\x80\x9ceven the most formidable argument concerning the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purposes could not overcome the clarity [of\xc2\xa0] the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kloeckner </i>v. <i>Solis</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa04 (2012) (slip op., at 14, n.\xc2\xa04).  Statutory design and purpose matter only to the extent they help clarify an otherwise ambiguous provision.  Could anyone maintain with a straight face that \xc2\xa736B is unclear?  To mention just the highlights, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation clashes with a statutory definition, renders words inoperative in at least seven separate provisions of the Act, overlooks the contrast between provisions that say \xe2\x80\x9cExchange\xe2\x80\x9d and those that say \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State,\xe2\x80\x9d gives the same phrase one meaning for purposes of tax credits but an entirely different meaning for other purposes, and (let us not forget) contradicts the ordinary meaning of the words Congress used.  On the other side of the ledger, the Court has come up with nothing more than a general provision that turns out to be controlled by a specific one, a handful of clauses that are consistent with either understanding of establishment by the State, and a resemblance between the tax-credit provision and the rest of the Tax Code.  If that is all it takes to make something ambiguous, everything is ambiguous.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Having gone wrong in consulting statutory purpose at all, the Court goes wrong again in analyzing it.  The purposes of a law must be \xe2\x80\x9ccollected chiefly from its words,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cfrom extrinsic circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sturges</i> v. <i>Crowninshield</i>, 4 Wheat. 122, 202 (1819) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  Only by concentrating on the law\xe2\x80\x99s terms can a judge hope to uncover the scheme <i>of the statute</i>, rather than some other scheme that the judge thinks desirable.  Like it or not, the express terms of the Affordable Care Act make only two of the three reforms mentioned by the Court applicable in States that do not establish Exchanges.  It is perfectly possible for them to operate independently of tax credits.  The guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements continue to ensure that insurance companies treat all customers the same no matter their health, and the individual mandate continues to encourage people to maintain coverage, lest they be \xe2\x80\x9ctaxed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court protests that without the tax credits, the number of people covered by the individual mandate shrinks, and without a broadly applicable individual mandate the guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements \xe2\x80\x9cwould destabilize the individual insurance market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 15.  If true, these projections would show only that the statutory scheme contains a flaw; they would not show that the statute means the opposite of what it says.  Moreover, it is a flaw that appeared as well in other parts of the Act.  A different title established a long-term-care insurance program with guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements, but without an individual mandate or subsidies.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78001\xe2\x80\x938002,\n\n124Stat.\n828\xe2\x80\x93847 (2010).  This program never came into effect \xe2\x80\x9conly because Congress, in response to actuarial analyses predicting that the [program] would be fiscally unsustainable, repealed the provision in 2013.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Halbig</i>, 758 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 410.  How could the Court say that Congress would never dream of combining guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements with a narrow individual mandate, when it combined those requirements with <i>no</i> individual mandate in the context of long-term-care insurance?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Similarly, the Department of Health and Human Services originally interpreted the Act to impose guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements in the Federal Territories, even though the Act plainly does not make the individual mandate applicable there.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see 26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A(f)(4);\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201(f).  \xe2\x80\x9cThis combination, predictably, [threw] individual insurance markets in the territories into turmoil.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Halbig, supra,</i> at 410.  Responding to complaints from the Territories, the Department at first insisted that it had \xe2\x80\x9cno statutory authority\xe2\x80\x9d to address the problem and suggested that the Territories \xe2\x80\x9cseek legislative relief from Congress\xe2\x80\x9d instead.  Letter from G. Cohen, Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, to S. Igisomar, Secretary of Commerce of the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (July 12, 2013).  The Department changed its mind a year later, after what it described as \xe2\x80\x9ca careful review of [the] situation and the relevant statutory language.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from M. Tavenner, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to G. Francis, Insurance Commissioner of the Virgin Islands (July 16, 2014).  How could the Court pronounce it \xe2\x80\x9cimplausible\xe2\x80\x9d for Congress to have tolerated instability in insurance markets in States with federal Exchanges, <i>ante,</i> at 17, when even the Government maintained until recently that Congress did exactly that in American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Compounding its errors, the Court forgets that it is no more appropriate to consider one of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s purposes in isolation than it is to consider one of its words that way.  No law pursues just one purpose at all costs, and no statutory scheme encompasses just one element.  Most relevant here, the Affordable Care Act displays a congressional preference for state participation in the establishment of Exchanges: Each State gets the first opportunity to set up its Exchange,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718031(b); States that take up the opportunity receive federal funding for \xe2\x80\x9cactivities .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. related to establishing\xe2\x80\x9d an Exchange, \xc2\xa718031(a)(3); and the Secretary may establish an Exchange in a State only as a fallback, \xc2\xa718041(c).  But setting up and running an Exchange involve significant burdens\xe2\x80\x94meeting strict deadlines, \xc2\xa718041(b), implementing requirements related to the offering of insurance plans, \xc2\xa718031(d)(4), setting up outreach programs, \xc2\xa718031(i), and ensuring that the Exchange is self-sustaining by 2015, \xc2\xa718031(d)(5)(A).  A State would have much less reason to take on these burdens if its citizens could receive tax credits no matter who establishes its Exchange.  (Now that the Internal Revenue Service has interpreted \xc2\xa736B to authorize tax credits everywhere, by the way, 34 States have failed to set up their own Exchanges.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.)  So even if making credits available on all Exchanges advances the goal of improving healthcare markets, it frustrates the goal of encouraging state involvement in the implementation of the Act.  <i>This</i> is what justifies going out of our way to read \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State or not established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Worst of all for the repute of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is largely self-defeating.  The Court predicts that making tax credits unavailable in States that do not set up their own Exchanges would cause disastrous economic consequences there.  If that is so, however, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one expect States to react by setting up their own Exchanges?  And wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that outcome satisfy two of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s goals rather than just one: enabling the Act\xe2\x80\x99s reforms to work <i>and</i> promoting state involvement in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s implementation?  The Court protests that the very existence of a federal fallback shows that Congress expected that some States might fail to set up their own Exchanges.  <i>Ante,</i> at 19.  So it does.  It does not show, however, that Congress expected the number of recalcitrant States to be particularly large.  The more accurate the Court\xe2\x80\x99s dire economic predictions, the smaller that number is likely to be.  That reality destroys the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pretense that applying the law as written would imperil \xe2\x80\x9cthe viability of the entire Affordable Care Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 20.  All in all, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s arguments about the law\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and design are no more convincing than its arguments about context.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Perhaps sensing the dismal failure of its efforts to show that \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State or the Federal Government,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court tries to palm off the pertinent statutory phrase as \xe2\x80\x9cinartful drafting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.  This Court, however, has no free-floating power \xe2\x80\x9cto rescue Congress from its drafting errors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lamie </i>v. <i>United States Trustee</i>,\n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 526,\n542 (2004)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Only when it is patently obvious to a reasonable reader that a drafting mistake has occurred may a court correct the mistake.  The occurrence of a misprint may be apparent from the face of the law, as it is where the Affordable Care Act \xe2\x80\x9ccreates three separate Section 1563s.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.  But the Court does not pretend that there is any such indication of a drafting error on the face of \xc2\xa736B.  The occurrence of a misprint may also be apparent because a provision decrees an absurd result\xe2\x80\x94a consequence \xe2\x80\x9cso monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sturges</i>, 4 Wheat., at 203.  But \xc2\xa736B does not come remotely close to satisfying that demanding standard.  It is entirely plausible that tax credits were restricted to state Exchanges deliberately\xe2\x80\x94for example,in order to encourage States to establish their own Exchanges.  We therefore have no authority to dismiss the terms of the law as a drafting fumble.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Let us not forget that the term \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d appears twice in \xc2\xa736B and five more times in other parts of the Act that mention tax credits.  What are the odds, do you think, that the same slip of the pen occurred in seven separate places?  No provision of the Act\xe2\x80\x94none at all\xe2\x80\x94contradicts the limitation of tax credits to state Exchanges.  And as I have already explained, uses of the term \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State\xe2\x80\x9d beyond the context of tax credits look anything but accidental.  <i>Supra,</i> at 6.  If there was a mistake here, context suggests it was a substantive mistake in designing this part of the law, not a technical mistake in transcribing it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">V</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision reflects the philosophy that judges should endure whatever interpretive distortions it takes in order to correct a supposed flaw in the statutory machinery.  That philosophy ignores the American people\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give <i>Congress</i> \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll legislative Powers\xe2\x80\x9d enumerated in the Constitution.  Art. I, \xc2\xa71.  They made Congress, not this Court, responsible for both making laws and mending them.  This Court holds only the judicial power\xe2\x80\x94the power to pronounce the law as Congress has enacted it.  We lack the prerogative to repair laws that do not work out in practice, just as the people lack the ability to throw us out of office if they dislike the solutions we concoct.  We must always remember, therefore, that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur task is to apply the text, not to improve upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pavelic &amp; LeFlore</i> v. <i>Marvel Entertainment Group, Div. of Cadence Industries Corp.</i>,\n\n493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 120,\n126 (1989)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Trying to make its judge-empowering approach seem respectful of congressional authority, the Court asserts that its decision merely ensures that the Affordable Care Act operates the way Congress \xe2\x80\x9cmeant [it] to operate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 17.  First of all, what makes the Court so sure that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cmeant\xe2\x80\x9d tax credits to be available everywhere?  Our only evidence of what Congress meant comes from the terms of the law, and those terms show beyond all question that tax credits are available only on state Exchanges.  More importantly, the Court forgets that ours is a government of laws and not of men.  That means we are governed by the terms of our laws, not by the unen-acted will of our lawmakers.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform to its intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lamie</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 542.  In the meantime, this Court \xe2\x80\x9chas no roving license .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to disregard clear language simply on the view that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Congress \xe2\x80\x98must have intended\xe2\x80\x99 something broader.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bay Mills</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even less defensible, if possible, is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s claim that its interpretive approach is justified because this Act \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not reflect the type of care and deliberation that one might expect of such significant legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  It is not our place to judge the quality of the care and deliberation that went into this or any other law.  A law enacted by voice vote with no deliberation whatever is fully as binding upon us as one enacted after years of study, months of committee hearings, and weeks of debate.  Much less is it our place to make everything come out right when Congress does not do its job properly.  It is up to Congress to design its laws with care, and it is up to the people to hold them to account if they fail to carry out that responsibility.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Rather than rewriting the law under the pretense of interpreting it, the Court should have left it to Congress to decide what to do about the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limitation of tax credits to state Exchanges.  If Congress values above everything else the Act\xe2\x80\x99s applicability across the country, it could make tax credits available in every Exchange.  If it prizes state involvement in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s implementation, it could continue to limit tax credits to state Exchanges while taking other steps to mitigate the economic consequences predicted by the Court.  If Congress wants to accommodate both goals, it could make tax credits available everywhere while offering new incentives for States to set up their own Exchanges.  And if Congress thinks that the present design of the Act works well enough, it could do nothing.  Congress could also do something else alto-gether, entirely abandoning the structure of the Affordable Care Act.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on making a choice that should be made by Congress both aggrandizes judicial power and encourages congressional lassitude.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Just ponder the significance of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take matters into its own hands.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s revision of the law authorizes the Internal Revenue Service to spend tens of billions of dollars every year in tax credits on federal Exchanges.  It affects the price of insurance for millions of Americans.  It diminishes the participation of the States in the implementation of the Act.  It vastly expands the reach of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s individual mandate, whose scope depends in part on the availability of credits.  What a parody today\xe2\x80\x99s decision makes of Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s assurances to the people of New York: \xe2\x80\x9cThe legislature not only commands the purse but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated.  The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the purse; no direction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the wealth of society, and can take no active resolution whatever.  It may truly be said to have neither force nor will but merely judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion changes the usual rules of statutory interpretation for the sake of the Affordable Care Act.  That, alas, is not a novelty.  In <i>National Federation of Independent Business </i>v. <i>Sebelius</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, this Court revised major components of the statute in order to save them from unconstitutionality.  The Act that Congress passed provides that every individual \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d maintain insurance or else pay a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A.  This Court, however, saw that the Commerce Clause does not authorize a federal mandate to buy health insurance.  So it rewrote the mandate-cum-penalty as a tax.  567 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (principal opinion) (slip op., at 15\xe2\x80\x9345).  The Act that Congress passed also requires every State to accept an expansion of its Medicaid program, or else risk losing <i>all</i> Medicaid funding.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396c.  This Court, however, saw that the Spending Clause does not authorize this coercive condition.  So it rewrote the law to withhold only the <i>incremental</i> funds associated with the Medicaid expansion.  567 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (principal opinion) (slip op., at 45\xe2\x80\x9358).  Having transformed two major parts of the law, the Court today has turned its attention to a third.  The Act that Congress passed makes tax credits available only on an \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court, however, concludes that this limitation would prevent the rest of the Act from working as well as hoped.  So it rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere.  We should start calling this law SCOTUScare.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Perhaps the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will attain the enduring status of the Social Security Act or the Taft-Hartley Act; perhaps not.  But this Court\xe2\x80\x99s two decisions on the Act will surely be remembered through the years.  The somersaults of statutory interpretation they have performed (\xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d means tax, \xe2\x80\x9cfurther [Medicaid] payments to the State\xe2\x80\x9d means only incremental Medicaid payments to the State, \xe2\x80\x9cestablished by the State\xe2\x80\x9d means not established by the State) will be cited by litigants endlessly, to the confusion of honest jurisprudence.  And the cases will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
