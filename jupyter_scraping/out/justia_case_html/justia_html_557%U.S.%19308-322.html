Because it is located in Texas, it is required by \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act) to seek federal preclearance before it can change anything about its elections, even though there is no evidence it has ever discriminated on the basis of race in those elections.  The district filed suit seeking relief under the \xe2\x80\x9cbailout\xe2\x80\x9d provision in \xc2\xa74(a) of the Act, which allows a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d to be released from the preclearance requirements if certain conditions are met.  The district argued in the alternative that, if \xc2\xa75 were interpreted to render it ineligible for bailout, \xc2\xa75 was unconstitutional.  The Federal District Court rejected both claims.  It concluded that bailout under \xc2\xa74(a) is available only to counties, parishes, and subunits that register voters, not to an entity like the district that does not register its own voters.  It also concluded that a 2006 amendment extending \xc2\xa75 for 25 years was constitutional.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The historic accomplishments of the Voting Rights Act are undeniable, but the Act now raises serious constitutional concerns.  The preclearance requirement represents an intrusion into areas of state and local responsibility that is otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.  Some of the conditions that the Court relied upon in upholding this statutory scheme in South Carolina</em> v. <em>Katzenbach</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/index.html">383 U. S. 301</a>, and <em>City of Rome</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/156/index.html">446 U. S. 156</a>, have unquestionably improved.  Those improvements are no doubt due in significant part to the Voting Rights Act itself, and stand as a monument to its success, but the Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.  The Act also differentiates between the States in ways that may no longer be justified.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the Court recognizes that judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is \xe2\x80\x9cthe gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blodgett</em> v. <em>Holden</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/275/142/index.html">275 U. S. 142</a>, 147\xe2\x80\x93148 (Holmes, J., concurring).  Here the District Court found that the sizable record compiled by Congress to support extension of \xc2\xa75 documented continuing racial discrimination and that \xc2\xa75 deterred discriminatory changes.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court will not shrink from its duty \xe2\x80\x9cas the bulwark of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments,\xe2\x80\x9d The Federalist No. 78, but \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is \xe2\x80\xa6 well established\xe2\x80\xa6 that normally the Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Escambia County</em> v. <em>McMillan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/48/index.html">466 U. S. 48</a>, 51.  Here, the district also raises a statutory claim that it is eligible to bail out under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74 and 5, and that claim is sufficient to resolve the appeal.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Act must be interpreted to permit all political subdivisions, including the district, to seek to bail out from the preclearance requirements.  It is undisputed that the district is a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d in the ordinary sense, but the Act also provides a narrower definition in \xc2\xa714(c)(2): \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[P]olitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x99 shall mean any county or parish, except that where registration for voting is not conducted under the supervision of a county or parish, the term shall include any other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for voting.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court below concluded that the district did not qualify for \xc2\xa74(a) bailout under this definition, but specific precedent, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s structure, and underlying constitutional concerns compel a broader reading.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has already established that \xc2\xa714(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s definition does not apply to the term \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance provision.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sheffield Bd. of Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/110/index.html">435 U. S. 110</a>.  Rather, the \xe2\x80\x9cdefinition was intended to operate only for purposes of determining which political units in nondesignated States may be separately designated for coverage under \xc2\xa74(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 128\xe2\x80\x93129.  \xe2\x80\x9d[O]nce a State has been [so] designated \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, [the] definition \xe2\x80\xa6 has no operative significance in determining [\xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s] reach.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dougherty County Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/32/index.html">439 U. S. 32</a>, 44.  In light of these decisions, \xc2\xa714(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s definition should not constrict the availability of bailout either.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government responds that any such argument is foreclosed by <em>City of Rome</em>.  In 1982, however, Congress expressly repudiated <em>City of Rome</em>.  Thus, <em>City of Rome</em>\xe2\x80\x99s logic is no longer applicable.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the district is subject to \xc2\xa75 under <em>Sheffield</em> not because it is a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d but because it is a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d is counterintuitive and similarly untenable after the 1982 amendments.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contrary interpretation has helped to render the bailout provision all but a nullity.  Since 1982, only 17 jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x94out of the more than 12,000 covered political subdivisions\xe2\x80\x94have successfully bailed out of the Act.  It is unlikely that Congress intended the provision to have such limited effect.

The district has an elected board, and is required by \xc2\xa75 to seek preclearance from federal authorities in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C., before it can change anything about those elections.  This is required even though there has never been any evidence of racial discrimination in voting in the district.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The district filed suit seeking relief from these preclearance obligations under the \xe2\x80\x9cbailout\xe2\x80\x9d provision of the Voting Rights Act.  That provision allows the release of a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d from the preclearance requirements if certain rigorous conditions are met.  The court below denied relief, concluding that bailout was unavailable to a political subdivision like the utility district that did not register its own voters.  The district appealed, arguing that the Act imposes no such limitation on bailout, and that if it does, the preclearance requirements are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That constitutional question has attracted ardent briefs from dozens of interested parties, but the importance of the question does not justify our rushing to decide it.  Quite the contrary: Our usual practice is to avoid the unnecessary resolution of constitutional questions.  We agree that the district is eligible under the Act to seek bailout.  We therefore reverse, and do not reach the constitutionality of \xc2\xa75.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifteenth Amendment promises that the \xe2\x80\x9cright of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged \xe2\x80\xa6 on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, \xc2\xa71.  In addition to that self-executing right, the Amendment also gives Congress the \xe2\x80\x9cpower to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72.  The first century of congressional enforcement of the Amendment, however, can only be regarded as a failure.  Early enforcement Acts were inconsistently applied and repealed with the rise of Jim Crow.  <em>South Carolina</em> v. <em>Katzenbach</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/index.html">383 U. S. 301</a>, 310 (1966); A. Keyssar, The Right to Vote 105\xe2\x80\x93111 (2000).  Another series of enforcement statutes in the 1950s and 1960s depended on individual lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice.  But litigation is slow and expensive, and the States were creative in \xe2\x80\x9ccontriving new rules\xe2\x80\x9d to continue violating the Fifteenth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cin the face of adverse federal court decrees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Katzenbach</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 335; <em>Riley</em> v. <em>Kennedy</em>, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress responded with the Voting Rights Act.  Section 2 of the Act operates nationwide; as it exists today, that provision forbids any \xe2\x80\x9cstandard, practice, or procedure\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cresults in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(a).  Section 2 is not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The remainder of the Act constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cscheme of stringent remedies aimed at areas where voting discrimination has been most flagrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Katzenbach</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 315.  Rather than continuing to depend on case-by-case litigation, the Act directly pre-empted the most powerful tools of black disenfranchisement in the covered areas.  All literacy tests and similar voting qualifications were abolished by \xc2\xa74 of the Act.  Voting Rights Act of 1965, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(a)\xe2\x80\x93(d), 79 Stat. 438\xe2\x80\x93439.  Although such tests may have been facially neutral, they were easily manipulated to keep blacks from voting.  The Act also empowered federal examiners to override state determinations about who was eligible to vote.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6, 7, 9, 13, <em>id.,</em> at 439\xe2\x80\x93442, 444\xe2\x80\x93445.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These two remedies were bolstered by \xc2\xa75, which suspended all changes in state election procedure until they were submitted to and approved by a three-judge Federal District Court in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C., or the Attorney General.  <em>Id.</em>, at 439, codified as amended at 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973c(a).  Such preclearance is granted only if the change neither \xe2\x80\x9chas the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We have interpreted the requirements of \xc2\xa75 to apply not only to the ballot-access rights guaranteed by \xc2\xa74, but to drawing district lines as well.  <em>Allen</em> v. <em>State Bd. of Elections</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/544/index.html">393 U. S. 544</a>, 564\xe2\x80\x93565 (1969).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To confine these remedies to areas of flagrant disenfranchisement, the Act applied them only to States that had used a forbidden test or device in November 1964, and had less than 50% voter registration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election.  \xc2\xa74(b), 79 Stat. 438.  Congress recognized that the coverage formula it had adopted \xe2\x80\x9cmight bring within its sweep governmental units not guilty of any unlawful discriminatory voting practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Briscoe</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/404/index.html">432 U. S. 404</a>, 411 (1977).  It therefore \xe2\x80\x9cafforded such jurisdictions immediately available protection in the form of \xe2\x80\xa6 [a] \xe2\x80\x98bailout\xe2\x80\x99 suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To bail out under the current provision, a jurisdiction must seek a declaratory judgment from a three-judge District Court in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71973b(a)(1), 1973c(a).  It must show that for the previous 10 years it has not used any forbidden voting test, has not been subject to any valid objection under \xc2\xa75, and has not been found liable for other voting rights violations; it must also show that it has \xe2\x80\x9cengaged in constructive efforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment\xe2\x80\x9d of voters, and similar measures.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71973b(a)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(F).  The Attorney General can consent to entry of judgment in favor of bailout if the evidence warrants it, though other interested parties are allowed to intervene in the declaratory judgment action.  \xc2\xa71973b(a)(9).  There are other restrictions: To bail out, a covered jurisdiction must show that every jurisdiction in its territory has complied with all of these requirements.  \xc2\xa71973b(a)(3).  The District Court also retains continuing jurisdiction over a successful bailout suit for 10 years, and may reinstate coverage if any violation is found.  \xc2\xa71973b(a)(5).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As enacted, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act were temporary provisions.  They were expected to be in effect for only five years.  \xc2\xa74(a), 79 Stat. 438.  We upheld the temporary Voting Rights Act of 1965 as an appropriate exercise of congressional power in <em>Katzenbach</em>, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he constitutional propriety of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects.\xe2\x80\x9d  383 U. S., at 308.  We concluded that the problems Congress faced when it passed the Act were so dire that \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional conditions [could] justify legislative measures not otherwise appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 334\xe2\x80\x93335 (citing <em>Home Building &amp; Loan Assn.</em> v. <em>Blaisdell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/290/398/index.html">290 U.

S. 332</a> (1917)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress reauthorized the Act in 1970 (for 5 years), 1975 (for 7 years), and 1982 (for 25 years).  The coverage formula remained the same, based on the use of voting-eligibility tests and the rate of registration and turnout among all voters, but the pertinent dates for assessing these criteria moved from 1964 to include 1968 and eventually 1972.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973b(b).  We upheld each of these reauthorizations against constitutional challenges, finding that circumstances continued to justify the provisions.  <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/526/index.html">411 U.

Most recently, in 2006, Congress extended \xc2\xa75 for yet another 25 years.  Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, 120 Stat. 577.  The 2006 Act retained 1972 as the last baseline year for triggering coverage under \xc2\xa75.  It is that latest extension that is now before us.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One was created in 1987 to deliver city services to residents of a portion of Travis County, Texas.  It is governed by a board of five members, elected to staggered terms of four years.  The district does not register voters but is responsible for its own elections; for administrative reasons, those elections are run by Travis County.  Because the district is located in Texas, it is subject to the obligations of \xc2\xa75, although there is no evidence that it has ever discriminated on the basis of race.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The district filed suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking relief under the statute\xe2\x80\x99s bailout provisions and arguing in the alternative that, if interpreted to render the district ineligible for bailout, \xc2\xa75 was unconstitutional.  The three-judge District Court rejected both claims.  Under the statute, only a \xe2\x80\x9cState or political subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d is permitted to seek bailout, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973b(a)(1)(A), and the court concluded that the district was not a political subdivision because that term includes only \xe2\x80\x9ccounties, parishes, and voter-registering subunits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One </em>v.<em> Mukasey</em>, 573 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 221, 232 (2008).  Turning to the district\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional challenge, the court concluded that the 25-year extension of \xc2\xa75 was constitutional both because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\xa6 rationally concluded that extending [\xc2\xa7]5 was necessary to protect minorities from continued racial discrimination in voting\xe2\x80\x9d and because \xe2\x80\x9cthe 2006 Amendment qualifies as a congruent and proportional response to the continuing problem of racial discrimination in voting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 283.

C.  The preclearance requirement applies broadly, <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Hampton County Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/166/index.html">470 U. S. 166</a>, 175\xe2\x80\x93176 (1985), and in particular to every political subdivision in a covered State, no matter how small, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sheffield Bd. of Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/110/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/110/index.html">435 U.

Things have changed in the South.  Voter turnout and registration rates now approach parity.  Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare.  And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.  See generally H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x93478, at 12\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These improvements are no doubt due in significant part to the Voting Rights Act itself, and stand as a monument to its success.  Past success alone, however, is not adequate justification to retain the preclearance requirements.  See Issacharoff, Is Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act a Victim of Its Own Success? 104 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1710 (2004).  It may be that these improvements are insufficient and that conditions continue to warrant preclearance under the Act.  But the Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act also differentiates between the States, despite our historic tradition that all the States enjoy \xe2\x80\x9cequal sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/363/1/index.html">363 U. S. 1</a>, 16 (1960) (citing <em>Lessee of Pollard</em> v. <em>Hagan</em>, 3 How. 212, 223 (1845)); see also <em>Texas</em> v. <em>White</em>, 7 Wall. 700, 725\xe2\x80\x93726 (1869).  Distinctions can be justified in some cases.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctrine of the equality of States \xe2\x80\xa6 does not bar \xe2\x80\xa6 remedies for <em>local</em> evils which have subsequently appeared.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Katzenbach</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 328\xe2\x80\x93329 (emphasis added).  But a departure from the fundamental principle of equal sovereignty requires a showing that a statute\xe2\x80\x99s disparate geographic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These federalism concerns are underscored by the argument that the preclearance requirements in one State would be unconstitutional in another.  See <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html">539 U. S. 461</a>, 491\xe2\x80\x93492 (2003) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cRace cannot be the predominant factor in redistricting under our decision in <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/900/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/900/index.html">515 U. S. 900</a> (1995).  Yet considerations of race that would doom a redistricting plan under the Fourteenth Amendment or \xc2\xa72 seem to be what save it under \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x9d).  Additional constitutional concerns are raised in saying that this tension between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72 and 5 must persist in covered jurisdictions and not elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evil that \xc2\xa75 is meant to address may no longer be concentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclearance.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage formula is based on data that is now more than 35 years old, and there is considerable evidence that it fails to account for current political conditions.  For example, the racial gap in voter registration and turnout is lower in the States originally covered by \xc2\xa75 than it is nationwide.  E. Blum &amp; L. Campbell, Assessment of Voting Rights Progress in Jurisdictions Covered Under Section Five of the Voting Rights Act 3\xe2\x80\x936 (American Enterprise Institute, 2006).

We fully appreciate that judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is \xe2\x80\x9cthe gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blodgett</em> v. <em>Holden</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/275/142/index.html">275 U.

Here, the district also raises a statutory claim that it is eligible to bail out under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74 and 5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas argues that the principle of constitutional avoidance has no pertinence here.  He contends that even if we resolve the district\xe2\x80\x99s statutory argument in its favor, we would still have to reach the constitutional question, because the district\xe2\x80\x99s statutory argument would not afford it all the relief it seeks.  <em>Post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x933 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree.  The district expressly describes its constitutional challenge to \xc2\xa75 as being \xe2\x80\x9cin the alternative\xe2\x80\x9d to its statutory argument.  See Brief for Appellant 64 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Court should reverse the judgment of the district court and render judgment that the district is entitled to use the bailout procedure or, in the alternative, that \xc2\xa75 cannot be constitutionally applied to the district\xe2\x80\x9d).  The district\xe2\x80\x99s counsel confirmed this at oral argument.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (\xe2\x80\x9c[Question:] [D]o you acknowledge that if we find in your favor on the bailout point we need not reach the constitutional point?  [Answer:] I do acknowledge that\xe2\x80\x9d).  We therefore turn to the district\xe2\x80\x99s statutory argument.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act authorizes a bailout suit by a \xe2\x80\x9cState or political subdivision.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973b(a)(1)(A).  There is no dispute that the district is a political subdivision of the State of Texas in the ordinary sense of the term.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1197 (8th ed. 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cA division of a state that exists primarily to discharge some function of local government\xe2\x80\x9d).  The district was created under Texas law with \xe2\x80\x9cpowers of government\xe2\x80\x9d relating to local utilities and natural resources.  Tex. Const., Art. XVI, \xc2\xa759(b); Tex. Water Code Ann. \xc2\xa754.011 (West 2002); see also <em>Bennett</em> v. <em>Brown Cty. Water Improvement Dist.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973<em>l</em>(c)(2).  The District Court concluded that this definition applied to the bailout provision in \xc2\xa74(a), and that the district did not qualify, since it is not a county or parish and does not conduct its own voter registration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cStatutory definitions control the meaning of statutory words, of course, in the usual case.  But this is an unusual case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lawson</em> v. <em>Suwannee Fruit &amp; S. S. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/198/index.html">336 U.

Were the scope of \xc2\xa74(a) considered in isolation from the rest of the statute and our prior cases, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach might well be correct.  But here specific precedent, the structure of the Voting Rights Act, and underlying constitutional concerns compel a broader reading of the bailout provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Importantly, we do not write on a blank slate.  Our decisions have already established that the statutory definition in \xc2\xa714(c)(2) does not apply to every use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act.  We have, for example, concluded that the definition does not apply to the preclearance obligation of \xc2\xa75.  According to its text, \xc2\xa75 applies only \xe2\x80\x9c[w]henever a [covered] State or political subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d enacts or administers a new voting practice.  Yet in <em>Sheffield Bd. of Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/110/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/110/index.html">435 U. S. 110</a>, we rejected the argument by a Texas city that it was neither a State nor a political subdivision as defined in the Act, and therefore did not need to seek preclearance of a voting change.  The dissent agreed with the city, pointing out that the city did not meet the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore could not be covered.  <em>Id.,</em> at 141\xe2\x80\x93144 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  The majority, however, relying on the purpose and structure of the Act, concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cdefinition was intended to operate only for purposes of determining which political units in nondesignated States may be separately designated for coverage under \xc2\xa74(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 128\xe2\x80\x93129; see also <em>id.,</em> at 130, n.\xc2\xa018 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive objective in \xc2\xa714(c)(2) was to limit the jurisdictions which may be separately designated for coverage under \xc2\xa74(b)\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reaffirmed this restricted scope of the statutory definition the next Term in <em>Dougherty County Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/32/index.html">439 U. S. 32</a> (1978).  There, a school board argued that because \xe2\x80\x9cit d[id] not meet the definition\xe2\x80\x9d of political subdivision in \xc2\xa714(c)(2), it \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not come within the purview of \xc2\xa75.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 43, 44.  We responded:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis contention is squarely foreclosed by our decision last Term in [<em>Sheffield</em>].  There, we expressly rejected the suggestion that the city of Sheffield was beyond the ambit of \xc2\xa75 because it did not itself register voters and hence was not a political subdivision as the term is defined in \xc2\xa714(c)(2) of the Act. \xe2\x80\xa6 [O]nce a State has been designated for coverage, \xc2\xa714(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of political subdivision has no operative significance in determining the reach of \xc2\xa75.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to these decisions, then, the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa714(c)(2) does not apply to every use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act.  Even the intervenors who oppose the district\xe2\x80\x99s bailout concede, for example, that the definition should not apply to \xc2\xa72, which bans racial discrimination in voting by \xe2\x80\x9cany State or political subdivision,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(a).  See Brief for Intervenor-Appellee Texas State Conference of NAACP Branches et al. 17 (citing <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power Dist., </em>109 F.\xc2\xa03d 586, 592\xe2\x80\x93593 (CA9 1997)); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Uvalde Consol.

In light of our holdings that the statutory definition does not constrict the scope of preclearance required by \xc2\xa75, the district argues, it only stands to reason that the definition should not constrict the availability of bailout from those preclearance requirements either.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government responds that any such argument is foreclosed by our interpretation of the statute in <em>City of Rome</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/156/index.html"></a><a href="/us/446/156/index.html">446 U. S. 156</a>.  There, it argues, we made clear that the discussion of political subdivisions in <em>Sheffield</em> was dictum, and \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically held that a \xe2\x80\x98city is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa74(a) bailout.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Appellee 14 (quoting <em>City of Rome</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 168).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if that is what <em>City of Rome</em> held, the premises of its statutory holding did not survive later changes in the law.  In <em>City of Rome</em> we rejected the city\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to bail out from coverage under \xc2\xa75, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical units of a covered jurisdiction cannot independently bring a \xc2\xa74(a) bailout action.\xe2\x80\x9d  446 U. S., at 167.  We concluded that the statute as then written authorized a bailout suit only by a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the coverage formula, or a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision with respect to which [coverage] determinations have been made as a separate unit,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 164, n.\xc2\xa02 (quoting 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973b(a) (1976 ed.)); see also 446 U. S., at 163\xe2\x80\x93169.  Political subdivisions covered because they were part of a covered State, rather than because of separate coverage determinations, could not separately bail out.  As Justice Stevens put it, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he political subdivisions of a covered State\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9cnot entitled to bail out in a piecemeal fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 192 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1982, however, Congress expressly repudiated <em>City of Rome</em> and instead embraced \xe2\x80\x9cpiecemeal\xe2\x80\x9d bailout.  As part of an overhaul of the bailout provision, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act to expressly provide that bailout was also available to \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivisions\xe2\x80\x9d in a covered State, \xe2\x80\x9cthough [coverage] determinations were <em>not</em> made with respect to such subdivision as a separate unit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982, 96 Stat. 131, codified at 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973b(a)(1) (emphasis added).  In other words, Congress decided that a jurisdiction covered because it was within a covered State need not remain covered for as long as the State did.  If the subdivision met the bailout requirements, it could bail out, even if the State could not.  In light of these amendments, our logic for denying bailout in <em>City of Rome</em> is no longer applicable to the Voting Rights Act\xe2\x80\x94if anything, that logic compels the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bailout and preclearance under \xc2\xa75 are now governed by a principle of symmetry.  \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Sheffield</em> that all political units in a covered State are to be treated for \xc2\xa75 purposes as though they were \xe2\x80\x98political subdivisions\xe2\x80\x99 of that State, it follows that they should also be treated as such for purposes of \xc2\xa74(a)\xe2\x80\x99s bailout provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>City of Rome</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 192 (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends that this reading of <em>Sheffield</em> is mistaken, and that the district is subject to \xc2\xa75 under our decision in <em>Sheffield</em> not because it is a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d but because it is a \xe2\x80\x9cState.\xe2\x80\x9d  That would mean it could bail out only if the whole State could bail out.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The assertion that the district is a State is at least counterintuitive.  We acknowledge, however, that there has been much confusion over why <em>Sheffield</em> held the city in that case to be covered by the text of \xc2\xa75.  See <em>City of Rome</em>, 446 U. S., at 168\xe2\x80\x93169; <em>id.,</em> at 192 (Stevens, J., concurring); see also <em>Uvalde Consol. Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1002/index.html">451 U. S. 1002</a>, 1004, n.\xc2\xa04 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]his Court has not yet settled on the proper construction of the term \xe2\x80\x98political subdivision\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But after the 1982 amendments, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position is untenable.  If the district is considered the State, and therefore necessarily subject to preclearance so long as Texas is covered, then the same must be true of all other subdivisions of the State, including counties.  That would render even counties unable to seek bailout so long as their State was covered.  But that is the very restriction the 1982 amendments overturned.  Nobody denies that counties in a covered State can seek bailout, as several of them have.  See Voting Rights Act: Section 5 of the Act\xe2\x80\x94History, Scope, and Purpose: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 1st Sess., 2599\xe2\x80\x932834 (2005) (detailing bailouts).  Because such piecemeal bailout is now permitted, it cannot be true that \xc2\xa75 treats every governmental unit as the State itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contrary interpretation has helped to render the bailout provision all but a nullity.  Since 1982, only 17 jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x94out of the more than 12,000 covered political subdivisions\xe2\x80\x94have successfully bailed out of the Act.  App. to Brief for Jurisdictions That Have Bailed Out as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3; Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 2002 Census of Governments, Vol. 1, No. 1, pp. 1, 22\xe2\x80\x9360.  It is unlikely that Congress intended the provision to have such limited effect.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hayes</em>, 555 U.

Because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statutory decision does not provide appellant with full relief, I conclude that it is inappropriate to apply the constitutional avoidance doctrine in this case.  I would therefore decide the constitutional issue presented and hold that \xc2\xa75 exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doctrine of constitutional avoidance factors heavily in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that appellant is eligible for bailout as a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa74(a) of the VRA.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11.<em> </em>Regardless of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the statutory question, I am in full agreement that this case raises serious questions concerning the constitutionality of \xc2\xa75 of the VRA.  But,<em> </em>unlike the Court, I do not believe that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance is applicable here.  The ultimate relief sought in this case is not bailout eligibility\xe2\x80\x94it is bailout itself.  See First Amended Complaint in No. 06\xe2\x80\x931384 (DDC), p.\xc2\xa08, Record, Doc. 83 (\xe2\x80\x9cPlaintiff requests the Court to declare that the district has met the bail-out requirements of \xc2\xa74 of the [VRA] and that the preclearance requirements of \xc2\xa75 \xe2\x80\xa6 no longer apply to the district; or, in the alternative, that \xc2\xa75 of the Act as applied to the district is an unconstitutional overextension of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement power to remedy past violations of the Fifteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Eligibility for bailout turns on the statutory question addressed by the Court\xe2\x80\x94the proper definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d in the bailout clauses of \xc2\xa74(a) of the VRA.  Entitlement to bailout, however, requires a covered \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical subdivision\xe2\x80\x9d to submit substantial evidence indicating that it is not engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination in voting on account of race,\xe2\x80\x9d see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973b(a)(3).  The Court properly declines to give appellant bailout because appellant has not yet proved its compliance with the statutory requirements for such relief.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71973b(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  In fact, the record below shows that appellant\xe2\x80\x99s factual entitlement to bailout is a vigorously contested issue.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, NAACP\xe2\x80\x99s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in No. 06\xe2\x80\x931384 (DDC), pp.\xc2\xa0490\xe2\x80\x93492, Record, Doc. 100; Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Statement of Uncontested Material Facts in No. 06\xe2\x80\x931384 (DDC), \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb619, 59, Record, Doc. 98.  Given its resolution of the statutory question, the Court has thus correctly remanded the case for resolution of appellant\xe2\x80\x99s factual entitlement to bailout.  See <em>ante</em>, at 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But because the Court is not in a position to award appellant bailout, adjudication of the constitutionality of \xc2\xa75, in my view, cannot be avoided.  \xe2\x80\x9cTraditionally, the avoidance canon was not a doctrine under which courts read statutes to avoid mere constitutional doubts.  Instead, it commanded courts, when faced with two plausible constructions of a statute\xe2\x80\x94one constitutional and the other unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x94to choose the constitutional reading.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Martinez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/371/index.html">543 U. S. 371</a>, 395 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  To the extent that constitutional avoidance is a worthwhile tool of statutory construction, it is because it allows a court to dispose of an entire case on grounds that do not require the court to pass on a statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  See <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Mayor of Philadelphia</em> v. <em>Educational Equality League</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/605/index.html">415 U. S. 605</a>, 629 (1974).  The doctrine \xe2\x80\x9cavoids decision of constitutional questions where possible, and it permits one lawsuit, rather than two, to resolve the entire controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  C. Wright, The Law of Federal Courts \xc2\xa719, p. 104 (4th ed. 1983).  Absent a determination that appellant is not just eligible for bailout, but is entitled to it, this case will not have been entirely disposed of on a nonconstitutional ground.  Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the Court were to give us bailout \xe2\x80\xa6 the Court might choose on its own not to reach the constitutional issues because we would receive relief\xe2\x80\x9d).  Invocation of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance is therefore inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doctrine of constitutional avoidance is also unavailable here because an interpretation of \xc2\xa74(a) that merely makes more political subdivisions <em>eligible</em> for bailout does not render \xc2\xa75 constitutional and the Court notably does not suggest otherwise.  See <em>Clark</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 396 (Thomas, J., dissenting).<em> </em>Bailout eligibility is a distant prospect for most covered jurisdictions.  To obtain bailout a covered jurisdiction must satisfy numerous objective criteria.  It must show that during the previous 10 years: (A) no \xe2\x80\x9ctest or device has been used within such State or political subdivision for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color\xe2\x80\x9d; (B) \xe2\x80\x9cno final judgment of any court of the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 has determined that denials or abridgments of the right to vote on account of race or color have occurred anywhere in the territory of\xe2\x80\x9d the covered jurisdiction; (C) \xe2\x80\x9cno Federal examiners or observers \xe2\x80\xa6 have been assigned to\xe2\x80\x9d the covered jurisdiction; (D) the covered jurisdiction has fully complied with \xc2\xa75; and (E) \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General has not interposed any objection (that has not been overturned by a final judgment of a court) and no declaratory judgment has been denied under [\xc2\xa75].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71973b(a)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(E).  The jurisdiction also has the burden of presenting \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of minority participation, including evidence of the levels of minority group registration and voting, changes in such levels over time, and disparities between minority-group and non-minority-group participation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71973b(a)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These extensive requirements may be difficult to satisfy, see Brief for Georgia Governor Sonny Purdue as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20\xe2\x80\x9326, but at least they are objective.  The covered jurisdiction seeking bailout must also meet subjective criteria: it must \xe2\x80\x9c(i) have eliminated voting procedures and methods of election which inhibit or dilute equal access to the electoral process; (ii) have engaged in constructive efforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment of persons exercising rights protected [under the Act]; and (iii) have engaged in other constructive efforts, such as expanded opportunity for convenient registration and voting for every person of voting age and the appointment of minority persons as election officials throughout the jurisdiction and at all stages of the election and registration process.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71973b(a)(1)(F)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iii).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a result, a covered jurisdiction meeting each of the objective conditions could nonetheless be denied bailout because it has not, in the subjective view of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, engaged in sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive efforts\xe2\x80\x9d to expand voting opportunities, \xc2\xa71973b(a)(1)(F)(iii).  Congress, of course, has complete authority to set the terms of bailout.  But its promise of a bailout opportunity has, in the great majority of cases, turned out to be no more than a mirage.  As the Court notes, only a handful \xe2\x80\x9cof the more than 12,000 covered political subdivisions \xe2\x80\xa6 have successfully bailed out of the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16;[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] see Williamson, The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Statutory Analysis of the Revised Bailout Provisions, 62 Wash. U.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0Q. 1, 42 (1984) (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe conditions for termination of coverage have been made so restrictive that bailout will continue to be impossible for most jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, bailout eligibility does not eliminate the issue of \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court quite properly alerts Congress that \xc2\xa75 tests the outer boundaries of its Fifteenth Amendment enforcement authority and may not be constitutional.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.  And, although I respect the Court\xe2\x80\x99s careful approach to this weighty issue, I nevertheless believe it is necessary to definitively resolve that important question.  For the reasons set forth below, I conclude that the lack of current evidence of intentional discrimination with respect to voting renders \xc2\xa75 unconstitutional.  The provision can no longer be justified as an appropriate mechanism for enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe government of the United States is one of delegated powers alone.  Its authority is defined and limited by the Constitution.  All powers not granted to it by that instrument are reserved to the States or the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cruikshank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/542/index.html">92 U. S. 542</a>, 551 (1876); see also <em>U. S. Term Limits, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thornton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/779/index.html">514 U. S. 779</a>, 848 (1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  In the specific area of voting rights, this Court has consistently recognized that the Constitution gives the States primary authority over the structuring of electoral systems.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>White</em> v. <em>Weiser</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/783/index.html">412 U. S. 783</a>, 795 (1973); <em>Burns</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/73/index.html">384 U. S. 73</a>, 84\xe2\x80\x9385 (1966).  \xe2\x80\x9cNo function is more essential to the separate and independent existence of the States and their governments than the power to determine within the limits of the Constitution the qualifications of their own voters for state, county, and municipal offices and the nature of their own machinery for filling local public offices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/112/index.html">400 U. S. 112</a>, 125 (1970) (opinion of Black, J.).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0State autonomy with respect to the machinery of self-government defines the States as sovereign entities rather than mere provincial outposts subject to every dictate of a central governing authority.  See U. S. Const., Amdt. 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Alden</em> v. <em>Maine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/706/index.html">527 U. S. 706</a>, 713 (1999).  In the main, the \xe2\x80\x9cFramers of the Constitution intended the States to keep for themselves, as provided in the Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gregory</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/452/index.html">501 U.

The Fifteenth Amendment guarantees that the \xe2\x80\x9cright of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71, and it grants Congress the authority to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d these rights \xe2\x80\x9cby appropriate legislation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72.  The Fifteenth Amendment thus renders unconstitutional any federal or state law that would limit a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s access to the ballot on one of the three bases enumerated in the Amendment.  See <em>Mobile</em> v. <em>Bolden</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/index.html"></a><a href="/us/446/55/index.html">446 U.

Nonetheless, because States still retain sovereign authority over their election systems, any measure enacted in furtherance of the Fifteenth Amendment must be closely examined to ensure that its encroachment on state authority in this area is limited to the appropriate enforcement of this ban on discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is certainly no question that the VRA initially \xe2\x80\x9cwas passed pursuant to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Fifteenth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Monterey County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/266/index.html">525 U.

Section 5 \xe2\x80\x9cwas a response to a common practice in some jurisdictions of staying one step ahead of the federal courts by passing new discriminatory voting laws as soon as the old ones had been struck down.  That practice had been possible because each new law remained in effect until the Justice Department or private plaintiffs were able to sustain the burden of proving that the new law, too, was discriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Beer</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/130/index.html">425 U.

Almost immediately following Reconstruction, blacks attempting to vote were met with coordinated intimidation and violence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, L. McDonald, A Voting Rights Odyssey: Black Enfranchisement in Georgia 34 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cBy 1872, the legislative and executive branches of state government \xe2\x80\xa6 were once again firmly in the control of white Democrats, who resorted to a variety of tactics, including fraud, intimidation, and violence, to take away the vote from blacks, despite ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  A soon-to-be victorious mayoral candidate in Wilmington, North Carolina, for example, urged white voters in an 1898 election-eve speech: \xe2\x80\x9cGo to the polls tomorrow and if you find the negro out voting, tell him to leave the polls, and if he refuses kill him; shoot him down in his tracks.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.

And only such a punitive measure [as \xc2\xa75] had any hope of forcing the South to let blacks vote\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was against this backdrop of \xe2\x80\x9chistorical experience\xe2\x80\x9d that \xc2\xa75 was first enacted and upheld against a constitutional challenge.  See <em>Katzenbach</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 308.  As the <em>Katzenbach</em> Court explained, \xc2\xa75, which applied to those States and political subdivisions that had employed discriminatory tests and devices in the previous Presidential election, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973b(b), directly targeted the \xe2\x80\x9cinsidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  383 U. S., at 309; see also <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 329 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress began work with reliable evidence of actual voting discrimination in a great majority of the States and political subdivisions affected by the new remedies of the Act\xe2\x80\x9d).  According to the Court, it was appropriate to radically interfere with control over local elections only in those jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory disenfranchisement as those were \xe2\x80\x9cthe geographic areas where immediate action seemed necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 328.  The Court believed it was thus \xe2\x80\x9cpermissible to impose the new remedies\xe2\x80\x9d on the jurisdictions covered under \xc2\xa74(b) \xe2\x80\x9cat least in the absence of proof that they ha[d] been free of substantial voting discrimination in recent years.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In upholding \xc2\xa75 in <em>Katzenbach</em>, the Court nonetheless noted that the provision was an \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon exercise of congressional power\xe2\x80\x9d that would not have been \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d absent the \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional conditions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunique circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d present in the targeted jurisdictions at that particular time.  <em>Id., </em>at 334\xe2\x80\x93335.  In reaching its decision, the Court thus refused to simply accept Congress\xe2\x80\x99 representation that the extreme measure was necessary to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment; rather, it closely reviewed the record compiled by Congress to ensure that \xc2\xa75 was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98appropriate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d antievasion legislation.  See <em>id</em>.<em>, </em>at 308.  In so doing, the Court highlighted evidence showing that black voter registration rates ran approximately 50 percentage points lower than white voter registration in several States.  See <em>id.,</em> at 313.  It also noted that the registration rate for blacks in Alabama \xe2\x80\x9crose only from 14.2% to 19.4% between 1958 and 1964; in Louisiana it barely inched ahead from 31.7% to 31.8% between 1956 and 1965; and in Mississippi it increased only from 4.4% to 6.4% between 1954 and 1964.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court further observed that voter turnout levels in covered jurisdictions had been at least 12% below the national average in the 1964 Presidential election.  See <em>id.</em>, at 329\xe2\x80\x93330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statistical evidence confirmed Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment that \xe2\x80\x9cthe extraordinary stratagem of contriving new rules of various kinds for the sole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse federal court decrees\xe2\x80\x9d was working and could not be defeated through case-by-case enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 335.  This record also clearly supported Congress\xe2\x80\x99 predictive judgment that such \xe2\x80\x9cStates might try similar maneuvers in the future in order to evade the remedies for voting discrimination contained in the Act itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>These stark statistics\xe2\x80\x94in conjunction with the unrelenting use of discriminatory tests and practices that denied blacks the right to vote\xe2\x80\x94constituted sufficient proof of \xe2\x80\x9cactual voting discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d to uphold the preclearance requirement imposed by \xc2\xa75 on the covered jurisdictions as an appropriate exercise of congressional power under the Fifteenth Amendment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 330.  It was only \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder the compulsion of these unique circumstances [that] Congress responded in a permissibly decisive manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 335.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several important principles emerge from <em>Katzenbach </em>and the decisions that followed it.  First, \xc2\xa75 prohibits more state voting practices than those necessarily encompassed by the explicit prohibition on intentional discrimination found in the text of the Fifteenth Amendment.  The explicit command of the Fifteenth Amendment is a prohibition on state practices that in fact deny individuals the right to vote \xe2\x80\x9con account of\xe2\x80\x9d race, color, or previous servitude.  In contrast, \xc2\xa75 is the quintessential prophylaxis; it \xe2\x80\x9cgoes beyond the prohibition of the Fifteenth Amendment by suspending <em>all</em> changes to state election law\xe2\x80\x94however innocuous\xe2\x80\x94until they have been precleared by federal authorities in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  The Court has freely acknowledged that such legislation is preventative, upholding it based on the view that the Reconstruction Amendments give Congress the power \xe2\x80\x9cboth to remedy and to <em>deter</em> violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a <em>somewhat broader</em> swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kimel</em> v. <em>Florida Bd. of Regents</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/62/index.html">528 U. S. 62</a>, 81 (2000) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, because it sweeps more broadly than the substantive command of the Fifteenth Amendment, \xc2\xa75 pushes the outer boundaries of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Fifteenth Amendment enforcement authority.  See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/900/index.html">515 U. S. 900</a>, 926 (1995) (detailing the \xe2\x80\x9cfederalism costs exacted by \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Presley</em> v. <em>Etowah County Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/491/index.html">502 U. S. 491</a>, 500\xe2\x80\x93501 (1992) (describing \xc2\xa75 as \xe2\x80\x9can extraordinary departure from the traditional course of relations between the States and the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>City of Rome</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/156/index.html">446 U. S. 156</a>, 200 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe preclearance requirement both intrudes on the prerogatives of state and local governments and abridges the voting rights of all citizens in States covered under the Act\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Lopez</em>, 525 U.

Even the Department of Justice has described it as a \xe2\x80\x98substantial departure \xe2\x80\xa6 from ordinary concepts of our federal system\xe2\x80\x99; its encroachment on state sovereignty is significant and undeniable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sheffield Bd. of Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/110/index.html">435 U. S. 110</a>, 141 (1978) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted).  This \xe2\x80\x9cencroachment is especially troubling because it destroys local control of the means of self-government, one of the central values of our polity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>City of Rome</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 201 (Powell, J., dissenting).<em> </em> More than 40 years after its enactment, this intrusion has become increasingly difficult to justify.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, to accommodate the tension between the constitutional imperatives of the Fifteenth and Tenth Amendments\xe2\x80\x94a balance between allowing the Federal Government to patrol state voting practices for discrimination and preserving the States\xe2\x80\x99 significant interest in self-determination\xe2\x80\x94the constitutionality of \xc2\xa75 has always depended on the proven existence of intentional discrimination so extensive that elimination of it through case-by-case enforcement would be impossible.  See <em>Katzenbach</em>, 383 U. S., at 308 (\xe2\x80\x9cBefore enacting the measure, Congress explored with great care the problem of racial discrimination in voting\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Katzenbach</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/641/index.html">384 U.

Essential to our holdings in [<em>South Carolina</em> v.] <em>Katzenbach </em>and <em>City of Rome</em> was our conclusion that Congress was remedying the effects of prior <em>intentional </em>racial discrimination.  In both cases, we required Congress to have some evidence that the jurisdiction burdened with preclearance obligations had actually engaged in such intentional discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em>,\n<em>supra</em>, at 294\xe2\x80\x93295 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (emphasis in\noriginal).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has never deviated from this understanding.  We have explained that prophylactic legislation designed to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments must \xe2\x80\x9cidentify conduct transgressing the \xe2\x80\xa6 substantive provisions\xe2\x80\x9d it seeks to enforce and be tailored \xe2\x80\x9cto remedying or preventing such conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.</em> v. <em>College Savings Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/627/index.html">527 U. S. 627</a>, 639 (1999).  Congress must establish a \xe2\x80\x9chistory and pattern\xe2\x80\x9d of constitutional violations to establish the need for \xc2\xa75 by justifying a remedy that pushes the limits of its constitutional authority.  <em>Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.</em> v. <em>Garrett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/356/index.html">531 U. S. 356</a>, 368 (2001).  As a result, for \xc2\xa75 to withstand renewed constitutional scrutiny, there must be a demonstrated connection between the \xe2\x80\x9cremedial measures\xe2\x80\x9d chosen and the \xe2\x80\x9cevil presented\xe2\x80\x9d in the record made by Congress when it renewed the Act.  <em>City of Boerne</em> v. <em>Flores</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/507/index.html">521 U. S. 507</a>, 530 (1997).  \xe2\x80\x9cStrong measures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted response to another, lesser one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The extensive pattern of discrimination that led the Court to previously uphold \xc2\xa75 as enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment no longer exists.  Covered jurisdictions are not now engaged in a systematic campaign to deny black citizens access to the ballot through intimidation and violence.  And the days of \xe2\x80\x9cgrandfather clauses, property qualifications, \xe2\x80\x98good character\xe2\x80\x99 tests, and the requirement that registrants \xe2\x80\x98understand\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98interpret\xe2\x80\x99 certain matter,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Katzenbach</em>, 383 U. S., at 311, are gone.  There is thus currently no concerted effort in these jurisdictions to engage in the \xe2\x80\x9cunremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 309, that served as the constitutional basis for upholding the \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon exercise of congressional power\xe2\x80\x9d embodied in \xc2\xa75, <em>id.,</em> at 334.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lack of sufficient evidence that the covered jurisdictions currently engage in the type of discrimination that underlay the enactment of \xc2\xa75 undermines any basis for retaining it.  Punishment for long past sins is not a legitimate basis for imposing a forward-looking preventative measure that has already served its purpose.  Those supporting \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s reenactment argue that without it these jurisdictions would return to the racially discriminatory practices of 30 and 40 years ago.  But there is no evidence that public officials stand ready, if given the chance, to again engage in concerted acts of violence, terror, and subterfuge in order to keep minorities from voting.  Without such evidence, the charge can only be premised on outdated assumptions about racial attitudes in the covered jurisdictions.  Admitting that a prophylactic law as broad as \xc2\xa75 is no longer constitutionally justified based on current evidence of discrimination is not a sign of defeat.  It is an acknowledgment of victory.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The current statistical evidence confirms that the emergency that prompted the enactment of \xc2\xa75 has long since passed.  By 2006, the voter registration rates for blacks in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi had jumped to 71.8%, 66.9%, and 72.2%, respectively.  See App. to Brief for Southeastern Legal Foundation as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>6a\xe2\x80\x937a (hereinafter SLF Brief).  Therefore, in contrast to the <em>Katzenbach </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the \xe2\x80\x9cregistration of voting-age whites ran roughly 50 percentage points or more ahead of Negro registration\xe2\x80\x9d in these States in 1964, see 383 U. S., at 313, since that time this disparity has nearly vanished.  In 2006, the disparity was only 3 percentage points in Alabama, 8 percentage points in Louisiana, and in Mississippi, black voter registration actually exceeded white voter registration by 1.5 percentage points.  See App. to SLF Brief 6a\xe2\x80\x937a.  In addition, blacks in these three covered States also have higher registration numbers than the registration rate for whites in noncovered states.  See E. Blum &amp; L. Campbell, Assessment of Voting Rights Progress in Jurisdictions Covered Under Section Five of the Voting Rights Act 3\xe2\x80\x936 (American Enterprise Institute, 2006); see also S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x93295, p.\xc2\xa011 (2006) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cpresently in seven of the covered States, African-Americans are registered at a rate higher than the national average\xe2\x80\x9d; in two more, black registration in the 2004 election was \xe2\x80\x9cidentical to the national average\xe2\x80\x9d; and in \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas, black registration and turnout in the 2004 election \xe2\x80\xa6 was higher than that for whites\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, when reenacting \xc2\xa75 in 2006, Congress evidently understood that the emergency conditions which prompted \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s original enactment no longer exist.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x93478, p.\xc2\xa012 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe record reveals that many of the first generation barriers to minority voter registration and voter turnout that were in place prior to the VRA have been eliminated\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead of relying on the kind of evidence that the <em>Katzenbach</em> Court had found so persuasive, Congress instead based reenactment on evidence of what it termed \xe2\x80\x9csecond generation barriers constructed to prevent minority voters from fully participating in the electoral process.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72(b)(2), 120 Stat. 577.  But such evidence is not probative of the type of purposeful discrimination that prompted Congress to enact \xc2\xa75 in 1965.  For example, Congress relied upon evidence of racially polarized voting within the covered jurisdictions.  But racially polarized voting is not evidence of unconstitutional discrimination, see <em>Bolden</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/index.html"></a><a href="/us/446/55/index.html">446 U. S. 55</a>, is not state action, see <em>James</em> v. <em>Bowman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/190/127/index.html">190 U. S. 127</a>, 136 (1903), and is not a problem unique to the South, see Katz, Aisenbrey, Baldwin, Cheuse, &amp; Weisbrodt, Documenting Discrimination in Voting: Judicial Findings Under Section 2 of The Voting Rights Act Since 1982, 39 U. Mich. J.\xc2\xa0L. Reform 643, 665 (2006).  The other evidence relied on by Congress, such as \xc2\xa75 enforcement actions, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72 and 4 lawsuits, and federal examiner and observer coverage, also bears no resemblance to the record initially supporting \xc2\xa75, and is plainly insufficient to sustain such an extraordinary remedy.  See SLF Brief 18\xe2\x80\x9335.  In sum, evidence of \xe2\x80\x9csecond generation barriers\xe2\x80\x9d cannot compare to the prevalent and pervasive voting discrimination of the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to say that voter discrimination is extinct.  Indeed, the District Court singled out a handful of examples of allegedly discriminatory voting practices from the record made by Congress.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One </em>v. <em>Mukasey, </em>573 F. Supp. 2d. 221, 252\xe2\x80\x93254, 256\xe2\x80\x93262 (DDC 2008).  But the existence of discrete and isolated incidents of interference with the right to vote has never been sufficient justification for the imposition of \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary requirements.  From its inception, the statute was promoted as a measure needed to neutralize a coordinated and unrelenting campaign to deny an entire race access to the ballot.<em> </em>See <em>City of Boerne</em>, 521 U. S., at 526 (concluding that <em>Katzenbach </em>confronted a \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights resulting from this country\xe2\x80\x99s history of racial discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).  Perfect compliance with the Fifteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s substantive command is not now\xe2\x80\x94nor has it ever been\xe2\x80\x94the yardstick for determining whether Congress has the power to employ broad prophylactic legislation to enforce that Amendment.  The burden remains with Congress to prove that the extreme circumstances warranting \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s enactment persist today.  A record of scattered infringement of the right to vote is not a constitutionally acceptable substitute.<font super="1"> </font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in order to guarantee that no citizen would be denied the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

But now\xe2\x80\x94more than 40 years later\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93the violence, intimidation, and subterfuge that led Congress to pass \xc2\xa75 and this Court to uphold it no longer remains.  An acknowledgment of \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutionality represents a fulfillment of the Fifteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s promise of full enfranchisement and honors the success achieved by the VRA. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0All 17 covered jurisdictions that have been awarded bailout are from Virginia, see <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316,<em> </em>and all 17 were represented by the same attorney\xe2\x80\x94a former lawyer in the Voting Rights Section of the Department of Justice, see Hebert, An Assessment of the Bailout Provisions of the Voting Rights Act, in Voting Rights Act Reauthorization of 2006, p.\xc2\xa0257, n.\xc2\xa01 (A.
