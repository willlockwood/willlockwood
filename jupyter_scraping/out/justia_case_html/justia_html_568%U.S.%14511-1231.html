The adjustment amount is determined in part by the percentage of a hospital\xe2\x80\x99s patients who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), called the SSI fraction.  Each year, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates the SSI fraction for an eligible hospital and submits that number to the hospital\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal intermediary,\xe2\x80\x9d a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) contractor.  The intermediary computes the reimbursement amount due and then sends the hospital a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR).  A provider dissatisfied with the determination has a right to appeal to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB or Board) within 180 days of receiving the NPR.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71395oo(a)(3).  By regulation, the Secretary of HHS authorized the PRRB to extend the 180-day limit, for good cause, up to three years.  See 42 CFR 405.1841(b) (2007).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Baystate Medical Center\xe2\x80\x94not a party here\xe2\x80\x94timely appealed its SSI fraction calculation for each year from 1993 through 1996.  The PRRB found that errors in CMS\xe2\x80\x99s methodology resulted in a systematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share adjustment and corresponding underpayments to providers.  In March 2006, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s Baystate decision was made public.  Within 180 days, respondent hospitals filed a complaint with the Board, challenging their adjustments for 1987 through 1994.  Acknowledging that their challenges were more than a decade out of time, they urged that equitable tolling of the limitations period was in order due to CMS\xe2\x80\x99s failure to tell them about the computation error.  The PRRB held that it lacked jurisdiction, reasoning that it had no equitable powers save those legislation or regulation might confer.  On judicial review, the District Court dismissed the hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit reversed.  The presumption that statutory limitations periods are generally subject to equitable tolling, the court concluded, applied to the 180-day time limit because nothing in \xc2\xa71395oo(a)(3) indicated that Congress intended to disallow such tolling.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0The 180-day limitation in \xc2\xa71395oo(a)(3) is not \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0Unless Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cclearly state[d]\xe2\x80\x9d that a statutory limitation is jurisdictional, the restriction should be treated \xe2\x80\x9cas nonjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arbaugh v.

But a requirement that would otherwise be nonjurisdictional does not become jurisdictional simply because it is in a section of a statute that also contains jurisdictional provisions.  Gonzalez v.

In support, amicus relies on the general rule that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9ccertain language in one part of the statute and different language in another\xe2\x80\x9d can indicate that \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent meanings were intended,\xe2\x80\x9d Sosa v.

Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n.  Here, the regulation survives inspection under that deferential standard.  The Secretary brought to bear practical experience in superintending the huge program generally, and the PRRB in particular, in maintaining a three-year outer limit for intermediary determination challenges.

That premise is inapt in the context of providers\xe2\x80\x99 administrative appeals under the Medicare Act.  For nearly 40 years the Secretary has prohibited the Board from extending the 180-day deadline, except as provided by regulation.  In the six times \xc2\xa71395oo has been amended since 1974, Congress has left untouched the 180-day provision and the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s rulemaking authority.

But this Court has explained that giving intermediaries more time to discover overpayments than providers have to discover underpayments may be justified by the \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative realities\xe2\x80\x9d of the system: a few dozen fiscal intermediaries are charged with issuing tens of thousands of NPRs, while each provider can concentrate on a single NPR, its own.

Government contractors, called fiscal intermediaries, receive cost reports annually from care providers and notify them of the reimbursement amount for which they qualify.  A provider dissatisfied with the fiscal intermediary\xe2\x80\x99s determination may appeal to an administrative body named the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB or Board).  The governing statute, \xc2\xa7602(h)(l)(D), \n\n97Stat.\n165, \n\n42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71395oo(a)(3), sets a 180-day limit for filing appeals from the fiscal intermediary to the PRRB.  By a regulation promulgated in 1974, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authorized the Board to extend the 180-day limitation, for good cause, up to three years.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe providers in this case are hospitals who appealed to the PRRB more than ten years after expiration of the 180-day statutory deadline.  They assert that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose information that made the fiscal intermediary\xe2\x80\x99s reimbursement calculation incorrect prevented them from earlier appealing to the Board.  Three positions have been briefed and argued regarding the time for providers\xe2\x80\x99 appeals to the PRRB.  First, a Court-appointed amicus curiae has urged that the 180-day limitation is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore cannot be enlarged at all by agency or court.  Second, the Government maintains that the Secretary has the prerogative to set an outer limit of three years for appeals to the Board.  And third, the hos- pitals argue that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies, stopping the 180-day clock during the time the Secretary concealed the information that made the fiscal interme- diary\xe2\x80\x99s reimbursement determinations incorrect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe hold that the statutory 180-day limitation is not \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the Secretary reasonably construed the statute to permit a regulation extending the time for a provider\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the PRRB to three years.  We further hold that the presumption in favor of equitable tolling does not apply to administrative appeals of the kind here at issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Medicare program covers certain inpatient services that hospitals provide to Medicare beneficiaries.  Providers are reimbursed at a fixed amount per patient, regardless of the actual operating costs they incur in rendering these services.  But the total reimbursement amount is adjusted upward for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.  This adjustment is made because hospitals with an unusually high percentage of low-income patients generally have higher per-patient costs; such hospitals, Congress therefore found, should receive higher reimbursement rates.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93241, pt. 1, p.\xc2\xa016 (1985).  The amount of the disproportionate share adjustment is determined in part by the percentage of the patients served by the hospital who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments, a percentage commonly called the SSI fraction.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71395ww(d) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the end of each year, providers participating in Medicare submit cost reports to contractors acting on behalf of HHS known as fiscal intermediaries.  Also at year end, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) cal- culates the SSI fraction for each eligible hospital and submits that number to the intermediary for that hospital.

Eventually, the PRRB determined that CMS had omitted several categories of SSI data from its calculations and was using a flawed process to determine the number of low-income beneficiaries treated by hospitals.  These errors caused a systematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share adjustment, resulting in underpayments to the providers.  Baystate Medical Center v.

On judicial review, the District Court dismissed the hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 claims for relief, holding that nothing in the statute suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended to authorize equitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  686 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 55, 70 (DC 2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals reversed.  642 F.\xc2\xa03d 1145 (CADC 2011).  It relied on the presumption that statutory limitations periods are generally subject to equitable tolling and reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1148 (quoting Irwin v.

The presumption applies to the 180-day time limit for provider appeals from re- imbursement determinations, the Court of Appeals held, finding nothing in the statutory provision for PRRB review indicating that Congress intended to disallow equi- table tolling.  642 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1149\xe2\x80\x931151.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether the 180-day time limit in \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71395oo(a)(3) constricts the Board\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.

We have recognized, as a general rule, that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9ccertain language in one part of the statute and different language in another\xe2\x80\x9d can indicate that \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent meanings were intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sosa v.

For the reasons earlier stated, see supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x938, we are persuaded that the time limi- tation in \xc2\xa71395oo(a) is most sensibly characterized as a nonjurisdictional prescription.

Imposing equitable tolling to permit appeals barred by the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s regulation would essentially gut the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that an appeal to the Board \xe2\x80\x9cshall be dismissed\xe2\x80\x9d if filed more than 180 days after the NPR, unless the provider shows \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause\xe2\x80\x9d and requests an extension no later than three years after the NPR.

Irwin concerned the then 30-day time period for filing suit against a federal agency under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c) (1988 ed.).

Irwin itself, and equitable-tolling cases we have considered both pre- and post-Irwin, have generally involved time limits for filing suit in federal court.  See, e.g., Holland v. Flor- ida, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2010) (one-year limitation for filing application for writ of habeas corpus); Rotella v.

We have never applied the Irwin presumption to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s internal appeal dead- line, here the time a provider has to appeal an inter- mediary\xe2\x80\x99s reimbursement determination to the PRRB.  Cf. United States v. Brockamp, \n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347, \n350 (1997)\n (assuming, arguendo, that Irwin presumption applied to time limit for filing an administrative claim for a tax re- fund, but concluding based on statutory text, structure, and purpose that there was \xe2\x80\x9cgood reason to believe that Congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe presumption of equitable tolling was adopted in part on the premise that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch a principle is likely to be a realistic assessment of legislative intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Irwin, 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95.  But that premise is inapt in the context of providers\xe2\x80\x99 administrative appeals under the Medicare Act.  The Act, until 1972, provided no avenue for providers to obtain administrative or judicial review.  When Congress first directed the Secretary to establish the PRRB, Congress simultaneously imposed the 180-day deadline, with no statutory exceptions.  For nearly 40 years the Secre- tary has prohibited the Board from extending that deadline, except as provided by regulation.  And until the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this case, no court had ever read equitable tolling into \xc2\xa71395oo(a)(3) or the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of that provision.

I agree with those holdings and join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in full.  I write separately to note that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this case does not establish that equitable tolling principles are irrelevant to internal administrative deadlines in all, or even most, contexts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court is correct that our equitable tolling cases have typically involved deadlines to bring suit in federal court.  Ante, at 12.  But we have never suggested that the presumption in favor of equitable tolling is generally inapplicable to administrative deadlines.  Cf. Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2011) (slip op., at 12, n.\xc2\xa04) (noting that the Government did not dispute whether the statutory filing deadline in the Article I Veterans Court was subject to equitable tolling if the deadline was nonjurisdictional); United States v. Brockamp, \n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347\n\xe2\x80\x93353 (1997) (assuming without deciding that the Irwin presumption applied to administrative tax refund claims but finding based on statutory text, structure, and the underlying subject matter that tolling was unavail- able); see also ante, at 12 (discussing Brockamp).  And we have previously applied the Irwin presumption outside the context of filing deadlines in Article III courts.  See Young v. United States, \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43\n\xe2\x80\x9353 (2002) (applying the presumption to a limitations period in bankruptcy proceedings); cf. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., \n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385\n\xe2\x80\x93398 (1982) (holding that the statutory time limit for filing charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn administrative settings other than the one presented here, I believe the \xe2\x80\x9cbackground principle\xe2\x80\x9d that limita- tions periods \xe2\x80\x9care customarily subject to equitable tolling,\xe2\x80\x9d Young, 535 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 49\xe2\x80\x9350 (internal quotation marks omitted), may limit an agency\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to make filing deadlines absolute.  The Court quite properly observes that the question whether equitable tolling is available turns on congressional intent.  See ante, at 13.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] realistic assessment\xe2\x80\x9d of that intent, Irwin, 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95, may vary by context.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, given the nature of the statutory scheme, which \xe2\x80\x9capplies to \xe2\x80\x98sophisticated\xe2\x80\x99 institutional providers\xe2\x80\x9d who are \xe2\x80\x9crepeat players\xe2\x80\x9d in the Medicare system, and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history, I agree that it would distort congres- sional intent to presume that the PRRB\xe2\x80\x99s administrative deadline should be subject to equitable tolling.  Ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314 (quoting Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc. v. Shalala, \n\n525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 449, \n456 (1999)\n).  By contrast, with respect to remedial statutes designed to protect the rights of unsophisticated claimants, see ante, at 13, agencies (and reviewing courts) may best honor congressional intent by presuming that statutory deadlines for admin- istrative appeals are subject to equitable tolling, just as courts presume comparable judicial deadlines under such statutes may be tolled.  Because claimants must generally pursue administrative relief before seeking judicial review, see\xc2\xa0Woodford v. Ngo, \n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81\n\xe2\x80\x9391 (2006), a contrary approach could have odd practical consequences and would attribute a strange intent to Congress: to protect a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to seek judicial review of an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision by making equitable tolling available, while leaving to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s discretion whether the same claimant may invoke equitable tolling in order to seek an administrative remedy in the first place.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven in cases where the governing statute clearly delegates to an agency the discretion to adopt rules that limit the scope of equitable exceptions to administrative deadlines, I believe \xe2\x80\x9ccases may arise where the equities in favor of tolling the limitations period are \xe2\x80\x98so great that deference to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is inappropriate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Bowen v. City of New York, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 467, \n480 (1986)\n (quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 319, \n330 (1976)\n).  In particular, efforts by an agency to enforce tight filing deadlines in cases where there are credible allegations that filing delay was due to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own misfea- sance may not survive deferential review.  While equitable tolling extends to circumstances outside both parties\xe2\x80\x99 control, the related doctrines of equitable estoppel and fraudulent concealment may bar a defendant from enforcing a statute of limitation when its own deception prevented a reasonably diligent plaintiff from bringing a timely claim.  See United States v. Beggerly, \n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 38\n\xe2\x80\x9350 (1998) (Stevens, J., concurring) (noting that these doctrines are distinct); see generally 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79.1, 9.7 (1991) (describing the doctrines).  In Bowen, we applied the basic principle underlying these doctrines to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, as we concluded that a 60-day deadline to seek judicial review of the administrative denial of disability benefits should be tolled because the Social Security Administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98secretive conduct pre- vent[ed] plaintiffs from knowing of a violation of rights.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 481 (quoting New York v.

We would face a different case if the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s regulation did not recognize an exception for good cause or defined good cause so narrowly as to exclude cases of fraudulent concealment and equitable estoppel.
