Testifying in his own defense, Mr. Riddell said he did not intend for the rifle to go off, and did not have his finger on the trigger when it did fire. On cross-examination, however, the prosecution was permitted to confront Mr. Riddell with a statement elicited from him, in violation of Miranda, in which he told the police \'I cocked the hammer and pulled the trigger.

Thus, to the extent that the use of incriminating statements elic- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="976">Page 404 U.S. 974 , 976</a></p><p> ited in violation of constitutional safeguards is prohibited, the police have no incentive to attempt to circumvent those safeguards. </p><p> There is the view that the use of Miranda-violative statements does not affect the \'fundamental fairness\' of the courtroom trial.* I cannot accept this position. The lesson of Miranda is that the effective determination of guilt all too often rests on the ruses and strategems employed in an incommunicado police interrogation, not on the evidence and testimony elicited in the impartial surroundings of a trial court. </p><p> Yet, after Harris, there is no longer any real incentive for police to obey Miranda. Credibility is always an issue when an accused takes the stand in his own defense. The license granted by the Harris majority to use Miranda-violative statements for impeachment purposes, therefore, foreshadows the possible use of tainted statements in almost every case. This opens the door to a calculated risk by police interrogators. If, in response to Miranda warnings, an accused indicates he wishes to have an attorney present during questioning, the request may be ignored with virtual impunity. If a damaging statement is thereafter forthcoming, it may almost certainly be used against the accused if he later elects to take the stand in his own defense. Moreover, the risk </p><p> * This view is reflected in draft legislation recently submitted by the Justice Department to the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. The proposed legislation would restrict federal habeas corpus relief to constitutional rights which have as their \'primary purpose the protection of the reliability of either the factfinding process at trial or the appellate process on appeal from the judgment of conviction.\' Habeas Corpus Amendments of the Department of Justice, in Appendix, Letter to Hon. Sam J. Ervin, Jr., October 19, 1971. The covering letter expressly refers to the use of Miranda-violative statements as a claim which would be barred under the proposed amendments. Letter, p. 16. But see Dershowitz &amp; Ely, Harris v. New York, 80 Yale L.J. 1198 (1971). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="977">Page 404 U.S. 974 , 977</a></p><p> is minimal that the inability to use the statement in the prosecution\'s case-in-chief will result in a dismissal of the charges or a directed verdict of acquittal. Unlike other situations in which exclusionary rules operate to exclude illegally obtained physical evidence, it is seldom that a prima facie case requires corroboration from the lips of the accused. </p><p> The accused may take cold comfort in the fact that if he does take the stand, the tainted statements may only be used for \'impeachment.\' We have often noted the impossible task that faces a jury instructed to close its eyes to the fact that evidence introduced for a limited purpose is highly damaging on the ultimate issue of guilt, as well. The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury ... all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.\' Krulewitch v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/440/case.html#453">336 U.S. 440, 453</a> ( concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson). See also Spencer v. Texas, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/554/case.html#575">385 U.S. 554, 575</a>, 659 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Warren). Cf. Bruton v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/123/case.html">391 U.S. 123</a>; Jackson v. Denno, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/368/case.html">378 U.S. 368</a>, 12 L. Ed.2d 908. </p><p> It is no answer to say, as did the majority in Harris, that the privilege against self-incrimination \'cannot be construed to include the right to commit perjury.\' As we said in Miranda, the presence of counsel during police questioning may help \'to guarantee that the accused gives a fully accurate statement to the police and that the statement is rightly reported by the prosecution at trial.\' 384 U.S., AT 470. A statement made in the inherently coercive, police-dominated atmosphere denounced in Miranda is not so reliable that we can safely ignore its implicit involuntariness and the critical burden the use of such a statement places upon the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege. </p><p> The exclusionary rule is a recognition that the vision of law enforcement authorities is often narrowed by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="978">Page 404 U.S. 974 , 978</a></p><p> their total immersion in the never-ending war against crime. If we permit the legitimate desire to win that war to undermine constitutional guarantees of liberty, our victory will indeed be fleeting.
