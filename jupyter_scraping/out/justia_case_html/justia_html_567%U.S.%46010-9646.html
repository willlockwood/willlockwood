In No. 10\xe2\x88\x929647, petitioner Jackson accompanied two other boys to a video store to commit a robbery; on the way to the store, he learned that one of the boys was carrying a shotgun.  Jackson stayed outside the store for most of the robbery, but after he entered, one of his co-conspirators shot and killed the store clerk.  Arkansas charged Jackson as an adult with capital felony murder and aggravated robbery, and a jury convicted him of both crimes.  The trial court imposed a statutorily mandated sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.  Jackson filed a state habeas petition, arguing that a mandatory life-without-parole term for a 14-year-old violates the \n \nEighth Amendment.  Disagreeing, the court granted the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn No. 10\xe2\x88\x929646, petitioner Miller, along with a friend, beat Miller\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor and set fire to his trailer after an evening of drinking and drug use.

A jury found Miller guilty, and the trial court imposed a statutorily mandated punishment of life without parole.

Simmons, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551\n.  That right \xe2\x80\x9cflows from the basic \xe2\x80\x98precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to both the offender and the offense.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo strands of precedent reflecting the concern with proportionate punishment come together here.  The first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty.  See, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana, \n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 407\n.  Several cases in this group have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability.  Thus, Roper v. Simmons held that the \n \nEighth Amendment bars capital punishment for children, and Graham v. Florida, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, concluded that the Amendment prohibits a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a juvenile convicted of a nonhomicide offense.  Graham further likened life without parole for juveniles to the death penalty, thereby evoking a second line of cases.  In those decisions, this Court has required sentencing authorities to consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death.  See, e.g., Woodson v. North Carolina, \n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280\n (plurality opinion).  Here, the confluence of these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory life without parole for juveniles violates the \n \nEighth Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs to the first set of cases: Roper and Graham establish that children are constitutionally different from adults for sentencing purposes.  Their \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98lack of maturity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98underdeveloped sense of responsibility\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d lead to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking.  Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 569.  They \xe2\x80\x9care more vulnerable .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to negative influences and outside pressures,\xe2\x80\x9d including from their family and peers; they have limited \xe2\x80\x9ccontro[l] over their own environment\xe2\x80\x9d and lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing settings.  Ibid.  And because a child\xe2\x80\x99s character is not as \xe2\x80\x9cwell formed\xe2\x80\x9d as an adult\xe2\x80\x99s, his traits are \xe2\x80\x9cless fixed\xe2\x80\x9d and his actions are less likely to be \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of irretrievabl[e] deprav[ity].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 570.  Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile Graham\xe2\x80\x99s flat ban on life without parole was for nonhomicide crimes, nothing that Graham said about children is crime-specific.  Thus, its reasoning implicates any life-without-parole sentence for a juvenile, even as its categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.  Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth matters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The mandatory penalty schemes at issue here, however, prevent the sentencer from considering youth and from assessing whether the law\xe2\x80\x99s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender.  This contravenes Graham\xe2\x80\x99s (and also Roper\xe2\x80\x99s) foundational principle: that imposition of a State\xe2\x80\x99s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGraham also likened life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to the death penalty.  That decision recognized that life-without-parole sentences \xe2\x80\x9cshare some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  And it treated life without parole for juveniles like this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases treat the death penalty, imposing a categorical bar on its imposition for nonhomicide offenses.  By likening life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to the death penalty, Graham makes relevant this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases demanding individualized sentencing in capital cases.  In particular, those cases have emphasized that sentencers must be able to consider the mitigating qualities of youth.  In light of Graham\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, these decisions also show the flaws of imposing mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders.

Michigan, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 957\n, forecloses a holding that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the \n \nEighth Amendment.  Harmelin declined to extend the individualized sentencing requirement to noncapital cases \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the qualitative difference between death and all other penalties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1006 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  But Harmelin had nothing to do with children, and did not purport to apply to juvenile offenders.  Indeed, since Harmelin, this Court has held on multiple occasions that sentencing practices that are permissible for adults may not be so for children.  See Roper, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551\n; Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S ___.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe States next contend that mandatory life-without-parole terms for juveniles cannot be unconstitutional because 29 jurisdictions impose them on at least some children convicted of murder.  In considering categorical bars to the death penalty and life without parole, this Court asks as part of the analysis whether legislative enactments and actual sentencing practices show a national consensus against a sentence for a particular class of offenders.  But where, as here, this Court does not categorically bar a penalty, but instead requires only that a sentencer follow a certain process, this Court has not scrutinized or relied on legislative enactments in the same way.  See, e.g., Sumner v. Schuman, \n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 66\n.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, that the States offer do not distinguish these cases from others holding that a sentencing practice violates the \n \nEighth Amendment.  Fewer States impose mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders than authorized the penalty (life-without-parole for nonhomicide offenders) that this Court invalidated in Graham.  And as Graham and Thompson v. Oklahoma, \n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 815\n, explain, simply counting legislative enactments can present a distorted view.  In those cases, as here, the relevant penalty applied to juveniles based on two separate provisions: One allowed the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to adult court, while another set out penalties for any and all individuals tried there.  In those circumstances, this Court reasoned, it was impossible to say whether a legislature had endorsed a given penalty for children (or would do so if presented with the choice).  The same is true here. Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9325.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0The States next argue that courts and prosecutors sufficiently consider a juvenile defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age, as well as his background and the circumstances of his crime, when deciding whether to try him as an adult.  But this argument ignores that many States use mandatory transfer systems.  In addition, some lodge the decision in the hands of the prosecutors, rather than courts.  And even where judges have transfer-stage discretion, it has limited utility, because the decisionmaker typically will have only partial information about the child or the circumstances of his offense.  Finally, because of the limited sentencing options in some juvenile courts, the transfer decision may present a choice between a light sentence as a juvenile and standard sentencing as an adult.  It cannot substitute for discretion at post-trial sentencing.

In neither case did the sentencing authority have any discretion to impose a different punishment.  State law mandated that each juvenile die in prison even if a judge or jury would have thought that his youth and its attendant characteristics, along with the nature of his crime, made a lesser sentence (for example, life with the possibility of parole) more appropriate.

Simmons, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551 (2005)\n, in which this Court invalidated the death penalty for all juvenile offenders under the age of 18, Jackson filed a state petition for habeas corpus.  He argued, based on Roper\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, that a mandatory sentence of life without parole for a 14-year-old also violates the \n \nEighth Amendment.  The circuit court rejected that argument and granted the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  See Jackson App. 72\xe2\x80\x9376.  While that ruling was on appeal, this Court held in Graham v. Florida that life without parole violates the \n \nEighth Amendment when imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders.  After the parties filed briefs addressing that decision, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  See Jackson v. Norris, 2011 Ark. 49, ___ S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d ___.  The majority found that Roper and Graham were \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to their contexts: \xe2\x80\x9cdeath-penalty cases involving a juvenile and life-imprisonment-without-parole cases for nonhomicide offenses involving a juvenile.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 5, ___ S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at ___.

Miller had by then been in and out of foster care because his mother suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction and his stepfather abused him.  Miller, too, regularly used drugs and alcohol; and he had attempted suicide four times, the first when he was six years old.  See E. J. M. v. State, 928 So.\xc2\xa02d 1077, 1081 (Ala. Crim.

See 6 Record in No. 10\xe2\x80\x939646, p. 1004.  The two boys followed Cannon back to his trailer, where all three smoked marijuana and played drinking games.  When Cannon passed out, Miller stole his wallet, splitting about $300 with Smith.  Miller then tried to put the wallet back in Cannon\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, but Cannon awoke and grabbed Miller by the throat.  Smith hit Cannon with a nearby baseball bat, and once released, Miller grabbed the bat and repeatedly struck Cannon with it.  Miller placed a sheet over Cannon\xe2\x80\x99s head, told him \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I am God, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to take your life,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and delivered one more blow.  Miller v. State, 63 So. 3d 676, 689 (Ala. Crim. App. 2010).  The boys then retreated to Miller\xe2\x80\x99s trailer, but soon decided to return to Cannon\xe2\x80\x99s to cover up evidence of their crime.  Once there, they lit two fires.  Cannon eventually died from his injuries and smoke inhalation.

See Ala. Code \xc2\xa712\xe2\x80\x9315\xe2\x80\x9334 (1977).  The D.\xc2\xa0A. did so, and the juvenile court agreed to the transfer after a hearing.

The first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty.  See Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310) (listing cases).  So, for example, we have held that imposing the death penalty for nonhomicide crimes against individuals, or imposing it on mentally retarded defendants, violates the \n \nEighth Amendment.  See Kennedy v. Louisiana, \n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 407 (2008)\n; Atkins v. Virginia, \n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 304 (2002)\n.  Several of the cases in this group have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability.   Thus, Roper held that the \n \nEighth Amendment bars capital punishment for children, and Graham concluded that the Amendment also prohibits a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a child who committed a nonhomicide offense.  Graham further likened life without parole for juveniles to the death penalty itself, thereby evoking a second line of our precedents.  In those cases, we have prohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment, requiring that sentencing authorities consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death.  See Woodson v. North Carolina, \n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280 (1976)\n (plurality opinion); Lockett v. Ohio, \n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 586 (1978)\n.  Here, the confluence of these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the \n \nEighth Amendment.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo start with the first set of cases: Roper and Graham establish that children are constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing.  Because juveniles have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are less deserving of the most severe punishments.\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  Those cases relied on three significant gaps between juveniles and adults.  First, children have a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d leading to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking.  Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 569.  Second, children \xe2\x80\x9care more vulner- able .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to negative influences and outside pressures,\xe2\x80\x9d including from their family and peers; they have limited \xe2\x80\x9ccontro[l] over their own environment\xe2\x80\x9d and lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing settings.  Ibid.  And third, a child\xe2\x80\x99s character is not as \xe2\x80\x9cwell formed\xe2\x80\x9d as an adult\xe2\x80\x99s; his traits are \xe2\x80\x9cless fixed\xe2\x80\x9d and his actions less likely to be \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of irretrievabl[e] deprav[ity].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 570.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur decisions rested not only on common sense\xe2\x80\x94on what \xe2\x80\x9cany parent knows\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but on science and social science as well.  Id., at 569.  In Roper, we cited studies showing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[o]nly a relatively small proportion of adolescents\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d who engage in illegal activity \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98develop entrenched patterns of problem behavior.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 570 (quoting Steinberg &amp; Scott, Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence: Developmental Immaturity, Diminished Responsibility, and the Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am. Psychologist 1009, 1014 (2003)).  And in Graham, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for example, in \xe2\x80\x9cparts of the brain involved in behavior control.\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  We reasoned that those findings\xe2\x80\x94of transient rashness, proclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences\xe2\x80\x94both lessened a child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmoral culpability\xe2\x80\x9d and enhanced the prospect that, as the years go by and neurological development occurs, his \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deficiencies will be reformed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 570).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRoper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive at- tributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he heart of the retribution rationale\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d relates to an offender\xe2\x80\x99s blameworthiness, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an adult.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321) (quoting Tison v. Arizona, \n\n481 U. S. 137, \n149 (1987)\n; Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 571).  Nor can deterrence do the work in this context, because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the same characteristics that render juveniles less culpable than adults\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94their immaturity, recklessness, and impetuosity\xe2\x80\x94make them less likely to consider potential punishment.  Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 571).  Similarly, incapacitation could not support the life-without-parole sentence in Graham: Deciding that a \xe2\x80\x9cjuvenile offender forever will be a danger to society\xe2\x80\x9d would require \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] a judgment that [he] is incorrigible\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98incorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (quoting Workman v. Commonwealth, 429 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky. App. 1968)).  And for the same reason, rehabilitation could not justify that sentence.  Life without parole \xe2\x80\x9cforswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  It reflects \xe2\x80\x9can irrevocable judgment about [an offender\xe2\x80\x99s] value and place in society,\xe2\x80\x9d at odds with a child\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for change.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGraham concluded from this analysis that life-without-parole sentences, like capital punishment, may violate the \n \nEighth Amendment when imposed on children.  To be sure, Graham\xe2\x80\x99s flat ban on life without parole applied only to nonhomicide crimes, and the Court took care to distinguish those offenses from murder, based on both moral culpability and consequential harm.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).  But none of what it said about children\xe2\x80\x94about their distinctive (and transitory) mental traits and en- vironmental vulnerabilities\xe2\x80\x94is crime-specific.  Those features are evident in the same way, and to the same de- gree, when (as in both cases here) a botched robbery turns into a killing.  So Graham\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning implicates any life-without-parole sentence imposed on a juvenile, even as its categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMost fundamentally, Graham insists that youth matters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarceration without the possibility of parole.  In the circumstances there, juvenile status precluded a life-without-parole sentence, even though an adult could receive it for a similar crime.  And in other contexts as well, the characteristics of youth, and the way they weaken rationales for punishment, can render a life-without-parole sentence disproportionate.  Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 20\xe2\x80\x9323) (generally doubting the penological justifications for imposing life without parole on juveniles).  \xe2\x80\x9cAn offender\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x9d we made clear in Graham, \xe2\x80\x9cis relevant to the \n \nEighth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d and so \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal procedure laws that fail to take defendants\xe2\x80\x99 youthfulness into account at all would be flawed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 25).  The Chief Justice, concurring in the judgment, made a similar point.  Al- though rejecting a categorical bar on life-without-parole sentences for juveniles, he acknowledged \xe2\x80\x9cRoper\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that juveniles are typically less culpable than adults,\xe2\x80\x9d and accordingly wrote that \xe2\x80\x9can offender\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile status can play a central role\xe2\x80\x9d in considering a sentence\xe2\x80\x99s proportionality.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936); see id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (Graham\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cyouth is one factor, among others, that should be considered in deciding whether his punishment was unconstitutionally excessive\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut the mandatory penalty schemes at issue here prevent the sentencer from taking account of these central considerations.  By removing youth from the balance\xe2\x80\x94 by subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole sentence applicable to an adult\xe2\x80\x94these laws prohibit a sentencing authority from assessing whether the law\xe2\x80\x99s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender.  That contravenes Graham\xe2\x80\x99s (and also Roper\xe2\x80\x99s) foundational principle: that imposition of a State\xe2\x80\x99s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd Graham makes plain these mandatory schemes\xe2\x80\x99 defects in another way: by likening life-without-parole sentences imposed on juveniles to the death penalty itself.  Life-without-parole terms, the Court wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cshare some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19).  Imprisoning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of his life \xe2\x80\x9cby a forfeiture that is irrevocable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (citing Solem v. Helm, \n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 277\n\xe2\x80\x93301 (1983)).  And this lengthiest possible incarceration is an \xe2\x80\x9cespecially harsh punishment for a juvenile,\xe2\x80\x9d because he will almost inevitably serve \xe2\x80\x9cmore years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320).  The penalty when imposed on a teenager, as compared with an older person, is therefore \xe2\x80\x9cthe same .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in name only.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 20).  All of that suggested a distinctive set of legal rules: In part because we viewed this ultimate penalty for juveniles as akin to the death penalty, we treated it similarly to that most severe punishment.  We imposed a categorical ban on the sentence\xe2\x80\x99s use, in a way unprecedented for a term of imprisonment.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 9); id., at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor the first time in its history, the Court declares an entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital sentence using the categorical approach it previously reserved for death penalty cases alone\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the bar we adopted mirrored a proscription first established in the death penalty context\xe2\x80\x94that the punishment cannot be imposed for any nonhomicide crimes against individuals.

In Woodson, \n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280\n, we held that a statute mandating a death sentence for first-degree murder violated the \n \nEighth Amendment.  We thought the mandatory scheme flawed because it gave no significance to \xe2\x80\x9cthe character and record of the individual offender or the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d of the offense, and \xe2\x80\x9cexclud[ed] from consideration .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the possibility of compassionate or mitigating factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 304.  Subsequent decisions have elaborated on the requirement that capital defendants have an opportunity to advance, and the judge or jury a chance to assess, any mitigating factors, so that the death penalty is reserved only for the most culpable defendants committing the most serious offenses.  See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, \n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 66\n\xe2\x80\x9376 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, \n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104\n\xe2\x80\x93112 (1982); Lockett, 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 597\xe2\x80\x93609 (plurality opinion).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf special pertinence here, we insisted in these rulings that a sentencer have the ability to consider the \xe2\x80\x9cmitigating qualities of youth.\xe2\x80\x9d  Johnson v. Texas, \n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350, \n367 (1993)\n.  Everything we said in Roper and Graham about that stage of life also appears in these decisions.  As we observed, \xe2\x80\x9cyouth is more than a chronological fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Eddings, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 115.  It is a time of immaturity, ir- responsibility, \xe2\x80\x9cimpetuousness[,] and recklessness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Johnson, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 368.  It is a moment and \xe2\x80\x9ccondition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.\xe2\x80\x9d  Eddings, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 115.

There, a 16-year-old shot a police officer point-blank and killed him.  We invalidated his death sentence because the judge did not consider evidence of his neglectful and violent family background (including his mother\xe2\x80\x99s drug abuse and his father\xe2\x80\x99s physical abuse) and his emotional disturbance.  We found that evidence \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly relevant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94more so than it would have been in the case of an adult offender.  455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 115.  We held: \xe2\x80\x9c[J]ust as the chronological age of a minor is itself a relevant mitigating factor of great weight, so must the background and mental and emotional development of a youthful defendant be duly considered\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing his culpability.  Id., at 116.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of Graham\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, these decisions too show the flaws of imposing mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders.  Such mandatory penalties, by their nature, preclude a sentencer from taking account of an offender\xe2\x80\x99s age and the wealth of characteristics and circumstances attendant to it.  Under these schemes, every juvenile will receive the same sentence as every other\xe2\x80\x94the 17-year-old and the 14-year-old, the shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable household and the child from a chaotic and abusive one.  And still worse, each juvenile (including these two 14-year-olds) will receive the same sentence as the vast majority of adults committing similar homicide offenses\xe2\x80\x94but really, as Graham noted, a greater sentence than those adults will serve.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In meting out the death penalty, the elision of all these differences would be strictly forbidden.  And once again, Graham indicates that a similar rule should apply when a juvenile confronts a sentence of life (and death) in prison.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo Graham and Roper and our individualized sentencing cases alike teach that in imposing a State\xe2\x80\x99s harshest penalties, a sentencer misses too much if he treats every child as an adult.  To recap: Mandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features\xe2\x80\x94among them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences.  It prevents taking into account the family and home environment that surrounds him\xe2\x80\x94and from which he cannot usually extricate himself\xe2\x80\x94no matter how bru- tal or dysfunctional.  It neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him.  Indeed, it ignores that he might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth\xe2\x80\x94for example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys.  See, e.g., Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 27) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he features that distinguish juveniles from adults also put them at a significant disadvantage in criminal proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d); J. D. B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936) (discussing children\xe2\x80\x99s responses to interrogation).  And finally, this mandatory punishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation even when the circumstances most suggest it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBoth cases before us illustrate the problem.  Take Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s first.  As noted earlier, Jackson did not fire the bullet that killed Laurie Troup; nor did the State argue that he intended her death.  Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was instead based on an aiding-and-abetting theory; and the appellate court affirmed the verdict only because the jury could have believed that when Jackson entered the store, he warned Troup that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e ain\xe2\x80\x99t playin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than told his friends that \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you all was playin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 359 Ark., at 90\xe2\x80\x9392, 194 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 759\xe2\x80\x93760; supra, at 2.  To be sure, Jackson learned on the way to the video store that his friend Shields was carrying a gun, but his age could well have affected his calculation of the risk that posed, as well as his willingness to walk away at that point.  All these circumstances go to Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s culpability for the offense.  See Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral culpability\xe2\x80\x9d).  And so too does Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s family background and immersion in violence: Both his mother and his grandmother had previously shot other individuals.  See Record in No. 10\xe2\x80\x939647, pp. 80\xe2\x80\x9382.  At the least, a sentencer should look at such facts before depriving a 14-year-old of any prospect of release from prison.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is true also in Miller\xe2\x80\x99s case.  No one can doubt that he and Smith committed a vicious murder.  But they did it when high on drugs and alcohol consumed with the adult victim.  And if ever a pathological background might have contributed to a 14-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s commission of a crime, it is here.  Miller\xe2\x80\x99s stepfather physically abused him; his alcoholic and drug-addicted mother neglected him; he had been in and out of foster care as a result; and he had tried to kill himself four times, the first when he should have been in kindergarten.  See 928 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 1081 (Cobb, J., concurring in result); Miller App. 26\xe2\x80\x9328; supra, at 4.  Nonetheless, Miller\xe2\x80\x99s past criminal history was limited\xe2\x80\x94two instances of truancy and one of \xe2\x80\x9csecond-degree criminal mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d  No. CR\xe2\x80\x9303\xe2\x80\x930915, at 6 (unpublished memorandum).  That Miller deserved severe punishment for killing Cole Cannon is beyond question.  But once again, a sentencer needed to examine all these circumstances before concluding that life without any possibility of parole was the appropriate penalty.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe therefore hold that the \n \nEighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.  Cf. Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (\xe2\x80\x9cA State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d but must provide \xe2\x80\x9csome meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x9d).  By making youth (and all that accompanies it) irrelevant to imposition of that harshest prison sentence, such a scheme poses too great a risk of disproportionate punishment.  Because that holding is sufficient to decide these cases, we do not consider Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s and Miller\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that the \n \nEighth Amendment requires a categorical bar on life without parole for juveniles, or at least for those 14 and younger.  But given all we have said in Roper, Graham, and this decision about children\xe2\x80\x99s diminished culpability and heightened capacity for change, we think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.  That is especially so because of the great difficulty we noted in Roper and Graham of distinguishing at this early age between \xe2\x80\x9cthe juvenile of- fender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 573; Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  Although we do not foreclose a sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make that judgment in homicide cases, we require it to take into account how children are different, and how those differences coun- sel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlabama and Arkansas offer two kinds of arguments against requiring individualized consideration before sen- tencing a juvenile to life imprisonment without possi- bility of parole.  The States (along with the dissents) first contend that the rule we adopt conflicts with aspects of our \n \nEighth Amendment caselaw.  And they next assert that the rule is unnecessary because individualized circumstances come into play in deciding whether to try a juvenile offender as an adult.  We think the States are wrong on both counts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe States (along with Justice Thomas) first claim that Harmelin v. Michigan, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 957 (1991)\n, precludes our holding.  The defendant in Harmelin was sentenced to a mandatory life-without-parole term for possessing more than 650 grams of cocaine.  The Court upheld that pen- alty, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9ca sentence which is not otherwise cruel and unusual\xe2\x80\x9d does not \xe2\x80\x9cbecom[e] so simply because it is \xe2\x80\x98mandatory.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 995.  We recognized that a different rule, requiring individualized sentencing, applied in the death penalty context.  But we refused to extend that command to noncapital cases \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the qualitative difference between death and all other penalties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see id., at 1006 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  According to Alabama, invalidating the mandatory imposition of life-without-parole terms on juveniles \xe2\x80\x9cwould effectively overrule Harmelin.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent in No. 10\xe2\x80\x939646, p. 59 (hereinafter Alabama Brief); see Arkansas Brief 39.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe think that argument myopic.  Harmelin had nothing to do with children and did not purport to apply its holding to the sentencing of juvenile offenders.  We have by now held on multiple occasions that a sentencing rule permissible for adults may not be so for children.  Capital punishment, our decisions hold, generally comports with the \n \nEighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94except it cannot be imposed on children.  See Roper, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551\n; Thompson, \n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 815\n.  So too, life without parole is permissible for nonhomicide offenses\xe2\x80\x94except, once again, for children.  See Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 24).  Nor are these sentencing decisions an oddity in the law.  To the contrary, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recogni- tion\xe2\x80\x99 that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. D. B., 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311) (quoting Eddings, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 115\xe2\x80\x93116, citing examples from criminal, property, contract, and tort law).  So if (as Harmelin recognized) \xe2\x80\x9cdeath is different,\xe2\x80\x9d children are different too.  Indeed, it is the odd legal rule that does not have some form of exception for children.  In that context, it is no surprise that the law relating to society\xe2\x80\x99s harshest punishments recognizes such a distinction.  Cf. Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7) (\xe2\x80\x9cGraham\xe2\x80\x99s age places him in a significantly different category from the defendan[t] in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Harmelin\xe2\x80\x9d).  Our ruling thus neither overrules nor undermines nor con- flicts with Harmelin.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlabama and Arkansas (along with The Chief Jus- tice and Justice Alito) next contend that because many States impose mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juveniles, we may not hold the practice unconstitutional.  In considering categorical bars to the death penalty and life without parole, we ask as part of the analysis whether \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98objective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d show a \xe2\x80\x9cnational consensus\xe2\x80\x9d against a sentence for a particular class of offenders.  Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 563).  By our count, 29 jurisdictions (28 States and the Federal Government) make a life-without-parole term mandatory for some juveniles convicted of murder in adult court.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The States argue that this number precludes our holding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not agree; indeed, we think the States\xe2\x80\x99 argument on this score weaker than the one we rejected in Graham.  For starters, the cases here are different from the typical one in which we have tallied legislative enactments.  Our decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime\xe2\x80\x94as, for example, we did in Roper or Graham.  Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process\xe2\x80\x94considering an offender\xe2\x80\x99s youth and attendant characteristics\xe2\x80\x94before imposing a particular penalty.  And in so requiring, our decision flows straightforwardly from our precedents: specifically, the principle of Roper, Graham, and our individualized sentencing cases that youth matters for purposes of meting out the law\xe2\x80\x99s most serious punishments.  When both of those circumstances have obtained in the past, we have not scrutinized or relied in the same way on legislative enactments.  See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, \n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 66\n (relying on Woodson\xe2\x80\x99s logic to prohibit the mandatory death penalty for murderers already serving life without parole); Lockett, 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602\xe2\x80\x93608 (plurality opinion) (applying Woodson to require that judges and juries consider all mitigating evidence); Eddings, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 110\xe2\x80\x93117 (similar).  We see no difference here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia\xe2\x80\x9d that the States offer do not distinguish these cases from others holding that a sentencing practice violates the \n \nEighth Amendment.  In Graham, we prohibited life-without-parole terms for juveniles committing nonhomicide offenses even though 39 jurisdictions permitted that sentence.  See 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  That is 10 more than impose life without parole on juveniles on a mandatory basis.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And in Atkins, Roper, and Thompson, we similarly banned the death penalty in circumstances in which \xe2\x80\x9cless than half\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cStates that permit[ted] capital punishment (for whom the issue exist[ed])\xe2\x80\x9d had previously chosen to do so.  Atkins, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 342 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted); see id., at 313\xe2\x80\x93315 (majority opinion); Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 564\xe2\x80\x93565; Thompson, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 826\xe2\x80\x93827 (plurality opinion).  So we are breaking no new ground in these cases.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGraham and Thompson provide special guidance, because they considered the same kind of statutes we do and explained why simply counting them would present a distorted view.  Most jurisdictions authorized the death penalty or life without parole for juveniles only through the combination of two independent statutory provisions.  One allowed the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to adult court, while another (often in a far-removed part of the code) set out the penalties for any and all individuals tried there.  We reasoned that in those circumstances, it was impossible to say whether a legislature had endorsed a given penalty for children (or would do so if presented with the choice).  In Thompson, we found that the statutes \xe2\x80\x9ct[old] us that the States consider 15-year-olds to be old enough to be tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or too old to be dealt with effectively in juvenile court), but t[old] us nothing about the judgment these States have made regarding the appropriate punishment for such youthful offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 826, n. 24 (plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted); see also id., at 850 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment); Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 596, n. (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting).  And Graham echoed that reasoning: Although the confluence of state laws \xe2\x80\x9cma[de] life without parole possible for some juvenile nonhomicide offenders,\xe2\x80\x9d it did not \xe2\x80\x9cjustify a judgment\xe2\x80\x9d that many States actually \xe2\x80\x9cintended to subject such offenders\xe2\x80\x9d to those sentences.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAll that is just as true here.  Almost all jurisdictions allow some juveniles to be tried in adult court for some kinds of homicide.  See Dept. of Justice, H. Snyder &amp; M. Sickmund, Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 2006 National Report 110\xe2\x80\x93114 (hereinafter 2006 National Report).  But most States do not have separate penalty provisions for those juvenile offenders.

Alabama and Arkansas initially ignore that many States use mandatory transfer systems: A juvenile of a certain age who has committed a specified offense will be tried in adult court, regardless of any individualized circumstances.  Of the 29 relevant jurisdictions, about half place at least some juvenile homicide offenders in adult court automatically, with no apparent opportunity to seek transfer to juvenile court.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F15" name="T15">\n\t\t\t\t\t15\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Moreover, several States at times lodge this decision exclusively in the hands of prosecutors, again with no statutory mechanism for judicial reevaluation.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F16" name="T16">\n\t\t\t\t\t16\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And those \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutorial discretion laws are usually silent regarding standards, protocols, or appropriate considerations for decisionmaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dept. of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, P.

First, the decisionmaker typically will have only partial information at this early, pretrial stage about either the child or the circumstances of his offense.  Miller\xe2\x80\x99s case provides an example.  As noted earlier, see n.\xc2\xa03, supra, the juvenile court denied Miller\xe2\x80\x99s request for his own mental-health expert at the transfer hearing, and the appeals court affirmed on the ground that Miller was not then entitled to the protections and services he would receive at trial.  See No. CR\xe2\x80\x9303\xe2\x80\x930915, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (unpublished memorandum).  But by then, of course, the expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony could not change the sentence; whatever she said in mitigation, the mandatory life-without-parole prison term would kick in.  The key mo- ment for the exercise of discretion is the transfer\xe2\x80\x94and as Miller\xe2\x80\x99s case shows, the judge often does not know then what she will learn, about the offender or the offense, over the course of the proceedings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond and still more important, the question at transfer hearings may differ dramatically from the issue at a post-trial sentencing.  Because many juvenile systems require that the offender be released at a particular age or after a certain number of years, transfer decisions often present a choice between extremes: light punishment as a child or standard sentencing as an adult (here, life without parole).  In many States, for example, a child convicted in juvenile court must be released from custody by the age of 21.  See, e.g., Ala. Code \xc2\xa712\xe2\x80\x9315\xe2\x80\x93117(a) (Cum. Supp. 2011); see generally 2006 National Report 103 (noting limitations on the length of juvenile court sanctions).  Discretionary sentencing in adult court would provide different options: There, a judge or jury could choose, rather than a life-without-parole sentence, a lifetime prison term with the possibility of parole or a lengthy term of years.  It is easy to imagine a judge deciding that a minor deserves a (much) harsher sentence than he would receive in juvenile court, while still not thinking life-without-parole appropriate.  For that reason, the discretion available to a judge at the transfer stage cannot substitute for discretion at post-trial sentencing in adult court\xe2\x80\x94and so cannot satisfy the \n \nEighth Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGraham, Roper, and our individualized sentencing decisions make clear that a judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles.  By requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes, the mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the \n \nEighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.  We accordingly reverse the judgments of the Arkansas Supreme Court and Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and remand the cases for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Jackson was ineligible for the death penalty under Thompson v.

See Alabama Brief 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  In addition, life without parole is mandatory for older juveniles in Louisiana (age 15 and up) and Texas (age 17).  See La. Child. Code Ann., Arts. 857(A), (B) (West Supp. 2012); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714:30(C), 14:30.1(B) (West Supp. 2012); Tex.

In many of these jurisdictions, life without parole is the mandatory punishment only for aggravated forms of murder.  That distinction makes no difference to our analysis.  We have consistently held that limiting a mandatory death penalty law to particular kinds of murder cannot cure the law\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional vice\xe2\x80\x9d of disregarding the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances of the particular offense and the character and propensities of the offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  Roberts v.

Here, we consider the constitutional-ity of mandatory sentencing schemes\xe2\x80\x94which by definition remove a judge\xe2\x80\x99s or jury\xe2\x80\x99s discretion\xe2\x80\x94so no comparable gap between legislation and practice can exist.  Rather than showing whether sentencers consider life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders appropriate, the number of juveniles serving this sentence, see post, at 1, 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting), merely reflects the number who have com-mitted homicide in mandatory-sentencing jurisdictions.  For the same reason, The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s comparison of ratios in this case and Gra-ham carries little weight.  He contrasts the number of mandatorylife-without-parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the number of juveniles arrested for murder, with \xe2\x80\x9cthe corresponding number\xe2\x80\x9d of sentences in Graham (i.e., the number of life-without-parole sentences for juveniles who committed serious nonhomicide crimes, as compared to arrests for those crimes).  Post, at 4.  But because the mandatory nature of the sentences here necessarily makes them more common, The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s figures do not \xe2\x80\x9ccorrespon[d]\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  The higher ratio is mostly a function of removing the sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.\nWhere mandatory sentencing does not itself account for the number of juveniles serving life-without-parole terms, the evidence we have of practice supports our holding.  Fifteen jurisdictions make life without parole discretionary for juveniles.  See Alabama Brief 25 (listing 12 States); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.5(b) (West 2008); Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9350\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x933(b) (2011); N.\xc2\xa0M.

According to available data, only about 15% of all juvenile life-without-parole sentences come from those 15 jurisdictions, while 85% come from the 29 mandatory ones.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 10\xe2\x80\x939646, p. 19; Human Rights Watch, State Distribution of Youth Offenders Serv-ing Juvenile Life Without Parole (JLWOP), Oct. 2, 2009, online athttp: // www.hrw.org / news/2009 / 10/02 / state-distribution-juvenile-offenders-serving-juvenile-life-without-parole (as visited June 21, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  That figure indicates that when given the choice, sentencers impose life without parole on children relatively rarely.

Graham v. Florida, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 18).  In my view, without such a finding, the \n \nEighth Amendment as interpreted in Graham forbids sentencing Jackson to such a sentence, regardless of whether its application is mandatory or discretionary under state law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Graham we said that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral culpability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  For one thing, \xe2\x80\x9ccompared to adults, juveniles have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility; they are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure; and their characters are not as well formed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]sychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds\xe2\x80\x9d making their actions \xe2\x80\x9cless likely to be evidence of \xe2\x80\x98irretrievably depraved character\xe2\x80\x99 than are the actions of adults\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Roper v. Simmons, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551, \n570 (2005)\n)); ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  For another thing, Graham recognized that lack of intent normally dimin- ishes the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral culpability\xe2\x80\x9d that attaches to the crime in question, making those that do not intend to kill \xe2\x80\x9ccategorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (citing Kennedy v.

And we concluded that, because of this \xe2\x80\x9ctwice diminished moral culpability,\xe2\x80\x9d the \n \nEighth Amendment forbids the imposition upon juveniles of a sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide cases.  Graham, supra, at ___, ___ (slip op., at 18, 32).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven Graham\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, the kinds of homicide that can subject a juvenile offender to life without parole must exclude instances where the juvenile himself neither kills nor intends to kill the victim.  Quite simply, if the juvenile either kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks \xe2\x80\x9ctwice diminished\xe2\x80\x9d responsibility.  But where the juvenile neither kills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Graham as extenuating apply.  The dissent itself here would permit life without parole for \xe2\x80\x9cjuveniles who commit the worst types of murder,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 7 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of one who did not himself kill or intend to kill.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases, the question of intent is a complicated one.  The felony-murder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in the course of a felony to all participants who intended to commit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or intended to kill.  See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714.5(a) and (c) (2d ed. 2003).  This rule has been based on the idea of \xe2\x80\x9ctransferred intent\xe2\x80\x9d; the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill required for murder.  See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, &amp; C. Streiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed. 2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton\xe2\x80\x99s Criminal Law \xc2\xa7147 (15th ed. 1994).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut in my opinion, this type of \xe2\x80\x9ctransferred intent\xe2\x80\x9d is not sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could subject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole.  As an initial matter, this Court has made clear that this artificially constructed kind of intent does not count as intent for purposes of the \n \nEighth Amendment.  We do not rely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may receive the death penalty.  Thus, the Constitution forbids imposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in a robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and simply was \xe2\x80\x9cin the car by the side of the road .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0, waiting to help the robbers escape.\xe2\x80\x9d  Enmund, supra, at 788.  Cf. Tison, supra, at 157\xe2\x80\x93158 (capital punishment permissi- ble for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death because he was \xe2\x80\x9cactively involved\xe2\x80\x9d in every aspect of the kidnaping and his behavior showed \xe2\x80\x9ca reckless disregard for human life\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given Graham, this holding applies to juvenile sentences of life without parole a\xc2\xa0fortiori.  See ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Indeed, even juveniles who meet the Tison standard of \xe2\x80\x9creckless disregard\xe2\x80\x9d may not be eligible for life without parole.  Rather, Graham dictates a clear rule: The only juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to life without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses who \xe2\x80\x9ckill or intend to kill.\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults, there is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without parole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to kill.  At base, the theory of transferring a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s intent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dangerous felony should understand the risk that the victim of the felony could be killed, even by a confederate.  See 2 LaFave, supra, \xc2\xa714.5(c).  Yet the ability to consider the full consequences of a course of action and to adjust one\xe2\x80\x99s conduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles lack capacity to do effectively.  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939. Justice Frankfurter cautioned, \xe2\x80\x9cLegal theories and their phrasing in other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncrit- ically transferred to a determination of a State\xe2\x80\x99s duty to- ward children.\xe2\x80\x9d  May v. Anderson, \n\n345 U.\xc2\xa0S. 528, \n536 (1953)\n (concurring opinion).  To apply the doctrine of transferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to sentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve such \xe2\x80\x9cfallacious reasoning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation pres- ent in Kuntrell Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Jackson simply went along with older boys to rob a video store.  On the way, he became aware that a confederate had a gun.  He initially stayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying something like \xe2\x80\x9cWe ain\xe2\x80\x99t playin\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I thought you all was playin,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d before an older confederate shot and killed the store clerk.  Jackson v. State, 359 Ark. 87, 91, 194 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 757, 760 (2004).  Crucially, the jury found him guilty of first-degree murder under a statute that permitted them to convict if, Jackson \xe2\x80\x9cattempted to commit or committed an aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that of- fense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s] death under circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  See Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x9310\xe2\x80\x93101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15.  Thus, to be found guilty, Jackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did not), nor did he need to have intent to kill or even \xe2\x80\x9cextreme indifference.\xe2\x80\x9d  As long as one of the teenage accomplices in the robbery acted with extreme indifference to the value of human life, Jackson could be convicted of capital murder.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk, might not have intended to do so either.  See Jackson v. Norris, 2011 Ark. 49, at 10, ___ S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d ___ (Danielson, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny evidence of [Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s] intent to kill was severely lacking\xe2\x80\x9d).  In that case, the \n \nEighth Amendment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the possibility of parole.  If, on remand, however, there is a finding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s death, the question remains open whether the \n \nEighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a juvenile in those circumstances as well.

Our role, however, is to apply the law, not to answer such questions.  The pertinent law here is the \n \nEighth Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unusual punishments.\xe2\x80\x9d  Today, the Court invokes that Amendment to ban a punishment that the Court does not itself characterize as un- usual, and that could not plausibly be described as such.

The Court accepts that over 2,000 of those prisoners received that sentence because it was mandated by a legislature.  Ante, at 22, n.\xc2\xa010.  And it recognizes that the Federal Government and most States impose such mandatory sentences.  Ante, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  Put simply, if a 17-year-old is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent victim, it is not \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d for the murderer to receive a mandatory sentence of life without parole.  That reality should preclude finding that mandatory life imprisonment for juvenile killers violates the \n \nEighth Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur precedent supports this conclusion.  When determining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, this Court typically begins with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98objective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham v. Florida, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10); see also, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana, \n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 407, \n422 (2008)\n; Roper v. Simmons, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551, \n564 (2005)\n.  We look to these \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that we are not simply following our own subjective values or beliefs.  Gregg v. Georgia, \n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 153, \n173 (1976)\n (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).  Such tangible evidence of societal standards enables us to determine whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9cconsensus against\xe2\x80\x9d a given sentencing practice.  Graham, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10).  If there is, the punishment may be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cun- usual.\xe2\x80\x9d  But when, as here, most States formally require and frequently impose the punishment in question, there is no objective basis for that conclusion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur \n \nEighth Amendment cases have also said that we should take guidance from \xe2\x80\x9cevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6 (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, \n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 97, \n102 (1976)\n; internal quotation marks omitted).  Mercy toward the guilty can be a form of decency, and a maturing society may abandon harsh punishments that it comes to view as unnecessary or unjust.  But decency is not the same as leniency.  A decent society protects the innocent from violence.  A mature society may determine that this requires removing those guilty of the most heinous murders from its midst, both as protection for its other members and as a concrete expression of its standards of decency.  As judges we have no basis for deciding that progress toward greater decency can move only in the direction of easing sanctions on the guilty.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, there is little doubt about the direction of society\xe2\x80\x99s evolution: For most of the 20th century, American sentencing practices emphasized rehabilitation of the offender and the availability of parole.  But by the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, outcry against repeat offenders, broad disaffection with the rehabilitative model, and other factors led many legislatures to reduce or eliminate the possibility of parole, imposing longer sentences in order to punish criminals and prevent them from committing more crimes.  See, e.g., Alschuler, The Changing Purposes of Criminal Punishment, 70 U.\xc2\xa0Chi.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1, 1\xe2\x80\x9313 (2003); see generally Crime and Public Policy (J. Wilson &amp; J. Petersilia eds. 2011).  Statutes establishing life without parole sentences in particular became more common in the past quarter century.  See Baze v. Rees, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 35\n, and n.\xc2\xa010 (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  And the parties agree that most States have changed their laws relatively recently to expose teenage murderers to mandatory life without parole.

The Court notes that Graham found a punishment authorized in 39 jurisdictions unconstitutional, whereas the punishment it bans today is mandated in 10 fewer.  Ante, at 21.  But Graham went to considerable lengths to show that although theoretically allowed in many States, the sentence at issue in that case was \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly rare\xe2\x80\x9d in practice.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  The Court explained that only 123 prisoners in the entire Nation were serving life without parole for nonhomicide crimes committed as juveniles, with more than half in a single State.  It contrasted that with statistics showing nearly 400,000 juveniles were arrested for serious nonhomicide offenses in a single year.  Based on the sentence\xe2\x80\x99s rarity despite the many opportunities to im- pose it, Graham concluded that there was a national consensus against life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide crimes.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9316).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere the number of mandatory life without parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the number of juveniles arrested for murder, is over 5,000 times higher than the corresponding number in Graham.  There is thus nothing in this case like the evidence of national consensus in Graham.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court disregards these numbers, claiming that the prevalence of the sentence in question results from the number of statutes requiring its imposition.  Ante, at 21, n.\xc2\xa010.  True enough.  The sentence at issue is statutorily mandated life without parole.  Such a sentence can only result from statutes requiring its imposition.  In Graham the Court relied on the low number of actual sentences to explain why the high number of statutes allowing such sentences was not dispositive.  Here, the Court excuses the high number of actual sentences by citing the high number of statutes imposing it.  To say that a sentence may be considered unusual because so many legislatures approve it stands precedent on its head.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court also advances another reason for discounting the laws enacted by Congress and most state legisla- tures.  Some of the jurisdictions that impose mandatory life without parole on juvenile murderers do so as a result of two statutes: one providing that juveniles charged with serious crimes may be tried as adults, and another generally mandating that those convicted of murder be imprisoned for life.  According to the Court, our cases suggest that where the sentence results from the interaction of two such statutes, the legislature can be considered to have imposed the resulting sentences \xe2\x80\x9cinadvertent[ly].\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 22\xe2\x80\x9325.  The Court relies on Graham and Thompson v. Oklahoma, \n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 815, \n826, n. \n24 (1988)\n (plurality opinion), for the proposition that these laws are therefore not valid evidence of society\xe2\x80\x99s views on the punishment at issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is a fair question whether this Court should ever assume a legislature is so ignorant of its own laws that it does not understand that two of them interact with each other, especially on an issue of such importance as the one before us.  But in Graham and Thompson it was at least plausible as a practical matter.  In Graham, the extreme rarity with which the sentence in question was imposed could suggest that legislatures did not really intend the inevitable result of the laws they passed.  See 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15\xe2\x80\x9316).  In Thompson, the sentencing practice was even rarer\xe2\x80\x94only 20 defendants had received it in the last century.  487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 832 (plurality opinion).  Perhaps under those facts it could be argued that the leg- islature was not fully aware that a teenager could re- ceive the particular sentence in question.  But here the widespread and recent imposition of the sentence makes it implausible to characterize this sentencing practice as a collateral consequence of legislative ignorance.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor do we display our usual respect for elected officials by asserting that legislators have accidentally required 2,000 teenagers to spend the rest of their lives in jail.  This is particularly true given that our well-publicized decision in Graham alerted legislatures to the possibility that teenagers were subject to life with parole only because of legislative inadvertence.  I am aware of no effort in the wake of Graham to correct any supposed legislative oversight.  Indeed, in amending its laws in response to Graham one legislature made especially clear that it does intend juveniles who commit first-degree murder to receive mandatory life without parole.  See Iowa Code Ann. \xc2\xa7902.1 (West Cum. Supp. 2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the end, the Court does not actually conclude that mandatory life sentences for juvenile murderers are un- usual.  It instead claims that precedent \xe2\x80\x9cleads to\xe2\x80\x9d today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, primarily relying on Graham and Roper.  Ante, at 7.  Petitioners argue that the reasoning of those cases \xe2\x80\x9ccompels\xe2\x80\x9d finding in their favor.  Jackson Brief 34.  The Court is apparently unwilling to go so far, asserting only that precedent points in that direction.  But today\xe2\x80\x99s decision invalidates the laws of dozens of legislatures and Congress.  This Court is not easily led to such a result.  See, e.g., United States v. Harris, \n\n106 U.\xc2\xa0S. 629, \n635 (1883)\n (courts must presume an Act of Congress is constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cunless the lack of constitutional authority .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is clearly demonstrated\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the Court does not rely on the \n \nEighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text or objective evidence of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards, its analysis of precedent alone must bear the \xe2\x80\x9cheavy burden [that] rests on those who would attack the judgment of the representatives of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gregg, 428 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 175.  If the Court is unwilling to say that precedent compels today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, perhaps it should reconsider that decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding does not follow from Roper and Graham.  Those cases undoubtedly stand for the proposition that teenagers are less mature, less responsible, and less fixed in their ways than adults\xe2\x80\x94not that a Supreme Court case was needed to establish that.  What they do not stand for, and do not even suggest, is that legislators\xe2\x80\x94who also know that teenagers are different from adults\xe2\x80\x94may not require life without parole for juveniles who commit the worst types of murder.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat Graham does not imply today\xe2\x80\x99s result could not be clearer.  In barring life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, Graham stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is a line \xe2\x80\x98between homicide and other serious violent offenses against the individual.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting Kennedy, 554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 27)).  The whole point of drawing a line between one issue and another is to say that they are different and should be treated differently.  In other words, the two are in different categories.  Which Graham also said: \xe2\x80\x9cdefendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (emphasis added).  Of course, to be especially clear that what is said about one issue does not apply to another, one could say that the two issues cannot be compared.  Graham said that too: \xe2\x80\x9cSerious nonhomicide crimes .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cannot be compared to murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  A case that expressly puts an issue in a different category from its own subject, draws a line between the two, and states that the two should not be compared, cannot fairly be said to control that issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRoper provides even less support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  In that case, the Court held that the death penalty could not be imposed for offenses committed by juveniles, no matter how serious their crimes.  In doing so, Roper also set itself in a different category than this case, by ex- pressly invoking \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d \n \nEighth Amendment analysis for death penalty cases.  543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 568\xe2\x80\x93569.  But more importantly, Roper reasoned that the death penalty was not needed to deter juvenile murderers in part because \xe2\x80\x9clife imprisonment without the possibility of parole\xe2\x80\x9d was available.  Id., at 572.  In a classic bait and switch, the Court now tells state legislatures that\xe2\x80\x94Roper\xe2\x80\x99s promise notwithstanding\xe2\x80\x94they do not have power to guarantee that once someone commits a heinous murder, he will never do so again.  It would be enough if today\xe2\x80\x99s decision proved Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s prescience in writing that Roper\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creassurance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. gives little comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 623 (dissenting opinion).  To claim that Roper actually \xe2\x80\x9cleads to\xe2\x80\x9d revoking its own reassurance surely goes too far.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not offer Roper and Graham\xe2\x80\x99s false promises of restraint.  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion suggests that it is merely a way station on the path to further judicial displacement of the legislative role in prescribing appropriate punishment for crime.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis focuses on the mandatory nature of the sentences in this case.  See ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9317.  But then\xe2\x80\x94although doing so is entirely unnecessary to the rule it announces\xe2\x80\x94the Court states that even when a life without parole sentence is not mandatory, \xe2\x80\x9cwe think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 17.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s holding may be limited to mandatory sentences, but the Court has already announced that discretionary life without parole for juveniles should be \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or, to use a common synonym, \xe2\x80\x9cunusual.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s gratuitous prediction appears to be nothing other than an invitation to overturn life without parole sentences imposed by juries and trial judges.  If that invitation is widely accepted and such sentences for juvenile offenders do in fact become \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court will have bootstrapped its way to declaring that the \n \nEighth Amendment absolutely prohibits them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis process has no discernible end point\xe2\x80\x94or at least none consistent with our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s legal traditions.  Roper and Graham attempted to limit their reasoning to the circumstances they addressed\xe2\x80\x94Roper to the death penalty, and Graham to nonhomicide crimes.  Having cast aside those limits, the Court cannot now offer a credible substitute, and does not even try.  After all, the Court tells us, \xe2\x80\x9cnone of what [Graham] said about children .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is crime- specific.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  The principle behind today\xe2\x80\x99s decision seems to be only that because juveniles are different from adults, they must be sentenced differently.  See ante, at 14\xe2\x80\x9317.  There is no clear reason that principle would not bar all mandatory sentences for juveniles, or any juvenile sentence as harsh as what a similarly situated adult would receive.  Unless confined, the only stopping point for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis would be never permitting juvenile offenders to be tried as adults.  Learning that an Amendment that bars only \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d punishments requires the abolition of this uniformly established practice would be startling indeed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is a great tragedy when a juvenile commits murder\xe2\x80\x94most of all for the innocent victims.  But also for the murderer, whose life has gone so wrong so early.  And for society as well, which has lost one or more of its members to deliberate violence, and must harshly punish another.  In recent years, our society has moved toward requiring that the murderer, his age notwithstanding, be imprisoned for the remainder of his life.  Members of this Court may disagree with that choice.  Perhaps science and policy suggest society should show greater mercy to young killers, giving them a greater chance to reform themselves at the risk that they will kill again.  See ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  But that is not our decision to make.  Neither the text of the Constitution nor our precedent prohibits legislatures from requiring that juvenile murderers be sentenced to life without parole.

So under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own logic, whether discretionary sentences are common or uncommon has nothing to do with whether mandatory sentences are unusual.  In any event, if analysis of discretionary sentences were relevant, it would not provide objective support for today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.

In- stead, the Court looked for objective indicia of our society\xe2\x80\x99s moral standards and the trajectory of our moral \xe2\x80\x9cevolution.\xe2\x80\x9d  See id., at 274\xe2\x80\x93275 (emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judgment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Coker v.

Thus, in Coker, which held that the \n \nEighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman, the Court noted that only one State permitted that practice.  Id., at 595\xe2\x80\x93596.  In Enmund, where the Court held that the \n \nEighth Amendment forbids capital punishment for ordinary felony murder, both federal law and the law of 28 of the 36 States that authorized the death penalty at the time rejected that punishment.  458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 789.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile the tally in these early cases may be characterized as evidence of a national consensus, the evidence became weaker and weaker in later cases.  In Atkins, which held that low-IQ defendants may not be sentenced to death, the Court found an anti\xe2\x80\x93death-penalty consensus even though more than half of the States that allowed capital punishment permitted the practice.  See 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 342 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (observing that less than half of the 38 States that permit capital punishment have enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally retarded).  The Court attempted to get around this problem by noting that there was a pronounced trend against this punishment.  See id., at 313\xe2\x80\x93315 (listing 18 States that had amended their laws since 1986 to prohibit the execution of mentally retarded persons).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe importance of trend evidence, however, was not long lived.  In Roper, which outlawed capital punishment for defendants between the ages of 16 and 18, the lineup of the States was the same as in Atkins, but the trend in favor of abolition\xe2\x80\x94five States during the past 15 years\xe2\x80\x94was less impressive.  Roper, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 564\xe2\x80\x93565.  Nevertheless, the Court held that the absence of a strong trend in support of abolition did not matter.  See id., at 566 (\xe2\x80\x9cAny difference between this case and Atkins with respect to the pace of abolition is thus counterbalanced by the consistent direction of the change\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Court went further.  Holding that the \n \nEighth Amendment prohibits capital punishment for the brutal rape of a 12-year-old girl, the Court disregarded a nascent legislative trend in favor of permitting capital punishment for this narrowly defined and heinous crime.  See 554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 433 (explaining that, although \xe2\x80\x9cthe total number of States to have made child rape a capital offense .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is six,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his is not an indication of a trend or change in direction comparable to the one supported by data in Roper\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court felt no need to see whether this trend developed further\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because true moral evolution can lead in only one direction.  And despite the argument that the rape of a young child may involve greater depravity than some murders, the Court proclaimed that homicide is categorically different from all (or maybe almost all) other offenses.  See id., at 438 (stating that nonhomicide crimes, including child rape, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be devastating in their harm .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public, they cannot be compared to murder in their severity and irrevocability\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  As the Court had previously put it, \xe2\x80\x9cdeath is different.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ford, supra, at 411 (plurality opinion).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo years after Kennedy, in Graham v. Florida, any pretense of heeding a legislative consensus was discarded.  In Graham, federal law and the law of 37 States and the District of Columbia permitted a minor to be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for nonhomicide crimes, but despite this unmistakable evidence of a national consensus, the Court held that the practice violates the \n \nEighth Amendment.  See 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x933).  The Court, however, drew a distinction between minors who murder and minors who commit other heinous offenses, so at least in that sense the principle that death is different lived on.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday, that principle is entirely put to rest, for here we are concerned with the imposition of a term of imprisonment on offenders who kill.  The two (carefully selected) cases before us concern very young defendants, and despite the brutality and evident depravity exhibited by at least one of the petitioners, it is hard not to feel sympathy for a 14-year-old sentenced to life without the possibility of release.  But no one should be confused by the particulars of the two cases before us.  The category of murderers that the Court delicately calls \xe2\x80\x9cchildren\xe2\x80\x9d (murderers under the age of 18) consists overwhelmingly of young men who are fast approaching the legal age of adulthood.  Evan Miller and Kuntrell Jackson are anomalies; much more typical are murderers like Donald Roper, who committed a brutal thrill-killing just nine months shy of his 18th birthday.  Roper, 543 U. S., at 556.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSeventeen-year-olds commit a significant number of murders every year,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and some of these crimes are incredibly brutal.  Many of these murderers are at least as mature as the average 18-year-old.  See Thompson, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 854 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that maturity may \xe2\x80\x9cvary widely among different individuals of the same age\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress and the legislatures of 43 States have concluded that at least some of these murderers should be sentenced to prison without parole, and 28 States and the Federal Government have decided that for some of these offenders life without parole should be mandatory.  See Ante, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, and nn.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.  The majority of this Court now overrules these legislative judgments.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is true that, at least for now, the Court apparently permits a trial judge to make an individualized decision that a particular minor convicted of murder should be sentenced to life without parole, but do not expect this possibility to last very long.  The majority goes out of its way to express the view that the imposition of a sentence of life without parole on a \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d (i.e., a murderer under the age of 18) should be uncommon.  Having held in Graham that a trial judge with discretionary sentencing authority may not impose a sentence of life without parole on a minor who has committed a nonhomicide offense, the Justices in the majority may soon extend that holding to minors who commit murder.  We will see.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat today\xe2\x80\x99s decision shows is that our \n \nEighth Amendment cases are no longer tied to any objective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards.  Our \n \nEighth Amendment case law is now entirely inward looking.  After entirely disregarding objective indicia of our society\xe2\x80\x99s standards in Graham, the Court now extrapolates from Graham.  Future cases may extrapolate from today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, and this process may continue until the majority brings sentencing practices into line with whatever the majority views as truly evolved standards of decency.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe \n \nEighth Amendment imposes certain limits on the sentences that may be imposed in criminal cases, but for the most part it leaves questions of sentencing policy to be determined by Congress and the state legislatures\xe2\x80\x94and with good reason.  Determining the length of imprisonment that is appropriate for a particular offense and a particular offender inevitably involves a balancing of in- terests.  If imprisonment does nothing else, it removes the criminal from the general population and prevents him from committing additional crimes in the outside world.  When a legislature prescribes that a category of killers must be sentenced to life imprisonment, the legislature, which presumably reflects the views of the electorate, is taking the position that the risk that these offenders will kill again outweighs any countervailing consideration, including reduced culpability due to immaturity or the possibility of rehabilitation.  When the majority of this Court countermands that democratic decision, what the majority is saying is that members of society must be exposed to the risk that these convicted murderers, if released from custody, will murder again.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnless our cases change course, we will continue to march toward some vision of evolutionary culmination that the Court has not yet disclosed.

To reach that result, the Court relies on two lines of precedent.  The first involves the categorical prohibition of certain punishments for specified classes of offenders.

The Court compounds its errors by combining these lines of precedent and extending them to reach a result that is even less legitimate than the foundation on which it is built.

In Roper, the Court held that the Constitution prohibits the execution of an offender who was under 18 at the time of his offense.  543 U. S., at 578.  The Roper Court looked to, among other things, its own sense of parental intuition and \xe2\x80\x9cscientific and sociological studies\xe2\x80\x9d to conclude that offenders under the age of 18 \xe2\x80\x9ccannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 569.

In short, it does not authorize courts to invalidate any punishment they deem disproportionate to the severity of the crime or to a particular class of offenders.

But even accepting an analogy between capital and juvenile life-without-parole sentences, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases prohibiting mandatory capital sentencing schemes have no basis in the original understanding of the \n \nEighth Amendment, and, thus, cannot justify a prohibition of sentencing schemes that mandate life-without-parole sentences for juveniles.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn a line of cases following Furman v.

Furman first announced the principle that States may not permit sentencers to exercise unguided discretion in imposing the death pen- alty.  See generally \n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238\n.  In response to Furman, many States passed new laws that made the death pen- alty mandatory following conviction of specified crimes, thereby eliminating the offending discretion.  See Gregg v.

It is not concerned with whether a particular lawful method of punishment\xe2\x80\x94whether capital or noncapital\xe2\x80\x94is imposed pursuant to a mandatory or discretionary sentencing regime.  See Gardner v. Florida, \n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 349, \n371 (1977)\n (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe prohibition of the \n \nEighth Amendment relates to the character of the punishment, and not to the process by which it is imposed\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the early days of the Republic,\xe2\x80\x9d each crime generally had a defined punishment \xe2\x80\x9cprescribed with specificity by the legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Grayson, \n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41, \n45 (1978)\n.  Capital sentences, to which the Court analogizes, were treated no differently.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]andatory death sentences abounded in our first Penal Code\xe2\x80\x9d and were \xe2\x80\x9ccommon in the several States\xe2\x80\x94both at the time of the founding and throughout the 19th century.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harmelin, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 994\xe2\x80\x93995; see also Woodson, supra, at 289 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cAt the time the \n \nEighth Amendment was adopted in 1791, the States uniformly followed the common-law practice of making death the exclusive and mandatory sentence for certain specified offenses\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, the idea that the mandatory imposition of an otherwise-constitutional sentence renders that sentence cruel and unusual finds \xe2\x80\x9cno support in the text and history of the \n \nEighth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harmelin, supra, at 994.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, mandatory death penalty schemes were \xe2\x80\x9ca perfectly reasonable legislative response to the concerns expressed in Furman\xe2\x80\x9d regarding unguided sentencing discretion, in that they \xe2\x80\x9celiminat[ed] explicit jury discretion and treat[ed] all defendants equally.\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham v. Collins, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461, \n487 (1993)\n (Thomas, J., concurring).  And, as Justice White explained more than 30 years ago, \xe2\x80\x9ca State is not constitutionally forbidden to provide that the commission of certain crimes conclusively establishes that a criminal\xe2\x80\x99s character is such that he deserves death.\xe2\x80\x9d  Roberts, supra, at 358 (dissenting opinion).  Thus, there is no basis for concluding that a mandatory capi- tal sentencing scheme is unconstitutional.  Because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases requiring individualized sentencing in the capital context are wrongly decided, they cannot serve as a valid foundation for the novel rule regarding mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles that the Court announces today.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, this Court has already declined to extend its individualized-sentencing rule beyond the death pen- alty context.  In Harmelin, the defendant was convicted of possessing a large quantity of drugs.  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 961 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  In accordance with Michigan law, he was sentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Ibid.  Citing the same line of death penalty precedents on which the Court relies today, the defendant argued that his sentence, due to its mandatory nature, violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Id., at 994\xe2\x80\x93995 (opinion of the Court).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court rejected that argument, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here can be no serious contention .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that a sentence which is not otherwise cruel and unusual becomes so sim- ply because it is \xe2\x80\x98mandatory.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 995.  In so doing, the Court refused to analogize to its death penalty cases.  The Court noted that those cases had \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly suggested that there is no comparable [individualized-sentencing] requirement outside the capital context, because of the qualitative difference between death and all other penalties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Court observed that, \xe2\x80\x9ceven where the difference\xe2\x80\x9d between a sentence of life without parole and other sentences of imprisonment \xe2\x80\x9cis the greatest,\xe2\x80\x9d such a sentence \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be compared with death.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 996.  Therefore, the Court concluded that the line of cases requiring individualized sentencing had been drawn at cap- ital cases, and that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno basis for extending it further.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CommentText">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHarmelin\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning logically extends to these cases.  Obviously, the younger the defendant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe great[er]\xe2\x80\x9d the difference between a sentence of life without parole and other terms of imprisonment.  Ibid.  But under Harmelin\xe2\x80\x99s rationale, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age is immaterial to the \n \nEighth Amendment analysis.  Thus, the result in today\xe2\x80\x99s cases should be the same as that in Harmelin.  Petitioners, like the defendant in Harmelin, were not sentenced to death.  Accordingly, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases \xe2\x80\x9ccreating and clarifying the individualized capital sentencing doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d do not apply.  Id., at 995 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNothing about our Constitution, or about the qualitative difference between any term of imprisonment and death, has changed since Harmelin was decided 21 years ago.  What has changed (or, better yet, \xe2\x80\x9cevolved\xe2\x80\x9d) is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s ever-expanding line of categorical proportionality cases.  The Court now uses Roper and Graham to jettison Harmelin\xe2\x80\x99s clear distinction between capital and noncapital cases and to apply the former to noncapital juvenile offenders.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to do so is even less supportable than the precedents used to reach it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs The Chief Justice notes, ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (dissenting opinion), the Court lays the groundwork for future incursions on the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to sentence criminals.  In its categorical proportionality cases, the Court has considered \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98objective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice\xe2\x80\x99 to determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563).  In Graham, for example, the Court looked to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctual sentencing practices\xe2\x80\x9d to conclude that there was a national consensus against life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9314); see also Roper, supra, at 564\xe2\x80\x93565; Atkins v.

That statement may well cause trial judges to shy away from imposing life without parole sentences and embolden appellate judges to set them aside when they are imposed.  And, when a future petitioner seeks a categorical ban on sentences of life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders, this Court will most assuredly look to the \xe2\x80\x9cactual sentencing practices\xe2\x80\x9d triggered by this case.  The Court has, thus, gone from \xe2\x80\x9cmerely\xe2\x80\x9d divining the societal consensus of today to shaping the societal consensus of tomorrow.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday\xe2\x80\x99s decision invalidates a constitutionally permissible sentencing system based on nothing more than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s belief that \xe2\x80\x9cits own sense of morality .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pre-empts that of the people and their representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Graham, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 29).

When the Bill of Rights was ratified, 14-year-olds were subject to trial and punishment as adult offenders.  See Roper v. Simmons, \n, n.\xc2\xa01 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Further, mandatory death sentences were common at that time.  See Harmelin v. Michigan, \n\xe2\x80\x93995 (1991).  It is therefore implausible that a 14-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory prison sentence\xe2\x80\x94of any length, with or without parole\xe2\x80\x94would have been viewed as cruel and unusual.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">3</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court later extended Woodson, requiring that capital defendants be permitted to present, and sentencers in capital cases be permitted to consider, any relevant mitigating evidence, including the age of the defendant.
