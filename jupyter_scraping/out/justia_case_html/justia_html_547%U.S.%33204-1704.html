A group of plaintiffs including Toledo residents who pay state and local taxes sued in state court, alleging that the tax breaks violated the Commerce Clause.  The taxpayer plaintiffs claimed injury because the tax breaks depleted the state and local treasuries to which they contributed.  Defendants removed the action to District Court.  Plaintiffs moved to remand to state court because, <em>inter alia,</em> they doubted whether they satisfied either the constitutional or prudential limitations on standing in federal court.  The District Court declined to remand the case, concluding that plaintiffs had standing under the \xe2\x80\x9cmunicipal taxpayer standing\xe2\x80\x9d rule articulated in <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Mellon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/index.html"></a><a href="/us/262/447/index.html">262 U. S. 447</a>.  On the merits, the court found that neither tax benefit violated the Commerce Clause.  Without addressing standing, the Sixth Circuit agreed as to the municipal tax exemption, but held that the state franchise tax credit violated the Commerce Clause.  Defendants sought certiorari to review the invalidation of the franchise tax credit, and plaintiffs sought certiorari to review the upholding of the property tax exemption.  This Court granted review to consider whether the franchise tax credit violates the Commerce Clause, and directed the parties to address the issue of standing.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Plaintiffs have not established their standing to challenge the state franchise tax credit.

This Court has denied <em>federal</em> taxpayers standing under Article III to object to a particular expenditure of federal funds simply because they are taxpayers.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Valley Forge Christian College, supra,</em> at 476\xe2\x80\x93482.  The animating principle behind cases such as <em>Valley Forge</em> was announced in <em>Frothingham</em> v. <em>Mellon,</em> decided with <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Mellon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/index.html"></a><a href="/us/262/447/index.html">262 U. S. 447</a>, in which the Court observed that a federal taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in the moneys of the Treasury \xe2\x80\xa6 is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 486\xe2\x80\x93487.  This rationale applies with undiminished force to state taxpayers who allege simply that a state fiscal decision will deplete the fisc and \xe2\x80\x9cimpose disproportionate burdens on them.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Doremus</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/index.html">342 U. S. 429</a>, 433\xe2\x80\x93434.  Because state budgets frequently have an array of tax and spending provisions that may be challenged on a variety of bases, affording state taxpayers standing to press such challenges simply because their tax burden gives them an interest in the state treasury would interpose the federal courts as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of state fiscal administration, contrary to the more modest role Article III envisions for federal courts.  See <em>Allen, supra,</em>\xc2\xa0at 760\xe2\x80\x93761.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Also rejected is plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that they have state taxpayer standing on the ground that their Commerce Clause challenge is just like the Establishment Clause challenge this Court permitted in <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a>, 105\xe2\x80\x93106.  <em>Flast </em>allowed an Establishment Clause challenge by federal taxpayers to a congressional action under Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78.  Although <em>Flast </em>held out the possibility that \xe2\x80\x9cspecific [constitutional] limitations\xe2\x80\x9d other than the Establishment Clause might support federal taxpayer standing, <em>id.,</em> at 105, 85, only the Establishment Clause has been held to do so since <em>Flast, </em>see, <em>e.g., Bowen</em> v. <em>Kendrick,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/589/index.html">487 U. S. 589</a>, 618.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on <em>Flast </em>is misguided: Whatever rights plaintiffs have under the Commerce Clause, they are fundamentally unlike the right not to contribute even \xe2\x80\x9cthree pence\xe2\x80\x9d to support a religious establishment that was upheld in <em>Flast, </em>392 U. S., at 103.  Indeed, plaintiffs compare the two Clauses at such a high level of generality that almost any constitutional constraint on government power could be likened to the Establishment Clause as interpreted in <em>Flast</em>.  <em>Id.,</em> at 105.  And a finding that the Commerce Clause satisfies the <em>Flast </em>test because it often implicates governments\xe2\x80\x99 fiscal decisions would leave no principled way of distinguishing other constitutional provisions that also constrain governments\xe2\x80\x99 taxing and spending decisions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Arkansas Writers\xe2\x80\x99 Project, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ragland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/221/index.html">481 U. S. 221</a>.  Yet such a broad application of <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer standing would be at odds with <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s own promise that it would not transform federal courts into forums for taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cgeneralized grievances.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S.<em>,</em> at 106.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 status as <em>municipal</em> taxpayers does not give them standing to challenge the <em>state</em> franchise tax credit at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has noted with approval the standing of municipal taxpayers to enjoin the illegal use of a municipal corporation\xe2\x80\x99s funds.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Frothingham, supra,</em> at 486\xe2\x80\x93487.  But plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to leverage the notion of municipal taxpayer standing into standing to challenge the state tax credit are unavailing.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs argue that because state law requires revenues from the franchise tax to be distributed to local governments, the award of a credit to DaimlerChrysler reduced such distributions and thus depleted the funds of local governments to which plaintiffs pay taxes.  But plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge is still to the state law and state decision, not those of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 municipality.  Their argument thus suffers from the same defects that the claim of state taxpayer standing exhibits.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Also rejected is plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim that their standing to challenge the municipal property tax exemption supports jurisdiction over their challenge to the franchise tax credit under the \xe2\x80\x9csupplemental jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d recognized in <em>Mine Workers</em> v. <em>Gibbs,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/index.html">383 U. S. 715</a>.  <em>Gibbs </em>held that federal-question jurisdiction over a claim may authorize a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims that may be viewed as part of the same case because they \xe2\x80\x9cderive from a common nucleus of operative fact\xe2\x80\x9d as the federal claim.  <em>Id.,</em> at 725.  Plaintiffs assume that <em>Gibbs </em>stands for the proposition that federal jurisdiction extends to all claims sufficiently related to a claim within Article III to be part of the same case, regardless of the deficiency that would keep the former claims out of federal court if presented on their own.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s general approach to the application of <em>Gibbs</em> has been markedly more cautious.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Exxon Mobil Corp.</em> v. <em>Allapattah Services, Inc., </em>545 U. S. ___, ___.  The Court has never applied <em>Gibbs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 rationale to permit a federal court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim that does not itself satisfy those elements of the Article III inquiry, such as constitutional standing, that \xe2\x80\x9cserv[e] to identify those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitmore</em> v. <em>Arkansas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/149/index.html">495 U. S. 149</a>, 155.  There is no reason to read <em>Gibbs\xe2\x80\x99</em> language as broadly as plaintiffs urge, particularly since the Court\xe2\x80\x99s standing cases confirm that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press, see, <em>e.g., Allen, supra,</em> at 752.  If standing were commutative, as plaintiffs claim, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought, see, <em>e.g., Friends of Earth, Inc.</em> v. <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/167/index.html">528 U. S. 167</a>, 185, would make little sense when all claims for relief derive from a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon nucleus of operative fact,\xe2\x80\x9d as they appear to have in cases like <em>Laidlaw</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such a reading of <em>Gibbs</em> would have remarkable implications.  The doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and political question all originate in Article III\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d language, no less than standing does.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>National Park Hospitality Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Interior, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/803/index.html">538 U. S. 803</a>, 808.  Yet if <em>Gibbs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccommon nucleus\xe2\x80\x9d formulation<em> </em>announced a new definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d for all Article III purposes, a federal court would be free to entertain moot or unripe claims, or claims presenting a political question, if they \xe2\x80\x9cderived from\xe2\x80\x9d the same \xe2\x80\x9coperative fact[s]\xe2\x80\x9d as another federal claim suffering from none of these defects.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reading of <em>Gibbs</em>, therefore, would amount to a significant revision of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent interpreting Article III.  With federal courts thus deciding issues they would not otherwise be authorized to decide, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tripartite allocation of power\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that Article III is designed to maintain, <em>Valley Forge, supra</em>, at 474, would quickly erode, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the standing requirement\xe2\x80\x99s role in maintaining this separation would be rendered hollow rhetoric, see <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Casey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/343/index.html">518 U.

Taxpayers in Toledo sued, alleging that their local and state tax burdens were increased by the tax breaks for DaimlerChrysler, tax breaks that they asserted violated the Commerce Clause.  The Court of Appeals agreed that a state tax credit offered under Ohio law violated the Commerce Clause, and state and local officials and DaimlerChrysler sought review in this Court.  We are obligated before reaching this Commerce Clause question to determine whether the taxpayers who objected to the credit have standing to press their complaint in federal court.

Determining that a matter before the federal courts is a proper case or controversy under Article III therefore assumes particular importance in ensuring that the Federal Judiciary respects \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the proper\xe2\x80\x94and properly limited\xe2\x80\x94role of the courts in a democratic society,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Allen</em> v. <em>Wright,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/index.html">468 U.

If the judicial power extended to every <em>question </em>under the constitution it would involve almost every subject proper for legislative discussion and decision; if to every <em>question </em>under the laws and treaties of the United States it would involve almost every subject on which the executive could act.  The division of power [among the branches of government] could exist no longer, and the other departments would be swallowed up by the judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Papers of John Marshall 95 (C.

In rejecting a claim that improper federal appropriations would \xe2\x80\x9cincrease the burden of future taxation and thereby take [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] property without due process of law,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court observed that a federal taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cinterest in the moneys of the Treasury \xe2\x80\xa6 is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 486\xe2\x80\x93487.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis logic is equally applicable to taxpayer challenges to expenditures that deplete the treasury, and to taxpayer challenges to so-called \xe2\x80\x9ctax expenditures,\xe2\x80\x9d which reduce amounts available to the treasury by granting tax credits or exemptions.  In either case, the alleged injury is based on the asserted effect of the allegedly illegal activity on public revenues, to which the taxpayer contributes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Standing has been rejected in such cases because the alleged injury is not \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete and particularized,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 560, but instead a grievance the taxpayer \xe2\x80\x9csuffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Frothingham</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 488.  In addition, the injury is not \xe2\x80\x9cactual or imminent,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead \xe2\x80\x9cconjectural or hypothetical.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 560 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  As an initial matter, it is unclear that tax breaks of the sort at issue here do in fact deplete the treasury: The very point of the tax benefits is to spur economic activity, which in turn <em>increases </em>government revenues.  In this very action, the Michigan plaintiffs claimed that they were injured because they lost out on the added revenues that would have accompanied DaimlerChrysler\xe2\x80\x99s decision to expand facilities in Michigan.  See n.\xc2\xa02,<em> supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injury is also \xe2\x80\x9cconjectural or hypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d in that it depends on how legislators respond to a reduction in revenue, if that is the consequence of the credit.  Establishing injury requires speculating that elected officials will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s tax bill to make up a deficit; establishing redressability requires speculating that abolishing the challenged credit will redound to the benefit of the taxpayer because legislators will pass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.  Neither sort of speculation suffices to support standing.  See <em>ASARCO Inc.</em> v. <em>Kadish,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/605/index.html"></a><a href="/us/490/605/index.html">490 U.

We indicated as much in <em>Doremus</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/index.html">342 U. S. 429</a> (1952).  In that case, we noted our earlier holdings that \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury are too indeterminable, remote, uncertain and indirect\xe2\x80\x9d to support standing to challenge \xe2\x80\x9ctheir manner of expenditure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 433.  We then \xe2\x80\x9creiterate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d what we had said in rejecting a federal taxpayer challenge to a federal statute \xe2\x80\x9cas equally true when a state Act is assailed: \xe2\x80\x98The [taxpayer] must be able to show \xe2\x80\xa6 that he has sustained \xe2\x80\xa6 some direct injury \xe2\x80\xa6 and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 433\xe2\x80\x93434 (quoting <em>Frothingham</em>,<em>  supra,</em> at 488); see <em>ASARCO</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 613\xe2\x80\x93614 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have likened state taxpayers to federal taxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of taxpayer standing (citing <em>Doremus</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 434)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The allegations of injury that plaintiffs make in their complaint furnish no better basis for finding standing than those made in the cases where federal taxpayer standing was denied.  Plaintiffs claim that DaimlerChrysler\xe2\x80\x99s tax credit depletes the Ohio fisc and \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[es] disproportionate burdens on [them].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 28a.  This is no different from similar claims by federal taxpayers we have already rejected under Article III as insufficient to establish standing.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Frothingham,</em> 262 U. S.<em>,</em> at 486 (allegation of injury that the effect of government spending \xe2\x80\x9cwill be to increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take [plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] property without due process of law\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0State policymakers, no less than their federal counterparts, retain broad discretion to make \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy decisions\xe2\x80\x9d concerning state spending \xe2\x80\x9cin different ways \xe2\x80\xa6 depending on their perceptions of wise state fiscal policy and myriad other circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>ASARCO</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 615 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  Federal courts may not assume a particular exercise of this state fiscal discretion in establishing standing; a party seeking federal jurisdiction cannot rely on such \xe2\x80\x9c[s]peculative inferences \xe2\x80\xa6 to connect [his] injury to the challenged actions of [the defendant],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Simon,</em> 426 U. S., at 45; see also <em>Allen</em>,<em> </em>468 U. S.<em>,</em> at 759.  Indeed, because state budgets frequently contain an array of tax and spending provisions, any number of which may be challenged on a variety of bases, affording state taxpayers standing to press such challenges simply because their tax burden gives them an interest in the state treasury would interpose the federal courts as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of state fiscal administration, contrary to the more modest role Article III envisions for federal courts.  See <em>id.,</em> at 760\xe2\x80\x93761 (quoting <em>Laird</em> v. <em>Tatum,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/1/index.html">408 U.

I, \xc2\xa78, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on <em>Flast </em>is misguided: Whatever rights plaintiffs have under the Commerce Clause, they are fundamentally unlike the right not to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98contribute three pence \xe2\x80\xa6 for the support of any one [religious] establishment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S.<em>,</em> at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)).  Indeed, plaintiffs compare the Establishment Clause to the Commerce Clause at such a high level of generality that almost any constitutional constraint on government power would \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically limit\xe2\x80\x9d a State\xe2\x80\x99s taxing and spending power for <em>Flast </em>purposes.  392 U. S.<em>,</em> at 105; see Brief for Respondents 14 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn each case, the harm to be avoided by [the two clauses] is the loss of governmental neutrality\xe2\x80\x9d).  And even if the two clauses are similar in that they often implicate governments\xe2\x80\x99 fiscal decisions, see <em>id.,</em> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, a finding that the Commerce Clause satisfies the <em>Flast </em>test would leave no principled way of distinguishing those other constitutional provisions that we have recognized constrain governments\xe2\x80\x99 taxing and spending decisions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Arkansas Writers\xe2\x80\x99 Project, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ragland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/221/index.html">481 U. S. 221</a> (1987) (invalidating state sales tax under the Free Press Clause).  Yet such a broad application of <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer standing would be quite at odds with its narrow application in our precedent and <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s own promise that it would not transform federal courts into forums for taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cgeneralized grievances.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S.<em>,</em> at 106. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Flast </em>is consistent with the principle, underlying the Article III prohibition on taxpayer suits, that a litigant may not assume a particular disposition of government funds in establishing standing.  The <em>Flast </em>Court discerned in the history of the Establishment Clause \xe2\x80\x9cthe specific evils feared by [its drafters] that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion in general.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 103<em>.</em>  The Court therefore understood the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury\xe2\x80\x9d alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal spending to be the very \xe2\x80\x9cextract[ion] and spen[ding]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9ctax money\xe2\x80\x9d in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff.  <em>Id.,</em> at 106.  And an injunction against the spending would of course redress <em>that</em> injury, regardless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way that would benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally.  See <em>Valley Forge, </em>454 U. S.<em>,</em> at 514 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 invocation of the Establishment Clause was of decisive importance in resolving the standing issue in <em>[Flast]</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs thus do not have state taxpayer standing on the ground that their Commerce Clause challenge is just like the Establishment Clause challenge in <em>Flast</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs also claim that their status as <em>municipal</em> taxpayers gives them standing to challenge the <em>state</em> franchise tax credit at issue here.  The <em>Frothingham</em> Court noted with approval the standing of municipal residents to enjoin the \xe2\x80\x9cillegal use of the moneys of a municipal corporation,\xe2\x80\x9d relying on \xe2\x80\x9cthe peculiar relation of the corporate taxpayer to the corporation\xe2\x80\x9d to distinguish such a case from the general bar on taxpayer suits.  262 U.

Plaintiffs here challenged the municipal property tax exemption as municipal taxpayers.  That challenge was rejected by the Court of Appeals on the merits, and no issue regarding plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 standing to bring it has been raised.  In plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to the state franchise tax credit, however, they identify no municipal action contributing to any claimed injury.  Instead, they try to leverage the notion of municipal taxpayer standing beyond challenges to municipal action, in two ways.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, plaintiffs claim that because state law requires revenues from the franchise tax to be distributed to local governments, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa75733.12 (Lexis 2005), the award of a credit to DaimlerChrysler reduced such distributions and thus depleted the funds of \xe2\x80\x9clocal governments to which Respondents pay taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 16.  But plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge is still to the state law and state decision, not those of their municipality.  We have already explained why a state taxpayer lacks standing to challenge a state fiscal decision on the grounds that it might affect his tax liability.  All plaintiffs have done in recasting their claims as ones brought by municipal taxpayers whose municipalities receive funding from the State\xe2\x80\x94the level of which might be affected by the same state fiscal decision\xe2\x80\x94is introduce yet another level of conjecture to their already hypothetical claim of injury.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And in fact events have highlighted the peril of assuming that any revenue increase resulting from a taxpayer suit will be put to a particular use.  Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s General Assembly suspended the statutory budget mechanism that distributes franchise tax revenues to local governments in 2001 and again in its subsequent biennial budgets.\nSee Amended Substitute H.\xc2\xa0B. 94, 124th General Assembly \xc2\xa7140 (2001), available at http://www.legislature.state.\noh.us/BillText124/124_HB_94_ENR.pdf (all Internet ma-\nterials as visited May 12, 2006, and available in\nClerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); Amended Substitute H.\xc2\xa0B.\n95, 125th General Assembly \xc2\xa7139 (2003), available at http://\xc2\xa0www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText125/125_HB_95_EN2_N.pdf; Amended Substitute H.\xc2\xa0B. 66, 126th Gen-\neral Assembly \xc2\xa7557.12 (2005), available at http://www.\nlegislature.state.oh.us/BillText126/126_HB_66_EN2d.pdf.  Any effect that enjoining DaimlerChrysler\xe2\x80\x99s credit will have on municipal funds, therefore, will not result from automatic operation of a statutory formula, but from a hypothesis that the state government will choose to direct the supposed revenue from the restored franchise tax to municipalities.  This is precisely the sort of conjecture we may not entertain in assessing standing.  See <em>ASARCO</em>,<em> supra,</em> at  614 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second way plaintiffs seek to leverage their standing to challenge the municipal property tax exemption into a challenge to the franchise tax credit is by relying on <em>Mine Workers</em> v. <em>Gibbs,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/index.html">383 U. S. 715</a> (1966).  According to plaintiffs, the \xe2\x80\x9csupplemental jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d recognized in that case supports jurisdiction over all their claims, once the District Court determined they had standing to challenge the property tax exemption.  Brief for Respondents 17\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Gibbs </em>held that federal-question jurisdiction over a claim may authorize a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims that may be viewed as part of the same case because they \xe2\x80\x9cderive from a common nucleus of operative fact\xe2\x80\x9d as the federal claim.  383 U. S., at 725.  Plaintiffs assume that <em>Gibbs </em>stands for the proposition that federal jurisdiction extends to all claims sufficiently related to a claim within Article III to be part of the same case, regardless of the nature of the deficiency that would keep the former claims out of federal court if presented on their own.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our general approach to the application of <em>Gibbs</em>, however,<em> </em>has been markedly more cautious.  For example, as a matter of statutory construction of the pertinent jurisidictional provisions, we refused to extend <em>Gibbs </em>to allow claims to be asserted against nondiverse parties when jurisdiction was based on diversity, see <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</em> v. <em>Kroger,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/index.html">437 U. S. 365</a> (1978), and we refused to extend <em>Gibbs </em>to authorize supplemental jurisdiction over claims that do not satisfy statutory amount-in-controversy requirements, see <em>Finley</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/index.html">490 U. S. 545</a> (1989).  As the Court explained just last Term, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e have not \xe2\x80\xa6 applied <em>Gibbs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 expansive interpretive approach to other aspects of the jurisdictional statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Exxon Mobil Corp.</em> v. <em>Allapattah Services, Inc., </em>545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 5) (applying 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367, enacted in 1990, to allow a federal court in a diversity action to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional diverse plaintiffs whose claims failed to meet the amount-in-controversy threshold).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What we have never done is apply the rationale of <em>Gibbs </em>to permit a federal court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim that does not itself satisfy those elements of the Article III inquiry, such as constitutional standing, that \xe2\x80\x9cserv[e] to identify those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitmore,</em> 495 U. S., at 155.  We see no reason to read the language of <em>Gibbs </em>so broadly, particularly since our standing cases confirm that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.  See <em>Allen,</em> 468 U. S., at 752 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the <em>particular claims </em>asserted\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  We have insisted, for instance, that \xe2\x80\x9ca plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Laidlaw, </em>528 U. S., at 185; see <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, 109 (1983).  But if standing were commutative, as plaintiffs claim, this insistence would make little sense when all claims for relief derive from a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon nucleus of operative fact,\xe2\x80\x9d as they certainly appear to have in both <em>Laidlaw</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 175\xe2\x80\x93179, and <em>Lyons</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 97\xe2\x80\x9398.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reading of <em>Gibbs </em>to<em> </em>allow standing as to one claim to suffice for all claims arising from the same \xe2\x80\x9cnucleus of operative fact\xe2\x80\x9d would have remarkable implications.  The doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and political question all originate in Article III\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d language, no less than standing does.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>National Park Hospitality Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Interior, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/803/index.html">538 U. S. 803</a>, 808 (2003) (ripeness); <em>Arizonans for Official English</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/43/index.html">520 U. S. 43</a>, 67 (1997) (mootness); <em>Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</em> 418 U. S., at 215 (political question).  Yet if <em>Gibbs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccommon nucleus\xe2\x80\x9d formulation<em> </em>announced a new definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d for all Article III purposes, a federal court would be free to entertain moot or unripe claims, or claims presenting a political question, if they \xe2\x80\x9cderived from\xe2\x80\x9d the same \xe2\x80\x9coperative fact[s]\xe2\x80\x9d as another federal claim suffering from none\nof these defects.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reading of <em>Gibbs</em>, therefore, would amount to a significant revision of our precedent interpreting Article III.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With federal courts thus deciding issues they would not otherwise be authorized to decide, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tripartite allocation of power\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that Article III is designed to maintain, <em>Valley Forge</em>, 454 U. S., at 474, would quickly erode; our emphasis on the standing requirement\xe2\x80\x99s role in maintaining this separation would be rendered hollow rhetoric.  As we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he actual-injury requirement would hardly serve the purpose \xe2\x80\xa6 of preventing courts from undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches[,] if once a plaintiff demonstrated harm from one particular inadequacy in government administration, the court were authorized to remedy <em>all </em>inadequacies in that administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Casey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/343/index.html">518 U. S. 343</a>, 357 (1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Lewis </em>emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he remedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 theory of ancillary standing would contravene this principle.  Plaintiffs failed to establish Article III injury with respect to their <em>state </em>taxes, and even if they did do so with respect to their <em>municipal </em>taxes, that injury does not entitle them to seek a remedy as to the state taxes.  As the Court summed up the point in <em>Lewis</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 358, n.\xc2\xa06.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All the theories plaintiffs have offered to support their standing to challenge the franchise tax credit are unavailing.  Because plaintiffs have no standing to challenge that credit, the lower courts erred by considering their claims against it on the merits.  The judgment of the Sixth Circuit is therefore vacated in part, and the cases are remanded for dismissal of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to the franchise tax credit.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Ohio has begun phasing out the franchise tax and has discontinued offering new credits against the tax like the one DaimlerChrysler received.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75733.01(G), 5733.33(B)(1) (Lexis 2005).  Where relevant, therefore, the citations in this opinion are to the statutes in effect at the time DaimlerChrysler made its investment.  </p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Other plaintiffs were residents of Toledo who claimed they were injured because they were displaced by the DaimlerChrysler expansion and Michigan residents who claimed injury because DaimlerChrysler would have expanded its operations in Michigan but for the Ohio investment tax credit.  Plaintiffs neither identified these allegations as a basis for standing in their merits brief before this Court nor referred to them at oral argument.  Any argument based on these allegations is therefore abandoned.  See, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>International Business Machines Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/843/index.html">517 U.

Indeed, plaintiffs initially expressed doubts as to their standing.  Nonetheless, because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e presume that federal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Renne</em> v. <em>Geary,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/312/index.html">501 U.

Whatever the parties\xe2\x80\x99 previous positions on the propriety of a federal forum, plaintiffs, as the parties seeking to establish federal jurisdiction, must make the showings required for standing.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority of the Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue have reached a similar conclusion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Booth</em> v. <em>Hvass</em>, 302 F.\xc2\xa03d 849 (CA8 2002); <em>Board of Ed. of Mt.

But two of those cases hold only that, once a litigant has standing to request invalidation of a particular agency action, it may do so by identifying all grounds on which the agency may have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98failed to comply with its statutory mandate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sierra Club</em> v. <em>Adams</em>, 578 F.\xc2\xa02d 389, 392 (CADC 1978) (quoting<em> Sierra Club</em> v. <em>Morton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/index.html">405 U.

They do not establish that the litigant can, by virtue of his standing to challenge one government action, challenge other governmental actions that did not injure him.  In the third case, the Court of Appeals relied substantially on the fact that \xe2\x80\x9call courts possess an inherent power to prevent unprofessional conduct by those attorneys who are practicing before them\xe2\x80\x9d in allowing the Government to contest the division of a damages award it was ordered to pay between a plaintiff and his attorney.  <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 881 F.\xc2\xa02d 707, 710\xe2\x80\x93711 (CA9 1989).
