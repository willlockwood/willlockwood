JUSTICE SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The mortgage clause in the contract of lease of the 15th of January, 1867, executed by Sillers and Graham, could not operate as a mortgage, because the crops to which it relates were not then in existence.  When the crops grew, the lien attached and bound them effectually from that time.</p>\n<p>It is admitted that the cotton in question was one of those crops.</p>\n<p>Ellett, having bought the premises, became clothed with all the rights of Sillers touching the rent stipulated to be paid by Graham.  The sheriff\'s deed conveyed the reversion, and the rent followed it as an incident.  The lease passed by assignment to the grantee, and all its provisions in favor of the lessor enured to the benefit of the assignee.  The appellants had full notice of the rights of Sillers.  They read the lease a few days after its execution.  Ellett also notified them of his rights and claim.  The cotton went impressed with his lien into their hands.  When they sold it, they took the proceeds in trust for his benefit, and became liable to him for the amount.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
