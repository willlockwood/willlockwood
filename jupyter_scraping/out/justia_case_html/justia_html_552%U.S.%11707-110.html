See <em>State</em> v. <em>Hoffman</em>, 123 Idaho 638, 851 P.\xc2\xa02d 934 (1993).  Hoffman sought federal habeas relief on the grounds that, <em>inter</em> <em>alia</em>, his counsel had been ineffective during both pretrial plea bargaining and the sentencing phase of his trial.  The District Court, finding that Hoffman had received ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing but not during plea bargaining, granted Hoffman\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition in part and ordered the State of Idaho to resentence him.  Civ. Action No. 94\xe2\x80\x930200\xe2\x80\x93S\xe2\x80\x93BLW (Mar. 30, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 65.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision regarding ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing,*<footcall num="*"> but reversed with respect to the ineffective assistance claim during plea negotiations.  455 F.\xc2\xa03d 926, 942 (2006).  The Ninth Circuit thus granted the writ, ordering the District Court to direct the State either to release Hoffman or to \xe2\x80\x9coffe[r] [him] a plea agreement with the \xe2\x80\x98same material terms\xe2\x80\x99 offered in the original plea agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 943.  The State sought, and we granted, certiorari.  552 U. S. ___ (2007).</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hoffman now abandons his claim that counsel was ineffective during plea bargaining.  See Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Motion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss the Cause as Moot.  He \xe2\x80\x9cno longer seeks or desires the relief ordered by the Court of Appeals with respect to the plea offer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 3.  Rather, Hoffman now \xe2\x80\x9cwishes to withdraw his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with plea bargaining\xe2\x80\x9d and asks this Court to dismiss his appeal with prejudice on that issue so that he may proceed with the resentencing ordered by the District Court.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State, in its response, notes that Hoffman\xe2\x80\x99s requested relief is \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually identical to the request made by the state in its Petition for Certiorari.\xe2\x80\x9d  Response to Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Motion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss the Cause as Moot, p. 3.  The State therefore agrees that the instant motion to vacate and dismiss with prejudice moots Hoffman\xe2\x80\x99s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations and asks that the motion be granted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We grant respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  Because his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel during pretrial plea bargaining is moot, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals to the extent that it addressed that claim.  The case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with directions that it instruct the United States District Court for the District of Idaho to dismiss the relevant claim with prejudice.  <em>Deakins</em> v. <em>Monaghan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/193/index.html">484 U.
