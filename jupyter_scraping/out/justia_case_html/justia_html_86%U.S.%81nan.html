The court overruled the plea, determined that the case was made out, and rendered a judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of the three bills, with interest and costs. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The defendant now brought the case here for review.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff is an assignee of the bills within the meaning of the eleventh section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, and by the express provisions of the section is not entitled to maintain his action in the circuit court unless a suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover the contents of the bills if no assignment had been made.  But the petition does not show that the endorsers through whom the plaintiff claims were not citizens of Louisiana at the time the suit was brought.  It is true, the citizenship of the defendant is averred to have been in Louisiana, and that of the plaintiff in Kentucky, but there is no averment of the citizenship of the payees of the bills, or of the citizenship of the subsequent endorsers.  For aught that appears in the record, they may also be citizens of Louisiana, and therefore incapable of suing in the circuit court for that district to recover the contents of the bills.  As that court has only a limited jurisdiction, it must appear affirmatively that it may take cognizance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 86 U. S. 83</a></p><p> of the controversy between the parties. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In <em>Turner v. Bank of North America,</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] it was distinctly ruled that when an action upon a promissory note is brought in a federal court by an endorser against the maker, not only the parties to the suit, but also the citizenship of the payee, and the endorser, must be averred in the record to be such as to give the court jurisdiction.  The same rule was asserted in <em>Montalet v. Murray,</em> [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] in <em>Mollan v. Torrance,</em> [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and in <em>Gibson v. Chew.</em> [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The judgment must, therefore, be reversed, and the cause sent back that amendment may be made in the pleadings showing the citizenship of the endorser of the bills, if it be such as to give the court jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p>We may notice another error which will doubtless be avoided should there be a second trial.  Issues of fact appear to have been made up which were determined by the court in the absence of the defendant\'s counsel, and without any written agreement to waive a jury trial.  This was irregular.  In the absence of such an agreement and of the defendant\'s counsel, it was not competent for the court to try the issue without the intervention of a jury. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The act referred to enacts:</p>\n<p>"Issues of fact in civil cases, in any circuit court . . . may be tried and determined by the court without the intervention of a jury whenever the parties or attorneys of record file a stipulation in writing with the clerk of the court waiving a jury."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/4/7/case.html">Turner v.
