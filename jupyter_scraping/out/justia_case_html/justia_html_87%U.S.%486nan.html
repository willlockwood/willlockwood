The court must be satisfied that the delivery cannot be made before it can adjudge absolutely the payment of money.  But if so satisfied, it may so adjudge.  A special finding to that effect is not necessary.  An absolute judgment for the money is equivalent to such a finding.</p>\n<p>In one part of this record, it appears that the verdict was for the return of the property or, in case that could not be made, for $3,000, the value, and $800 damages for the detention.  The judgment was for the money, and the presumption </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 87 U. S. 488</a></p><p> is, in the absence of anything in the record to the contrary, that before it was rendered, the court had become judicially satisfied that the property could not be returned.  In a court of error, every presumption is in favor of the validity of the judgment brought under consideration.  Error must appear affirmatively before there can be a reversal.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
