When an officer responding to the call asked eyewitness Nubia Blandon to describe the man, Blandon pointed to her kitchen window and said the man she saw breaking into the car was standing in the parking lot, next to a police officer.  Petitioner Barion Perry\xe2\x80\x99s arrest followed this identification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore trial, Perry moved to suppress Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s identification on the ground that admitting it at trial would violate due process.  The New Hampshire trial court denied the motion.  To determine whether due process prohibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification at trial, the Superior Court said, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions instruct a two-step inquiry: The trial court must first decide whether the police used an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure; if they did, the court must next consider whether that procedure so tainted the resulting identification as to render it unreliable and thus inadmissible.  Perry\xe2\x80\x99s challenge, the court found, failed at step one, for Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s identification did not result from an unnecessarily suggestive procedure employed by the police.  A jury subsequently convicted Perry of theft by unauthorized taking.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn appeal, Perry argued that the trial court erred in requiring an initial showing that police arranged a suggestive identification procedure.  Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry contended, suffice to require court evaluation of the reliability of an eyewitness identification before allowing it to be presented to the jury.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Perry\xe2\x80\x99s argument and affirmed his conviction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial inquiry into the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the identification was not procured under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances arranged by law enforcement.

Only when evidence \xe2\x80\x9cis so extremely unfair that its admission violates fundamental conceptions of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d  Dowling v. United States, \n\n493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 342\n (internal quotation marks omitted), does the Due Process Clause preclude its admission.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContending that the Due Process Clause is implicated here, Perry relies on a series of decisions involving police-arranged identification procedures.  See Stovall v. Denno, \n\n388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 293\n; Simmons v. United States, \n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377\n; Foster v. California, \n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440\n; Neil v. Biggers, \n\n409 U.\xc2\xa0S. 188\n; and Manson v. Brathwaite, \n\n432 U.\xc2\xa0S. 98\n.  These cases detail the approach appropriately used to determine whether due process requires suppression of an eyewitness identification tainted by police arrangement.  First, due process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary.  Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 198.  Even when the police use such a procedure, however, suppression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable consequence.  Brathwaite, 432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 112\xe2\x80\x93113; Biggers, 409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 198\xe2\x80\x93199.  Instead, due process requires courts to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether improper police conduct created a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial likelihood of misidentification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 201.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]eliability [of the eyewitness identification] is the linchpin\xe2\x80\x9d of that evaluation.  Brathwaite, 432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114.  Where the \xe2\x80\x9cindicators of [a witness\xe2\x80\x99] ability to make an accurate identification\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9coutweighed by the corrupting effect\xe2\x80\x9d of law enforcement suggestion, the identification should be suppressed.  Id., at 114, 116.  Otherwise, the identification, assuming no other barrier to its admission, should be submitted to the jury.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Perry argues that it was mere happenstance that all of the cases in the Stovall line involved improper police action.  The rationale underlying this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, Perry asserts, calls for a rule requiring trial judges to prescreen eyewitness evidence for reliability any time an identification is made under suggestive circumstances.  This Court disagrees.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf \xe2\x80\x9creliability is the linchpin\xe2\x80\x9d of admissibility under the Due Process Clause, Brathwaite, 432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114, Perry contends, it should not matter whether law enforcement was responsible for creating the suggestive circumstances that marred the identification.  This argument removes Brathwaite\xe2\x80\x99s statement from its mooring, attributing to it a meaning that a fair reading of the opinion does not bear.  The due process check for reliability, Brathwaite made plain, comes into play only after the defendant establishes improper police conduct.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerry\xe2\x80\x99s contention also ignores a key premise of Brathwaite: A primary aim of excluding identification evidence obtained under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances is to deter law enforcement use of improper procedures in the first place.  This deterrence rationale is inapposite in cases, like Perry\xe2\x80\x99s, where there is no improper police conduct.  Perry also places significant weight on United States v. Wade, \n\n388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n, describing it as a decision not anchored to improper police conduct.  But the risk of police rigging was the very danger that prompted the Court in Wade to extend a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerry\xe2\x80\x99s position would also open the door to judicial preview, under the banner of due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifications.  There is no reason why an identification made by an eyewitness with poor vision or one who harbors a grudge against the defendant, for example, should be regarded as inherently more reliable than Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s identification here.  Even if this Court could, as Perry contends, distinguish \xe2\x80\x9csuggestive circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d from other factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perry\xe2\x80\x99s limitation would still involve trial courts, routinely, in preliminary examinations, for most eyewitness identifications involve some element of suggestion.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0In urging a broadly applicable rule, Perry maintains that eyewitness identifications are uniquely unreliable.  The fallibility of eyewitness evidence does not, without the taint of improper state conduct, warrant a due process rule requiring a trial court to screen the evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess its creditworthiness.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to adopt such a rule rests, in large part, on its recognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally determines the reliability of evidence.  It also takes account of other safeguards built into the adversary system that caution juries against placing undue weight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability.  These protections include the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment rights to counsel and to confront and cross-examine the eyewitness, eyewitness-specific instructions warning juries to take care in appraising identification evidence, and state and federal rules of evidence permitting  trial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact or potential for misleading the jury.  Many of these safeguards were availed of by Perry\xe2\x80\x99s defense.  Given the safeguards generally applicable in criminal trials, the introduction of Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s eyewitness testimony, without a preliminary judicial assessment of its reliability, did not render Perry\xe2\x80\x99s trial fundamentally unfair.

Those safeguards apart, admission of evidence in state trials is ordinarily governed by state law, and the reliability of relevant testimony typically falls within the province of the jury to determine.  This Court has recognized, in addition, a due process check on the admission of eyewitness identification, applicable when the police have arranged suggestive circumstances leading the witness to identify a particular person as the perpetrator of a crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn identification infected by improper police influence, our case law holds, is not automatically excluded.  Instead, the trial judge must screen the evidence for reliability pretrial.  If there is \xe2\x80\x9ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\xe2\x80\x9d Simmons v. United States, \n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377, \n384 (1968)\n, the judge must disallow presentation of the evidence at trial.  But if the indicia of reliability are strong enough to outweigh the corrupting effect of the police-arranged suggestive circumstances, the identification evidence ordinarily will be admitted, and the jury will ultimately determine its worth.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have not extended pretrial screening for reliability to cases in which the suggestive circumstances were not arranged by law enforcement officers.  Petitioner requests that we do so because of the grave risk that mistaken identification will yield a miscarriage of justice.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Our decisions, however, turn on the presence of state action and aim to deter police from rigging identification procedures, for example, at a lineup, showup, or photograph array.  When no improper law enforcement activity is involved, we hold, it suffices to test reliability through the rights and opportunities generally designed for that purpose, notably, the presence of counsel at postindictment lineups, vigorous cross-examination, protective rules of evi- dence, and jury instructions on both the fallibility of eyewitness identification and the requirement that guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAround 3 a.m. on August 15, 2008, Joffre Ullon called the Nashua, New Hampshire, Police Department and reported that an African-American male was trying to break into cars parked in the lot of Ullon\xe2\x80\x99s apartment building.  Officer Nicole Clay responded to the call.  Upon arriving at the parking lot, Clay heard what \xe2\x80\x9csounded like a metal bat hitting the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 37a\xe2\x80\x9338a.  She then saw petitioner Barion Perry standing between two cars.  Perry walked toward Clay, holding two car-stereo amplifiers in his hands.  A metal bat lay on the ground behind him.  Clay asked Perry where the amplifiers came from.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I] found them on the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry responded.

Clavijo immediately went downstairs to the parking lot to inspect the car.  He first observed that one of the rear windows had been shattered.  On further inspection, he discovered that the speakers and amplifiers from his car stereo were missing, as were his bat and wrench.  Clavijo then approached Clay and told her about Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s alert and his own subsequent observations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy this time, another officer had arrived at the scene. Clay asked Perry to stay in the parking lot with that officer, while she and Clavijo went to talk to Blandon.  Clay and Clavijo then entered the apartment building and took the stairs to the fourth floor, where Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s and Clavijo\xe2\x80\x99s apartments were located.  They met Blandon in the hallway just outside the open door to her apartment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAsked to describe what she had seen, Blandon stated that, around 2:30 a.m., she saw from her kitchen window a tall, African-American man roaming the parking lot and looking into cars.  Eventually, the man circled Clavijo\xe2\x80\x99s car, opened the trunk, and removed a large box.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tClay asked Blandon for a more specific description of the man.

Apart from these guarantees, we have recognized, state and federal statutes and rules ordinarily govern the admissibility of evidence, and juries are assigned the task of determining the reliability of the evidence presented at trial.

In Stovall v. Denno, \n\n388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 293 (1967)\n, first of those decisions, a witness identified the defendant as her assailant after police officers brought the defendant to the witness\xe2\x80\x99 hospital room.

Although the police-arranged showup was undeniably suggestive, the Court held that no due process violation occurred.  Id., at 302.  Crucial to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was the procedure\xe2\x80\x99s necessity: The witness was the only person who could identify or exonerate the defendant; the witness could not leave her hospital room; and it was uncertain whether she would live to identify the defendant in more neutral circumstances.

When a witness identifies the defendant in a police-organized photo lineup, the Court ruled, the identification should be suppressed only where \xe2\x80\x9cthe photographic identification procedure was so [unnecessarily] suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 384\xe2\x80\x93385.

California, \n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440 (1969)\n, that due process required the exclusion of an eyewitness identification obtained through police-arranged procedures that \xe2\x80\x9cmade it all but inevitable that [the witness] would identify [the defendant].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 443.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSynthesizing previous decisions, we set forth in Neil v.

Notwithstanding the improper procedure, the victim\xe2\x80\x99s identification was reliable: She saw her assailant for a considerable period of time under adequate light, provided police with a detailed de- scription of her attacker long before the showup, and had \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt\xe2\x80\x9d that the defendant was the person she had seen.  Id., at 200 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Similarly, the Court concluded in Brathwaite that police use of an unnecessarily suggestive photo array did not require exclusion of the resulting identification.  432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114\xe2\x80\x93117.  The witness, an undercover police officer, viewed the defendant in good light for several minutes, provided a thorough description of the suspect, and was certain of his identification.  Id., at 115.  Hence, the \xe2\x80\x9cindicators of [the witness\xe2\x80\x99] ability to make an accurate identification [were] hardly outweighed by the corrupting effect of the challenged identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 116.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerry concedes that, in contrast to every case in the Stovall line, law enforcement officials did not arrange the suggestive circumstances surrounding Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s identification.  See Brief for Petitioner 34; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (counsel for Perry) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e do not allege any manipulation or intentional orchestration by the police.\xe2\x80\x9d).  He contends, however, that it was mere happenstance that each of the Stovall cases involved improper police action.

As just explained, supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, the Brathwaite Court\xe2\x80\x99s reference to reliability appears in a portion of the opinion concerning the appropriate remedy when the police use an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure.  The Court adopted a judicial screen for reliability as a course preferable to a per\xc2\xa0se rule requiring exclusion of identification evidence whenever law enforcement officers employ an improper procedure.  The due process check for reliability, Brathwaite made plain, comes into play only after the defendant establishes improper police conduct.  The very purpose of the check, the Court noted, was to avoid depriving the jury of identification evidence that is reliable, notwithstanding improper police conduct.  432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 112\xe2\x80\x93113.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerry\xe2\x80\x99s contention that improper police action was not essential to the reliability check Brathwaite required is echoed by the dissent.  Post, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Both ignore a key premise of the Brathwaite decision: A primary aim of ex- cluding identification evidence obtained under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances, the Court said, is to deter law enforcement use of improper lineups, showups, and photo arrays in the first place.  See 432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 112.  Alerted to the prospect that identification evidence improperly obtained may be excluded, the Court reasoned, police officers will \xe2\x80\x9cguard against unnecessarily suggestive procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  This deterrence rationale is inapposite in cases, like Perry\xe2\x80\x99s, in which the police engaged in no improper conduct.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tColeman v. Alabama, \n\n399 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1970)\n, another decision in the Stovall line, similarly shows that the Court has linked the due process check, not to suspicion of eyewitness testimony generally, but only to improper police arrangement of the circumstances surrounding an identification.  The defendants in Coleman contended that a witness\xe2\x80\x99 in-court identifications violated due process, because a pretrial stationhouse lineup was \xe2\x80\x9cso unduly prejudicial and conducive to irreparable misidentification as fatally to taint [the later identifications].\xe2\x80\x9d  399 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 3 (plurality opinion).

J., dissenting), 28, n.\xc2\xa02 (Stewart, J., dissenting).  No due process violation occurred, the plurality explained, because nothing \xe2\x80\x9cthe police said or did prompted [the witness\xe2\x80\x99] virtually spontaneous identification of [the defendants].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 6.

See Brief for Petitioner 12, 15, 21\xe2\x80\x9322, 28; post, at 2\xe2\x80\x934, 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  In fact, the risk of police rigging was the very danger to which the Court responded in Wade when it recognized a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel at postindictment, police-organized identification procedures. 388 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 233, 235\xe2\x80\x93236.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he confrontation compelled by the State between the accused and the victim or witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court began, \xe2\x80\x9cis peculiarly riddled with innumerable dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even crucially, derogate from a fair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 228 (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cA major factor contributing to the high incidence of miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court continued, \xe2\x80\x9chas been the degree of suggestion inherent in the manner in which the prosecution presents the suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  (emphasis added).  To illustrate the improper suggestion it was concerned about, the Court pointed to police-designed lineups where \xe2\x80\x9call in the lineup but the suspect were known to the identifying witness, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the other participants in [the] lineup were grossly dissimilar in appearance to the suspect, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. only the suspect was required to wear distinctive clothing which the culprit allegedly wore, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the witness is told by the police that they have caught the culprit after which the defendant is brought before the witness alone or is viewed in jail, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the suspect is pointed out before or during a lineup, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the participants in the lineup are asked to try on an article of clothing which fits only the suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 233 (footnotes omitted).  Beyond genuine debate, then, prevention of unfair police practices prompted the Court to extend a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups.

Moreover, his position would open the door to judicial preview, under the banner of due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifications.  External suggestion is hardly the only factor that casts doubt on the trustworthiness of an eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99 testimony.  As one of Perry\xe2\x80\x99s amici points out, many other factors bear on \xe2\x80\x9cthe likelihood of misidentification,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 9\xe2\x80\x94for example, the passage of time between exposure to and identification of the defendant, whether the witness was under stress when he first encountered the suspect, how much time the witness had to observe the suspect, how far the witness was from the suspect, whether the suspect carried a weapon, and the race of the suspect and the witness.  Brief for American Psychological Association as Amicus Curiae 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  There is no reason why an iden- tification made by an eyewitness with poor vision, for ex- ample, or one who harbors a grudge against the defendant, should be regarded as inherently more reliable, less of a \xe2\x80\x9cthreat to the fairness of trial,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 14, than the identification Blandon made in this case.  To embrace Perry\xe2\x80\x99s view would thus entail a vast enlargement of the reach of due process as a constraint on the admission of evidence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerry maintains that the Court can limit the due process check he proposes to identifications made under \xe2\x80\x9csuggestive circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 11\xe2\x80\x9314.  Even if we could rationally distinguish suggestiveness from other factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perry\xe2\x80\x99s limitation would still involve trial courts, routinely, in preliminary examinations.  Most eyewitness identifications involve some element of suggestion.  Indeed, all in-court identifications do.  Out-of-court identifications volunteered by witnesses are also likely to involve suggestive circumstances.  For example, suppose a witness identifies the defendant to police officers after seeing a photograph of the defendant in the press captioned \xe2\x80\x9ctheft suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d or hearing a radio report implicating the defendant in the crime.  Or suppose the witness knew that the defendant ran with the wrong crowd and saw him on the day and in the vicinity of the crime.  Any of these circumstances might have \xe2\x80\x9csuggested\xe2\x80\x9d to the witness that the defendant was the person the witness observed committing the crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn urging a broadly applicable due process check on eyewitness identifications, Perry maintains that eyewitness identifications are a uniquely unreliable form of evidence.

See also post, at 14\xe2\x80\x9317.  We do not doubt either the importance or the fallibility of eyewitness identifications.  Indeed, in recognizing that defendants have a constitutional right to counsel at postindictment police lineups, we observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wade, 388 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have concluded in other contexts, however, that the potential unreliability of a type of evidence does not alone render its introduction at the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s trial fundamentally unfair.  See, e.g., Ventris, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 594, n.

We reach a similar conclusion here: The fallibility of eyewitness evidence does not, without the taint of improper state conduct, warrant a due process rule requiring a trial court to screen such evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess its creditworthiness.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur unwillingness to enlarge the domain of due process as Perry and the dissent urge rests, in large part, on our recognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally de- termines the reliability of evidence.  See supra, at 7.  We also take account of other safeguards built into our adversary system that caution juries against placing undue weight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability.  These protections include the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment right to confront the eyewitness.  See Maryland v. Craig, \n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 836, \n845 (1990)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe central concern of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Another is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to the effective assistance of an attorney, who can expose the flaws in the eyewitness\xe2\x80\x99 testimony during cross-examination and focus the jury\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the fallibility of such testimony during opening and closing arguments.  Eyewitness-specific jury instructions, which many federal and state courts have adopted,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t likewise warn the jury to take care in appraising identification evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Telfaire, 469 F.\xc2\xa02d 552, 558\xe2\x80\x93559 (CADC 1972) (per\xc2\xa0curiam) (D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit Model Jury Instructions) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the identification by the witness may have been influenced by the circumstances under which the defendant was presented to him for identification, you should scrutinize the identification with great care.\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also Ventris, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 594, n. (citing jury instructions that informed jurors about the unreliability of uncorroborated jailhouse-informant testimony as a reason to resist a ban on such testimony); Dowling, 493 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 352\xe2\x80\x93353.  The constitutional requirement that the government prove the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt also impedes convictions based on dubious identification evidence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tState and federal rules of evidence, moreover, permit trial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact or potential for misleading the jury.  See, e.g., Fed. Rule Evid. 403; N.\xc2\xa0H. Rule Evid. 403 (2011).  See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 19\xe2\x80\x9322 (inquiring whether the standard Perry seeks differs materially from the one set out in Rule 403).  In appropriate cases, some States also permit defendants to present expert testimony on the hazards of eyewitness identification evidence.  See, e.g., State v. Clopten, 2009 UT 84, A33, 223 P.\xc2\xa03d 1103, 1113 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe expect .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that in cases involving eyewitness identification of strangers or near-strangers, trial courts will routinely admit expert testimony [on the dangers of such evidence].\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMany of the safeguards just noted were at work at Perry\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  During her opening statement, Perry\xe2\x80\x99s court-appointed attorney cautioned the jury about the vulnerability of Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s identification.  App. 115a (Blandon, \xe2\x80\x9cthe eyewitness that the State needs you to believe[,] can\xe2\x80\x99t pick [Perry] out of a photo array.  How carefully did she really see what was going on? .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. How well could she really see him?\xe2\x80\x9d).  While cross-examining Blandon and Officer Clay, Perry\xe2\x80\x99s attorney constantly brought up the weaknesses of Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s identification.  She highlighted: (1) the significant distance between Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s window and the parking lot, id., at 226a; (2) the lateness of the hour, id., at 225a; (3) the van that partly obstructed Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s view, id., at 226a; (4) Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s concession that she was \xe2\x80\x9cso scared [she] really didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention\xe2\x80\x9d to what Perry was wearing, id., at 233a; (5) Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s inability to describe Perry\xe2\x80\x99s facial features or other identifying marks, id., at 205a, 233a\xe2\x80\x93235a; (6) Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pick Perry out of a photo array, id., at 235a; and (7) Perry\xe2\x80\x99s position next to a uniformed, gun-bearing police officer at the moment Blandon made her identification, id., at 202a\xe2\x80\x93205a.  Perry\xe2\x80\x99s counsel reminded the jury of these frailties during her summation.  Id., at 374a\xe2\x80\x93375a (Blandon \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to tell you much about who she saw .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Id., at 399a\xe2\x80\x93401a.  The court also instructed the jury that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 390a, 392a, 395a\xe2\x80\x93396a, and specifically cautioned that \xe2\x80\x9cone of the things the State must prove [beyond a reasonable doubt] is the identification of the defendant as the person who committed the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 398a\xe2\x80\x93399a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven the safeguards generally applicable in criminal trials, protections availed of by the defense in Perry\xe2\x80\x99s case, we hold that the introduction of Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s eyewitness testimony, without a preliminary judicial assessment of its reliability, did not render Perry\xe2\x80\x99s trial fundamentally unfair.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the foregoing reasons, we agree with the New Hampshire courts\xe2\x80\x99 appraisal of our decisions.

Our cases thus establish a clear rule: The admission at trial of  out-of-court eyewitness identifications derived from imper-missibly suggestive circumstances that pose a very substan- tial likelihood of misidentification violates due process.  The Court today announces that that rule does not even \xe2\x80\x9ccom[e] into play\xe2\x80\x9d unless the suggestive circumstances are improperly \xe2\x80\x9cpolice-arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2, 11.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur due process concern, however, arises not from the act of suggestion, but rather from the corrosive effects of suggestion on the reliability of the resulting identification.  By rendering protection contingent on improper police arrangement of the suggestive circumstances, the Court effectively grafts a mens rea inquiry onto our rule.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding enshrines a murky distinction\xe2\x80\x94between suggestive confrontations intentionally orchestrated by the police and, as here, those inadvertently caused by police actions\xe2\x80\x94that will sow confusion.  It ignores our precedents\xe2\x80\x99 acute sensitivity to the hazards of intentional and unintentional suggestion alike and unmoors our rule from the very interest it protects, inviting arbitrary results.  And it recasts the driving force of our decisions as an interest in police deterrence, rather than reliability.

Brathwaite, 432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114.  Eyewitness evidence derived from suggestive circumstances, we have explained, is uniquely resistant to the ordinary tests of the adversary process.  An eyewitness who has made an identification often becomes convinced of its accuracy.  \xe2\x80\x9cRegardless of how the initial misidentification comes about, the witness thereafter is apt to retain in his memory the image of the photograph rather than of the person actually seen, reducing the trustworthiness of subsequent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. courtroom identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Simmons v.

Second, if the defendant meets that burden, courts consider whether the identification was reliable under the totality of the circumstances.  That step entails considering the witness\xe2\x80\x99 opportunity to view the perpetrator, degree of attention, accuracy of description, level of certainty, and the time between the crime and pretrial confrontation, then weighing such factors against the \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupting effect of the suggestive identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brathwaite, 432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 108, 114.

Rather, the majority maintains that the suggestive circumstances giving rise  to the identification must be \xe2\x80\x9cpolice-arranged,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpolice rigg[ed],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpolice-designed,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpolice-organized.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2, 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Those terms connote a degree of intentional orchestration or manipulation.  See Brief for Respondent 19 (no indication that police \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately tried to manipulate any evidence\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18 (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o one deliberately arranged the circumstances to obtain an identification\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority cate-gorically exempts all eyewitness identifications derived from suggestive circumstances that were not police-manipulated\xe2\x80\x94however suggestive, and however unreliable\xe2\x80\x94from our due process check.  The majority thus  appears to graft a mens rea requirement onto our existing rule.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs this case illustrates, police intent is now paramount.  As the Court acknowledges, Perry alleges an \xe2\x80\x9caccidental showup.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 34 (emphasis added); see ante, at 4.  He was the only African-American at the scene of the crime standing next to a police officer.  For the majority, the fact that the police did not intend that showup, even if they inadvertently caused it in the course of a police procedure, ends the inquiry.  The police were questioning the eyewitness, Blandon, about the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s identity, and were intentionally detaining Perry in the parking lot\xe2\x80\x94but had not intended for Blandon to identify the perpetrator from her window.  Presumably, in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, had the police asked Blandon to move to the window to identify the perpetrator, that could have made all the difference.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI note, however, that the majority leaves what is required by its arrangement-focused inquiry less than clear.  In parts, the opinion suggests that the police must arrange an identification \xe2\x80\x9cprocedure,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of whether they \xe2\x80\x9cinten[d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01; see also ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Elsewhere, it indicates that the police must arrange the \xe2\x80\x9csuggestive circum-stances\xe2\x80\x9d that lead the witness to identify the accused.  See ante, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Still elsewhere it refers to \xe2\x80\x9cim-proper\xe2\x80\x9d police conduct, ante, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 9\xe2\x80\x9312, connoting bad faith.  Does police \xe2\x80\x9carrangement\xe2\x80\x9d relate to the procedure, the suggestiveness, or both?  If it relates to the procedure, do suggestive preprocedure encounters no longer raise the same concerns?  If the police need not \xe2\x80\x9cinten[d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01, what makes the police action \xe2\x80\x9cimproper\xe2\x80\x9d?  And does that mean that good-faith, unintentional police suggestiveness in a police-arranged lineup can be \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissibly sugges- tive\xe2\x80\x9d?  If no, the majority runs headlong into Wade.  If  yes, on what basis\xe2\x80\x94if not deterrence\xe2\x80\x94does it distinguish unintentional police suggestiveness in an accidental  confrontation?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe arrangement-focused inquiry will sow needless con-fusion.  If the police had called Perry and Blandon to  the police station for interviews, and Blandon saw Perry being questioned, would that be sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cimproper police arrangement\xe2\x80\x9d?  If Perry had voluntarily come to the police station, would that change the result?  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion renders the applicability of our ordinary inquiry contingent on a murky line-drawing exercise.  Whereas our two-step inquiry focuses on overall reliability\xe2\x80\x94and could account for the spontaneity of the witness\xe2\x80\x99 identification and degree of police manipulation under the total-ity of the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion forecloses that assessment by establishing a new and inflexible step zero.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority regards its limitation on our two-step rule as compelled by precedent.  Its chief rationale, ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x9313, is that none of our prior cases involved situations where the police \xe2\x80\x9cdid not arrange the suggestive circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10; see also ante, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01.  That is not necessarily true, given the seemingly unintentional encounter highlighted in Wade.  But even if it were true, it is unsurprising.  The vast majority of eyewitness identifications that the State uses in criminal prosecutions are obtained in lineup, showup, and photograph displays arranged by the police.  Our precedents reflect that practical reality.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is also beside the point.  Our due process concerns were not predicated on the source of suggestiveness.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the likelihood of misidentification which violates a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to due process,\xe2\x80\x9d Biggers, 409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 198, and we are concerned with suggestion in-sofar as it has \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupting effect[s]\xe2\x80\x9d on the identification\xe2\x80\x99s reliability.  Brathwaite, 432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114.  Accordingly, whether the police have created the suggestive circumstances intentionally or inadvertently, the resulting identification raises the same due process concerns.  It is no more or less likely to misidentify the perpetrator.  It is  no more or less powerful to the jury.  And the defendant  is no more or less equipped to challenge the identifica- tion through cross-examination or prejudiced at trial.  The arrangement-focused inquiry thus untethers our doctrine from the very \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98evidentiary interest\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d it was designed to protect, inviting arbitrary results.

Whereas we previously disclaimed the crabbed view of suggestiveness as \xe2\x80\x9cthe result of po- lice procedures intentionally designed to prejudice an ac-cused,\xe2\x80\x9d Wade, 388 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 235, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s focus on police rigging and improper conduct will revive it.  Whereas our precedents were sensitive to intentional and unintentional suggestiveness alike, see supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision narrows our concern to intentionally orchestrated suggestive confrontations.  We once described the \xe2\x80\x9cpri-mary evil to be avoided\xe2\x80\x9d as the likelihood of misidentification.  Biggers, 409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 198.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, however, means that even if that primary evil is at its apex, we need not avoid it at all so long as the suggestive circumstances do not stem from improper police arrangement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority gives several additional reasons for why applying our due process rule beyond improperly police-arranged circumstances is unwarranted.  In my view, none withstands close inspection.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the majority insists that our precedents \xe2\x80\x9caim to deter police from rigging identification procedures,\xe2\x80\x9d so our rule should be limited to applications that advance that \xe2\x80\x9cprimary aim\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ckey premise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2, 11 (citing Brathwaite, 432  U.\xc2\xa0S., at 112).  That mischaracterizes our cases.  We discussed deterrence in Brathwaite because Brathwaite challenged our two-step inquiry as lacking deterrence value.  Brathwaite argued that deterrence de-manded a per\xc2\xa0se rule excluding all suggestive identifications.  He said that our rule, which probes the reliability of suggestive identifications under the totality of the circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be expected to have a significant deterrent impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 111.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe rebutted Brathwaite\xe2\x80\x99s criticism in language the majority now wrenches from context: Upon summarizing Brathwaite\xe2\x80\x99s argument, we acknowledged \xe2\x80\x9cseveral interests to be considered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We then compared the two rules under each interest: First, we noted the \xe2\x80\x9cdriving force\xe2\x80\x9d behind Wade and its companion cases\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe concern that the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless that evidence has aspects of reliability\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and found both approaches \xe2\x80\x9cresponsive to this concern,\xe2\x80\x9d but the per\xc2\xa0se rule  to go \xe2\x80\x9ctoo far\xe2\x80\x9d in suppressing reliable evidence.  432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 111\xe2\x80\x93112.

We simply underscored, in responding to Brathwaite,  that our rule was not without deterrence benefits.  To  the contrary, we clarified that deterrence was a subsidiary concern to reliability, the \xe2\x80\x9cdriving force\xe2\x80\x9d of our doctrine.

Alabama, \n\n399 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1970)\n, held that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o due process violation occurred .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because nothing \xe2\x80\x98the police said or did prompted\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the identification and shows that our rule is linked \xe2\x80\x9conly to improper police arrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  That misreads the decision.  In Coleman, the petitioners challenged a witness\xe2\x80\x99 in-court identification of them at trial on grounds that it had been tainted by a suggestive pretrial lineup.  We held that no due process violation occurred because the in-court identification ap-peared to be \xe2\x80\x9centirely based upon observations at the  time of the assault and not at all induced by the conduct of the lineup,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus could not be said to stem from an identification procedure \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  399 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (plurality opinion).  We then dismissed each of the asserted suggestive influences as having had no bearing on the identification at all: The petitioners claimed that the police intimated to the witness that his attackers were in the lineup; we found the record \xe2\x80\x9cdevoid of evidence that anything the police said or did\xe2\x80\x9d induced the identification.  Id., at 6.  The petitioners claimed that they alone were made to say certain words; we found that the witness identified petitioners before either said anything.  One petitioner claimed he was singled out to wear a hat; we found that the witness\xe2\x80\x99 identification \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not appear .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. based on the fact that he remembered that [the attacker] had worn a hat.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Thus, far from indicating that improper police conduct is a prerequisite, Coleman merely held that there had been no influence on the witness.  In fact, in concluding that the lineup was not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman indicates that the two-step inquiry is not truncated at the threshold by the absence of police misconduct.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the majority emphasizes that we should rely on the jury to determine the reliability of evidence.  See ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But our cases are rooted in the assumption that eyewitness identifications upend the ordinary expectation that it is \xe2\x80\x9cthe province of the jury to weigh the credibility of competing witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kansas v. Ventris, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 586\n, n. (2009).  As noted, jurors find eyewitness evidence unusually powerful and their ability to assess credibility  is hindered by a witness\xe2\x80\x99 false confidence in the accuracy of his or her identification.  That disability in no way de-pends on the intent behind the suggestive circumstances.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority\xe2\x80\x99s appeals to protecting the jury\xe2\x80\x99s domain, moreover, appeared in dissent after dissent from our de-cisions.  See Foster v. California, \n\n394 U. S. 440, \n447  (1969)\n (Black, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he jury is the sole tribunal to weigh and determine facts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmust . . . be allowed to hear eyewitnesses and decide for itself whether it can recognize the truth\xe2\x80\x9d); Simmons, 390 U. S., at 395 (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe weight of the evidence . . . is not a question for the Court but for the jury\xe2\x80\x9d).  So too does the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that other constitutional protections like the \n \nSixth Amendment rights to compulsory process and confrontation can suffice to expose unreliable identifications.  Compare ante, at 6, with Foster, 394 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 448\xe2\x80\x93449 (Black, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution sets up its own standards of unfairness in criminal trials,\xe2\x80\x9d including the \n \nSixth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cright to compulsory process\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cright to confront .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d).  So too does the majority\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to leave reliability to the rules of evidence.  Compare ante, at 17, with Foster, 394 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 448 (Black, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Rules of evidence are designed in the interests of fair trials\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d), and Stovall, 388 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 306 (Black, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he result .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is to put into a constitutional mould a rule of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).  Those arguments did not prevail then; they should not prevail here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, the majority suggests that applying our rule beyond police-arranged suggestive circumstances would entail a heavy practical burden, requiring courts to engage in \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary judicial inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d into \xe2\x80\x9cmost, if not all, eyewitness identifications.\xe2\x80\x9d   Ante, at 13, 18.  But that is inaccurate.  The burden of showing \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissibly suggestive\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s, so the objection falls to the defendant to raise.  And as is implicit in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reassurance that Perry may resort to the rules of evidence in lieu of our due process precedents, trial courts will be entertaining defendants\xe2\x80\x99 objections, pretrial or at trial, to unreliable eyewitness evidence in any event.  The relevant question, then, is what the standard of admissibility governing such objections should be.  I see no reason to water down the standard for an equally suggestive and unreliable identification simply because the suggestive confrontation was unplanned.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt bears reminding, moreover, that we set a high bar for suppression.  The vast majority of eyewitnesses proceed to testify before a jury.  To date, Foster is the only case in which we have found a due process violation.  394 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 443.  There has been no flood of claims in the four Federal Circuits that, having seen no basis for an arrangement-based distinction in our precedents, have long indicated that due process scrutiny applies to all suggestive identification procedures.  See Dunnigan v. Keane, 137 F. 3d 117, 128 (CA2 1998); United States v. Bouthot, 878 F. 2d 1506, 1516 (CA1 1989); Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6 1986); see also Green v. Loggins, 614 F. 2d 219, 223 (CA9 1980).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision nonetheless precludes even the possibility that an unintended confrontation will meet that bar, mandating summary dismissal of every such claim at the threshold.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the majority questions how to \xe2\x80\x9crationally distinguish suggestiveness from other factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9cpoor vision\xe2\x80\x9d or a prior \xe2\x80\x9cgrudge,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, and more broadly, how to distinguish eyewitness evidence from other kinds of arguably unreliable evidence.  Ante, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  Our precedents, however, did just that.  We emphasized the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98formidable number of instances in the records of English and Amer-ican trials\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wade, 388 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228.  We then observed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the influence of improper suggestion upon identifying witnesses probably accounts for more miscarriages of justice than any other single factor.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 229.  More-over, the majority points to no other type of evidence that shares the rare confluence of characteristics that makes eyewitness evidence a unique threat to the fairness of trial.  Jailhouse informants, cf. ante, at 15, unreliable as they may be, are not similarly resistant to the traditional tools of the adversarial process and, if anything, are met with particular skepticism by juries.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt would be one thing if the passage of time had cast doubt on the empirical premises of our precedents.  But just the opposite has happened.  A vast body of scientific literature has reinforced every concern our precedents articulated nearly a half-century ago, though it merits barely a parenthetical mention in the majority opinion.  Ante, at 14.  Over the past three decades, more than two thousand studies related to eyewitness identification have been published.  One state supreme court recently appointed a special master to conduct an exhaustive survey of the current state of the scientific evidence and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he research .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not only extensive,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cit represents the \xe2\x80\x98gold standard in terms of the applicability of social science research to law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  State v. Henderson, 208 N.\xc2\xa0J. 208, 283, 27 A. 3d 872, 916 (2011).  \xe2\x80\x9cExperimental methods and findings have been tested and retested, subjected to scientific scrutiny through peer-reviewed journals, evaluated through the lens of meta-analyses, and replicated at times in real-world settings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see also Schmechel, O\xe2\x80\x99Toole, Easterly, &amp; Loftus, Beyond the Ken?

The trial court found that the circumstances surrounding Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s identification did not rise to an impermissibly suggestive level.  It is not at all clear, moreover, that there was a very substantial likelihood of misidentification, given Blandon\xe2\x80\x99s lack of equivocation on the scene, the short time between crime and confrontation, and the \xe2\x80\x9cfairly well lit\xe2\x80\x9d parking lot.

In my view, the ordinary two-step inquiry should apply, whether the police created the suggestive circumstances intentionally or inadvertently.
