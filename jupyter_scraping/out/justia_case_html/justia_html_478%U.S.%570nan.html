The court instructed the jury on both first-degree murder, which requires proof of premeditation and deliberation under Tennessee law, and second-degree murder, which requires proof of malice, but not of planning and premeditation.  The court then instructed the jury that "[a]ll homicides are presumed to be malicious in the absence of evidence which would rebut the implied presumption," and that, "if the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a killing has occurred, then it is presumed that the killing was done maliciously."  The jury found respondent guilty of first-degree murder of one victim and of second-degree murder of the other.  The Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting respondent\'s argument that the malice instruction impermissibly shifted the burden of proof as to malice.

[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>On December 30, 1978, Charles Browning and Joy Faulk were shot to death while they sat in Browning\'s pickup truck in a remote area of Rutherford County, Tennessee.  Respondent Stanley Clark, Faulk\'s former boyfriend, was charged with the murders.</p>\n<p>The evidence introduced at trial showed that Browning, Faulk, and Faulk\'s two young children (aged 6 and 3) had been driving in Rutherford County on the night of the murders.  According to the older child, another vehicle followed Browning\'s truck for about an hour.  Browning pulled his truck into a private driveway, apparently to let the other vehicle </p><p><a class="page-number" name="573">Page 478 U. S. 573</a></p><p> pass.  The driver of the second vehicle then pulled in behind Browning, thereby blocking any exit.  The driver left his vehicle, walked up to the cab of Browning\'s truck, and fired four shots at point-blank range.  One shot struck Browning in the head, two others struck Faulk in the head, and the fourth struck Faulk in the left shoulder.  The killer left the scene in his vehicle.  Both Browning and Faulk died</p>\n<p>Faulk\'s children, who had not been shot, went for help, telling a local resident that "Clicker" (the nickname by which the children knew respondent) had shot Browning and their mother.  Earlier that night, police had seen respondent following Browning\'s truck.  Police soon located respondent, but apprehended him only after a high-speed chase.  Police found the murder weapon, a .25-caliber pistol that respondent had borrowed from a friend, near respondent\'s home.  At trial, the State relied on the foregoing evidence and on evidence showing that respondent and Joy Faulk had a stormy love affair that Faulk ended in the fall of 1978.  Several times after their breakup, respondent threatened to kill Faulk if he ever found her with another man.</p>\n<p>Respondent offered two lines of defense.  First, he contended that Sam Faulk, Joy\'s ex-husband, killed the victims because of a dispute concerning custody of the two Faulk children.  The State rebutted this contention by introducing evidence that no such dispute existed, and that Sam Faulk was elsewhere when the murders were committed.  Second, respondent argued that he was either insane or incapable of forming the requisite criminal intent.  To support this argument, respondent introduced evidence that he was suffering from amnesia and could not remember the events of the night of the murders.  In addition, some testimony suggested that respondent had been drinking heavily the entire day before the murders.  Finally, two defense psychiatrists testified that respondent was legally insane at the time the murders were committed because his depression concerning his recent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="574">Page 478 U. S. 574</a></p><p> breakup with Joy Faulk made it impossible for him to conform his conduct to the law.</p>\n<p>At the close of trial, the court instructed the jury on the elements of both first- and second-degree murder.  Under Tennessee law, first-degree murder requires proof of premeditation and deliberation, while second-degree murder requires proof of malice.  The court\'s instructions defined malice as "an intent to do any injury to another, a design formed in the mind of doing mischief to another."  App. 186.  Malice did not require proof of planning or premeditation; a killing "upon a sudden impulse of passion" sufficed if committed with intent to harm another.  <em>Id.</em> at 187.  The court then charged the jury:</p>\n<p>"All homicides are presumed to be malicious in the absence of evidence which would rebut the implied presumption.  Thus, if the State has proven beyond a reasonable . . . doubt that a killing has occurred, then it is presumed that the killing was done maliciously.  But this presumption may be rebutted by either direct or circumstantial evidence, or by both, regardless of whether the same be offered by the Defendant, or exists in the evidence of the State."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The jury found respondent guilty of first-degree murder for killing Faulk, and of second-degree murder for killing Browning.</p>\n<p>The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the convictions, rejecting respondent\'s argument that the jury instructions had impermissibly shifted the burden of proof as to malice. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Respondent then sought habeas corpus relief in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="575">Page 478 U. S. 575</a></p><p> the Middle District of Tennessee.  The District Court held that the malice instruction had violated respondent\'s right to have his guilt proved beyond a reasonable doubt, as that right was defined in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana.</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The court went on to find that the error could not be deemed harmless, because respondent had "relied upon a <em>mens rea</em> defense" in contesting his guilt.  611 F.Supp. 294, 302 (1983).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The court agreed that the malice instruction was unconstitutional under <em>Sandstrom.</em>  Turning to the question whether the error was harmless, the court reasoned that, because respondent contested malice at his trial, an erroneous burden-shifting instruction could not be harmless under governing precedent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-5 (citing <em>Engle v. Koehler,</em> 707 F.2d 241, 246 (CA6 1983), <em>aff\'d by an equally divided Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/1/case.html">466 U. S. 1</a></span> (1984)).  The court reached this conclusion "despite the substantial evidence of petitioner\'s guilt," and added:</p>\n<p>"Were we writing on a clean slate, we would direct our inquiry to that suggested by Justice Powell (dissenting) in <em>Connecticut v. Johnson,</em> 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/460/73/case.html#97">460 U.

A-6.  The court nevertheless affirmed the order granting habeas corpus relief.  We granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Court of Appeals\' harmless error analysis was correct.

California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html">386 U.

Our application of harmless error analysis in these cases has not reflected a denigration of the constitutional rights involved.  Instead, as we emphasized earlier this Term:</p>\n<p>"The harmless error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\'s guilt or innocence, <em>United States v. Nobles,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/225/case.html">422 U.

S. 230</a></span> (1975), and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial, rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.  <em>Cf.</em> R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970) (<em>Reversal for error, regardless of its effect on the judgment. encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it\')." </em></p>\n<p><em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/673/case.html#681">475 U. S. 681</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Despite the strong interests that support the harmless error doctrine, the Court in <em>Chapman</em> recognized that some constitutional errors require reversal without regard to the evidence in the particular case.  386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html#23">386 U.

S. 510</a></span> (1927) (adjudication by biased judge).  This limitation recognizes that some errors necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair.  The State, of course, must provide a trial before an impartial judge, <em>Tumey v. Ohio, supra,</em> with counsel to help the accused defend against the State\'s charge, <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, supra.</em> <em>Compare Holloway v. Arkansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/475/case.html">435 U.

Without these basic protections, a criminal trial cannot reliably serve </p><p><a class="page-number" name="578">Page 478 U.

Harmless error analysis thus presupposes a trial, at which the defendant, represented by counsel, may present evidence and argument before an impartial judge and jury.

Where that right is altogether denied, the State cannot contend that the deprivation was harmless because the evidence established the defendant\'s guilt; the error in such a case is that the wrong entity judged the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p>We have emphasized, however, that, while there are some errors to which <em>Chapman</em> does not apply, they are the exception, and not the rule.  <em>United States v.

Accordingly, if the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless error analysis.  The thrust of the many constitutional rules governing the conduct of criminal trials is to ensure that those trials lead to fair and correct judgments.  Where a reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the interest in fairness has been satisfied, and the judgment should be affirmed.  As we have repeatedly stated, "the Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one."  <em>Delaware v.

Respondent received a full opportunity to put on evidence and make argument to support his claim of innocence.  He was tried by a fairly selected, impartial jury, supervised by an impartial judge.  Apart from the challenged malice instruction, the jury in this case was clearly instructed that it had to find respondent guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to every element of both first- and second-degree murder.  <em>See also</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em>  Placed in context, the erroneous malice instruction does not compare with the kinds of errors that automatically require reversal of an otherwise valid conviction.

The purpose of that rule is to ensure that only the guilty are criminally punished.  As the Court stated last Term in <em>Francis v.

Harmless error analysis addresses a different question:  what is to be done about a trial error that, in theory, may have altered the basis on which the jury decided the case, but in practice clearly had no effect on the outcome?  This question applies not merely to <em>Sandstrom</em> violations, but to other errors that may have affected either the instructions the jury heard or the record it considered --including errors such as mistaken admission of evidence, or unconstitutional comment on a defendant\'s silence, or erroneous limitation of a defendant\'s cross-examination of a prosecution witness.  All of these errors alter the terms under which the jury considered the defendant\'s guilt or innocence, and therefore all theoretically impair the defendant\'s interest in having a jury decide his case.  The dissent\'s argument -- that the Sixth Amendment forbids a reviewing court to decide the impact of a trial error on the outcome, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/570/case.html#593">478 U.

The jury determined that respondent was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of "intend[ing] to take the life" of Joy Faulk "with cool purpose."  App. 185 (trial court\'s charge defining premeditation).  The jury then determined that respondent was guilty of the malicious, but not premeditated, murder of Charles Browning.  The only alleged error in these instructions was the trial court\'s instruction that the jury could presume <em>malice</em> from a killing.  Respondent\'s (and the dissent\'s) theory is that a proper instruction on the burden of proof on malice might have led the jury to find <em>neither</em> malice <em>nor</em> premeditation as to Faulk\'s killing.  This argument is implausible on its face.</p>\n<p>We leave the question whether the error in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt to the Court of Appeals on remand.  We do suggest that the different verdicts for the two killings in no way support respondent\'s contention that the <em>Sandstrom</em> error in this case was prejudicial.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The parties disagree as to the scope of the relevant evidence that must be assessed under <em>Chapman.</em>  In particular, petitioner argues that evidence of amnesia, of respondent\'s drunkenness on the day of the murders, and of insanity is irrelevant to malice.  Respondent disagrees.  These are, of course, issues of Tennessee law in the first instance, and we need not resolve them here.  Nor do we express any view as to whether, assuming all the evidence in question is relevant to malice, the error in this case was nevertheless harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court\'s opinion, although I see no need for remanding for application of harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p>The evidence in this case showed that respondent stalked the victims by car for about an hour.  After trapping the victims\' truck in a private driveway, respondent fired four shots at point-blank range, killing both victims.  Two young girls, aged 3 and 6, were in the truck and witnessed the slaying.  Their mother was one of the victims.  After the murder, respondent left the scene, but was apprehended by the police after a high-speed chase.  In my view, such evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that respondent acted with malice. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="585">Page 478 U.

California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html">386 U. S. 18</a></span> (1967), applies to the erroneous jury instructions in this case.  I do not agree, however, with the Court\'s dictum regarding the nature of harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>According to the Court,</p>\n<p>"if the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless error analysis."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/570/case.html#579">478 U. S. 579</a></span>.  This statement stands in sharp contrast with the Court\'s analysis in <em>Chapman</em> itself.</p>\n<p>The principal question presented in <em>Chapman</em> was "whether there can ever be harmless constitutional error," 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html#20">386 U. S. 20</a></span>.  Without questioning the view that constitutional error is always sufficiently serious to create a presumption in favor of reversal, the Court refused "to hold that all federal constitutional errors, regardless of the facts and circumstances, must always be deemed harmful."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html#21">386 U. S. 21</a></span>.  Far from announcing any general principle that harmless error analysis is the rule, rather than the exception, the Court stated its holding in this language:</p>\n<p>"We conclude that there may be some constitutional errors which, in the setting of a particular case, are so unimportant and insignificant that they may, consistent with the Federal Constitution, be deemed harmless, not requiring the automatic reversal of the conviction."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html#22">386 U. S. 22</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Thereafter in its opinion, the Court emphasized that the burden of showing that constitutional error is harmless is heavier than the burden of showing that ordinary trial error is harmless.  The Court noted that</p>\n<p>"the original common law harmless error rule put the burden on the beneficiary of the error either to prove that there was no injury or to suffer a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="586">Page 478 U. S. 586</a></p><p> reversal of his erroneously obtained judgment."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html#24">386 U. S. 24</a></span>.  It then fashioned its constitutional rule by reference to its earlier decision in <em>Fahy v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/85/case.html">375 U. S. 85</a></span> (1963), stating:</p>\n<p>"There is little, if any, difference between our statement in <em>Fahy v. Connecticut</em> about \'whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction\' and requiring the beneficiary of a constitutional error to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.  We, therefore, do no more than adhere to the meaning of our <em>Fahy</em> case when we hold, as we now do, that, before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  While appellate courts do not ordinarily have the original task of applying such a test, it is a familiar standard to all courts, and we believe its adoption will provide a more workable standard, although achieving the same result as that aimed at in our <em>Fahy</em> case."</p>\n<p>386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html#24">386 U.

S. 587</a></p><p> how strong the evidence of guilt may be.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/570/case.html#577">478 U. S. 577</a></span>-578.  <em>See also Chapman,</em> 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html#23">386 U. S. 23</a></span>, n. 8.  The Court suggests that the inapplicability of harmless error to these violations rests on concerns about reliability and accuracy, and that such concerns are the only relevant consideration in determining the applicability of harmless error.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/570/case.html#579">478 U. S. 579</a></span>.  In fact, however, violations of certain constitutional rights are not, and should not be, subject to harmless error analysis, because those rights protect important values that are unrelated to the truthseeking function of the trial.  Thus, racial discrimination in the selection of grand juries is intolerable even if the defendant\'s guilt is subsequently established in a fair trial. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Racial discrimination in the selection of a petit jury may require a new trial without any inquiry into the actual impact of the forbidden practice. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The admission of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="588">Page 478 U. S. 588</a></p><p> coerced confession can never be harmless, even though the basic trial process was otherwise completely fair and the evidence of guilt overwhelming. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  In short, as the Court has recently emphasized, our Constitution, and our criminal justice system, protect other values besides the reliability of the guilt or innocence determination. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  A coherent harmless error jurisprudence should similarly respect those values.</p>\n<p>In addition to giving inadequate respect to constitutional values besides reliability, adopting a broad presumption in favor of harmless error also has a corrosive impact on the administration of criminal justice.  An automatic application of harmless error review in case after case, and for error after error, can only encourage prosecutors to subordinate the interest </p><p><a class="page-number" name="589">Page 478 U. S. 589</a></p><p> in respecting the Constitution to the ever-present and always powerful interest in obtaining a conviction in a particular case. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  It is particularly striking to compare the Court\'s apparent willingness to forgive constitutional errors that redound to the prosecutor\'s benefit with the Court\'s determination to give conclusive effect to trivial errors that obstruct a defendant\'s ability to raise meritorious constitutional arguments. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Both a proper respect for a range of constitutional values and the interest in an evenhanded approach to the administration of justice convince me that the Court\'s dictum about a sweeping presumption in favor of harmless error review is not only unnecessary, but also unsound.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In this particular case, however, the primary constitutional value protected by our holdings in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/510/case.html">442 U. S. 510</a></span> (1979), and <em>Francis v. Franklin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/307/case.html">471 U. S. 307</a></span> (1985), is an accurate determination of the defendant\'s guilt or innocence.  In my opinion, this is also not the kind of error with such an inherently imprecise effect that harmless error inquiry is ill advised. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  It follows that the Federal Constitution does not command a rule of automatic reversal, and that the Court of Appeals should review the entire record </p><p><a class="page-number" name="590">Page 478 U.

The erroneous instruction invites the jury to abdicate its constitutional responsibility to decide for itself whether the State has proved every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is likely that the jury will accept this invitation, because "there is no reason to believe the jury would have deliberately undertaken the more difficult task" of evaluating the evidence of intent when offered the opportunity simply to rely on a presumption, <em>Sandstrom,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/510/case.html#526">442 U.

When a defendant contests the issue of intent, a reviewing court will rarely be capable of deciding whether the error contributed to the verdict: it will have no way of knowing how the jury treated the question of intent.  <em>See Sandstrom,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/510/case.html#526">442 U. S. 526</a></span>; <em>Ulster County Court v. Allen,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/140/case.html#175">442 U.

[<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The verdicts reached in this case aptly illustrate why harmless error analysis is inappropriate in cases where a defendant contests the element of <em>mens rea.</em>  Clark was charged with the first-degree murders of two people, who were together in a truck when they were killed.  The State used the same evidence to prove that Clark killed Faulk as to prove that he killed Browning.  Yet the jury found Clark guilty of the first-degree murder of Faulk and the second-degree murder of Browning.  That the jury reached distinct verdicts shows that it focused closely on the question of Clark\'s mental culpability, the precise issue on which the court gave the constitutionally defective charge.  A reviewing court simply cannot determine whether this jury in fact relied on the flawed instruction.  It certainly is possible that it did:  perhaps the jury did not find sufficient intent to convict </p><p><a class="page-number" name="595">Page 478 U. S. 595</a></p><p> Clark of second-degree murder, and, but for the presumption of malice, would have convicted him of voluntary manslaughter, for which malice was not required.  It is of no value to point to any evidence presented at trial of Clark\'s intent;</p>\n<p>"[a]n erroneous presumption on a disputed element of the crime renders irrelevant the evidence on the issue, because the jury may have relied upon the presumption, rather than upon that evidence."</p>\n<p><em>Connecticut v.

The ordinary view is that a jury adheres to the instructions, <em>Parker v. Randolph,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/62/case.html">442 U. S. 62</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/62/case.html#73">442 U. S. 73</a></span> (1979) (plurality opinion), and there is no reason to believe that the "lay jury will know enough to disregard the judge\'s bad law, if in fact, he misguides them."  <em>Bollenbach v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/607/case.html">326 U.

S. 613</a></span>-614 (1946).</p>\n<p>It is true that, "[w]hen a jury is instructed to presume malice from predicate facts, it still must find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/570/case.html#580">478 U. S. 580</a></span>.  But that truism is beside the point here, where the only fact that the jury was required to find in order to trigger the presumption was that "a killing has occurred."  App. 187.  The jury was instructed to presume criminal intent, the <em>sine qua non</em> of criminal responsibility, from the fact of a dead body.  The jury may have found the fact that there was a body, but this jury has not met <em>In re Winship\'s</em> requirement of finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, "every fact necessary to constitute the crime," 397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html#364">397 U. S. 364</a></span>:  this jury may never have found that Clark acted with malice, an essential element of the crimes of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court recognized 40 years ago that the question a reviewing court must ask "is not whether guilt may be spelt out of a record, but whether guilt has been found by a jury according to the procedures and standards" required by the Constitution.  <em>Bollenbach v. United States,</em> 326 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/607/case.html#614">326 U. S. 614</a></span>.  When a jury has not been properly instructed concerning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="596">Page 478 U. S. 596</a></p><p> an essential element of the offense that has been charged, the danger exists that the defendant has been deprived of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to have the jury determine whether the State has proved each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Faced with an incorrect instruction and a general verdict of guilty, a reviewing court simply lacks any adequate basis for deciding whether the jury has performed its constitutionally required function.  Because I believe the Court today asks and answers the wrong question, I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The trial court\'s wording of the definition of malice and of the presumption of malice for first-degree murder differed slightly from that it gave for second-degree murder, presented in the text.  Because these differences are immaterial, the courts below treated the instructions as if they were identical, <em>see</em> App. to Pet. for Cert. A-10, A-12, as does the majority.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Under <em>Sandstrom,</em> both mandatory conclusive presumptions, which remove the presumed element from the case once the State has proved the predicate fact, and mandatory rebuttable presumptions, which require the jury to find the presumed element unless the defendant rebuts the presumption, are unconstitutional.  <em>See Sandstrom v. Montana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/510/case.html">442 U.
