S. 36</a>, 59, this Court held that the Clause permits admission of \xe2\x80\x9c[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial \xe2\x80\xa6 only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Later, in <em>Melendez-Diaz</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, 557 U. S. ___, the Court declined to create a \xe2\x80\x9cforensic evidence\xe2\x80\x9d exception to <em>Crawford</em>, holding that a forensic laboratory report, created specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding, ranked as \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d for Confrontation Clause purposes.  Absent stipulation, the Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a report without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth of the report\xe2\x80\x99s statements.  557 U. S., at ___.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s jury trial on charges of driving while intoxicated (DWI) occurred after <em>Crawford,</em> but before <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>.  Principal evidence against him was a forensic laboratory report certifying that his blood-alcohol concentration was well above the threshold for aggravated DWI.  Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood sample had been tested at the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division (SLD), by a forensic analyst named Caylor, who completed, signed, and certified the report.  However, the prosecution neither called Caylor to testify nor asserted he was unavailable; the record showed only that Caylor was placed on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason.  In lieu of Caylor, the State called another analyst, Razatos, to validate the report.  Razatos was familiar with the testing device used to analyze Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood and with the laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the test on Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood sample.  Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s counsel objected, asserting that introduction of Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s report without his testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause, but the trial court overruled the objection, admitted the SLD report as a business record, and permitted Razatos to testify.  Bullcoming was convicted, and, while his appeal was pending before the New Mexico Supreme Court, this Court decided <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>.  The state high court acknowledged that the SLD report qualified as testimonial evidence under <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, but held that the report\xe2\x80\x99s admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause because: (1) certifying analyst Caylor was a mere scrivener who simply transcribed machine-generated test results, and (2) SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not participate in testing Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood, qualified as an expert witness with respect to the testing machine and SLD procedures.  The court affirmed Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">147 N.\xc2\xa0M. 487, 226 P.\xc2\xa03d 1, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to all but Part IV and footnote 6.  The Confrontation Clause, the opinion concludes, does not permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not sign the certification or personally perform or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification.  The accused\xe2\x80\x99s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0If an out-of-court statement is testimonial, it may not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s certification reported more than a machine-generated number: It represented that he received Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood sample intact with the seal unbroken; that he checked to make sure that the forensic report number and the sample number corresponded; that he performed a particular test on Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s sample, adhering to a precise protocol; and that he left the report\xe2\x80\x99s remarks section blank, indicating that no circumstance or condition affected the sample\xe2\x80\x99s integrity or the analysis\xe2\x80\x99 validity.  These representations, relating to past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data, are meet for cross-examination.  The potential ramifications of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, therefore, raise red flags.  Most witnesses testify to their observations of factual conditions or events.  Where, for example, a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s report recorded an objective fact such as the read-out of a radar gun, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning would permit another officer to introduce the information, so long as he or she was equipped to testify about the technology the observing officer deployed and the police department\xe2\x80\x99s standard operating procedures.  As, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/813/index.html">547 U. S. 813</a>, 826, makes plain, however, such testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause.  The comparative reliability of an analyst\xe2\x80\x99s testimonial report does not dispense with the Clause.  <em>Crawford,</em> 541 U. S., at 62.  The analysts who write reports introduced as evidence must be made available for confrontation even if they have \xe2\x80\x9cthe scientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of Mother Teresa.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, 557 U. S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa06.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Nor was Razatos an adequate substitute witness simply because he qualified as an expert with respect to the testing machine and the SLD\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory procedures.  Surrogate testimony of the kind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what Caylor knew or observed about the events he certified, nor expose any lapses or lies on Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s part.  Significantly, Razatos did not know why Caylor had been placed on unpaid leave.  With Caylor on the stand, Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s counsel could have asked Caylor questions designed to reveal whether Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty accounted for his removal from work.  And the State did not assert that Razatos had any independent opinion concerning Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood alcohol content.  More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court believes that questioning one witness about another\xe2\x80\x99s testimonial statements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.  Although the purpose of Sixth Amendment rights is to ensure a fair trial, it does not follow that such rights can be disregarded because, on the whole, the trial is fair.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/140/index.html">548 U. S. 140</a>, 145.  If a \xe2\x80\x9cparticular guarantee\xe2\x80\x9d is violated, no substitute procedure can cure the violation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 146.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Melendez-Diaz </em>precluded the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that introduction of the SLD report did not implicate the Confrontation Clause because the report is nontestimonial.  Like the certificates in <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, the SLD report is undoubtedly an \xe2\x80\x9caffirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact\xe2\x80\x9d in a criminal proceeding.  557 U. S., at ___.  Created solely for an \xe2\x80\x9cevidentiary purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at ___, the report ranks as testimonial.  In all material respects, the SLD report resembles the certificates in <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>.  Here, as there, an officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory required by law to assist in police investigations.  Like the <em>Melendez-Diaz</em> analysts, Caylor tested the evidence and prepared a certificate concerning the result of his analysis.  And like the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>certificates, Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s report here is \xe2\x80\x9cformalized\xe2\x80\x9d in a signed document, <em>Davis</em>, 547 U. S., at 837, n.\xc2\xa02.  Also noteworthy, the SLD report form contains a legend referring to municipal and magistrate courts\xe2\x80\x99 rules that provide for the admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.  Thus, although the SLD report was not notarized, the formalities attending the report were more than adequate to qualify Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s assertions as testimonial.

S. ___ (2009), this Court held that a forensic laboratory report stating that a suspect substance was cocaine ranked as testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause.  The report had been created specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding.  Absent stipulation, the Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a report without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth of the statements made in the report.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us, petitioner Donald Bullcoming \nwas arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated (DWI).  Principal evidence against Bullcoming was a foren-sic laboratory report certifying that Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood-alcohol concentration was well above the threshold for aggravated DWI.  At trial, the prosecution did not call as a witness the analyst who signed the certification.  Instead, the State called another analyst who was familiar with the laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the test on Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood sample.  The New Mexico Supreme Court determined that, although the blood-alcohol analysis was \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial,\xe2\x80\x9d the Confrontation Clause did not require the certifying analyst\xe2\x80\x99s in-court testimony.  Instead, New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s high court held, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented is whether the Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification\xe2\x80\x94made for the purpose of proving a particular fact\xe2\x80\x94through the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification.  We hold that surrogate testimony of that order does not meet the constitutional requirement.  The accused\xe2\x80\x99s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In August 2005, a vehicle driven by petitioner Donald Bullcoming rear-ended a pick-up truck at an intersection in Farmington, New Mexico.  When the truckdriver exited his vehicle and approached Bullcoming to exchange insurance information, he noticed that Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were bloodshot.  Smelling alcohol on Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s breath, the truckdriver told his wife to call the police.  Bullcoming left the scene before the police arrived, but was soon apprehended by an officer who observed his performance of field sobriety tests.  Upon failing the tests, Bullcoming was arrested for driving a vehicle while \xe2\x80\x9cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\xe2\x80\x9d (DWI), in violation of N.\xc2\xa0M. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa766\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x93102 (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because Bullcoming refused to take a breath test, the police obtained a warrant authorizing a blood-alcohol analy-sis.  Pursuant to the warrant, a sample of Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood was drawn at a local hospital.  To determine Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood-alcohol concentration (BAC), the police \nsent the sample to the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division (SLD).  In a standard SLD form titled \xe2\x80\x9cReport of Blood Alcohol Analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d participants in the testing were identified, and the forensic analyst certified his finding.  App. 62.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SLD\xe2\x80\x99s report contained in the top block \xe2\x80\x9cinformation \xe2\x80\xa6 filled in by [the] arresting officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (capitalization omitted).  This information included the \xe2\x80\x9creason [the] suspect [was] stopped\xe2\x80\x9d (the officer checked \xe2\x80\x9cAccident\xe2\x80\x9d), and the date (\xe2\x80\x9c8.14.05\xe2\x80\x9d) and time (\xe2\x80\x9c18:25 PM\xe2\x80\x9d) the blood sample was drawn.  <em>Ibid.</em> (capitalization omitted).  The arresting officer also affirmed that he had arrested Bullcoming and witnessed the blood draw.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The next two blocks contained certifications by the nurse who drew Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood and the SLD intake employee who received the blood sample sent to the laboratory.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following these segments, the report presented the \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate of analyst,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid. </em>(capitalization omitted), com-pleted and signed by Curtis Caylor, the SLD forensic analyst assigned to test Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood sample.  <em>Id.</em>, at 62, 64\xe2\x80\x9365.  Caylor recorded that the BAC in Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s sample was 0.21 grams per hundred milliliters, an inordinately high level.  <em>Id.</em>, at 62.  Caylor also affirmed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken in the laboratory,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statements in [the analyst\xe2\x80\x99s block of the report] are correct,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he had \xe2\x80\x9cfollowed the procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Those \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures\xe2\x80\x9d instructed analysts, <em>inter alia</em>, to  \xe2\x80\x9cre-tai[n] the sample container and the raw data from the analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cnot[e] any circumstance or condition which might affect the integrity of the sample or otherwise affect the validity of the analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 65.  Finally, in a block headed \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate of reviewer,\xe2\x80\x9d the SLD examiner who reviewed Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s analysis certified that Caylor was qualified to conduct the BAC test, and that the \xe2\x80\x9cestablished procedure\xe2\x80\x9d for handling and analyzing Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s sample \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] been followed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 62 (capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SLD analysts use gas chromatograph machines to determine BAC levels.

Second, SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not participate in testing Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood, \xe2\x80\x9cqualified as \nan expert witness with respect to the gas chromatograph machine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 9.  \xe2\x80\x9cRazatos provided live, in-court testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d the court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cand, thus, was available for cross-examination regarding the operation of the \xe2\x80\xa6 machine, the results of [Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s] BAC test, and the SLD\xe2\x80\x99s established laboratory procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Razatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony was crucial, the court explained, because Bullcoming could not cross-examine the machine or the written report.  <em>Id.</em>, at 10.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s] right of confrontation was preserved,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded, because Razatos was a qualified analyst, able to serve as a surrogate for Caylor.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to address this question: Does the Confrontation Clause permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not  sign the certification or personally perform or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification.  561 U. S. ___ (2010).  Our answer is in line with controlling precedent: As a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testimonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.  Because the New Mexico Supreme Court permitted the testimonial statement of one witness, <em>i.e.</em>, Caylor, to enter into evidence through the in-court testimony of a second person, <em>i.e.</em>, Razatos, we reverse that court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause confers upon the accused \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, \xe2\x80\xa6 the right \xe2\x80\xa6 to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  In a pathmarking 2004 decision, <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, we overruled <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Roberts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/56/index.html">448 U.

We have already explained that Caylor certified to more than a machine-generated number.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  In any event, the comparative reliability of an analyst\xe2\x80\x99s testimonial report drawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the Sixth Amendment bar.  This Court settled in <em>Crawford</em> that the \xe2\x80\x9cobviou[s] reliab[ility]\xe2\x80\x9d of a testimonial statement does not dispense with the Confrontation Clause.  541 U.

With Caylor on the stand, Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s counsel could have asked questions designed to reveal whether incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty accounted for Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s removal from his work station.  Notable in this regard, the State never asserted that Caylor was \xe2\x80\x9cunavailable\xe2\x80\x9d; the prosecution conveyed only that Caylor was on uncompensated leave.  Nor did the State assert that Razatos had any \xe2\x80\x9cindependent opinion\xe2\x80\x9d concerning Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s BAC.  See Brief for Respondent 58, n.\xc2\xa015.

Nor is it \xe2\x80\x9cthe role of courts to extrapolate from the words of the [Confrontation Clause] to the values behind it, and then to enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve (in the courts\xe2\x80\x99 views) those underlying values.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Giles</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/353/index.html">554 U.

Accordingly, the Clause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court believes that questioning one witness about another\xe2\x80\x99s testimonial statements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A recent decision involving another Sixth Amendment right\xe2\x80\x94the right to counsel\xe2\x80\x94is instructive.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/140/index.html">548 U.

This Court rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]rue enough,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of the rights set forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair trial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 145.  If a \xe2\x80\x9cparticular guarantee\xe2\x80\x9d of the Sixth Amendment is violated, no substitute procedure can cure the violation, and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o additional showing of prejudice is required to make the violation \xe2\x80\x98complete.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 146.  If repre-sentation by substitute counsel does not satisfy the Sixth Amendment, neither does the opportunity to confront a substitute witness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, when the State elected to introduce Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s certification, Caylor became a witness Bullcoming had the right to confront.

Reading the Clause in this \xe2\x80\x9cimplausible\xe2\x80\x9d manner, <em>ibid.</em>, the Court noted, would make the right to confrontation easily erasable.  See <em>Davis</em>, 547 U.

The hearsay rule\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of the certificates\xe2\x80\x99 evidentiary purpose thus confirmed our decision that the certificates were testimonial under the primary purpose analysis required by the Confrontation Clause.

Although \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ormality is not the sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d a statement\xe2\x80\x99s formality or informality can shed light on whether a particular statement has a primary purpose\nof use at trial.  <em>Bryant</em>, 562 U.

Therefore, the New Mexico court contravened our precedents in holding that the report was admissible via Razatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although this case is materially indistinguishable from the facts we considered in <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, I highlight \nsome of the factual circumstances that this case does <em>not</em> present.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, this is not a case in which the State suggested an alternate purpose, much less an alternate <em>primary</em> purpose, for the BAC report.  For example, the State has not claimed that the report was necessary to provide Bullcoming with medical treatment.  See <em>Bryant</em>, 562 U. S., at ___ , n.\xc2\xa09 (slip op., at 15, n.\xc2\xa09) (listing \xe2\x80\x9cStatements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment\xe2\x80\x9d under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4) as an example of statements that are\n\xe2\x80\x9cby their nature, made for a purpose other than use in a prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip op., at<em> </em>6, n.\xc2\xa02) (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]edical reports created for treatment purposes \xe2\x80\xa6 would not be testimonial under our decision today\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Giles</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/353/index.html">554 U. S. 353</a>, 376 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]tatements to physicians in the course of receiving treatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay rules\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, this is not a case in which the person testifying is a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal, albeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.  Razatos conceded on cross-examination that he played no role in producing the BAC report and did not observe any portion of Curtis Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct of the testing.  App. 58.  The court below also recognized Razatos\xe2\x80\x99 total lack of connection to the test at issue.  226 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 6.  It would be a different case if, for example, a supervisor who observed an analyst conducting a test testified about the results or a report about such results.  We need not address what degree of involvement is sufficient because here Razatos had no involvement whatsoever in the relevant test and report.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, this is not a case in which an expert witness was asked for his independent opinion about underlying testimonial reports that were not themselves admitted into evidence.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 703 (explaining that facts or data of a type upon which experts in the field would reasonably rely in forming  an opinion need not be admissible in order for the expert\xe2\x80\x99s opinion based on the facts and data to be admitted).  As the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at 12, the State does not assert that Razatos offered an independent, expert opinion about Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s blood alcohol concentration.  Rather, the State explains, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]side from reading a report that was introduced as an exhibit, Mr. Razatos offered no opinion about Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s blood alcohol content \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 58, n.\xc2\xa015 (citation omitted).  Here the State offered the BAC report, including Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s testimonial statements, into evidence.  We would face a different question if asked to determine the constitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others\xe2\x80\x99 testimonial statements if the testimonial statements were not themselves admitted as evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, this is not a case in which the State introduced only machine-generated results, such as a printout from a gas chromatograph.  The State here introduced Caylor\xe2\x80\x99s statements, which included his transcription of a blood alcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chromatograph printout, along with other statements about the procedures used in handling the blood sample.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10; App. 62 (\xe2\x80\x9cI certify that I followed the procedures set out on the reverse of this report, and the statements in this block are correct\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, we do not decide whether, as the New Mexico Supreme Court suggests, 226 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 10, a State could introduce (assuming an adequate chain of custody foundation) raw data generated by a machine in conjunction with the testimony of an expert witness.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16, n.\xc2\xa05.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case does not present, and thus the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not address, any of these factual scenarios.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, the primary purpose of the BAC report is clearly to serve as evidence.  It is therefore tes-timonial, and the trial court erred in allowing the State\nto introduce it into evidence via Razatos\xe2\x80\x99 testimony.  I respectfully concur.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, <em>Bryant </em>deemed reliability, as reflected in the hearsay rules, to be \xe2\x80\x9crelevant,\xe2\x80\x9d  562 U.

As we explained in <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, it is not the case \xe2\x80\x9cthat anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  It is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.

Although in some instances formality could signal reliability, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument fails to appreciate that, under our Confrontation Clause precedents, formality is primarily an indicator of testimonial purpose.  Formality is not the sole indicator of the testimonial nature of a statement because it is too easily evaded.  See <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/813/index.html">547 U. S. 813</a>, 838 (2006)<em> </em>(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Nonetheless formality has long been a hallmark of testimonial statements because formality suggests that the statement is intended for use at trial.  As we explained in <em>Bryant</em>, informality, on the other hand, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not necessarily indicate . . . lack of testimonial intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19).  The dissent itself recognizes the relevance of formality to the testimonial inquiry when it notes the formality of the problematic unconfronted statements in Sir Walter Raleigh\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  <em>Post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963572">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nKENNEDY, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nBULLCOMING V.

Two Terms ago, in a case arising from a state criminal prosecution, the Court interpreted the Clause to mandate exclusion of a laboratory report sought to be introduced based on the authority of that report\xe2\x80\x99s own sworn statement that a test had been performed yielding the results as shown.  <em>Melendez-Diaz</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, 557 U. S. ___ (2009).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in that case held the report inadmissible because no one was present at trial to testify to its contents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether or not one agrees with the reasoning and the result in <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, the Court today takes the new and serious misstep of extending that holding to instances like this one.  Here a knowledgeable representative of the laboratory was present to testify and to explain the lab\xe2\x80\x99s processes and the details of the report; but because he was not the analyst who filled out part of the form and transcribed onto it the test result from a machine printout, the Court finds a confrontation violation.  Some of the principal objections to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s underlying theory have been set out earlier and need not be repeated here.  See <em>id.,</em> at <em>___</em> (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Additional reasons, applicable to the extension of that doctrine and to the new ruling in this case, are now explained in support of this respectful dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before today, the Court had not held that the Confrontation Clause bars admission of scientific findings when an employee of the testing laboratory authenticates the findings, testifies to the laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s methods and practices, and is cross-examined at trial.  Far from replacing live testimony with \xe2\x80\x9csystematic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cextrajudicial\xe2\x80\x9d examinations, <em>Davis</em> v.<em> Washington, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/547/813/index.html">547 U.

They do not \xe2\x80\x9cresemble Marian proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 837.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The procedures followed here, but now invalidated by the Court, make live testimony rather than the \xe2\x80\x9csolemnity\xe2\x80\x9d of a document the primary reason to credit the labo-ratory\xe2\x80\x99s scientific results.  <em>Id., </em>at 838.  Unlike <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, where the jury was asked to credit a labora-\ntory\xe2\x80\x99s findings based solely on documents that were\n\xe2\x80\x9cquite plainly affidavits,\xe2\x80\x9d 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (Thomas, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted), here the signature, heading, or legend on the document were routine authentication elements for a report that would be assessed and explained by in-court testimony subject to full cross-examination.  The only sworn statement at issue was that of the witness who was present and who testified.</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record reveals that the certifying analyst\xe2\x80\x99s role here was no greater than that of anyone else in the chain of custody.  App. 56 (laboratory employee\xe2\x80\x99s testimony agreeing that \xe2\x80\x9conce the material is prepared and placed in the machine, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need any particular expertise to record the results\xe2\x80\x9d).  The information contained in the report was the result of a scientific process comprising multiple participants\xe2\x80\x99 acts, each with its own evidentiary significance.  These acts included receipt of the sample at the laboratory; recording its receipt; storing it; placing the sample into the testing device; transposing the printout of the results of the test onto the report; and review of the results.  See <em>Id., </em>at 48\xe2\x80\x9356; see also Brief for State of New Mexico Dept. of Health Scientific Laboratory Division as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4 (hereinafter New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief) (\xe2\x80\x9cEach blood sample has original testing work by . . . as many as seve[n] analysts . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d); App. 62 (indicating that this case involved three laboratory analysts who, respectively, received, analyzed, and reviewed analysis of the sample); cf.

Each sample is identified by a computer-generated number that is not linked back to the file containing the name of the person from whom the sample came until after all testing is completed.  See New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 26.  The analysis is mechanically performed by the gas chromatograph, which may operate\xe2\x80\x94as in this case\xe2\x80\x94after all the laboratory employees leave for the day.  See <em>id., </em>at<em> </em>17.  And whatever the result, it is reported to both law enforcement and the defense.  See <em>id., </em>at 36.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The representative of the testing laboratory whom the prosecution called was a scientific analyst named Mr. Razatos.  He testified that he \xe2\x80\x9chelp[ed] in overseeing the administration of these programs throughout the State,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was qualified to answer questions concerning each of these steps.  App. 49.  The Court has held that the government need not produce at trial \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone who laid hands on the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra</em>, at ___, n.\xc2\xa01 (slip op., at 5, n.\xc2\xa01).  Here, the defense used the opportunity in cross-examination to highlight the absence at trial of certain laboratory employees.  Under questioning by Bullcoming\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Razatos acknowledged that his name did not appear on the report; that he did not receive the sample, perform the analysis, or complete the review; and that he did not know the reason for some personnel decisions.  App. 58.  After weighing arguments from defense counsel concerning these admissions, and after con-sidering the testimony of Mr. Razatos, who knew the laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s protocols and processes, the jury found no reasonable doubt as to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these circumstances, requiring the State to call the technician who filled out a form and recorded the results of a test is a hollow formality.  The defense remains free to challenge any and all forensic evidence.  It may call and examine the technician who performed a test.  And it may call other expert witnesses to explain that tests are not always reliable or that the technician might have made a mistake.  The jury can then decide whether to credit the test, as it did here.  The States, furthermore, can assess the progress of scientific testing and enact or adopt statutes and rules to ensure that only reliable evidence is admitted.  Rejecting these commonsense arguments and the concept that reliability is a legitimate concern, the Court today takes a different course.  It once more assumes for itself a central role in mandating detailed evidentiary rules, thereby extending and confirming <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cvast potential to disrupt criminal procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The protections in the Confrontation Clause, and indeed the Sixth Amendment in general, are designed to ensure\na fair trial with reliable evidence.  But the <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a> (2004),<em> </em>line of cases has treated the reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 61\xe2\x80\x9362.  Today, for example, the Court bars admission of a lab report because it \xe2\x80\x9cis formalized in a signed document.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s unconventional and unstated premise is that\nthe State\xe2\x80\x94by acting to ensure a statement\xe2\x80\x99s reliability\xe2\x80\x94makes the statement more formal and therefore less likely to be admitted.  Park, Is Confrontation the Bottom Line? 19 Regent U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 459, 461 (2007).  That is so, the Court insists, because reliability does not animate the Confrontation Clause.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11; <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312); <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 61\xe2\x80\x9362.  Yet just this Term the Court ruled that, in another confrontation context, reliability was an essential part of the constitutional inquiry.  See <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Bryant</em>, 562 U.

Solemnity has sometimes been dispositive, see <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>, 557 U.

So, too, with the elusive distinction between utterances aimed at proving past events, and those calculated to help police keep the peace.  Compare <em>Davis, supra</em>, and <em>Bryant</em>, 562 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Now, the Court reveals, this rule is either less clear than it first appeared or too strict to be followed.  A report is admissible, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion states, if a \xe2\x80\x9clive witness competent to testify to the truth of the statements made in the report\xe2\x80\x9d appears.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  Such witnesses include not just the certifying analyst, but also any \xe2\x80\x9cscientist who . . . perform[ed] or observe[d] the test reported in the certification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s majority is not committed in equal shares to a common set of principles in applying the holding of <em>Crawford</em>.  Compare <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em> (opinion for the Court by Scalia, J.), with <em>id.</em>, at 834 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); and <em>Bryant</em>, <em>supra</em>, (opinion for the Court by Sotomayor, J.), with <em>id.</em>, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), and <em>id.</em>, at ___ (Scalia, J., dissenting), and <em>id.</em>, at ___ (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); and <em>ante</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (opinion of the Court), with <em>ante,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 1) (Sotomayor, J., concurring).  That the Court in the wake of <em>Crawford</em> has had such trouble fashioning a clear vision of that case\xe2\x80\x99s meaning is unsettling; for <em>Crawford </em>binds every judge in every criminal trial in every local, state, and federal court in the Nation.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior decisions leave trial judges to \xe2\x80\x9cguess what future rules this Court will distill from the sparse constitutional text,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 2) (Kennedy, J., dissenting), or to struggle to apply an \xe2\x80\x9camorphous, if not entirely subjective,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chighly context-dependent inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d involving \xe2\x80\x9copen-ended balancing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bryant, supra, </em>at ___ (slip op., at 15\xe2\x80\x9316) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted) (listing 11 factors relevant under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The persistent ambiguities in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach are symptomatic of a rule not amenable to sensible applications.  Procedures involving multiple participants illustrate the problem.  In <em>Melendez-Diaz</em> the Court insisted that its opinion did not require everyone in the chain of custody to testify but then qualified that \xe2\x80\x9cwhat testimony <em>is</em> introduced must . . . be introduced live.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U. S.,\nat ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 5, n.\xc2\xa01); <em>ante</em>, at 6, n. 2.  This\ncould mean that a statement that evidence remained in law-enforcement custody is admissible if the statement\xe2\x80\x99s maker appears in court.  If so, an intern at police headquarters could review the evidence log, declare that chain of custody was retained, and so testify.  The rule could also be that that the intern\xe2\x80\x99s statement\xe2\x80\x94which draws on statements in the evidence log\xe2\x80\x94is inadmissible unless every officer who signed the log appears at trial.  That rule, if applied to this case, would have conditioned admissibility of the report on the testimony of three or more identified witnesses.  See App. 62.  In other instances, 7 or even 40 witnesses could be required.  See <em>supra, </em>at 3.  The court has thus\xe2\x80\x94in its fidelity to <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>\xe2\x80\x94boxed itself into a choice of evils: render the Confrontation Clause pro forma or construe it so that its dictates are unworkable.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Crawford </em>itself does not compel today\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  It\nis true, as <em>Crawford </em>confirmed, that the Confrontation Clause seeks in part to bar the government from replicating trial procedures outside of public view.  See 541 U. S., at 50;<em> Bryant</em>, <em>supra, </em>at ___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312).  <em>Crawford </em>explained that the basic purpose of the Clause was to address the sort of abuses exemplified at the notorious treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh.  541 U. S., at 51.  On this view the Clause operates to bar admission of out-of-court statements obtained through formal interrogation in preparation for trial.  The danger is that innocent defendants may be convicted on the basis of unreliable, untested statements by those who observed\xe2\x80\x94or claimed to have observed\xe2\x80\x94preparation for or commission of the crime.  And, of course, those statements might not have been uttered at all or\xe2\x80\x94even if spoken\xe2\x80\x94might not have been true.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A rule that bars testimony of that sort, however, provides neither cause nor necessity to impose a constitutional bar on the admission of impartial lab reports like the instant one, reports prepared by experienced technicians in laboratories that follow professional norms and scientific protocols.  In addition to the constitutional right to call witnesses in his own defense, the defendant in this case was already protected by checks on potential prosecutorial abuse such as free retesting for defendants; result-blind issuance of reports; testing by an independent agency; routine processes performed en masse, which reduce opportunities for targeted bias; and labs operating pursuant to scientific and professional norms and oversight.  See Brief for Respondent 5, 14\xe2\x80\x9315, 41, 54; New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2, 26.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to preventing the State from conducting <em>ex parte</em> trials, <em>Crawford</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the regime of <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Roberts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/56/index.html">448 U. S. 56</a> (1980), seemed to have two under-lying jurisprudential objectives.  One was to delink the intricacies of hearsay law from a constitutional mandate; and the other was to allow the States, in their own courts and legislatures and without this Court\xe2\x80\x99s supervision, to explore and develop sensible, specific evidentiary rules pertaining to the admissibility of certain statements.  These results were to be welcomed, for this Court lacks the experience and day-to-day familiarity with the trial process to suit it well to assume the role of national tribunal for rules of evidence.  Yet far from pursuing these objectives, the Court rejects them in favor of their opposites.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of freeing the Clause from reliance on hearsay doctrines, the Court has now linked the Clause with hearsay rules in their earliest, most rigid, and least refined formulations.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mosteller, Remaking Confrontation Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge\nof Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 691, 739\xe2\x80\x93740, 742, 744\xe2\x80\x93746; Gallanis, The Rise of Modern Evidence Law, 84 Iowa L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 499, 502\xe2\x80\x93503, 514\xe2\x80\x93515, 533\xe2\x80\x93537 (1999).  In cases like <em>Melendez-Diaz</em> and this one, the Court has tied the Confrontation Clause to 18th century hearsay rules unleavened by principles tending to make those rules more sensible.  Sklansky, Hearsay\xe2\x80\x99s Last Hurrah, 2009 S.\xc2\xa0Ct. Rev. 1, 5\xe2\x80\x936, 36.  As a result, the Court has taken the Clause far beyond its most important ap-plication, which is to forbid sworn, <em>ex parte,</em> out-of-court statements by unconfronted and available witnesses who observed the crime and do not appear at trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the States are not just at risk of having some of their hearsay rules reviewed by this Court.  They often are foreclosed now from contributing to the formulation and enactment of rules that make trials fairer and more reliable.  For instance, recent state laws allowing admission\nof well-documented and supported reports of abuse by women whose abusers later murdered them must give way, unless that abuser murdered with the specific purpose of foreclosing the testimony.  <em>Giles</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/353/index.html">554 U. S. 353</a> (2008); Sklansky, <em>supra, </em>at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  Whether those statutes could provide sufficient indicia of reliability and other safeguards to comply with the Confrontation Clause as it should be understood is, to be sure, an open question.  The point is that the States cannot now participate in the development of this difficult part of the law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, there is an ongoing, continued, and systemic displacement of the States and dislocation of the federal structure.  Cf.  <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra,</em> at ___, ___, ___ (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 22\xe2\x80\x9323).  If this Court persists in applying wooden formalism in order to bar reliable testimony offered by the prosecution\xe2\x80\x94testimony thought proper for many decades in state and federal courts committed to devising fair trial processes\xe2\x80\x94then the States might find it necessary and appropriate to enact statutes to accommodate this new, intrusive federal regime.  If they do, those rules could remain on State statute books for decades, even if subsequent decisions of this Court were to better implement the objectives of <em>Crawford</em>.  This underscores the disruptive, long-term structural consequences of decisions like the one the Court announces today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0States also may decide it is proper and appropriate to enact statutes that require defense counsel to give advance notice if they are going to object to introduction of a report without the presence in court of the technician who prepared it.  Indeed, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion relies upon laws of that sort as a palliative to the disruption it is causing.  <em>Ante,</em> at 17 (plurality opinion).  It is quite unrealistic, however, to think that this will take away from the defense the incentives to insist on having the certifying analyst present.  There is in the ordinary case that proceeds to trial no good reason for defense counsel to waive the right of confrontation as the Court now interprets it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion repeats an assertion from <em>Melendez-Diaz</em> that its decision will not \xe2\x80\x9cimpose an undue burden on the prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 16 (plurality opinion).  But evidence to the contrary already has begun to mount.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for State of California et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>7 (explaining that the 10 toxicologists for the Los Angeles Police Department spent 782 hours at 261 court appearances during a 1-year period); Brief for National District Attorneys Assocation et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 23 (observing that each blood-alcohol analyst in California processes 3,220 cases per year on average).  New and more rigorous empirical studies further detailing the unfortunate effects of <em>Melendez-Diaz</em> are sure to be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the meantime, New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s experience exemplifies the problems ahead.  From 2008 to 2010, subpoenas requiring New Mexico analysts to testify in impaired-driving cases rose 71%, to 1,600\xe2\x80\x94or 8 or 9 every workday.  New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2.  In a State that is the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s fifth largest by area and that employs just 10 total analysts, <em>id., </em>at 3, each analyst in blood alcohol cases recently received 200 subpoenas per year, <em>id.,</em> at 33.  The analysts now must travel great distances on most working days.  The result has been, in the laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cchaotic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 5.  And if the defense raises an objection and the analyst is tied up in another court proceeding; or on leave; or absent; or delayed in transit; or no longer employed; or ill; or no longer living, the defense gets a windfall.  As a result, good defense attorneys will object in ever-greater numbers to a prosecution failure or inability to produce laboratory analysts at trial.  The concomitant increases in subpoenas will further impede the state laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s ability to keep pace with its obligations.  Scarce state resources could be committed to other urgent needs in the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seven years after its initiation, it bears remembering that the <em>Crawford </em>approach was not preordained.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s missteps have produced an interpretation of the word \xe2\x80\x9cwitness\xe2\x80\x9d at odds with its meaning elsewhere in the Constitution, including elsewhere in the Sixth Amendment, see Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84 Geo. L.\xc2\xa0J. 641, 647, 691\xe2\x80\x93696 (1996), and at odds with\nthe sound administration of justice.  It is time to return\nto solid ground.  A proper place to begin that return is to decline to extend <em>Melendez-Diaz</em> to bar the reliable, commonsense evidentiary framework the State sought to follow in this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
