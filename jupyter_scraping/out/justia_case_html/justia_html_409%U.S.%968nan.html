Petitioners are inmates of the Texas Department of Corrections (T. D. C.). They brought a class action under 42 U.S.C.A. 1983, challenging the constitutionality of: (1) a T. D. C. regulation barring all inmate assistance in preparation of legal work. (2) the primitive conditions of the solitary confinement as administered by the T. D. C. The District Court denied relief, Novak v. Beto, 320 F.Supp. 1206 (SD Tex.1970). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously reversed as to the prohibition on prisoners\' legal assistance, holding the State had not met its burden of providing alternatives to assure access to the courts as required by Johnson v. Avery, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/483/case.html">393 U.S. 483</a> (1969). A divided Court affirmed the constitutionality of the conditions of solitary confinement. Novak v.

United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/217/349/case.html">217 U.S. 349</a>, was a landmark in the definition of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. Robinson v. California made the Eighth Amendment binding on the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/660/case.html#669">370 U.S. 660, 669</a>d 758. We said that the \'dignity of man\' was the overriding value preserved by that clause. Trop v. Dulles, <a href="/cases/federal/us/356/86/case.html#100">356 U.S. 86, 100</a>. </p><p> The fitness of punishment is to be judged by applying evolving standards, for the clause \'is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.\' 217 U. S. at 378. What those standards are is now tendered. The extent to which the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment will apply in prison must also be determined. In Haines v. Kerner, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/519/case.html">404 U.S. 519</a> (1972), we held that a bare allegation of onerous penal conditions is sufficient to require a hearing. </p><p> Lower courts have often dealt with the issue and have reached divergent results3 without guidance from us. See Morales v. Schmidt, 340 F. Supp. 544 (D.C.1972). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="971">Page 409 U.S. 968 , 971</a></p><p> Denial of their petition in my view constitutes a travesty of justice. As Judge Tuttle stated in his dissent: </p><ul>\'. . . I do not hesitate to assert the proposition that the only way law has progressed from the days of the rack, the screw and the wheel is the development of moral concepts, or as stated by the Supreme Court in Trop v. Dulles, the application of \'evolving standards of decency." Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d, at 672.4</ul> <p> I would grant this petition and put the case down for argument. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> On the 9th of June 1972 the TDC revised their regulations on the lighting and diet.</p><ul>\'50.92322 Lighting.</ul><ul>\'The solid door of the solitary cell will be left open.
