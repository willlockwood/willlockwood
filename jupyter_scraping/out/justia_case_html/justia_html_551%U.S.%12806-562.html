Section 107(a) defines four categories of potentially responsible parties (PRPs) and makes them liable for, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9c(A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c(B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with [such] plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B).  Originally, some courts interpreted \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) as providing a cause of action for a private party to recover voluntarily incurred response costs and to seek contribution after having been sued.  However, after the enactment of \xc2\xa7113(f), which authorizes one PRP to sue another for contribution, many courts held it to be the exclusive remedy for PRPs.  In <em>Cooper Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Aviall Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/157/index.html">543 U. S. 157</a>, 161, this Court held that a private party could seek contribution under \xc2\xa7113(f) only after being sued under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After respondent Atlantic Research cleaned up a Government site it leased and contaminated while doing Government work, it sued the Government to recover some of its costs under, as relevant here, \xc2\xa7107(a).  The District Court dismissed the case, but the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that \xc2\xa7113(f) does not provide the exclusive remedy for recovering cleanup costs and that \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) provided a cause of action to any person other than those permitted to sue under \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(A). </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms allow a PRP to recover costs from other PRPs, the statute provides Atlantic Research with a cause of action.

S. 215</a>, 221, subparagraph (B)\xe2\x80\x99s language can be understood only with reference to subparagraph (A).  The provisions are adjacent and have similar structures, and the text denotes a relationship between them.  Subparagraph (B)\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother necessary costs\xe2\x80\x9d refers to and differentiates the relevant costs from those listed in subparagraph (A).  Thus, it is natural to read the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d by referring to the immediately preceding subparagraph (A).  Accepting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to a person not identified as a PRP in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4)\xe2\x80\x94would destroy the symmetry of subparagraphs (A) and (B) and render subparagraph (B) internally confusing.  Moreover, because the statute defines PRPs so broadly as to sweep in virtually all persons likely to incur cleanup costs, accepting that interpretation would reduce the number of potential plaintiffs to almost zero, rendering subparagraph (B) a dead letter.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, this interpretation will not create friction between \xc2\xa7107(a) and \xc2\xa7113(f).  Their two clearly distinct remedies complement each other: \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) authorizes a contribution action to PRPs with common liability stemming from an action instituted under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a), while \xc2\xa7107(a) permits cost recovery (as distinct from contribution) by a private party that has itself incurred cleanup costs.  Thus, at least in the case of reimbursement, a PRP cannot choose \xc2\xa7107(a)\xe2\x80\x99s longer statute of limitations for recovery actions over \xc2\xa7113(f)\xe2\x80\x99s shorter one for contribution claims.  Similarly, a PRP could not avoid \xc2\xa7113(f)\xe2\x80\x99s equitable distribution of reimbursement costs among PRPs by instead choosing to impose joint and several liability under \xc2\xa7107(a).  That choice of remedies simply does not exist, and in any event, a defendant PRP in a \xc2\xa7107(a) suit could blunt any such distribution by filing a \xc2\xa7113(f) counterclaim.  Finally, permitting PRPs to seek recovery under \xc2\xa7107(a) will not eviscerate \xc2\xa7113(f)(2), which prohibits \xc2\xa7113(f) contribution claims against \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State in an administrative or judicially approved settlement \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although that settlement bar does not by its terms protect against \xc2\xa7107(a) cost-recovery liability, a district court applying traditional equity rules would undoubtedly consider any prior settlement in the liability calculus; the settlement bar continues to provide significant protection from contribution suits by PRPs that have inequitably reimbursed costs incurred by another party; and settlement carries the inherent benefit of finally resolving liability as to the United States or a State.

See <em>Cooper Industries, supra</em>, at 161\xe2\x80\x93162 (collecting cases); <em>Key Tronic Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/809/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/809/index.html">511 U.

As a result, many Courts of Appeals held that \xc2\xa7113(f) was the exclusive remedy for PRPs.  See <em>Cooper Industries, supra</em>, at 169 (collecting cases).  But as courts prevented PRPs from suing under \xc2\xa7107(a), they expanded \xc2\xa7113(f) to allow PRPs to seek \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d even in the absence of a suit under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a).  <em>Aviall Servs., Inc.</em> v. <em>Cooper Industries, Inc.</em>, 312 F.\xc2\xa03d 677, 681 (CA5 2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Cooper Industries</em>, we held that a private party could seek contribution from other liable parties only after having been sued under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a).  543 U.

This narrower interpretation of \xc2\xa7113(f) caused several Courts of Appeals to reconsider whether PRPs have rights under \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B), an issue we declined to address in <em>Cooper Industries</em>.  <em>Id.</em>, at 168.  After revisiting the issue, some courts have permitted \xc2\xa7107(a) actions by PRPs.  See <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em> v. <em>UGI Utilities, Inc.</em>, 423 F.\xc2\xa03d 90 (CA2 2005); <em>Metropolitan Water Reclamation Dist. of Greater Chicago</em> v. <em>North American Galvanizing &amp; Coatings, Inc.</em>, 473 F.\xc2\xa03d 824 (CA7 2007).

Today, we resolve this issue.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, respondent Atlantic Research leased property at the Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot, a facility operated by the Department of Defense.  At the site, Atlantic Research retrofitted rocket motors for petitioner United States.  Using a high-pressure water spray, Atlantic Research removed pieces of propellant from the motors.  It then burned the propellant pieces.  Some of the resultant wastewater and burned fuel contaminated soil and groundwater at the site.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Atlantic Research cleaned the site at its own expense and then sought to recover some of its costs by suing the United States under both \xc2\xa7107(a) and \xc2\xa7113(f).  After our decision in <em>Cooper Industries</em> foreclosed relief under \xc2\xa7113(f), Atlantic Research amended its complaint to seek relief under \xc2\xa7107(a) and federal common law.  The United States moved to dismiss, arguing that \xc2\xa7107(a) does not allow PRPs (such as Atlantic Research) to recover costs.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss, relying on a case decided prior to our decision in <em>Cooper Industries</em>, <em>Dico, Inc.</em> v. <em>Amoco Oil Co.</em>, 340 F.\xc2\xa03d 525 (CA8 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.  Recognizing that <em>Cooper Industries</em> undermined the reasoning of its prior precedent, 459 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 830,  n.\xc2\xa04, the Court of Appeals joined the Second and Seventh Circuits in holding that \xc2\xa7113(f) does not provide \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusive route by which [PRPs] may recover cleanup costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 834 (citing <em>Consolidated Edison Co.</em>,<em> supra</em>).  The court reasoned that \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) authorized suit by any person other than the persons permitted to sue under \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(A).  459 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 835.  Accordingly, it held that \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) provides a cause of action to Atlantic Research.  To prevent perceived conflict between \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) and \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), the Court of Appeals reasoned that PRPs that \xe2\x80\x9chave been subject to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7106 or 107 enforcement actions are still required to use \xc2\xa7113, thereby ensuring its continued vitality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 836\xe2\x80\x93837.  We granted certiorari, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), and now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute centers on what \xe2\x80\x9cother person[s]\xe2\x80\x9d may sue under \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B).  The Government argues that \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d refers to any person not identified as a PRP in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In other words, subparagraph (B) permits suit only by non-PRPs and thus bars Atlantic Research\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Atlantic Research counters that subparagraph (B) takes its cue from subparagraph (A), not the earlier paragraph (1)\xe2\x80\x93(4).  In accord with the Court of Appeals, Atlantic Research believes that subparagraph (B) provides a cause of action to anyone except the United States, a State, or an Indian tribe\xe2\x80\x94the persons listed in subparagraph (A).  We agree with Atlantic\nResearch.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Statutes must \xe2\x80\x9cbe read as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>King</em> v. <em>St. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/215/index.html">502 U. S. 215</a>, 221 (1991).  Applying that maxim, the language of suparagraph (B) can be understood only with reference to subparagraph (A).  The provisions are adjacent and have remarkably similar structures.  Each concerns certain costs that have been incurred by certain entities and that bear a specified relationship to the national contingency plan.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Bolstering the structural link, the text also denotes a relationship between the two provisions.  By using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother necessary costs,\xe2\x80\x9d subparagraph (B) refers to and differentiates the relevant costs from those listed in subparagraph (A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of the relationship between the subparagraph, it is natural to read the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d by referring to the immediately preceding subparagraph (A), which permits suit only by the United States, a State, or an Indian tribe.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d therefore means any person other than those three.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79601(21) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to include the United States and the various States).  Consequently, the plain language of subparagraph (B) authorizes cost-recovery actions by any private party, including PRPs.  See <em>Key Tronic</em>, 511 U. S., at 818 (stating in dictum that \xc2\xa7107 \xe2\x80\x9cimpliedly authorizes private parties to recover cleanup costs from <em>other</em> PRP[s]\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation makes little textual sense.  In subparagraph (B), the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other necessary costs\xe2\x80\x9d and the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d both refer to antecedents\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94located in some previous statutory provision.  Although \xe2\x80\x9cany other necessary costs\xe2\x80\x9d clearly references the costs in subparagraph (A), the Government would inexplicably interpret \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d to refer not to the persons listed in subparagraph (A) but to the persons listed as PRPs in paragraphs (1)\xe2\x80\x93(4).  Nothing in the text of \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) suggests an intent to refer to antecedents located in two different statutory provisions.  Reading the statute in the manner suggested by the Government would destroy the symmetry of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(A) and (B) and render subparagraph (B) internally confusing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the statute defines PRPs so broadly as to sweep in virtually all persons likely to incur cleanup costs.  Hence, if PRPs do not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B), it is unclear what private party would.  The Government posits that \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) authorizes relief for \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent\xe2\x80\x9d private parties\xe2\x80\x94for instance, a landowner whose land has been contaminated by another.  But even parties not responsible for contamination may fall within the broad definitions of PRPs in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4).  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79607(a)(1) (listing \xe2\x80\x9cthe owner and operator of a \xe2\x80\xa6 facility\xe2\x80\x9d as a PRP); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alcan Aluminum Corp.</em>, 315 F.\xc2\xa03d 179, 184 (CA2 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cCERCLA \xc2\xa79607 is a strict liability statute\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the text logically precludes all PRPs, innocent or not, from recovering cleanup costs.  Accordingly, accepting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would reduce the number of potential plaintiffs to almost zero, rendering \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) a dead letter.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co.</em> v. <em>Mottley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/219/467/index.html">219 U. S. 467</a>, 475 (1911) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have regard to all the words used by Congress, and as far as possible give effect to them\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Government, our interpretation suffers from the same infirmity because it causes the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d to duplicate work done by other text.  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other necessary costs\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9calready precludes governmental entities from recovering under\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B).  Brief for United States 20.  Even assuming the Government is correct, it does not alter our conclusion.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other person\xe2\x80\x9d performs a significant function simply by clarifying that subparagraph (B) excludes the persons enumerated in subparagraph (A).  In any event, our hesitancy to construe statutes to render language superfluous does not require us to avoid surplusage at all costs.  It is appropriate to tolerate a degree of surplusage rather than adopt a textually dubious construction that threatens to render the entire provision a nullity.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government also argues that our interpretation will create friction between \xc2\xa7107(a) and \xc2\xa7113(f), the very harm courts of appeals have previously tried to avoid.  In particular, the Government maintains that our interpretation, by offering PRPs a choice between \xc2\xa7107(a) and \xc2\xa7113(f), effectively allows PRPs to circumvent \xc2\xa7113(f)\xe2\x80\x99s shorter statute of limitations.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79613(g)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  Furthermore, the Government argues, PRPs will eschew equitable apportionment under \xc2\xa7113(f) in favor of joint and several liability under \xc2\xa7107(a).  Finally, the Government contends that our interpretation eviscerates the settlement bar set forth in \xc2\xa7113(f)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have previously recognized that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107(a) and 113(f) provide two \xe2\x80\x9cclearly distinct\xe2\x80\x9d remedies.  <em>Cooper Industries</em>, 543 U.

The Government, however, uses the word \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d as if it were synonymous with any apportionment of expenses among PRPs.  Brief for United States 33, n.\xc2\xa014 (\xe2\x80\x9cContribution is merely a form of cost recovery, not a wholly independent type of relief\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pinal Creek Group</em> v. <em>Newmont Mining Corp.</em>, 118 F.\xc2\xa03d 1298, 1301 (CA9 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause all PRPs are liable under the statute, a claim by one PRP against another PRP necessarily is for contribution\xe2\x80\x9d).  This imprecise usage confuses the complementary yet distinct nature of the rights established in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107(a) and 113(f).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 113(f) explicitly grants PRPs a right to contribution.  Contribution is defined as the \xe2\x80\x9ctortfeasor\xe2\x80\x99s right to collect from others responsible for the same tort after the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate share, the shares being determined as a percentage of fault.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 353 (8th ed. 1999).  Nothing in \xc2\xa7113(f) suggests that Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d in anything other than this traditional sense.  The statute authorizes a PRP to seek contribution \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d a suit under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a).  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79613(f)(1).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Thus, \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) permits suit before or after the establishment of common liability.  In either case, a PRP\xe2\x80\x99s right to contribution under \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) is contingent upon an inequitable distribution of common liability among liable parties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, \xc2\xa7107(a) permits recovery of cleanup costs but does not create a right to contribution.<font b="1">  A private party may recover under \xc2\xa7107(a) without any establishment of liability to a third party.  Moreover, \xc2\xa7107(a) permits a PRP to recover only the costs it has \xe2\x80\x9cincurred\xe2\x80\x9d in cleaning up a site.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79607(a)(4)(B).  When a party pays to satisfy a settlement agreement or a court judgment, it does not incur its own costs of response.  Rather, it reimburses other parties for costs that those parties incurred.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the remedies available in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107(a) and 113(f) complement each other by providing causes of action \xe2\x80\x9cto persons in different procedural circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Consolidated Edison</em>, 423 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 99; see also <em>E.\xe2\x80\x82I. Dupont de Nemours</em>, 460 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 548 (Sloviter, J., dissenting).  Section 113(f)(1) authorizes a contribution action to PRPs with common liability stemming from an action instituted under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a).  And \xc2\xa7107(a) permits cost recovery (as distinct from contribution) by a private party that has itself incurred cleanup costs.  Hence, a PRP that pays money to satisfy a settlement agreement or a court judgment may pursue \xc2\xa7113(f) contribution.  But by reimbursing response costs paid by other parties, the PRP has not incurred its own costs of response and therefore cannot recover under \xc2\xa7107(a).  As a result, though eligible to seek contribution under \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), the PRP cannot simultaneously seek to recover the same expenses under \xc2\xa7107(a).  Thus, at least in the case of reimbursement, the PRP cannot choose the 6-year statute of limitations for cost-recovery actions over the shorter limitations period for \xc2\xa7113(f) contribution claims.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For similar reasons, a PRP could not avoid \xc2\xa7113(f)\xe2\x80\x99s equitable distribution of reimbursement costs among PRPs by instead choosing to impose joint and several liability on another PRP in an action under \xc2\xa7107(a).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The choice of remedies simply does not exist.  In any event, a defendant PRP in such a \xc2\xa7107(a) suit could blunt any inequitable distribution of costs by filing a \xc2\xa7113(f) counterclaim.  459 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 835; see also <em>Consolidated Edison, supra</em>, at 100, n.\xc2\xa09 (collecting cases).  Resolution of a \xc2\xa7113(f) counter-claim would necessitate the equitable apportionment of costs among the liable parties, including the PRP that filed the \xc2\xa7107(a) action.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79613(f)(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, permitting PRPs to seek recovery under \xc2\xa7107(a) will not eviscerate the settlement bar set forth in \xc2\xa7113(f)(2).  That provision prohibits \xc2\xa7113(f) contribution claims against \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State in an administrative or judicially approved settlement \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79613(f)(2).  The settlement bar does not by its terms protect against cost-recovery liability under \xc2\xa7107(a).  For several reasons, we doubt this supposed loophole would discourage settlement.  First, as stated above, a defendant PRP may trigger equitable apportionment by filing a \xc2\xa7113(f) counterclaim.  A district court applying traditional rules of equity would undoubtedly consider any prior settlement as part of the liability calculus.  Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7886A(2), p. 337 (1977) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo tortfeasor can be required to make contribution beyond his own equitable share of the liability\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, the settlement bar continues to provide significant protection from contribution suits by PRPs that have inequitably reimbursed the costs incurred by another party.  Third, settlement carries the inherent benefit of finally resolving liability as to the United States or a State.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the plain terms of \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) allow a PRP to recover costs from other PRPs, the statute provides Atlantic Research with a cause of action.

Prior to 2002, however, the statute made this small set of persons liable as PRPs.  Accordingly, even if BFPPs now give some life to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B), it would be implausible at best to conclude that \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) lay dormant until the enactment of \xc2\xa7107(r)(1) in 2002.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Similarly, \xc2\xa7113(f)(3)(B) permits a PRP to seek contribution after it \xe2\x80\x9chas resolved its liability to the United States or a State \xe2\x80\xa6 in an administrative or judicially approved settlement \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

For instance, we recognize that a PRP may sustain expenses pursuant to a consent decree following a suit under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a).  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United Technologies Corp.</em> v. <em>Browning-Ferris Industries</em>, Inc., 33 F.\xc2\xa03d 96, 97 (CA1 1994).  In such a case, the PRP does not incur costs voluntarily but does not reimburse the costs of another party.  We do not decide whether these compelled costs of response are recoverable under \xc2\xa7113(f), \xc2\xa7107(a), or both.  For our purposes, it suffices to demonstrate that costs incurred voluntarily are recoverable only by way of \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B), and costs of reimbursement to another person pursuant to a legal judgment or settlement are recoverable only under \xc2\xa7113(f).
