Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html">418 U.S. 87</a> (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioner must be given an opportunity to have his case decided on, and introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which his conviction has ultimately come to depend. Thus, even on its own terms, the Court should vacate the judgment below and remand for a determination whether petitioner should be afforded a new trial under local community standards. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] Although four of us would grant and reverse, the Justices who join this opinion do not insist that the case be decided on the merits. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
