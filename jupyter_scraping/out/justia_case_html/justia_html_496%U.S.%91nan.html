There also has been no finding, and there is no basis for the belief, that Peel\'s representation generally would be associated with governmental action.  The public understands that licenses are issued by governmental authorities and that many certificates are issued by private organizations, and it is unlikely that the public necessarily would confuse certification as a "specialist" by a national organization with formal state recognition.

The letterhead is potentially misleading because NBTA\'s name could give the impression to nonlawyers that the organization is a federal government agency; the juxtaposition of the references to Peel\'s state licenses to practice law and to his certification by the NBTA may lead individuals to believe that the NBTA is somehow sanctioned by the States; and the reference to NBTA certification may cause people to think that Peel is necessarily a better trial lawyer than attorneys without certification, because facts as well as opinions may be misleading when they are presented without adequate information.  A State could require a lawyer to provide additional information in order to prevent a claim of NBTA certification from being misleading.  A State may require, for example, that the letterhead include a disclaimer stating that the NBTA is a private organization not affiliated with or sanctioned by the State or Federal Government, or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 496 U.

[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>This case comes to us against a background of growing interest in lawyer certification programs.  In the 1973 Sonnett Memorial Lecture, then Chief Justice Warren E. Burger advanced the proposition that specialized training and certification of trial advocates is essential to the American system of justice. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  That proposition was endorsed by a number of groups of lawyers [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] who were instrumental in establishing the National Board of Trial Advocacy (NBTA) in 1977. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 496 U. S. 95</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Since then, NBTA has developed a set of standards and procedures for periodic certification of lawyers with experience and competence in trial work.  Those standards, which have been approved by a board of judges, scholars, and practitioners, are objective and demanding.  They require specified experience as lead counsel in both jury and nonjury trials, participation in approved programs of continuing legal education, a demonstration of writing skills, and the successful completion of a day-long examination.  Certification expires in five years unless the lawyer again demonstrates his or her continuing qualification. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>NBTA certification has been described as a "highly-structured" and "arduous process that employs a wide range of assessment methods."  Task Force on Lawyer Competence, Report With Findings and Recommendations to The Conference of Chief Justices, Publication No. NCSC-021, pp. 33-34 (May 26, 1982).  After reviewing NBTA.\'s procedures, the Supreme Court of Minnesota found that</p>\n<p>"NBTA applies a rigorous and exacting set of standards and examinations on a national scale before certifying a lawyer as a trial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="96">Page 496 U. S. 96</a></p><p> specialist."</p>\n<p><em>In re Johnson,</em> 341 N.W.2d 282, 283 (Minn. 1983).  The Alabama Supreme Court similarly concluded that</p>\n<p>"a certification of specialty by NBTA would indicate a level of expertise with regard to trial advocacy in excess of the level of expertise required for admission to the bar generally."</p>\n<p><em>Ex parte Nowell,</em> 487 So.2d 848, 851 (Ala.1986).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner practices law in Edwardsville, Illinois.  He was licensed to practice in Illinois in 1968, in Arizona in 1979, and in Missouri in 1981.  He has served as president of the Madison County Bar Association, and has been active in both national and state bar association work. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  He has tried to verdict over 100 jury trials and over 300 nonjury trials, and has participated in hundreds of other litigated matters that were settled.  NBTA issued petitioner a "Certificate in Civil Trial Advocacy" in 1981, renewed it in 1986, and listed him in its 1985 Directory of "Certified Specialists and Board Members." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Since 1983, petitioner\'s professional letterhead has contained a statement referring to his NBTA certification and to the three States in which he is licensed.  It appears as follows:</p>\n<p>"Gary E. Peel"</p>\n<p>"Certified Civil Trial Specialist"</p>\n<p>"By the National Board of Trial Advocacy"</p>\n<p>"Licensed: Illinois, Missouri, Arizona [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 496 U. S. 97</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In 1987, the Administrator of the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of Illinois (Commission) filed a complaint alleging that petitioner, by use of this letterhead, was publicly holding himself out as a certified legal specialist in violation of Rule 2-105(a)(3) of the Illinois Code of Professional Responsibility.  That Rule provides:</p>\n<p>"A lawyer or law firm may specify or designate any area or field of law in which he or its partners concentrates or limits his or its practice.  Except as set forth in Rule 2-105(a), no lawyer may hold himself out as \'certified\' or a \'specialist.\' [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]"</p>\n<p>The complaint also alleged violations of Rule 2-101(b), which requires that a lawyer\'s public</p>\n<p>"communication shall contain all information necessary to make the communication not misleading and shall not contain any false or misleading statement or otherwise operate to deceive,"</p>\n<p>and of Rule 1-102(a)(1), which generally subjects a lawyer to discipline for violation of any Rule of the Code of Professional Responsibility.  Disciplinary Rule 2-101(b), 1102(a)(1) (1988).</p>\n<p>After a hearing, the Commission recommended censure for a violation of Rule 2-105(a)(3).  It rejected petitioner\'s First Amendment claim that a reference to a lawyer\'s certification as a specialist was a form of commercial speech that could not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 496 U. S. 98</a></p><p> be "<em>subjected to blanket suppression.\'"  Report of the Hearing Panel, App. C to Pet. for Cert. 19a.  Although the Commission\'s "Findings of Facts" did not contain any statement as to whether petitioner\'s representation was deceptive, its "Conclusion of Law" ended with the brief statement that petitioner,\n</em></p>\n<p>"by holding himself out, on his letterhead as \'Gary E. Peel, Certified Civil Trial Specialist -- By the National Board of Trial Advocacy,\' is in direct violation of the above cited Rule [2-105(a)(3)]."</p>\n<p>"We hold it is \'misleading\' as our Supreme Court has never recognized or approved any certification process."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 20a.</p>\n<p>The Illinois Supreme Court adopted the Commission\'s recommendation for censure.  It held that the First Amendment did not protect petitioner\'s letterhead because the letterhead was misleading in three ways.  First, the State Supreme Court concluded that the juxtaposition of the reference to petitioner as "certified" by NBTA and the reference to him as "licensed" by Illinois, Missouri, and Arizona "could" mislead the general public into a belief that petitioner\'s authority to practice in the field of trial advocacy was derived solely from NBTA certification.  It thus found that the statements on the letterhead impinged on the court\'s exclusive authority to license its attorneys because they failed to distinguish voluntary certification by an unofficial group from licensure by an official organization.  <em>In re Peel,</em> 126 Ill.2d 397, 405-406, 128 Ill.Dec. 535, 538-539, 534 N.E.2d 980, 983-984 (1989).</p>\n<p>Second, the court characterized the claim of NBTA certification as "misleading because it tacitly attests to the qualifications of [petitioner] as a civil trial advocate."  <em>Id.</em> at 406, 128 Ill.Dec. at 539, 534 N.E.2d at 984.  The court noted confusion in the parties\' descriptions of the NBTA\'s requirements, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] but did not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="99">Page 496 U. S. 99</a></p><p> consider whether NBTA certification constituted reliable, verifiable evidence of petitioner\'s experience as a civil trial advocate.  Rather, the court reasoned that the statement was tantamount to an implied claim of superiority of the quality of petitioner\'s legal services and therefore warranted restriction under our decision in <em>In re R.M.J.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html">455 U. S. 191</a></span> (1982).  126 Ill.2d at 406, 128 Ill.Dec. at 539, 534 N.E.2d at 984.</p>\n<p>Finally, the court reasoned that use of the term "specialist" was misleading because it incorrectly implied that Illinois had formally authorized certification of specialists in trial advocacy.  The court concluded that the conjunction of the reference to being a specialist with the reference to being licensed implied that the former was the product of the latter.  <em>Id.</em> at 410, 128 Ill.Dec. at 541, 534 N.E.2d at 986.  Concluding that the letterhead was inherently misleading for these reasons, the court upheld the blanket prohibition of Rule 2105(a) under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Illinois Supreme Court considered petitioner\'s letterhead as a form of commercial speech governed by the "constitutional limitations on the regulation of lawyer advertising."  126 Ill.2d at 402, 128 Ill.Dec. at 538, 534 N.E.2d at 982.  The only use of the letterhead in the record is in petitioner\'s correspondence with the Commission itself.  Petitioner contends that, absent evidence of any use of the letterhead to propose commercial transactions with potential clients, the statement should be accorded the full protections of noncommercial speech.  However, he also acknowledges that "this case can and should be decided on the narrower ground that, even if it is commercial speech, it cannot be categorically prohibited."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  We agree that the question to be decided </p><p><a class="page-number" name="100">Page 496 U. S. 100</a></p><p> is whether a lawyer has a constitutional right, under the standards applicable to commercial speech, to advertise his or her certification as a trial specialist by NBTA.</p>\n<p>In <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html">433 U. S. 350</a></span> (1977), this Court decided that advertising by lawyers was a form of commercial speech entitled to protection by the First Amendment.  Justice Powell summarized the standards applicable to such claims for the unanimous Court in <em>In re R.M.J.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html">455 U. S. 191</a></span> (1982):</p>\n<p>"Truthful advertising related to lawful activities is entitled to the protections of the First Amendment.  But when the particular content or method of the advertising suggests that it is inherently misleading or when experience has proved that in fact such advertising is subject to abuse, the States may impose appropriate restrictions.  Misleading advertising may be prohibited entirely.  <em>But the States may not place an absolute prohibition on certain types of potentially misleading information, e.g., a listing of areas of practice, if the information also may be presented in a way that is not deceptive. . . . </em>"</p>\n<p>"Even when a communication is not misleading, the State retains some authority to regulate.  But the State must assert a substantial interest and the interference with speech must be in proportion to the interest served."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#203">455 U. S. 203</a></span> (emphasis added).  In this case we must consider whether petitioner\'s statement was misleading and, even if it was not, whether the potentially misleading character of such statements creates a state interest sufficiently substantial to justify a categorical ban on their use.</p>\n<p>The facts stated on petitioner\'s letterhead are true and verifiable.  It is undisputed that NBTA has certified petitioner as a civil trial specialist and that three States have licensed him to practice law.  There is no contention that any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 496 U. S. 101</a></p><p> potential client or person was actually misled or deceived by petitioner\'s stationery.  Neither the Commission nor the State Supreme Court made any factual finding of actual deception or misunderstanding, but rather concluded, as a matter of law, that petitioner\'s claims of being "certified" as a "specialist" were necessarily misleading absent an official state certification program.  Notably, although petitioner was originally charged with a violation of Disciplinary Rule 2101(b), which aims at misleading statements by an attorney, his letterhead was not found to violate this rule.</p>\n<p>In evaluating petitioner\'s claim of certification, the Illinois Supreme Court focused not on its facial accuracy, but on its implied claim "as to the quality of [petitioner\'s] legal services," and concluded that such a qualitative claim "<em>might be so likely to mislead as to warrant restriction.\'"  126 Ill.2d at 406, 128 Ill.Dec. at 540, 534 N.E.2d at 984 (quoting <em>In re R.M.J.,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#201">455 U. S. 201</a></span>).  This analysis confuses the distinction between statements of opinion or quality and statements of objective facts that may support an inference of quality.  A lawyer\'s certification by NBTA is a verifiable fact, as are the predicate requirements for that certification.  Measures of trial experience and hours of continuing education, like information about what schools the lawyer attended or his or her bar activities, are facts about a lawyer\'s training and practice.  A claim of certification is not an unverifiable opinion of the ultimate quality of a lawyer\'s work or a promise of success, <em>cf. In re R.M.J.,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#201">455 U. S. 201</a></span>, n. 14, but is simply a fact, albeit one with multiple predicates from which a consumer may or may not draw an inference of the likely quality of an attorney\'s work in a given area of practice.

S. 102</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>We must assume that some consumers will infer from petitioner\'s statement that his qualifications in the area of civil trial advocacy exceed the general qualifications for admission to a state bar.  Thus if the certification had been issued by an organization that had made no inquiry into petitioner\'s fitness, or by one that issued certificates indiscriminately for a price, the statement, even if true, could be misleading.  In this case, there is no evidence that a claim of NBTA certification suggests any greater degree of professional qualification than reasonably may be inferred from an evaluation of its rigorous requirements.  Much like a trademark, the strength of a certification is measured by the quality of the organization for which it stands.  The Illinois Supreme Court merely notes some confusion in the parties\' explanation of one of those requirements.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F9" name="T9">n</a> 9, <em>supra.</em>  We find NBTA standards objectively clear, and, in any event, do not see why the degree of uncertainty identified by the State Supreme Court would make the letterhead inherently misleading to a consumer.  A number of other States have their own certification plans and expressly authorize references to specialists and certification, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] but there is no evidence that the consumers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 496 U. S. 103</a></p><p> in any of these States are misled if they do not inform themselves of the precise standards under which claims of certification are allowed.</p>\n<p>Nor can we agree with the Illinois Supreme Court\'s somewhat contradictory fears that juxtaposition of the references to being "certified" as a "specialist" with the identification of the three States in which petitioner is "licensed" conveys, on the one hand, the impression that NBTA had the authority to grant those licenses and, on the other, that the NBTA certification was the product of official state action.  The separate character of the two references is plain from their texts:  one statement begins with the verb "[c]ertified" and identifies the source as the "<em>National</em> Board of Trial Advocacy," while the second statement begins with the verb "[l]icensed" and identifies <em>States</em> as the source of licensure.  The references are further distinguished by the fact that one is indented below petitioner\'s name while the other uses the same margin as his name.  <em>See supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#96">496 U.

The dictionary definition of "certificate," from which the Illinois </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 496 U. S. 104</a></p><p> Supreme Court quoted only excerpts, comports with this common understanding:</p>\n<p>"[A] document issued by <em>a school,</em> a state agency, <em>or a professional organization</em> certifying that one has satisfactorily <em>completed a course of studies, has passed a qualifying examination, or has</em> attained professional standing in a given field and may officially practice or hold a position in that field."</p>\n<p>Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 367 (1986 ed.) (emphasis added to portions omitted from 126 Ill.2d at 405, 128 Ill. Dec. at 539, 534 N.E.2d at 984).</p>\n<p>The court relied on a similarly cramped definition of "specialist," turning from Webster\'s -- which contains no suggestion of state approval of "specialists" -- to the American Bar Association\'s Comment to Model Rule 7.4, which prohibits a lawyer from stating or implying that he is a "specialist" except for designations of patent, admiralty, or state-designated specialties.  The Comment to the Rule concludes that the terms "specialist" and "specialty" "have acquired a secondary meaning implying formal recognition as a specialist and, therefore, use of these terms is misleading" in States that have no formal certification procedures.  ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 7.4 and Comment (1989).  We appreciate the difficulties that evolving standards for attorney certification present to national organizations like the ABA. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  However, it seems unlikely that petitioner\'s statement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 496 U. S. 105</a></p><p> about his certification as a "specialist" by an identified national organization necessarily would be confused with formal state recognition.  The Federal Trade Commission, which has a long history of reviewing claims of deceptive advertising, fortifies this conclusion with its observation that</p>\n<p>"one can readily think of numerous other claims of specialty -- from \'air conditioning specialist\' in the realm of home repairs to \'foreign car specialist\' in the realm of automotive repairs -- that cast doubt on the notion that the public would automatically mistake a claim of specialization for a claim of formal recognition by the State."</p>\n<p>Brief for Federal Trade Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 24.</p>\n<p>We reject the paternalistic assumption that the recipients of petitioner\'s letterhead are no more discriminating than the audience for children\'s television.  <em>Cf.

Justice O\'CONNOR\'s dissent urges that "we should be more deferential" to the State, asserting without explanation that "the Supreme Court of Illinois is in a far better position than is this Court to determine which statements are misleading or likely to mislead." [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Whether the inherent character of a statement places it beyond the protection of the First Amendment is a question of law over which Members of this Court should exercise <em>de novo</em> review.  <em>Cf.

That the judgment below is by a State Supreme Court exercising review over the actions of its State Bar Commission does not insulate it from our review for constitutional infirmity.  <em>See, e.g., Baird v.

The Commission\'s authority is necessarily constrained by the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and specifically by the principle that disclosure of truthful, relevant information is more likely to make a positive contribution to decisionmaking than is concealment of such information.  <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board v.

Even if we assume that petitioner\'s letterhead may be potentially misleading to some consumers, that potential does not satisfy the State\'s heavy burden of justifying a categorical prohibition against the dissemination of accurate factual information to the public.  <em>In re R.M.J.,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#203">455 U.

As we noted in <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html">433 U.

A lawyer\'s truthful statement that "XYZ Board" has "certified" him as a "specialist in admiralty law" would not necessarily be entitled to First Amendment protection if the certification was a sham.  States can require an attorney who advertises "XYZ certification" to demonstrate that such certification is available to all lawyers who meet objective and consistently applied standards relevant to practice in a particular area of the law.  There has been no showing -- indeed no suggestion -- that the burden of distinguishing between certifying boards that are bona fide and those that are bogus would be significant, or that bar associations and official disciplinary committees cannot police deceptive practices effectively.  <em>Cf.

To the extent that potentially misleading statements of private certification or specialization could confuse consumers, a State might consider screening certifying organizations or requiring a disclaimer about the certifying organization or the standards of a specialty.  <em>In re R.M.J.,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#201">455 U.

[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  A State may not, however, completely ban statements that are not actually or inherently misleading, such as certification as a specialist by bona fide organizations such as NBTA.  <em>Cf. In re Johnson,</em> 341 N.W.2d at 283 (striking down the Disciplinary Rule that prevented statements of being "<em>a specialist unless and until the Minnesota Supreme Court adopts or authorizes rules or regulations permitting him to do so\'").

There is no dispute about the <em>bona fides</em> and the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 496 U. S. 111</a></p><p> relevance of NBTA certification.  The Commission\'s concern about the possibility of deception in hypothetical cases is not sufficient to rebut the constitutional presumption favoring disclosure over concealment.  Disclosure of information such as that on petitioner\'s letterhead both serves the public interest and encourages the development and utilization of meritorious certification programs for attorneys.

We found that the advertisement of admission to the Bar of this Court could not be banned, despite recognition that "this relatively uninformative fact is at least bad taste" and "could be misleading to the general public unfamiliar with the requirements of admission to the Bar of this Court."  <em>In re R.M.J.,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#205">455 U.

We agree with Justice MARSHALL that a holding that a total ban is unconstitutional does not necessarily preclude less restrictive regulation of commercial speech.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Bates v.

A principal reason why consumers do not consult lawyers is because they do not know how to find a lawyer able to assist them with their particular problems.  Federal Trade Commission, Staff Report on Improving Consumer Access to Legal Services:  The Case for Removing Restrictions of Truthful Advertising 1 (1984).

I therefore concur in the plurality\'s holding that Illinois may not prohibit petitioner from holding himself out as a civil trial specialist certified by the National Board of Trial Advocacy.  I believe, though, that petitioner\'s letterhead statement is potentially misleading.  Accordingly, I would hold that Illinois may enact regulations other than a total ban to ensure that the public is not misled by such representations.  Because Illinois\' present regulation is unconstitutional as applied to petitioner, however, the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>The scope of permissible regulation depends on the nature of the commercial speech in question.  States may prohibit actually or inherently misleading commercial speech entirely.  <em>In re R.M.J.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html">455 U.

They may not, however, ban potentially misleading commercial speech if narrower limitations could be crafted to ensure that the information is presented in a nonmisleading manner.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>I agree with the plurality that petitioner\'s reference to his NBTA certification as a civil trial specialist is not actually </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 496 U.

The record contains no evidence that any recipient of petitioner\'s stationery actually has been misled by the statement.  I also believe that petitioner\'s letterhead statement is not inherently misleading such that it may be banned outright.  The Court has upheld such a ban only when the particular method by which the information is imparted to consumers is inherently conducive to deception and coercion.  In <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html">436 U. S. 447</a></span> (1978), the Court upheld a prophylactic ban on a lawyer\'s in-person solicitation of clients for pecuniary gain because such solicitation "is inherently conducive to overreaching and other forms of misconduct."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html#464">436 U. S. 464</a></span>.  A statement on a letterhead, however, does not raise the same concerns as face-to-face barratry, because the recipient of a letter does not have "a badgering advocate breathing down his neck" and can take time to reflect on the information provided to him.  <em>Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/466/case.html">486 U. S. 466</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/466/case.html#475">486 U. S. 475</a></span>-476 (1988).  The Court has also suggested that commercial speech that is devoid of intrinsic meaning may be inherently misleading, especially if such speech historically has been used to deceive the public.  <em>In re R.M.J., supra,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#202">455 U.

S. 1</a></span> (1979), which upheld a ban on the use of trade names by optometrists).  The statement about petitioner\'s NBTA certification does not fit this category, as it does impart some information and as the State has made no showing that similar claims have been used to deceive.  Illinois therefore may not prohibit petitioner from including the statement in his letterhead.</p>\n<p>The statement is nonetheless <em>potentially</em> misleading.  The name "National Board of Trial Advocacy" could create the misimpression that the NBTA is an agency of the Federal Government.  Although most lawyers undoubtedly know that the Federal Government does not regulate lawyers, most nonlawyers probably do not; thus, the word "National" in the NBTA\'s name does not dispel the potential implication </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 496 U. S. 113</a></p><p> that the NBTA is a governmental agency.  Furthermore, the juxtaposition on petitioner\'s letterhead of the phrase "Certified Civil Trial Specialist By the National Board of Trial Advocacy" with "Licensed:  Illinois, Missouri, Arizona" could lead even lawyers to believe that the NBTA, though not a governmental agency, is somehow sanctioned by the States listed on the letterhead.  <em>Cf. post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#123">496 U. S. 123</a></span> (O\'CONNOR, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The plurality\'s assertion that the letterhead is unlikely to mislead a person to think that the NBTA is in some way affiliated with the Government is founded on the assumption that people understand that licenses are issued by governmental authorities, whereas certificates are issued by private organizations.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#103">496 U. S. 103</a></span>-104.  But the dictionary definition of "certificate" relied on by the plurality in fact suggests that "certified" will often be understood as connoting governmental authorization:</p>\n<p>"[A] document issued by a school, <em>a state agency,</em> or a professional organization certifying that one has satisfactorily completed a course of studies, has passed a qualifying examination, <em>or has attained professional standing in a given field and may officially practice or hold a position in that field.</em>"</p>\n<p>Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 367 (1986 ed.) (emphases added). See also ibid (defining "certify" as, <em>inter alia,</em> "license").</p>\n<p>Indeed, this interpretation accords with many States\' practice of certifying legal specialists, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#124">496 U. S. 124</a></span>, and other professionals.  For instance, many States prescribe requirements for, and "certify" public accountants as, "Certified Public Accountants."  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 111, \xef\xbf\xbd 5500.01 <em>et seq.</em> (1987 and Supp.1988).  <em>See also</em> Webster\'s, <em>supra,</em> at 367 (defining "certified public accountant" as "an accountant usu[ally] in professional public practice who has met the requirements of a state law and has been granted a state certificate").  The phrase "Certified </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 496 U. S. 114</a></p><p> Civil Trial Specialist By the National Board of Trial Advocacy," without further explanation, is thus potentially misleading, at least when placed in proximity to petitioner\'s listing of his licenses to practice law in three States.  <em>Cf. Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/626/case.html">471 U.

S. 652</a></span> (1985) (holding that attorney advertisement promising "if there is no recovery, no legal fees are owed by our clients" was potentially misleading because "members of the public are often unaware of the technical meanings of such terms as <em>fees\' and `costs\' -- terms that, in ordinary usage, might well be virtually interchangeable").\n</em></p>\n<p>In addition, the reference to petitioner\'s certification as a civil trial specialist may cause people to think that petitioner is necessarily a better trial lawyer than attorneys without the certification.  <em>Cf. post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#123">496 U.

We have recognized that</p>\n<p>"advertising claims as to the quality of services . . . are not susceptible of measurement or verification; accordingly, such claims may be so likely to be misleading as to warrant restriction."</p>\n<p><em>Bates v.

The plurality discounts the misleading nature of the reference in two ways.  First, it asserts that the reference to NBTA certification is not an opinion, but a verifiable fact, and that the requirements for certification are also verifiable facts.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#101">496 U. S. 101</a></span>.  Second, it suggests that any inference of superiority that a consumer draws from the reference is justified, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#102">496 U. S. 102</a></span>, apparently because it believes that anyone who passes the NBTA\'s "<em>rigorous and exacting\'" standards possesses exceptional qualifications, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#95">496 U. S. 95</a></span> (quoting <em>In re Johnson,</em> 341 N.W.2d 282, 283 (Minn.1983)).  Whereas certification as a specialist by a "bogus" organization without "objective and consistently applied standards relevant to practice in a particular area of law" might be misleading, the plurality argues, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#109">496 U. S. 109</a></span>, NBTA certification suggests no "greater degree of professional qualification than reasonably may be inferred from an evaluation of its rigorous requirements," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#102">496 U.

S. 115</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Although these characteristics may buttress the plurality\'s conclusion that petitioner\'s letterhead statement is not <em>inherently</em> misleading, they do not prevent that statement from being <em>potentially</em> misleading.  Facts as well as opinions can be misleading when they are presented without adequate information.  Even if, as the plurality suggests, NBTA-certified lawyers are <em>generally</em> more highly qualified for trial work than the average attorney, petitioner\'s statement is still potentially misleading because a person reasonably could draw a different inference from it.  A person could think, for instance, that "Certified Civil Trial Specialist" means that petitioner has an unusually high success rate in civil trials.  Alternatively, a person could think that all lawyers are considered by the NBTA for certification as a specialist, so that petitioner is <em>necessarily</em> a better trial lawyer than every lawyer not so certified.  Neither inference, needless to say, would be true.</p>\n<p>The potential for misunderstanding might be less if the NBTA were a commonly recognized organization and the public had a general understanding of its requirements.  The record contains no evidence, however, that the NBTA or, more importantly, its certification requirements are widely known.</p>\n<p>This Court examined a statement similar to petitioner\'s in <em>In re R.M.J.</em>  There, an attorney had been disciplined by the state bar for advertising, among other things, that he was "Admitted to Practice Before THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT."  455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#197">455 U.

We found that "this relatively uninformative fact . . . could be misleading to the general public unfamiliar with the requirements of admission to the Bar of this Court."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#205">455 U. S. 205</a></span>.  We held that the State\'s total ban on such information was unconstitutional, however, in part because the state court had made no finding that the information was misleading, nor had the State attempted a less restrictive means of preventing deception, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 496 U. S. 116</a></p><p> such as "requir[ing] a statement explaining the nature of the Supreme Court Bar."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#206">455 U. S. 206</a></span>.  Nevertheless, our acknowledgment that the statement was <em>potentially</em> misleading and our suggestion that the State could require the attorney to provide additional information are instructive.</p>\n<p>Because a claim of certification by the NBTA as a civil trial specialist is potentially misleading, States may enact measures other than a total ban to prevent deception or confusion.  This Court has suggested that States may, for example, require "some limited supplementation, by way of warning or disclaimer or the like, . . . so as to assure that the consumer is not misled."  <em>Bates, supra,</em> 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html#384">433 U.

S. 203</a></span> ("[T]he remedy in the first instance is not necessarily a prohibition but preferably a requirement of disclaimers or explanation").  The Court\'s decisions in <em>Shapero</em> and <em>Zauderer</em> provide helpful guidance in this area.  In <em>Shapero,</em> the Court held that States may not categorically prohibit lawyers from soliciting business for pecuniary gain by sending personalized letters to potential clients known to face particular legal problems.  486 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/466/case.html#476">486 U. S. 476</a></span>.  The Court said that States could, however, enact less restrictive measures to prevent deception and abuse, such as requiring that a personalized letter bear a label identifying it as an advertisement or a statement informing the recipient how to report an inaccurate or misleading letter.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/466/case.html#477">486 U. S. 477</a></span>-478.  In <em>Zauderer,</em> the Court held that a State could not ban newspaper advertisements containing legal advice or illustrations because the State had failed to show that it could not combat potential abuses by means short of a blanket ban.  471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/626/case.html#644">471 U.

But the Court held that the State could require attorneys advertising contingent fee services to disclose that clients would have to pay costs even if their lawsuits were unsuccessful to prevent the possibility that people would erroneously think that they would not owe their attorneys any money if they lost their cases.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/626/case.html#650">471 U.

S. 117</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Following the logic of those cases, a State could require a lawyer claiming certification by the NBTA as a civil trial specialist to provide additional information in order to prevent that claim from being misleading. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The State might, for example, require a disclaimer stating that the NBTA is a private organization not affiliated with or sanctioned by the State or Federal Government.  The State also could require information about the NBTA\'s requirements for certification as a specialist so that any inferences drawn by consumers about the quality of services offered by an NBTA-certified attorney would be based on more complete knowledge of the meaning of NBTA certification.  Each State, of course, may decide for itself, within the constraints of the First Amendment, how best to prevent such claims from being misleading. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 496 U.

S. 125</a></span>.  On the contrary, a State could easily establish generally applicable regulations setting forth what types of information must accompany a claim of certification or specialty.  The state agency in charge of enforcing those regulations could then investigate and adjudicate alleged violations of the regulations, just as such agencies do under existing disciplinary rules.  No advance approval of every claim would be required.</p>\n<p>In any event, this Court\'s primary task in cases such as this is to determine whether a state law or regulation unduly burdens the speaker\'s exercise of First Amendment rights, not whether respect for those rights would be unduly burdensome for the State.  Because Illinois can prevent petitioner\'s claim from being misleading without banning that claim entirely, the State\'s total ban is unconstitutional <em>as applied in this case.</em> <em>Cf. post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#118">496 U.

The burden is on the State to enact a constitutional regulation, not on petitioner to guess in advance what he would have to do to comply with such a regulation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The precise amount of information necessary to avoid misunderstandings need not be decided here.  The poles of the spectrum of disclosure requirements, however, are clear.  A State may require an attorney to provide more than just the fact of his certification as a civil trial specialist by the NBTA.  But a State may not require an attorney to include in his letterhead an exhaustive, detailed recounting of the NBTA\'s certification requirements because more limited disclosure would suffice to prevent the possibility that people would be misled.  <em>Cf.

Thus, there are four Justices -- Justice STEVENS and the three Justices joining his opinion -- who believe that the First Amendment protects the letterhead as it is and that the State may not forbid its circulation.  But there are five Justices who believe that this particular letterhead is unprotected:  Justice O\'CONNOR, THE CHIEF JUSTICE, and Justice SCALIA believe the letterhead is inherently misleading, and hence would uphold Rule 2-105(a)(3); at least two of us -- Justice MARSHALL and myself -- find it potentially misleading and would permit the State to ban such letterheads but only if they are not accompanied by disclaimers appropriate to avoid the danger.  This letterhead does not carry such a disclaimer.  The upshot is that, while the State may not apply its flat ban to any and all claims of certification by attorneys, particularly those carrying disclaimers, the State should be allowed to apply its Rule to the letterhead in its present form and forbid its circulation.  That leads me to affirm, rather than to reverse, the judgment below.</p>\n<p>To reverse is to leave petitioner free to circulate his letterhead, not because it is protected under the First Amendment -- indeed, it is not -- but because five Justices refuse to enforce the Rule even as applied, leaving the State powerless to act until and unless it drafts a narrower rule that will survive scrutiny under the First Amendment.

This being so, the inquiry is not whether the regulation at issue here is invalid on its face, but whether it was constitutionally applied to forbid circulation of the letterhead in its present form.  It is plain enough that it was so applied, for five of us hold that the letterhead is at least potentially misleading and hence must carry an appropriate disclaimer to qualify for circulation.  As I see it, it is the petitioner who should have to clean up his advertisement so as to eliminate its potential to mislead.  Until he does, the State\'s Rule legally bars him from circulating the letterhead in its present form.</p>\n<p>I would therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p>Justice O\'CONNOR, with whom Chief Justice REHNQUIST and Justice SCALIA join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This case provides yet another example of the difficulties raised by rote application of the commercial speech doctrine in the context of state regulation of professional standards for attorneys.  Nothing in our prior cases in this area mandates that we strike down the state regulation at issue here, which is designed to ensure a reliable and ethical profession.

The plurality in this case correctly notes that the statements in petitioner\'s letterhead have not been shown actually to deceive consumers, <em>see ante</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="121">Page 496 U. S. 121</a></p><p> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#100">496 U. S. 100</a></span>-101, but it fails adequately to address whether the statements are "inherently likely to deceive," as the Supreme Court of Illinois concluded.  126 Ill.2d 397, 408, 128 Ill.Dec. 535, 540, 534 N.E.2d 980, 985 (1989).  Charged with the duties of monitoring the legal profession within the State, the Supreme Court of Illinois is in a far better position than is this Court to determine which statements are misleading or likely to mislead.  Although we are the final arbiters on the issue whether a statement is misleading as a matter of constitutional law, we should be more deferential to the State\'s experience with such statements.  Illinois does not stand alone in its conclusion that claims of certification are so misleading as to require a blanket ban.  At least 19 States and the District of Columbia currently ban claims of certification.  <em>See</em> Alaska Code Prof.Resp. DR 2105 (1990); D.C.Ct.Rules, App.A., DR 2105 (1989); Haw.Code Prof.Resp. DR 2-105 (1990); Ill.Code Prof.Resp. Rule 2-105 (1989); Ind.Rule Prof.Conduct 7.4 (1990); Iowa Code Prof.Resp. DR 2-105 (1989); Ky.Sup.Court Rule 7.4 (1990-1991); Mass.

The plurality states that "[a] claim of certification is not an unverifiable opinion of the ultimate quality of a lawyer\'s work or a promise of success, but is simply a fact."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#101">496 U. S. 101</a></span> (citation omitted).  This view, however, conflates fact and verifiability.  Merely because something is a fact does not make it readily verifiable.  A statement, even if </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 496 U. S. 122</a></p><p> true, could be misleading.  <em>See also Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html">433 U. S. 350</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html#383">433 U. S. 383</a></span> (1977) (attorney commercial speech "that is false, deceptive, <em>or</em> misleading of course is subject to restraint" (emphasis added)).  The ordinary consumer with a "comparative lack of knowledge" about legal affairs should be able to assess the validity of claims and statements made in attorney advertising.  Neither petitioner nor the plurality assert that petitioner\'s claim of certification on its face is readily understandable to the average consumer of legal services.</p>\n<p>The plurality verifies petitioner\'s statement on his letterhead by reference to the record assembled in this case, but that record is not readily available to members of the public.  Given the confusion in the court below about the certification standard applied by the NBTA, <em>see</em> 126 Ill.2d at 406, 128 Ill.Dec. at 539, 534 N.E.2d at 984, there can be little doubt that the meaning underlying a claim of NBTA certification is neither common knowledge nor readily verifiable by the ordinary consumer.  And nothing in petitioner\'s letterhead reveals how one might attempt to verify the claim of certification by the NBTA.  At least the claim of admission to the United States Supreme Court at issue in <em>In re R.M.J., supra,</em> which the Court stated "could be misleading," 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#205">455 U. S. 205</a></span>-206, named a readily recognizable institution or location to which inquiries could be addressed.  Reference to the "NBTA" provides no such guidepost for inquiries.  The State is, in my view, more than justified in banning claims of certification by the NBTA.</p>\n<p>The plurality appears to have abandoned altogether any requirement that a statement or claim be verifiable by the ordinary consumer of legal services.  Apparently, it would permit advertising claims of certification by any organization so long as the 1awyer can</p>\n<p>"demonstrate that such certification is available to all lawyers who meet objective and consistently applied standards relevant to practice in a particular area of the law."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#109">496 U. S. 109</a></span>.  The plurality has thereby deserted the sole policy reason that justifies its headlong plunge into </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 496 U. S. 123</a></p><p> micromanagement of state bar rules --  facilitation of a "consumer\'s access to legal services."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#110">496 U. S. 110</a></span>.  Facilitation of access to legal services is hardly achieved where the consumer neither knows the organization nor can readily verify its criteria for membership.</p>\n<p>"[A]dvertising claims as to the quality of services . . . are not susceptible of measurement or verification; accordingly, such claims may be so likely to be misleading as to warrant restriction."</p>\n<p><em>Bates, supra,</em> 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html#383">433 U. S. 383</a></span>-384; <em>see also In re R.M.J.,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#201">455 U. S. 201</a></span> ("[C]laims as to quality . . . might be so likely to mislead as to warrant restriction").  As the Supreme Court of Illinois properly concluded, certification is tantamount to a claim of quality, and superiority and is therefore inherently likely to mislead.  126 Ill.2d at 410, 128 Ill.Dec. at 541, 534 N.E.2d at 986.  Indeed, the plurality\'s citation of others\' descriptions of NBTA certification supports the conclusion that it is intended to attest to the quality of the lawyer\'s work.  The plurality refers to the Task Force on Lawyer Competence of the Conference of Chief Justices, Report with Findings and Recommendations to the Conference of Chief Justices, Publication No. NCSC-021, (May 26, 1982), which stated:</p>\n<p>"The National Board of Trial Advocacy, a national certification program that provides recognition for <em>superior achievement in trial advocacy,</em> uses a highly structured certification process in addition to a formal examination to select its members."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 33-34 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Not only does the certification claim lead the consumer to believe that this lawyer is better than those lawyers lacking such certification, it also leads to the conclusion that the State licenses the lawyer\'s purported superiority.  The juxtaposition on petitioner\'s letterhead of "Licensed:  Illinois, Missouri, Arizona" with the claim of NBTA certification increases the likelihood of deception.  As the court below reasoned, 126 Ill.2d at 406, 128 Ill.Dec. at 539, 534 N.E.2d at 984, the proximity of the two statements might easily lead the consumer to conclude that the State has sanctioned the certification.  As it is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="124">Page 496 U. S. 124</a></p><p> common knowledge that States police the ethical standards of the profession, that inference is likely to be especially misleading.  The plurality disposes of this difficulty by drawing an unconvincing distinction between licensing and certification:</p>\n<p>"We are satisfied that the consuming public understands that licenses . . . are issued by governmental authorities and that a host of certificates . . . are issued by private organizations."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#103">496 U. S. 103</a></span>.  Yet no such bright line exists.  For example, California is now certifying legal specialists.  <em>See</em> Cal. Rules Ct., Policies Governing the State Bar of California Program for Certifying Legal Specialists (1990).  <em>See also</em> Ariz. Rule Prof. Conduct ER 7.4 (1990); Ark. Model Rule Prof. Conduct 7.4(c) (1990); Fla. Rule Prof. Conduct 4-7.5(c) (1990); La.Rev.Stat. Ann., Rule of Prof. Conduct 7.4 (1988); N.J.Ct.Rule 1:39 and N.J.Rule Prof.Conduct 7.4 (1989); N.M.Rules Governing Practice of Law, Rule of Prof. Conduct 16-704 (1988); N.C.Ann.Rules, Plan of Certified Legal Specialization, App. H, Rule 5.7 (1989); S.C.Rules on Lawyer Advertising, Ct. Rule 7.4 (Supp.1989); Tex.State Bar Rules, Art. 10, \xc2\xa7 9, DR 2-101(C) (1989); Utah Rule Prof. Conduct 7.4(b) (1990).  Thus, claims of certification may well lead the ordinary consumer to conclude that the State has sanctioned such a claim.  "[B]ecause the public lacks sophistication concerning legal services," "the leeway for untruthful or misleading expression that has been allowed in other contexts has little force in the [attorney commercial speech] arena."  <em>Bates, supra,</em> 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html#383">433 U. S. 383</a></span>.  The Supreme Court of Illinois did not err when it concluded that the ordinary consumer is likely to be misled by the juxtaposition of state bar admission and claims of civil trial specialty.  Because the statement of certification on petitioner\'s letterhead is inherently misleading, the State may prohibit it without violation of the First Amendment.  <em>See In re R.M.J., supra,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/case.html#203">455 U. S. 203</a></span> ("Misleading advertising may be prohibited entirely").</p>\n<p>Petitioner does not suggest a less burdensome means of regulating attorney claims of certification than case-by-case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="125">Page 496 U. S. 125</a></p><p> determination.  Under petitioner\'s theory, the First Amendment requires States that would protect their consumers from misleading claims of certification to provide an individual hearing for each and every claim of certification, extending well beyond NBTA certification to any organization that may be used by a resourceful lawyer.  In my view, the First Amendment does not require the State to establish such an onerous system, and permits the State simply to prohibit such inherently misleading claims.</p>\n<p>As a majority of this Court agrees, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#111">496 U. S. 111</a></span>(MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment, joined by BRENNAN, J.); <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#118">496 U. S. 118</a></span> (WHITE, J., dissenting); (O\'CONNOR, J., dissenting, joined by REHNQUIST, C.J., and SCALIA, J.), petitioner\'s claim to certification is at least potentially misleading.  If the information cannot be presented in a way that is not deceptive, even statements that are merely potentially misleading may be regulated with an absolute prohibition.  <em>See In re R.M.J.,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/167/case.html#203">496 U. S. 203</a></span>.  It is difficult to believe that a disclaimer could be fashioned, as the plurality suggests, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#110">496 U. S. 110</a></span>; <em>see also</em> opinion concurring in judgment, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/91/case.html#117">496 U. S. 117</a></span>, that would make petitioner\'s claim of certification on his letterhead not potentially misleading.  Such a disclaimer would have to communicate three separate pieces of information in a space that could reasonably fit on a letterhead along with the claim of certification:  (1) that the claim to certification does not necessarily indicate that the attorney provides higher quality representation than those who are not certified; (2) that the certification is not state-sanctioned; and (3) either the criteria for certification or a reasonable means by which the consumer could determine what those criteria are.  Even if the State were to permit claims of certification along with disclaimers, in order to protect consumers adequately, the State would have to engage in case-by-case review to ensure that the misleading character of a particular claim to certification was cured by a particular disclaimer.  Alternatively, the State would be forced </p><p><a class="page-number" name="126">Page 496 U. S. 126</a></p><p> to fashion its own disclaimer for each organization for which certification is claimed by the attorneys within its borders, provide for certification itself, or, at the least, screen each organization. <em>See, e.g.,</em> Ala.Code Prof.Resp.Temp. DR 2-112 (1989) (providing for state screening of certifying organizations).  Although having information about certification may be helpful for consumers, the Constitution does not require States to go to these extremes to protect their citizens from deception.  In my view, the Court would do well to permit the States broad latitude to experiment in this area so as to allow such forms of disclosure as best serve the State\'s legitimate goal of assisting its citizens in obtaining the most reliable information about legal services.</p>\n<p>Petitioner also contends that D.R. 2-105 violates the Equal Protection Clause as applied to him on the ground that there is no rational justification for allowing attorneys in certain areas to claim specialization, <em>e.g.,</em> admiralty, patent, and trademark, while precluding him from claiming a civil trial specialty.  Yet petitioner\'s claim is not merely a claim of concentration of practice, which the Illinois rules permit, but rather a claim of quality.  It is not irrational for the State to assume that the reporting of professional experience is less likely to mislead the public than would claims of quality.  Moreover, while the claim of NBTA certification is misleading in part because the public does not know what meaning to attach to it, the claim of concentration of practice merely states a fact understandable on its face to the ordinary consumer.  Finally, as the Supreme Court of Illinois noted, historically lawyers have been permitted to advertise specialization in patent, trademark and admiralty law because of the difficulties encountered by the general public in finding such attorneys.  <em>See</em> 126 Ill.2d at 410-411, 128 Ill.Dec. at 541, 534 N.E.2d at 986.  Locating an attorney who is a civil trial advocate hardly poses the same obstacle.  Thus, I would conclude that the regulation does not violate the Equal Protection Clause </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 496 U. S. 127</a></p><p></p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, I would uphold Rule 2-105(a)(3) of the Illinois Code of Professional Responsibility and affirm the decision of the court below.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
