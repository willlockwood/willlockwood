TANEY"</p>\n<p>"U.S. HEATH"</p>\n<p>Upon this certificate, the cause came up to this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 50 U. S. 557</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The facts upon which the question certified has arisen are not disputed.  The sufficiency of the notice is therefore a question of law.  And it is of the first importance to the commercial community, that the rules which regulate the rights and liabilities of parties to negotiable instruments in courts of justice should be plain and certain, and conform to the established usages of trade.</p>\n<p>Two objections have been taken to the sufficiency of the notice in this case.  1st, that due diligence was not used by the holder to ascertain the residence of the endorser before the notice was sent to Nottingham, and 2d, if reasonable diligence was used at that time, yet the information he afterwards received in Baltimore imposed on him the obligation of giving a further notice to the defendant himself, or of sending it by mail to his nearest and usual post office.</p>\n<p>As regards the first question, the Court is of opinion that due diligence was used before the notice was sent to Nottingham.  The case shows that there was very little, if any, trade between Alexandria and Nottingham at the time of this transaction, and but few persons, therefore, in Alexandria would be likely to know whether the defendant did or did not reside in Nottingham.  The bill of exchange was not dated at any particular place, and the acceptors resided in Baltimore.  The defendant was not engaged in trade, but was a physician residing in the country, and it does not appear that he was in the practice of visiting Alexandria or of having any business transactions there.  And the proof is that Travers, of whom the holder inquired, from the nature of the trade in which he had been many years </p><p><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 50 U. S. 558</a></p><p> engaged -- first to Nottingham and afterwards to Baltimore -- was as likely as any other person in Alexandria to give the information which the plaintiffs were seeking to obtain, if not more so.  The answer he received was direct and positive, both as to the knowledge of Travers and the residence of the endorser, and he had a right to rely upon it.  And although Travers was mistaken and the notice was not sent to the nearest or usual post office of the defendant, yet the plaintiffs used all the diligence which the law requires and had sufficient reason to believe that the notice would be received.  The liability of the endorser was therefore fixed.  The case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/45/336/case.html#345">Harris v. Robinson,</a></span></em> 4 How. 345, is conclusive on this point.</p>\n<p>The second objection taken in the argument has not been so directly settled by judicial decision on the point, but is, we think, equally clear upon established principles.</p>\n<p>We have already said that the liability of the endorser was fixed by the notice sent to Nottingham.  The plaintiffs had acquired a right of action against him by this notice, and might have brought their suit the next day.  Could that right be divested by the information which was subsequently given to them?  We think not, and that all of the cases in relation to this subject imply the contrary.  The books are full of cases where mistakes of this kind have been committed, and suits afterwards brought when the residence of the party was discovered.  Yet it does not seem to have been supposed in any of them that a second notice was necessary, nor are we aware that such a point has ever been raised.  Yet if a notice thus given after diligent inquiry is not equivalent to actual notice, knowledge subsequently obtained would be a defense to the action, even if the holder had brought suit before he learned what was the nearest or usual post office of the defendant.</p>\n<p>The case of <em>Firth v. Thrush,</em> 8 Barn. &amp; Cress. 387, which was much relied on in the argument, depended upon different principles.  In that case, the holder knew that notice had not been given to the endorser.  He had been engaged in making inquires for his residence, without being able to obtain any information upon which he might have acted.  And the question there was not whether a second notice should be given, but whether due diligence was used in sending the first.</p>\n<p>The rule contended for by the defendant would produce much uncertainty and difficulty in transactions of this kind.  For if a second notice must be given, is it to be required in all cases where there has been an error in the information as to the defendant\'s post office?  Certainly the practice of the courts has been otherwise.  And if it is not to be required in all cases, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 50 U. S. 559</a></p><p> it would be impossible to fix any certain limits as to time or circumstances.  The subsequent information might come to him casually, when his mind was occupied with other engagements; he might not confide in it as much as in that which he had before received; it might come to him in a few days, or months might elapse before he obtained it.  The rule would be loose and uncertain in its application, and constantly lead to litigation, where the residence of the endorser was unknown, or an error committed as to his usual post office.  It would also be contrary, the court thinks, to the usages of commerce and to the uniform practice in courts of justice.  In the case of <em>Harris v. Robinson,</em> before referred to, no second notice was given, nor did the court intimate that any was necessary.</p>\n<p>The law does not require actual notice.  It requires reasonable diligence only, and reasonable efforts, made in good faith, to give it.  And if sufficient inquiries have been made and information received upon which the holder has a right to rely, a mistake as to the nearest post office or usual post office does not deprive him of his remedy.  He has done all that the law requires, and the notice thus sent fixes the liability of the endorser as effectually as if he had actually received it.  This we think is the true rule, and the only one that can give certainty and security in transactions in commercial paper.</p>\n<p><em>We shall therefore certify that reasonable diligence was used be the plaintiffs to give the defendant notice of the dishonor of the bill.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maryland and on the point or question on which the judges of the said circuit court were opposed in opinion and which was certified to this Court for its opinion agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof it is the opinion of this Court that upon the facts in this case, due diligence had been used by the plaintiffs, the holders of the bill, to give to the defendant, the endorser thereof, notice of the dishonor of said bill.  Whereupon it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court that it be so certified to the said circuit court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
