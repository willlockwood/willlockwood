The Act provides that a party alleging a vaccine-related injury may file a petition for compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, naming the Health and Human Services Secretary as the respondent; that the court must resolve the case by a specified deadline; and that the claimant can then decide whether to accept the court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment or reject it and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.  Awards are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.  As a <em>quid pro quo, </em>manufacturers enjoy significant tort-liability protections.  Most importantly, the Act eliminates manufacturer liability for a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s unavoidable, adverse side effects.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hannah Bruesewitz\xe2\x80\x99s parents filed a vaccine-injury petition in the Court of Federal Claims, claiming that Hannah became disabled after receiving a diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine manufactured by Lederle Laboratories (now owned by respondent Wyeth).  After that court denied their claim, they elected to reject the unfavorable judgment and filed suit in Pennsylvania state court, alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that the defective design of Lederle\xe2\x80\x99s DTP vaccine caused Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s disabilities, and that Lederle was subject to strict liability and liability for negligent design under Pennsylvania common law.  Wyeth removed the suit to the Federal District Court.  It granted Wyeth summary judgment, holding that the relevant Pennsylvania law was preempted by 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side-effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Third Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The NCVIA preempts all design-defect claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plaintiffs seeking compensation for injury or death caused by a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s side effects.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Section 300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s text suggests that a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s design<em> </em>is not open to question in a tort action.  If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a different design, the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause would do no work.  A vaccine side effect could alway<em>s</em> have been avoidable by use of a different vaccine not containing the harmful element.  The language of the provision thus suggests the design is not subject to question in a tort action.  What the statute establishes as a complete defense must be unavoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) with respect to the particular design.  This conclusion is supported by the fact that, although products-liability law establishes three grounds for liability\xe2\x80\x94defective manufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and defective design\xe2\x80\x94the Act mentions only manufacture and warnings.  It thus seems that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s failure to mention design-defect liability is \xe2\x80\x9cby deliberate choice, not inadvertence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Peabody Coal Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/149/index.html">537 U.

Moreover, reading the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cside effects that were unavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d to exempt injuries caused by flawed design would require treating \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d as a coordinating conjunction linking independent ideas when it is a concessive, subordinating conjunction conveying that one clause weakens or qualifies the other.  The canon against superfluity does not undermine this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 competing interpretation has superfluity problems of its own.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general reinforces what \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s text suggests.  Design defects do not merit a single mention in the Act or in Food and Drug Administration regulations that pervasively regulate the drug manufacturing process.  This lack of guidance for design defects, combined with the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically mentioned in the Act, strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for liability.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s mandates lead to the same conclusion.  It provides for federal agency improvement of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation, which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of design-defect torts\xe2\x80\x94prompting the development of improved designs, and providing compensation for inflicted injuries.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s structural <em>quid pro quo</em> also leads to the same conclusion.  The vaccine manufacturers fund an informal, efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury verdict.  Taxing their product to fund the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax them back into the market.

They had been so effective in preventing infectious diseases that the public became much less alarmed at the threat of those diseases,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and much more concerned with the risk of injury from the vaccines themselves.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Much of the concern centered around vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), which were blamed for children\xe2\x80\x99s disabilities and developmental delays.  This led to a massive increase in vaccine-related tort litigation.  Whereas between 1978 and 1981 only nine product-liability suits were filed against DTP manufacturers, by the mid-1980\xe2\x80\x99s the suits numbered more than 200 each year.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  This destabilized the DTP vaccine market, causing two of the three domestic manufacturers to withdraw; and the remaining manufacturer, Lederle Laboratories, estimated that its potential tort liability exceeded its annual sales by a factor of 200.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Vaccine shortages arose when Lederle had production problems in 1984.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the large number of suits, there were many complaints that obtaining compensation for legitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries was too costly and difficult.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  A significant number of parents were already declining vaccination for their children,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and concerns about compensation threatened to depress vaccination rates even further.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  This was a source of concern to public health officials, since vaccines are effective in preventing outbreaks of disease only if a large percentage of the population is vaccinated.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To stabilize the vaccine market and facilitate compensation, Congress enacted the NCVIA in 1986.  The Act establishes a no-fault compensation program \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to work faster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shalala</em> v. <em>Whitecotton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/268/index.html">514 U. S. 268</a>, 269 (1995).  A person injured by a vaccine, or his legal guardian, may file a petition for compensation in the United States Court of Federal Claims, naming the Secretary of Health and Human Services as the respondent.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  A special master then makes an informal adjudication of the petition within (except for two limited exceptions) 240 days.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The Court of Federal Claims must review objections to the special master\xe2\x80\x99s decision and enter final judgment under a similarly tight statutory deadline.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  At that point, a claimant has two options: to accept the court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and forgo a traditional tort suit for damages, or to reject the judgment and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fast, informal adjudication is made possible by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s Vaccine Injury Table, which lists the vaccines covered under the Act; describes each vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s compensable, adverse side effects; and indicates how soon after vaccination those side effects should first manifest themselves.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Claimants who show that a listed injury first manifested itself at the appropriate time are prima facie entitled to compensation.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  No showing of causation is necessary; the Secretary bears the burden of disproving causation.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  A claimant may also recover for unlisted side effects, and for listed side effects that occur at times other than those specified in the Table, but for those the claimant must prove causation.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Unlike in tort suits, claimants under the Act are not required to show that the administered vaccine was defectively manufactured, labeled, or designed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Successful claimants receive compensation for medical, rehabilitation, counseling, special education, and vocational training expenses; diminished earning capacity; pain and suffering; and $250,000 for vaccine-related deaths.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees are provided, not only for successful cases, but even for unsuccessful claims that are not frivolous.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  These awards are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>quid pro quo </em>for this, designed to stabilize the vaccine market, was the provision of significant tort-liability protections for vaccine manufacturers.  The Act requires claimants to seek relief through the compensation program before filing suit for more than $1,000.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Manufacturers are generally immunized from liability for failure to warn if they have complied with all regulatory requirements (including but not limited to warning requirements) and have given the warning either to the claimant or the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s physician.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  They are immunized from liability for punitive damages absent failure to comply with regulatory requirements, \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cintentional and wrongful withholding of information,\xe2\x80\x9d or other \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal or illegal activity.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  And most relevant to the present case, the Act expressly eliminates liability for a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s unavoidable, adverse side effects:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The vaccine at issue here is a DTP vaccine manufactured by Lederle Laboratories.

Her pediatrician administered doses of the DTP vaccine according to the Center for Disease Control\xe2\x80\x99s recommended childhood immunization schedule.  Within 24 hours of her April 1992 vaccination, Hannah started to experience seizures.[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  She suffered over 100 seizures during the next month, and her doctors eventually diagnosed her with \xe2\x80\x9cresidual seizure disorder\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopmental delay.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  Hannah, now a teenager, is still diagnosed with both conditions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 1995, Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s parents, Russell and Robalee Bruesewitz, filed a vaccine injury petition in the United States Court of Federal Claims, alleging that Hannah suffered from on-Table residual seizure disorder and encephalopathy injuries.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  A Special Master denied their claims on various grounds, though they were awarded $126,800 in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.  The Bruesewitzes elected to reject the unfavorable judgment, and in October 2005 filed this lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court.  Their complaint alleged (as relevant here) that defective design of Lederle\xe2\x80\x99s DTP vaccine caused Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s disabilities, and that Lederle was subject to strict liability, and liability for negligent design, under Pennsylvania common law.[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which granted Wyeth summary judgment on the strict-liability and negligence design-defect claims, holding that the Pennsylvania law providing those causes of action was preempted by 42 U.

It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine manufacturer <em>must</em> have taken for a side-effect to be considered \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute.  Provided that there was proper manufacture and warning, any remaining side effects, including those resulting from design defects, are deemed to have been unavoidable.  State-law design-defect claims are therefore preempted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a different design, the word \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d would do no work.  A<em> </em>side effect of a vaccine could <em>always</em> have been avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element.  The language of the provision thus suggests that the <em>design </em>of the vaccine is a given, not subject to question in the tort action.  What the statute establishes as a complete defense must be unavoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) <em>with respect to the particular design</em>.  Which plainly implies that the design itself is not open to question.[<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A further textual indication leads to the same conclusion.  Products-liability law establishes a classic and well known triumvirate of grounds for liability: defective manufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and defective design.[<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  If all three were intended to be preserved, it would be strange to mention specifically only two, and leave the third to implication.  It would have been much easier (and much more natural) to provide that manufacturers would be liable for \xe2\x80\x9cdefective manufacture, defective directions or warning, and defective design.\xe2\x80\x9d  It seems that the statute fails to mention design-defect liability \xe2\x80\x9cby deliberate choice, not inadvertence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Peabody Coal Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/149/index.html">537 U.

We agree with its premise that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98side effects that were unavoidable\xe2\x80\x99 must refer to side effects caused by a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s <em>design.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  We do not comprehend, however, the second step of its reasoning, which is that the use of\nthe conditional term \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the introductory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cplainly implies that some side effects stemming from a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s design are \xe2\x80\x98unavoidable,\xe2\x80\x99 while others are avoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  That is not so.  The \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause makes total sense whether the design to which \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d refers is (as the dissent believes) any feasible design (making the side effects of the design used for the vaccine at issue avoidable), or (as we believe) the particular design used for the vaccine at issue (making its side effects unavoidable).  Under the latter view, the condition established by the \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d clause is that the vaccine have been properly labeled and manufactured; and under the former, that it have been properly <em>designed</em>, labeled, and manufactured.  Neither view renders the \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause a nullity.  Which of the two variants must be preferred is addressed by our textual analysis, and is in no way determined by the \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s textual argument also rests upon the proposition that the word \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) is a term of art that incorporates comment <em>k</em> to Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7402A (1963\xe2\x80\x931964).[<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  The Restatement generally holds a manufacturer strictly liable for harm to person or property caused by \xe2\x80\x9cany product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  Comment <em>k</em> exempts from this strict-liability rule \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably unsafe products.\xe2\x80\x9d  An unavoidably unsafe product is defined by a hodge-podge of criteria and a few examples, such as the Pasteur rabies vaccine and experimental pharmaceuticals.  Despite this lack of clarity, petitioners seize upon one phrase in the comment <em>k</em> analysis, and assert that by 1986 a majority of courts had made this a <em>sine qua non </em>requirement for an \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably unsafe product\xe2\x80\x9d: a case-specific showing that the product was \xe2\x80\x9cquite incapable of being made safer for [its] intended \xe2\x80\xa6 use.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have no need to consider the finer points of comment <em>k</em>.  Whatever consistent judicial gloss that comment may have been given in 1986, there is no reason to believe that \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) was invoking it.  The comment creates a special category of \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably unsafe products,\xe2\x80\x9d while the statute refers to \xe2\x80\x9cside effects that were unavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  That the latter uses the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d and the former the adverb \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably\xe2\x80\x9d does not establish that Congress had comment <em>k</em> in mind.  \xe2\x80\x9cUnavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d is hardly a rarely used word.  Even the cases petitioners cite as putting a definitive gloss on comment <em>k</em> use the precise phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably unsafe product\xe2\x80\x9d;[<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>] none attaches special significance to the term \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The textual problems with petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation do not end there.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d in the clause \xe2\x80\x9ceven though the vaccine was properly prepared and [labeled]\xe2\x80\x9d is meant to signal the unexpected: unavoidable side effects persist <em>despite</em> best manufacturing and labeling practices.[<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  But petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading eliminates any opposition between the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause\xe2\x80\x94called a concessive subordinate clause by grammarians\xe2\x80\x94and the word \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>]  Their reading makes preemption turn equally on unavoidability, proper preparation, and proper labeling.  Thus, the dissent twice refers to the requirements of proper preparation and proper labeling as \xe2\x80\x9ctwo additional prerequisites\xe2\x80\x9d for preemption independent of unavoidability.[<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]  The primary textual justification for the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s position depends on that independence.[<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]  But linking independent ideas is the job of a coordinating junction like \xe2\x80\x9cand,\xe2\x80\x9d not a subordinating junction like \xe2\x80\x9ceven though.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners and the dissent contend that the interpretation we propose would render part of \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) superfluous: Congress could have more tersely and more clearly preempted design-defect claims by barring liability \xe2\x80\x9cif . . . the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  The intervening passage (\xe2\x80\x9cthe injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though\xe2\x80\x9d) is unnecessary.  True enough.  But the rule against giving a portion of text an interpretation which renders it superfluous does not prescribe that a passage which could have been more terse does not mean what it says.  The rule applies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offending passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing interpretation.  That is not the case here.[<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>]  To be sure, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation gives independent meaning to the intervening passage (the supposed meaning of comment <em>k</em>); but it does so only at the expense of rendering the remainder of the provision superfluous.  Since a vaccine is not \xe2\x80\x9cquite incapable of being made safer for [its] intended use\xe2\x80\x9d if manufacturing defects could have been eliminated or better warnings provided, the entire \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause is a useless appendage.[<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>]  It would suffice to say \xe2\x80\x9cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94full stop.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general reinforces what the text of \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) suggests.  A vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s license spells out the manufacturing method that must be followed and the directions and warnings that must accompany the product.[<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]  Manufacturers ordinarily must obtain the Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) approval before modifying either.[<a href="#F51" name="T51">Footnote 51</a>]  Deviations from the license thus provide objective evidence of manufacturing defects or inadequate warnings.  Further objective evidence comes from the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations\xe2\x80\x94more than 90 of them[<a href="#F52" name="T52">Footnote 52</a>]\xe2\x80\x94that pervasively regulate the manufacturing process, down to the requirements for plumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing facility.[<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>]  Material noncompliance with any one of them, or with any other FDA regulation, could cost the manufacturer its regulatory-compliance defense.[<a href="#F54" name="T54">Footnote 54</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Design defects, in contrast, do not merit a single mention in the NCVIA or the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.  Indeed, the FDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its intended use.[<a href="#F55" name="T55">Footnote 55</a>]  And the decision is surely not an easy one.  Drug manufacturers often could trade a little less efficacy for a little more safety, but the safest design is not always the best one.  Striking the right balance between safety and efficacy is especially difficult with respect to vaccines, which affect public as well as individual health.  Yet the Act, which in every other respect micromanages manufacturers, is silent on how to evaluate competing designs.  Are manufacturers liable only for failing to employ an alternative design that the FDA has approved for distribution (an approval it takes years to obtain[<a href="#F56" name="T56">Footnote 56</a>])?  Or does it suffice that a vaccine design has been approved in other countries?  Or could there be liability for failure to use a design that exists only in a lab?  Neither the Act nor the FDA regulations provide an answer, leaving the universe of alternative designs to be limited only by an expert\xe2\x80\x99s imagination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jurors, of course, often decide similar questions with little guidance, and we do not suggest that the absence\nof guidance alone suggests preemption.  But the lack of guidance for design defects combined with the exten-\nsive guidance for the two grounds of liability specifically mentioned in the Act strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for\nliability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The mandates contained in the Act lead to the same conclusion.  Design-defect torts, broadly speaking, have two beneficial effects: (1) prompting the development of improved designs, and (2) providing compensation for inflicted injuries.  The NCVIA provides other means for achieving both effects.  We have already discussed the Act\xe2\x80\x99s generous compensation scheme.  And the Act provides many means of improving vaccine design.  It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote \xe2\x80\x9cthe development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F57" name="T57">Footnote 57</a>]  It establishes a National Vaccine Program, whose Director is \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve optimal prevention of human infectious diseases \xe2\x80\xa6 and to achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>]  The Program is to set priorities for federal vaccine research, and to coordinate federal vaccine safety and efficacy testing.[<a href="#F59" name="T59">Footnote 59</a>]  The Act requires vaccine manufacturers and health-care providers to report adverse side effects,[<a href="#F60" name="T60">Footnote 60</a>] and provides for monitoring of vaccine safety through a collaboration with eight managed-care organizations.[<a href="#F61" name="T61">Footnote 61</a>]  And of course whenever the FDA concludes that a vaccine is unsafe, it may revoke the license.[<a href="#F62" name="T62">Footnote 62</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These provisions for federal agency improvement of vaccine design, and for federally prescribed compensation, once again suggest that \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence regarding design-defect liability was not inadvertent.  It instead reflects a sensible choice to leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine design to the FDA and the National Vaccine Program rather than juries.[<a href="#F63" name="T63">Footnote 63</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And finally, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s structural <em>quid pro quo</em> leads to the same conclusion: The vaccine manufacturers fund from their sales an informal, efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries;[<a href="#F64" name="T64">Footnote 64</a>] in exchange they avoid costly tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury verdict.[<a href="#F65" name="T65">Footnote 65</a>]  But design-defect allegations are the most speculative and difficult type of products liability claim to litigate.  Taxing vaccine manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 product to fund the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax manufacturers back into the market.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent believes the Act\xe2\x80\x99s mandates are irrelevant because they do not spur innovation in precisely the same way as state-law tort systems.[<a href="#F66" name="T66">Footnote 66</a>]  That is a novel suggestion.  Although we previously have expressed doubt that Congress would quietly preempt product-liability claims without providing a federal substitute, see <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 486\xe2\x80\x93488 (1996) (plurality opinion), we have never suggested we would be skeptical of preemption unless the congressional substitute operated like the tort system.  We decline to adopt that stance today.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s belief that the FDA and the National Vaccine Program cannot alone spur adequate vaccine innovation is probably questionable, but surely beside the point.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since our interpretation of \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) is the only interpretation supported by the text and structure of the NCVIA, even those of us who believe legislative history is a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation have no need to resort to it.  In any case, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s contention that it would contradict our conclusion is mistaken.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history relies on the following syllogism: A 1986 House Committee Report states that \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) \xe2\x80\x9csets forth the principle contained in Comment k of Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts (Second);\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F67" name="T67">Footnote 67</a>] in 1986 comment <em>k</em> was \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly understood\xe2\x80\x9d to require a case-specific showing that \xe2\x80\x9cno feasible alternative design\xe2\x80\x9d existed; Congress therefore must have intended \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) to require that showing.[<a href="#F68" name="T68">Footnote 68</a>]  The syllogism ignores unhelpful statements in the Report and relies upon a term of art that did not exist in 1986.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Immediately after the language quoted by the dissent, the 1986 Report notes the difficulty a jury would have in faithfully assessing whether a feasible alternative design exists when an innocent \xe2\x80\x9cyoung child, often badly injured or killed\xe2\x80\x9d is the plaintiff.[<a href="#F69" name="T69">Footnote 69</a>]  Eliminating that concern is why the Report\xe2\x80\x99s authors \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly believ[e] that Comment k is appropriate and necessary as the policy for civil actions seeking damages in tort.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F70" name="T70">Footnote 70</a>]  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) and its version of \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle in Comment K\xe2\x80\x9d adopted by the 1986 Report leave that concern unaddressed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent buries another unfavorable piece of legislative history.  Because the Report believes that \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) should incorporate \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle in Comment K\xe2\x80\x9d and because the Act provides a generous no-fault compensation scheme, the Report counsels injured parties who cannot prove a manufacturing or labeling defect to \xe2\x80\x9cpursue recompense in the compensation system, not the tort system.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F71" name="T71">Footnote 71</a>]  That counsel echoes our interpretation of \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not to worry, the dissent retorts, a Committee Report by a later Congress \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritative[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d vindicates its interpretation.[<a href="#F72" name="T72">Footnote 72</a>]  Post-enactment legislative history (a contradiction in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation.  See <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/227/index.html">526 U. S. 227</a>, 238 (1999); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mine Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/258/index.html">330 U. S. 258</a>, 281\xe2\x80\x93282 (1947).  Real (pre-enactment) legislative history is persuasive to some because it is thought to shed light on what legislators understood an ambiguous statutory text to mean when they voted to enact it into law.  See <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. </em>v. <em>Allapattah Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/546/index.html"></a><a href="/us/545/546/index.html">545 U. S. 546</a>, 568 (2005).  But post-enactment legislative history by definition \xe2\x80\x9ccould have had no effect on the congressional vote,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>District of Columbia</em> v. <em>Heller</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/570/index.html">554 U. S. 570</a>, 605 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It does not matter that \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1) did not take effect until the later Congress passed the excise tax that funds the compensation scheme,[<a href="#F73" name="T73">Footnote 73</a>] and that the supposedly dispositive Committee Report is attached to that funding legislation.[<a href="#F74" name="T74">Footnote 74</a>]  Those who voted on the relevant statutory language were not necessarily the same persons who crafted the statements in the later Committee Report; or if they were did not necessarily have the same views at that earlier time; and no one voting at that earlier time could possibly have been informed by those later statements.  Permitting the legislative history of subsequent funding legislation to alter the meaning of a statute would set a dangerous precedent.  Many provisions of federal law depend on appropriations or include sunset provisions;[<a href="#F75" name="T75">Footnote 75</a>] they cannot be made the device for unenacted statutory revision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That brings us to the second flaw in the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s syllogism: Comment <em>k</em> did not have a \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly understood meaning\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F76" name="T76">Footnote 76</a>] in the mid-1980\xe2\x80\x99s.  Some courts thought it required a case-specific showing that a product was \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably unsafe\xe2\x80\x9d; many others thought it categorically exempted certain types of products from strict liability.[<a href="#F77" name="T77">Footnote 77</a>]  When \xe2\x80\x9call (or nearly all) of the\xe2\x80\x9d relevant judicial decisions have given a term or concept a consistent judicial gloss, we presume Congress intended the term or concept to have that meaning when it incorporated it into a later-enacted statute.  <em>Merck &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Reynolds</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 5).  The consistent gloss represents\nthe public understanding of the term.  We cannot make the\nsame assumption when widespread disagreement exists among the lower courts.  We must make do with giving the term its most plausible meaning using the traditional tools of statutory interpretation.  That is what we have done today.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act preempts all design-defect claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plaintiffs who seek compensation for injury or death caused by vaccine side effects.

But the appearance of the word \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d in this last-mentioned sentence cannot provide petitioners with much help.  That is because nothing in the Report suggests that the statute means the word \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d to summon up an otherwise unmentioned third exception encompassing suits based on design defects.  Nor can the Report\xe2\x80\x99s reference to comment <em>k</em> fill the gap.

It says nothing at all about who\xe2\x80\x94judge, jury, or federal safety agency\xe2\x80\x94should decide whether a safer vaccine could have been designed.  Indeed, at the time Congress wrote this Report, different state courts had come to very different conclusions about that matter.

The Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS) decides when a vaccine is safe enough to\nbe licensed and which licensed vaccines, with which\nassociated injuries, should be placed on the Vaccine In-\njury Table.  42 U.

A special master in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s compensation program determines whether someone has suffered an injury listed on the Injury Table and, if not, whether the vaccine nonetheless caused the injury.  <em>Ante,</em> at 3\xe2\x80\x934; \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9313.  To allow a jury in effect to second-guess those determinations is to substitute less expert for more expert judgment, thereby threatening manufacturers with liability (indeed, strict liability) in instances where any conflict between experts and nonexperts is likely to be particularly severe\xe2\x80\x94instances where Congress intended the contrary.  That is because potential tort plaintiffs are unlikely to bring suit unless the specialized compensation program has determined that they are not entitled to compensation (say, because it concludes that the vaccine did not cause the injury).  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 28 (\xe2\x80\x9c99.8% of successful Compensation Program claimants have accepted their awards, foregoing any tort remedies against vaccine manufacturers\xe2\x80\x9d).

Until today, that duty was enforceable through a traditional state-law tort action for defective design.  In holding that \xc2\xa722(b)(1) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Vaccine Act or Act), 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1), pre-empts all design defect claims for injuries stemming from vaccines covered under the Act, the Court imposes its own bare policy preference over the considered judgment of Congress.  In doing so, the Court excises 13 words from the statutory text, misconstrues the Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history, and disturbs the careful balance Congress struck between compensating vaccine-injured children and stabilizing the childhood vaccine market.  Its decision leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately take account of scientific and technological advancements when designing or distributing their products.  Because nothing in the text, structure, or legislative history of the Vaccine Act remotely suggests that Congress intended such a result, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 22 of the Vaccine Act provides \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tandards of responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d to govern civil actions against vaccine manufacturers.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322.  Section 22(a) sets forth the \xe2\x80\x9c[g]eneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cState law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(a).  This baseline rule that state law applies is subject to three narrow exceptions, one of which, \xc2\xa722(b)(1), is at issue in this case.  Section 22(b)(1) provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was\naccompanied by proper directions and warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe provision contains two key clauses: \xe2\x80\x9cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d (the \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause), and \xe2\x80\x9ceven though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings\xe2\x80\x9d (the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Blackletter products liability law generally recognizes three different types of product defects: design defects, manufacturing defects, and labeling defects (<em>e.g.</em>, failure to warn).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The reference in the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause to a \xe2\x80\x9cproperly prepared\xe2\x80\x9d vaccine \xe2\x80\x9caccompanied by proper directions and warnings\xe2\x80\x9d is an obvious reference to two such defects\xe2\x80\x94manufacturing and labeling defects.  The plain terms of the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause thus indicate that \xc2\xa722(b)(1) applies only where neither kind of defect is present.  Because \xc2\xa722(b)(1) is invoked by vaccine manufacturers as a defense to tort liability, it follows that the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause requires a vaccine manufacturer in each civil action to demonstrate that its vaccine is free from manufacturing and labeling defects to fall within the liability exemption of \xc2\xa722(b)(1).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given that the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause requires the absence of manufacturing and labeling defects, the \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cside effects that were unavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d must refer to side effects caused by something other than manufacturing and labeling defects.  The only remaining kind of product defect recognized under traditional products liability law is a design defect.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cside effects that were unavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d must refer to side effects caused by a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s <em>design </em>that were \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>Because \xc2\xa722(b)(1) uses the conditional term \xe2\x80\x9cif,\xe2\x80\x9d moreover, the text plainly implies that some side effects stemming from a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s design are \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable,\xe2\x80\x9d while others are avoidable.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1124 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cin the event that,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cso long as,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9con condition that\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, because the \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause (like the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause) sets forth a condition to invoke \xc2\xa722(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s defense to tort liability, Congress must also have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate in each civil action that the particular side effects of a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s design were \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of conditional \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clauses in two other provisions of the Vaccine Act supports the conclusion that \xc2\xa722(b)(1) requires an inquiry in each case in which a manufacturer seeks to invoke the provision\xe2\x80\x99s exception to state tort liability.  In \xc2\xa722(b)(2), Congress created a presumption that, for purposes of \xc2\xa722(b)(1), \xe2\x80\x9ca vaccine shall be presumed to be accompanied by proper directions and warnings if<em> </em>the vaccine manufacturer shows that it complied in all material respects with\xe2\x80\x9d federal labeling requirements.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(2).  Similarly, in \xc2\xa723(d)(2), Congress created an exemption from punitive damages \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f . . . the manufacturer shows that it complied, in all material respects,\xe2\x80\x9d with applicable federal laws, unless it engages in \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cintentional and wrongful withholding of information\xe2\x80\x9d from federal regulators, or \xe2\x80\x9cother criminal or illegal activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9323(d)(2).  It would be highly anomalous for Congress to use a conditional \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa722(b)(2) and 23(d)(2) to require a specific inquiry in each case while using the same conditional \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause in \xc2\xa722(b)(1) to denote a categorical exemption from liability.  Cf. <em>Erlenbaugh</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/239/index.html">409 U. S. 239</a>, 243 (1972) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] legislative body generally uses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a given context\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, when Congress intends to pre-empt design defect claims categorically, it does so using categorical (<em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d) and/or declarative language (<em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d), rather than a conditional term (\xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).

Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s categorical reading, petitioners correctly contend that, where a plaintiff has proved that she has suffered an injury resulting from a side effect caused by\na vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s design, a vaccine manufacturer may invoke \xc2\xa722(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s liability exemption only if it demonstrates that the side effect stemming from the particular vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s design is \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the vaccine is otherwise free from manufacturing and labeling defects.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legislative history confirms petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xc2\xa722(b)(1) and sheds further light on its pre-emptive scope.

That intent, in turn, is manifested in the plain text of \xc2\xa722(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94in particular, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as the phrases \xe2\x80\x9cproperly prepared\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caccompanied by proper directions and warnings,\xe2\x80\x9d which were taken nearly verbatim from comment <em>k</em>.  42 U.

By the time of the Vaccine Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1986, numerous state and federal courts had interpreted comment <em>k</em> to mean that a product is \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably unsafe\xe2\x80\x9d when, given proper manufacture and labeling, no feasible alternative design would reduce the safety risks without compromising the product\xe2\x80\x99s cost and utility.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 expressed intent to codify the \xe2\x80\x9cprinciple in Comment K,\xe2\x80\x9d 1986 Report 26, the term \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa722(b)(1) is best understood as a term of art, which incorporates the commonly understood meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably unsafe\xe2\x80\x9d products under comment <em>k</em> at the time of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1986.  See <em>McDermott Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wilander</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/337/index.html">498 U.

The Report makes clear that \xe2\x80\x9cside effects that were unavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa722(b)(1) refers to side effects stemming from a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s design that were \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  By explaining what Congress meant by the term \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable,\xe2\x80\x9d moreover, the Report also confirms that whether a side effect is \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa722(b)(1) involves a specific inquiry in each case as to whether the vaccine \xe2\x80\x9cin the present state of human skill and knowledge cannot be made safe,\xe2\x80\x9d 1986 Report 26\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whether a feasible alternative design<em> </em>existed that would have eliminated the adverse side effects of the vaccine without compromising its cost and utility.  See Brief for Kenneth W. Starr et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>14\xe2\x80\x9315 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf a particular plaintiff could show that her injury at issue was avoidable \xe2\x80\xa6 through the use of a feasible alternative design for a specific vaccine, then she would satisfy the plain language of the statute, because she would have demonstrated that the side effects were <em>not</em> unavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d).  Finally, the Report confirms that the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause is properly read to establish two additional prerequisites\xe2\x80\x94proper manufacturing and proper labeling\xe2\x80\x94to qualify for \xc2\xa722(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s liability exemption.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the 1986 Report, one other piece of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history provides further confirmation of the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 textual reading of \xc2\xa722(b)(1).  When Congress enacted the Vaccine Act in 1986, it did not initially include a source of payment for the no-fault compensation program the Act established.  The Act thus \xe2\x80\x9cmade the compensation program and accompanying tort reforms contingent on the enactment of a tax to provide funding for the compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  1987 Report 690.  In 1987, Congress passed legislation to fund the compensation program.  The House Energy and Commerce Committee Report[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] accompanying that legislation specifically stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe codification of Comment (k) of The Restatement (Second) of Torts was not intended to decide as a matter of law the circumstances in which a vaccine should be deemed unavoidably unsafe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 691.  The Committee noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n amendment to establish \xe2\x80\xa6 that a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to develop [a] safer vaccine was not grounds for liability was rejected by the Committee during its original consideration of the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In light of that rejection, the Committee emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cthere should be no misunderstanding that the Act undertook to decide as a matter of law whether vaccines were unavoidably unsafe or not,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his question is left to the courts to determine in accordance with applicable law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, postenactment legislative history created by a subsequent Congress is ordinarily a hazardous basis from which to infer the intent of the enacting Congress.  See <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Finkelstein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/617/index.html">496 U. S. 617</a>, 631\xe2\x80\x93632 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part).  But unlike ordinary postenactment legislative history, which is justifiably given little or no weight, the 1987 Report reflects the intent of the Congress that enacted the funding legislation necessary to give operative effect to the principal provisions of the Vaccine Act, including \xc2\xa722(b)(1).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Congress in 1987 had a number of options before it, including adopting an entirely different compensation scheme, as the Reagan administration was proposing;[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] establishing different limitations on tort liability, including eliminating design defect liability, as pharmaceutical industry leaders were advocating;[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] or not funding the compensation program at all, which would have effectively nullified the relevant portions of the Act.  Because the tort reforms in the 1986 Act, including \xc2\xa722(b)(1), had no operative legal effect unless and until Congress provided funding for the compensation program, the views of the Congress that enacted that funding legislation are a proper and, indeed, authoritative guide to the meaning of \xc2\xa722(b)(1).  Those views, as reflected in the 1987 Report, provide unequivocal confirmation of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading of \xc2\xa722(b)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the text, structure, and legislative history of the Vaccine Act are fully consistent with petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading of \xc2\xa722(b)(1).  Accordingly, I believe \xc2\xa722(b)(1) exempts vaccine manufacturers from tort liability only upon a showing by the manufacturer in each case that the vaccine was properly manufactured and labeled, and that the side effects stemming from the vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s design could not have been prevented by a feasible alternative design that would have eliminated the adverse side effects without compromising the vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s cost and utility.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to the interpretation of \xc2\xa722(b)(1) set forth above, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation does considerable vio-lence to the statutory text, misconstrues the legislative history, and draws the wrong conclusions from the structure of the Vaccine Act and the broader federal scheme regulating vaccines.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a textual matter, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa722(b)(1) is fundamentally flawed in three central respects.  First, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s categorical reading rests on a faulty and untenable premise.  Second, its reading functionally excises 13 words from the statutory text, including the key term \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  And third, the majority entirely ignores the Vaccine Act\xe2\x80\x99s default rule preserving state tort law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin, the majority states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] side effect of a vaccine could <em>always </em>have been avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  From that premise, the majority concludes that the statute must mean that \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>design</em> of the vaccine is a given, not subject to question in the tort action,\xe2\x80\x9d because construing the statute otherwise would render \xc2\xa722(b)(1) a nullity.  <em>Ibid</em>.  A tort claimant, according to the majority, will always be able to point to a differently designed vaccine not containing the \xe2\x80\x9charmful element,\xe2\x80\x9d and if that were sufficient to show that a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s side effects were not \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute would pre-empt nothing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The starting premise of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, however, is fatally flawed.  Although in the most literal sense, as the majority notes, a side effect can always<em> </em>be avoided \xe2\x80\x9cby use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., this interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d would effectively read the term out of the statute, and Congress could not have intended that result.  Indeed, \xc2\xa722(b)(1) specifically uses the conditional phrase \xe2\x80\x9cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable,\xe2\x80\x9d which plainly indicates that Congress contemplated that there would be some instances in which a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s side effects are \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d and other instances in which they are not.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s premise that a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s side effects can always be \xe2\x80\x9cavoid[ed] by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, entirely ignores the fact that removing the \xe2\x80\x9charmful element\xe2\x80\x9d will often result in a less effective (or entirely ineffective) vaccine.  A vaccine, by its nature, ordinarily employs a killed or weakened form of a bacteria or virus to stimulate antibody production;[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] removing that bacteria or virus might remove the \xe2\x80\x9charmful element,\xe2\x80\x9d but it would also necessarily render the vaccine inert.  As explained above, the legislative history of the Vaccine Act and the cases interpreting comment <em>k</em> make clear that a side effect is \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa722(b)(1) only where there is no feasible alternative design that would eliminate the side effect of the vaccine without compromising its cost and utility.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s premise\xe2\x80\x94that side effects stemming from a vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s design are always avoidable\xe2\x80\x94is thus belied by the statutory text and legislative history of \xc2\xa722(b)(1).  And because its starting premise is invalid, its conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that the design of a vaccine is not subject to challenge in a tort action\xe2\x80\x94is also necessarily invalid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading suffers from an even more fundamental defect.  If Congress intended to exempt vaccine manufacturers categorically from all design defect liability, it more logically would have provided: \xe2\x80\x9cNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  There would have been no need for Congress to include the additional 13 words \xe2\x80\x9cthe injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>TRW Inc. </em>v. <em>Andrews</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/19/index.html">534 U. S. 19</a>, 31 (2001) (noting \xe2\x80\x9ccardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Bates</em> v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/431/index.html"></a><a href="/us/544/431/index.html">544 U. S. 431</a> (2005), this Court considered an analogous situation where an express pre-emption provision stated that certain States \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 436 (quoting 7 U.

The <em>Bates </em>Court stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cConspicuously absent from the submissions by [respondent] and the United States is any plausible alternative interpretation of \xe2\x80\x98in addition to or different from\xe2\x80\x99 that would give that phrase meaning.  Instead, they appear to favor reading those words out of the statute, which would leave the following: \xe2\x80\x98Such State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging.\xe2\x80\x99  This amputated version of [the statute] would no doubt have clearly and succinctly commanded the pre-emption of <em>all</em> state requirements concerning labeling.  That Congress added the remainder of the provision is evidence of its intent to draw a distinction between state labeling requirements that are pre-empted and those that are not.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 448\xe2\x80\x93449.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs with the statutory interpretation rejected by this Court in <em>Bates</em>, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa722(b)(1) functionally excises 13 words out of the statute, including the key term \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U.

Although the resulting \xe2\x80\x9camputated version\xe2\x80\x9d of the statutory provision \xe2\x80\x9cwould no doubt have clearly and succinctly commanded the pre-emption of <em>all</em> state\xe2\x80\x9d design defect claims, the fact \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat Congress added the remainder of the provision\xe2\x80\x9d is strong evidence of its intent not to pre-empt design defect claims categorically.  <em>Bates</em>, 544 U.

Corp. </em>v. <em>Ferrari</em>, 284 Ga. 384, 393, 668 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 236, 242 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98If Congress had intended to deprive injured parties of a long available form of compensation, it surely would have expressed that intent more clearly\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Bates</em>, 544 U. S., at 449)), cert. pending, No. 08\xe2\x80\x931120.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Strikingly, the majority concedes that its interpretation renders 13 words of the statute entirely superfluous.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe intervening passage (\xe2\x80\x98the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though\xe2\x80\x99) is unnecessary.  True enough\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nevertheless, the majority contends that \xe2\x80\x9cthe rule against giving a portion of text an interpretation which renders it superfluous \xe2\x80\xa6 applies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offending passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  According to the majority, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading of \xc2\xa722(b)(1) renders the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause superfluous because, to reach petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 desired outcome, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would suffice to say \xe2\x80\x98if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94full stop.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As explained above, however, the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause establishes two additional prerequisites\xe2\x80\x94proper manufacturing and proper labeling\xe2\x80\x94to qualify for \xc2\xa722(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption from liability.  Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s contention, then, the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause serves an important function by limiting the scope of the pre-emption afforded by the preceding \xe2\x80\x9cif\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d clause.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s only other textual argument is based on the <em>expressio unius</em>, <em>exclusio alterius</em> canon.  According to the majority, because blackletter products liability law generally recognizes three different types of product defects, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f all three were intended to be preserved, it would be strange [for Congress] to mention specifically only two\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, manufacturing and labeling defects in the \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand leave the third to implication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument, however, ignores that the default rule under the Vaccine Act is that state law is preserved.  As explained above, \xc2\xa722(a) expressly provides that the \xe2\x80\x9c[g]eneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d is that \xe2\x80\x9cState law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(a).  Because \xc2\xa722(a) already preserves state-law design defect claims (to the extent the exemption in \xc2\xa722(b)(1) does not apply), there was no need for Congress separately and expressly to preserve design defect claims in \xc2\xa722(b)(1).  Indeed, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 principal aim in enacting \xc2\xa722(b)(1) was not to preserve manufacturing and labeling claims (those, too, were already preserved by \xc2\xa722(a)), but rather, to federalize comment <em>k</em>-type protection for \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably unsafe\xe2\x80\x9d vaccines.  The \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xe2\x80\x9d clause simply functions to limit the applicability of that defense.  The lack of express language in \xc2\xa722(b)(1) specifically preserving design defect claims thus cannot fairly be understood as impliedly (and categorically) pre-empting such traditional state tort claims, which had already been preserved by \xc2\xa722(a).[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also suggests that if Congress wished to preserve design defect claims, it could have simply provided that manufacturers would be liable for \xe2\x80\x9cdefective manufacture, defective directions or warning, and defective design.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Putting aside the fact that \xc2\xa722(a) already preserves design defect claims (to the extent \xc2\xa722(b)(1) does not apply), the majority\xe2\x80\x99s proposed solution would not have fully effectuated Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  As the legislative history makes clear, Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d to effectuate its intent that the \xe2\x80\x9cprinciple in Comment K regarding \xe2\x80\x98unavoidably unsafe\xe2\x80\x99 products \xe2\x80\xa6 apply to the vaccines covered in the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d  1986 Report 26; see also 1987 Report 691.  At the time of the Vaccine Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1986, at least one State had expressly rejected comment <em>k</em>,[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] while many others had not addressed the applicability of comment <em>k</em> specifically to vaccines or applied comment <em>k</em> to civil actions proceeding on a theory other than strict liability (<em>e.g.</em>, negligence[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]).  A statute that simply stated that vaccine manufacturers would be liable for \xe2\x80\x9cdefective design\xe2\x80\x9d would be silent as to the availability of a comment <em>k</em>-type defense for \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidably unsafe\xe2\x80\x9d vaccines, and thus would not have fully achieved Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim of extending greater liability protection\nto vaccine manufacturers by providing comment <em>k</em>-type protection in all civil actions as a matter of federal law.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s structural arguments fare no better than its textual ones.  The principal thrust of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position is that, since nothing in the Vaccine Act or the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations governing vaccines expressly mentions design defects, Congress must have intended to remove issues concerning the design of FDA-licensed vaccines from the tort system.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  The flaw in that reasoning, of course, is that the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s silence on design defects existed long before the Vaccine Act was enacted.  Indeed, the majority itself concedes that the \xe2\x80\x9cFDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its intended use.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em>  And yet it is undisputed that prior to the Act, vaccine manufacturers had long been subject to liability under state tort law for defective vaccine design.  That the Vaccine Act did not itself set forth a comprehensive regulatory scheme with respect to design defects is thus best understood to mean not that Congress suddenly decided to change course <em>sub silentio</em> and pre-empt a longstanding, traditional category of state tort law, but rather, that Congress intended to leave the status quo alone (except, of course, with respect to those aspects of state tort law that the Act expressly altered).  See 1987 Report 691 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s intention to preclude court actions under applicable law.  The Committee\xe2\x80\x99s intent at the time of considering the Act \xe2\x80\xa6 was \xe2\x80\xa6 to leave otherwise applicable law unaffected, except as expressly altered by the Act\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also suggests that Congress necessarily intended to pre-empt design defect claims since the aim of such tort suits is to promote the development of improved designs and provide compensation for injured individuals, and the Vaccine Act \xe2\x80\x9cprovides other means for achieving both effects\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94most notably through the no-fault compensation program and the National Vaccine Program.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14, and nn. 57\xe2\x80\x9360 (citing 42 U.

But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position elides a significant difference between state tort law and the federal regulatory scheme.  Although the Vaccine Act charges the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the obligation to \xe2\x80\x9cpromote the development of childhood vaccines\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmake or assure improvements in . . . vaccines, and research on vaccines,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9327(a), neither the Act nor any other provision of federal law places a legal <em>duty</em> on vaccine manufacturers to improve the design of their vaccines to account for scientific and technological advances.  Indeed, the FDA does not condition approval of a vaccine on it being the most optimally designed among reasonably available alternatives, nor does it (or any other federal entity) ensure that licensed vaccines keep pace with technological and scientific advances.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Rather, the function of ensuring that vaccines are optimally designed in light of existing science and technology has traditionally been left to the States through the imposition of damages for design defects.

The normal competitive forces that spur innovation and improvements to existing product lines in other markets thus operate with less force in the vaccine market, particularly for vaccines that have already been released and marketed to the public.  Absent a clear statutory mandate to the contrary, there is no reason to think that Congress intended in the vaccine context to eliminate the traditional incentive and deterrence functions served by state tort liability in favor of a federal regulatory scheme providing only carrots and no sticks.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  See <em>Levine</em>, 555 U.

When viewed in the context of the Vaccine Act as a whole, \xc2\xa722(b)(1) is just one part of a broader statutory scheme that balances the need for compensating vaccine-injured children with added liability protections for vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable childhood vaccine market.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principal innovation of the Act was the creation of the no-fault compensation program\xe2\x80\x94a scheme funded entirely through an excise tax on vaccines.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Through that program, Congress relieved vaccine manufacturers of the burden of compensating victims of vaccine-related injuries in the vast majority of cases[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]\xe2\x80\x94an extremely significant economic benefit that \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionally creat[es] a valuable insurance policy for vaccine-related injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioners 10.  The structure and legislative history, moreover, point clearly to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intention to divert would-be tort claimants into the compensation program, rather than eliminate a longstanding category of traditional tort claims.  See 1986 Report 13 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Committee anticipates that the speed of the compensation program, the low transaction costs of the system, the no-fault nature of the required findings, and the relative certainty and generosity of the system\xe2\x80\x99s awards will divert a significant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, although complete pre-emption of tort claims would have eliminated the principal source of the \xe2\x80\x9cunpredictability\xe2\x80\x9d in the vaccine market, Congress specifically chose <em>not</em> to pre-empt state tort claims categorically.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(a) (providing as a \xe2\x80\x9c[g]eneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cState law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death\xe2\x80\x9d).  That decision reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 recognition that court actions are essential because they provide injured persons with significant procedural tools\xe2\x80\x94including, most importantly, civil discovery\xe2\x80\x94that are not available in administrative proceedings under the compensation program.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9312(d)(2)(E), (d)(3).  Congress thus clearly believed there was still an important function to be played by state tort law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of eliminating design defect liability entirely, Congress enacted numerous measures to reduce manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 liability exposure, including a limited regulatory compliance presumption of adequate warnings, see \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(2), elimination of claims based on failure\nto provide direct warnings to patients, \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(c), a heightened standard for punitive damages,<em> </em>\xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9323(d)(2), and, of course, immunity from damages for \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable\xe2\x80\x9d side effects, \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9322(b)(1).  Considered in light of the Vaccine Act as a whole, \xc2\xa722(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption from liability for unavoidably unsafe vaccines is just one part of a broader statutory scheme that reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 careful balance between providing adequate compensation for vaccine-injured children and conferring substantial benefits on vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable and predictable childhood vaccine supply.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision today disturbs that careful balance based on a bare policy preference that it is better \xe2\x80\x9cto leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine design to the FDA and the National Vaccine Program rather than juries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  To be sure, reasonable minds can disagree about the wisdom of having juries weigh the relative costs and benefits of a particular vaccine design.  But whatever the merits of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s\npolicy preference, the decision to bar all design defect claims against vaccine manufacturers is one that Congress must make, not this Court.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  By construing \xc2\xa722(b)(1) to pre-empt all design defect claims against vaccine manufacturers for covered vaccines, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one\xe2\x80\x94neither the FDA nor any other federal agency, nor state and federal juries\xe2\x80\x94ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately take account of scientific and technological advancements.  This concern is especially acute with respect to vaccines that have already been released and marketed to the public.  Manufacturers, given the lack of robust competition in the vaccine market, will often have little or no incentive to improve the designs of vaccines that are already generating significant profit margins.

There are some products which, in the present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use.  These are especially common in the field of drugs.  An outstanding example is the vaccine for the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious and damaging consequences when it is injected.  Since the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing and the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree of risk which they involve.  Such a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning, is not defective, nor is it <em>unreasonably</em> dangerous.  The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very reason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the prescription of a physician.  It is also true in particular of many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or perhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable risk.  The seller of such products, again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement 353\xe2\x80\x93354.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Smith ex rel.

Congress could, of course, adopt a regulatory regime that operates differently from state tort systems, and such a difference is not necessarily a reason to question Congress\xe2\x80\x99 pre-emptive intent.  In the specific context of the Vaccine Act, however, the relevant point is that this Court should not lightly assume that Congress intended <em>sub silentio</em> to displace a longstanding species of state tort liability where, as here, Congress specifically included an express saving clause preserving state law, there is a long history of state-law regulation of vaccine design, and pre-emption of state law would leave an important regulatory function\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, ensuring optimal vaccine design\xe2\x80\x94entirely unaddressed by the congressional substitute.</p>\n<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9cvaccine manufacturers fund from their sales\xe2\x80\x9d the compensation program is misleading.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.

Brief for Respondent 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  According to respondent, a ruling that \xc2\xa722(b)(1) does not pre-empt design defect claims could unleash a \xe2\x80\x9ccrushing wave\xe2\x80\x9d of tort litigation that would bankrupt vaccine manufacturers and deplete vaccine supply.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28.  This concern underlies many of the policy arguments in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s brief and appears to underlie the majority and concurring opinions in this case.  In the absence of any empirical data, however, the prospect of an onslaught of autism-related tort litigation by claimants denied relief by the Vaccine Court seems wholly speculative.  As an initial matter, the special masters in the autism cases have thus far uniformly rejected the alleged causal link between vaccines and autism.  See Brief for American Academy of Pediatrics et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 20\xe2\x80\x9321, n.\xc2\xa04 (collecting cases).  To be sure, those rulings do not necessarily mean that no such causal link exists,<em> </em>cf. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>29 (noting that injuries have been added to the Vaccine Injury Table for existing vaccines), or that claimants will not ultimately be able to prove such a link in a state tort action, particularly with the added tool of civil discovery.  But these rulings do highlight the substantial hurdles to recovery a claimant faces.  See <em>Schafer</em> v. <em>American Cyanamid Co.</em>, 20 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 5 (CA1 1994) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] petitioner to whom the Vaccine Court gives nothing may see no point in trying to overcome tort law\xe2\x80\x99s yet more serious obstacles to recovery\xe2\x80\x9d).  Trial courts, moreover, have considerable experience in efficiently handling and disposing of meritless products liability claims, and decades of tort litigation (including for design defect) in the prescription-drug context have not led to shortages in prescription drugs.  Despite the doomsday predictions of respondent and the various <em>amici</em> cited by the concurrence, <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, the possibility of a torrent of meritless lawsuits bankrupting manufacturers and causing vaccine shortages seems remote at best.  More fundamentally, whatever the merits of these policy arguments, the issue in this case is what Congress<em> </em>has decided, and as to that question, the text, structure, and legislative history compel the conclusion that Congress intended to leave the courthouse doors open for children who have suffered severe injuries from defectively designed vaccines.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s policy-driven decision to the contrary usurps Congress\xe2\x80\x99 role and deprives such vaccine-injured children of a key remedy that Congress intended them to have.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
