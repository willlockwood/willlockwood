S. 40</a></p><p> claiming that this statute violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] sought an injunction against its enforcement.  The state trial court upheld the statute, finding that its "avowed purpose" was "secular and not religious," and that the statute would "neither advance nor inhibit any religion or religious group" nor involve the State excessively in religious matters.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38-39.  The Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Kentucky affirmed by an equally divided court. 599 S.W.2d 157 (1980).  We reverse.</p>\n<p>This Court has announced a three-part test for determining whether a challenged state statute is permissible under the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution:</p>\n<p>"First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion . . . ; finally the statute must not foster \'an excessive government entanglement with religion.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html">403 U.

If a statute violates any of these three principles, it must be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="41">Page 449 U. S. 41</a></p><p> struck down under the Establishment Clause.  We conclude that Kentucky\'s statute requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school rooms has no secular legislative purpose, and is therefore unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth insists that the statute in question serves a secular legislative purpose, observing that the legislature required the following notation in small print at the bottom of each display of the Ten Commandments:</p>\n<p>"The secular application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States."</p>\n<p>1978 Ky. Acts, ch. 436, \xc2\xa7 1 (effective June 17, 1978), Ky.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 158.178 (1980).</p>\n<p>The trial court found the "avowed" purpose of the statute to be secular, even as it labeled the statutory declaration "self-serving."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 37.  Under this Court\'s rulings, however, such an "avowed" secular purpose is not sufficient to avoid conflict with the First Amendment.  In <em>Abington School District v. Schempp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html">374 U. S. 203</a></span> (1963), this Court held unconstitutional the daily reading of Bible verses and the Lord\'s Prayer in the public schools, despite the school district\'s assertion of such secular purposes as</p>\n<p>"the promotion of moral values, the contradiction to the materialistic trends of our times, the perpetuation of our institutions and the teaching of literature."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html#223">374 U. S. 223</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The preeminent purpose for posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in nature.  The Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and no legislative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact.  The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one\'s parents, killing or murder, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="42">Page 449 U. S. 42</a></p><p> adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness.  <em>See</em> Exodus 20:12-17; Deuteronomy 5:16-21. Rather, the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers:  worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord\'s name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.  <em>See</em> Exodus 20:1-11; Deuteronomy 5:6-15.</p>\n<p>This is not a case in which the Ten Commandments are integrated into the school curriculum, where the Bible may constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like.  <em>Abington School District v. Schempp, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html#225">374 U. S. 225</a></span>.  Posting of religious texts on the wall serves no such educational function.  If the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are to have any effect at all, it will be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments.  However desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion, it is not a permissible state objective under the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p>It does not matter that the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are financed by voluntary private contributions, for the mere posting of the copies under the auspices of the legislature provides the "official support of the State . . . Government" that the Establishment Clause prohibits.  374 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html#222">374 U. S. 222</a></span>; <em>see Engel v.

Such assistance has the obvious legitimate secular purpose of promoting educational opportunity.  The posting of the Ten Commandments on classroom walls has no such secular purpose.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.</p>\n<p>With no support beyond its own <em>ipse dixit,</em> the Court concludes that the Kentucky statute involved in this case "has <em>no</em> secular legislative purpose," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/39/case.html#41">449 U.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 37.  The Court\'s summary rejection of a secular purpose articulated by the legislature and confirmed by the state court is without precedent in Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  This Court regularly looks to legislative articulations of a statute\'s purpose in Establishment Clause cases </p><p><a class="page-number" name="44">Page 449 U.

The fact that the asserted secular purpose may overlap with what some may see as a religious objective does not render it unconstitutional.  As this Court stated in <em>McGowan v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/420/case.html">366 U.

Schempp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html">374 U. S. 203</a></span> (1963), repeatedly cited by the Court, is not to the contrary.  No statutory findings of secular purpose supported the challenged enactments in that case.  In one of the two cases considered in <em>Abington School District,</em> the trial court had determined that the challenged exercises were intended by the State to be religious exercises.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html#223">374 U.

S. 224</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court rejects the secular purpose articulated by the State because the Decalogue is "undeniably a sacred text," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/39/case.html#41">449 U. S. 41</a></span>.  It is equally undeniable, however, as the elected representatives of Kentucky determined, that the Ten Commandments have had a significant impact on the development of secular legal codes of the Western World.  The trial court concluded that evidence submitted substantiated this determination.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38.  <em>See also Anderson v. Salt Lake City Corp.,</em> 475 F.2d 29, 33 (CA10 1973) (upholding construction on public land of monument inscribed with Ten Commandments because they have "substantial secular attributes").  Certainly the State was permitted to conclude that a document with such secular significance should be placed before its students, with an appropriate statement of the document\'s secular import.  <em>See id.</em> at 34 ("It does not seem reasonable to require removal of a passive monument, involving no compulsion, because its accepted precepts, as a foundation for law, reflect the religious nature of an ancient era"). [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  <em>See also Opinion of the Justices,</em> 108 N.H. 97, 228 A.2d 161 (1967) (upholding placement of plaques with the motto "In God We Trust" in public schools).</p>\n<p>The Establishment Clause does not require that the public sector be insulated from all things which may have a religious </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 449 U. S. 46</a></p><p> significance or origin.  This Court has recognized that "religion has been closely identified with our history and government," <em>Abington School District, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html#212">374 U.

Kentucky has decided to make students aware of this fact by demonstrating the secular impact of the Ten Commandments.  The words of Justice Jackson, concurring in <em>McCollum v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/203/case.html">333 U.

Perhaps subjects such as mathematics, physics or chemistry are, or can be, completely secularized.  But it would not seem practical to teach either practice or appreciation of the arts if we are to forbid exposure of youth to any religious influences.  Music without sacred music, architecture minus the cathedral, or painting without the scriptural themes would be eccentric and incomplete, even from a secular point of view. . . .  I should suppose it is a proper, if not an indispensable, part of preparation for a worldly life to know the roles that religion and religions have played in the tragic story of mankind.  The fact is that, for good or for ill, nearly everything in our culture worth transmitting, everything which gives meaning to life, is saturated with religious influences, derived from paganism, Judaism, Christianity -- both Catholic and Protestant -- and other faiths accepted by a large part of the world\'s peoples.  One can hardly respect the system of education that would leave the student wholly ignorant of the currents of religious thought that move the world society for a part in which he is being prepared.
