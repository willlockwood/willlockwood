The law firms and the Government each offer a theory for why \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) expressly overrides the American Rule in the context of litigation in defense of a fee application, and the dissent embraces the latter.  Neither theory is persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We begin with the law firms\xe2\x80\x99 approach.  According to the firms, fee-defense litigation is part of the \xe2\x80\x9cservices rendered\xe2\x80\x9d to the estate administrator under \xc2\xa7330(a)(1).  See Brief for Petitioners 23\xe2\x80\x9330.  As explained above, that reading is untenable.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cservices\xe2\x80\x9d in this provision cannot be read to encompass adversarial fee-defense litigation.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <i>supra</i>.  Even the dissent agrees on this point.  See <i>post, </i>at 1 (opinion of Breyer, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, reading \xe2\x80\x9cservices\xe2\x80\x9d in this manner could end up compensating attorneys for the <i>unsuccessful</i> defense of a fee application.  The firms insist that \xe2\x80\x9cestates <i>do </i>benefit from fee defenses\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and thus receive a \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94because \xe2\x80\x9cthe estate has an interest in obtaining a just determination of the amount it should pay its professionals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that alleged interest\xe2\x80\x94and hence the supposed provision of a \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94exists whether or not a \xc2\xa7327(a) professional prevails in his fee dispute.  We decline to adopt a reading of \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) that would allow courts to pay professionals for arguing for fees they were found never to have been entitled to in the first place.  Such a result would not only require an unnatural interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cservices rendered,\xe2\x80\x9d but a particu-larly unusual deviation from the American Rule as well, as\xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost fee-shifting provisions permit a court to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees only to a \xe2\x80\x98prevailing party,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantially prevailing\xe2\x80\x99 party,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98successful\xe2\x80\x99 litigant,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Hardt</i>, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 253 (footnote omitted).  There is no indication that Congress departed from the American Rule in \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) with respect to fee-defense litigation, let alone that it did so in such an unusual manner.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory, embraced by the dissent, fares no better.  Although the United States agrees that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defense of a fee application does not <i>itself</i> qualify as an independently compensable service,\xe2\x80\x9d it nonetheless contends that \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation for such work is properly viewed as part of the compensation <i>for the underlying services</i> in the bankruptcy proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25.  According to the Government, if an attorney is not repaid for his time spent successfully litigating fees, his compensation for his actual \xe2\x80\x9cservices rendered\xe2\x80\x9d to the estate administrator in the underlying proceeding will be diluted.  <i>Id.,</i> at 18.  The United States thus urges us to treat fees for fee-defense work \xe2\x80\x9cas a component of \xe2\x80\x98reasonable compensation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 33; accord, <i>post, </i>at 1 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  We refuse to do so for several reasons.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">First and foremost, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory cannot be reconciled with the relevant text.  Section 330(a)(1) does not authorize courts to award \xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation\xe2\x80\x9d <i>simpliciter</i>, but \xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation <i>for actual, necessary services rendered by</i>\xe2\x80\x9d the \xc2\xa7327(a) professional.  \xc2\xa7330(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  Here, the contested award was tied to the firms\xe2\x80\x99 work on the fee-defense litigation and is correctly understood only as compensation for that work.  The Government and the dissent properly concede that litigation in defense of a fee application is not a \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7330(a)(1); it follows that the contested award was not \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d for a \xe2\x80\x9cservice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, the only way to reach their reading of the statute would be to excise the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfor actual, necessary services rendered\xe2\x80\x9d from the statute.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, \xc2\xa7330(a)(6) does not presuppose that courts are free to award compensation based on work that does not qualify as a service to the estate administrator.  That provision specifies that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny compensation awarded for the preparation of a fee application shall be based on the level and skill reasonably required to prepare the application.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government argues that because time spent <i>preparing</i> a fee application is compensable, time spent <i>defending</i> it must be too.  But the provision cuts the other way.  A \xc2\xa7327(a) professional\xe2\x80\x99s preparation of a fee application is best understood as a \xe2\x80\x9cservic[e] rendered\xe2\x80\x9d to the estate administrator under \xc2\xa7330(a)(1), whereas a professional\xe2\x80\x99s defense of that application is not.  By way of analogy, it would be natural to describe a car mechanic\xe2\x80\x99s preparation of an itemized bill as part of his \xe2\x80\x9cservices\xe2\x80\x9d to the customer because it allows a customer to understand\xe2\x80\x94and, if necessary, dispute\xe2\x80\x94his expenses.  But it would be less natural to describe a subsequent court battle over the bill as part of the \xe2\x80\x9cservices rendered\xe2\x80\x9d to the customer.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government used to understand that time spent preparing a fee application was different from time spent defending one for the purposes of \xc2\xa7330(a)(1).  Just a few years ago, the U.\xc2\xa0S. Trustee explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]easonable charges for preparing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fee applications .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are compensable .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because the preparation of a fee application is not required for lawyers practicing in areas other than bankruptcy as a condition to getting paid.\xe2\x80\x9d  78 Fed. Reg. 36250 (2013) (emphasis deleted).  By contrast, \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. defending .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fee applications\xe2\x80\x9d is ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cnot compensable,\xe2\x80\x9d the Trustee observed, as such time can be \xe2\x80\x9cproperly characterized as work that is for the benefit of the professional and not the estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To support its broader interpretation of \xc2\xa7330(a)(6), the Government, echoed by the dissent, relies on our remark in <i>Jean </i>that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e find no textual or logical argument for treating so differently a party\xe2\x80\x99s preparation of a fee application and its ensuing efforts to support that same application.\xe2\x80\x9d  496 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 162; see <i>post,</i> at 7.  But that use of <i>Jean</i> begs the question.  <i>Jean</i> addressed a statutory provision that everyone agreed authorized court-awarded fees for fee-defense litigation.  496 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 162.  The \xe2\x80\x9conly dispute\xe2\x80\x9d in that context was over what \xe2\x80\x9cfinding [was] necessary to support such an award.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  In resolving that issue, the Court declined to treat fee-application and fee-litigation work differently given that the relevant statutory text\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca court shall award to a prevailing party .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fees and other expenses .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. incurred by that party in any civil action\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94could not support such a distinction.  <i>Id.,</i> at 158.  Here, by contrast, the operative language\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94reaches only the fee-application work.  The fact that the provision at issue in <i>Jean </i>\xe2\x80\x9cdid not mention fee-defense work,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post, </i>at 5, is thus irrelevant.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s textual foothold for its argument is too insubstantial to support a deviation from the American Rule.  The open-ended phrase \xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone, is not the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cspecific and explicit provisio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress must provide in order to alter this default rule.  <i>Alyeska Pipeline</i>, 421 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 260.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Ultimately, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory rests on a flawed and irrelevant policy argument.  The United States contends that awarding fees for fee-defense litigation is a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial exception\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to the proper functioning of the Bankruptcy Code.  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>15, n.\xc2\xa07 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Absent this exception, it warns, fee-defense litigation will dilute attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and result in bankruptcy lawyers receiving less compensation than nonbankruptcy lawyers, thereby undermining the congressional aim of ensuring that talented attorneys will take on bankruptcy work.  Accord, <i>post, </i>at 3.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As an initial matter, we find this policy argument unconvincing.  In our legal system, <i>no</i> attorneys, regardless of whether they practice in bankruptcy, are entitled to receive fees for fee-defense litigation absent express statutory authorization.  Requiring bankruptcy attorneys to pay for the defense of their fees thus will not result inany disparity between bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy lawyers.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The United States nonetheless contends that uncompensated fee litigation in bankruptcy will be particularly costly because multiple parties in interest may object to fee applications, whereas nonbankruptcy fee litigation typically involves just a lawyer and his client.  But this argument rests on unsupported predictions of how the statutory scheme will operate in practice, and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in this case reveals the perils associ-ated with relying on such prognostications to interpretstatutes: The United States took the opposite view below, asserting that \xe2\x80\x9crequiring a professional to bear the normal litigation costs of litigating a contested request for payment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. dilutes a bankruptcy fee award no more than any litigation over professional fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Appellant United States Trustee in No. 11\xe2\x80\x93290 (SD Tex.), p. 15.  The speed with which the Government has changed its tune offers a good argument against substituting policy-oriented predictions for statutory text.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More importantly, we would lack the authority to rewrite the statute even if we believed that uncompensated fee litigation would fall particularly hard on the bank-ruptcy bar.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur unwillingness to soften the import of Con-gress\xe2\x80\x99 chosen words even if we believe the words lead to a harsh outcome is longstanding,\xe2\x80\x9d and that is no less true in bankruptcy than it is elsewhere.  <i>Lamie</i> v. <i>United States Trustee</i>,\n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 526,\n538 (2004)\n.  Whether or not the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory is desirable as a matter of policy, Congress has not granted us \xe2\x80\x9croving authority .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to allow counsel fees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whenever [we] might deem them warranted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Alyeska Pipeline</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 260.  Our job is to followthe text even if doing so will supposedly \xe2\x80\x9cundercut a basic objective of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post,</i> at 3.  Section 330(a)(1) itself does not authorize the award of fees for defending a fee application, and that is the end of the matter.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As we long ago observed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe general practice of the United States is in opposition\xe2\x80\x9d to forcing one side to pay the other\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and \xe2\x80\x9ceven if that practice [is] not strictly correct in principle, it is entitled to the respect of the court, till it is changed, or modified, by statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arcambel</i>, 3 Dall.<i>,</i> at 306 (emphasis deleted).  We follow that approach today.  Because \xc2\xa7330(a)(1) does not explic-itly override the American Rule with respect to fee-defense litigation, it does not permit bankruptcy courts to award compensation for such litigation.

And \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be extraordinary circumstances in which an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees\xe2\x80\x9d that justify additional compensation.  <i>Id.,</i> at 556.  These examples demonstrate that increased compensation is sometimes warranted to reflect exceptional effort or resources expended in order to attain one\xe2\x80\x99s fees.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In that vein, work performed in defending a fee application may, in some cases, be a relevant factor in calculating \xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Consider a bankruptcy attorney who earns $50,000\xe2\x80\x94a fee that reflects her hours, rates, and expertise\xe2\x80\x94but is forced to spend $20,000 defending her fee application against meritless objections.  It is within a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to decide that, taking into account the extensive fee litigation, $50,000 is an insufficient award.  The attorney has effectively been paid $30,000, and the bankruptcy court might understandably conclude that such a fee is not \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, this Court has previously acknowledged that work performed in defending a fee application is relevant to a determination of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  In <i>Commissioner </i>v. <i>Jean</i>,\n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 154\n\xe2\x80\x93166 (1990), the Court held that fee-defense work is compensable under the Equal Access to Justice Act,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A).  The Courtquoted with approval the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]enying attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees for time spent in obtaining them would dilute the value of a fees award by forcing attorneys into extensive, uncompensated litigation in order to gain any fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  496 U.\xc2\xa0S.,  at 162 (quoting <i>Gagne</i> v. <i>Maher</i>, 594 F.\xc2\xa02d 336, 344 (1979); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A contrary interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation\xe2\x80\x9d would undercut a basic objective of the statute.  Congress intended to ensure that high-quality attorneys and other professionals would be available to assist trustees in representing and administering bankruptcy estates.  To that end, Congress directed bankruptcy courts to consider \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the compensation is reasonable based on the customary compensation charged by comparably skilled practitioners in cases other than cases under\xe2\x80\x9d the Bankruptcy Code.  \xc2\xa7330(a)(3)(F).  Congress recognized that comparable compensation was necessary to ensure that professionals would \xe2\x80\x9cremain in the bankruptcy field.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93595, p. 330 (1977).  Cf. <i>Perdue</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 552 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 fee is a fee that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In some cases, the extensive process through which a bankruptcy professional defends his or her fees may be so burdensome that additional fees are necessary in order to maintain comparability of compensation.  In order to be paid, a professional assisting a trustee must file with the court a detailed application seeking compensation.  Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 2016(a).  The application will not be granted until after the court has conducted a hearing on the matter.  \xc2\xa7330(a)(1).  And \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court may, on its own motion or on the motion of the United States Trustee,the United States Trustee for the District or Region, the trustee for the estate, or any other party in interest, award compensation that is less than the amount of compensation that is requested.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7330(a)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By contrast, an attorney representing a private party, or a professional working outside of the bankruptcy context, generally faces fee objections made only by his or her client\xe2\x80\x94and those objections typically are made outside of court, at least initially.  This process is comparatively simple, involves fewer parties in interest, and does not necessarily impose litigation costs.  Consequently, in order to maintain comparable compensation, a court may find it necessary to account for the relatively burdensome fee-defense process required by the Bankruptcy Code.  Accounting for this process ensures that a professional is paid \xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority rests its conclusion upon an interpretation of the statutory language that I find neither legally necessary nor convincing.  The majority says that Congress, in writing the reasonable-compensation statute, did not \xe2\x80\x9cdisplace the American Rule with respect to fee-defense litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 5.  The American Rule normally requires \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach litigant\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cpa[y] his own attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, win or lose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hardt</i> v. <i>Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 242,\n253 (2010)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the American Rule is a default rule that applies only where \xe2\x80\x9ca statute or contract\xe2\x80\x9d does not \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[e] otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>And here, the statute \xe2\x80\x9cprovides otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Section 330(a)(1)(A) permits a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt [to] award .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by the trustee, examiner, ombudsman, professional person, or attorney and by any paraprofessional person employed by any such person.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court has recognized that through \xc2\xa7330(a), Congress \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e specific and explicit [its] provisio[n] for the allowance of attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus displaced the American Rule.  <i>Alyeska</i> <i>Pipeline Service Co.</i> v. <i>Wilderness Society</i>,\n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 240\n, and n. 33 (1975) (listing \xc2\xa7330(a)\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor among examples of provisions authorizing attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority suggests that the American Rule is not displaced with respect to fee-defense work in bankruptcy because \xc2\xa7330(a) does not specifically authorize fees for that particular type of work.  See <i>ante, </i>at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress did not expressly depart from the American Rule to permit compensation for fee-defense litigation by professionals hired to assist trustees in bankruptcy proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).  To the extent that the majority intends to impose a requirement that a statute must explicitly mention fee defense in order to provide compensation for that work, this requirement is difficult to reconcile with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Jean</i>.  There, the Court held that the Equal Access to Justice Act authorizes compensation for fee-defense work.  See<i> </i>496 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 160\xe2\x80\x93166.  The fee provision of the Equal Access to Justice Act, as enacted at the time, permitted an \xe2\x80\x9caward to a prevailing party .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of fees and other expenses .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. incurred by that party in any civil action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. brought by or against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 158 (quoting\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A) (1988 ed.)).  The provision did not mention fee-defense work\xe2\x80\x94but the Court nonetheless held that such work was compensable.  See <i>Jean, supra,</i> at 160\xe2\x80\x93166.  I would do the same here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority focuses on particular words that appear in the Equal Access to Justice Act: \xe2\x80\x9cfees,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante, </i>at 4.  But neither the term \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d nor the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d relates specifically to fee-defense work.  And even assuming that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d is more easily read to cover fee litigation than the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cactual, necessary services,\xe2\x80\x9d that difference here is beside the point.  I find the necessary authority in the words \xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d not the words \xe2\x80\x9cactual, necessary services.\xe2\x80\x9d  In order to ensure that each professional is paid <i>reasonably</i> for compensable services, a court must have the discretion to authorize pay reflecting fee-defense work.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority asserts that by interpreting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d I have effectively \xe2\x80\x9cexcise[d] the phrase \xe2\x80\x98for actual, necessary services rendered\xe2\x80\x99 from the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  But the majority misunder-stands my views.  The statute permits compensation for fee-defense work as a part of compensation <i>for the underlying services</i>.  Thus, where fee-defense work is not necessary to ensure reasonable compensation for some under-lying service, then under my reading of the statute, a court should not consider that work when calculating compensation.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, to the extent that the majority bases its decision on the specific words of \xc2\xa7330(a), its argument seems weak.  The majority disregards direct statutory evidence that Congress intended to give courts the authority to account for reasonable fee-litigation costs.  Section 330(a)(6) states that \xe2\x80\x9cany compensation awarded for the preparation of a fee application shall be based on the level and skill reasonably required to prepare the application.\xe2\x80\x9d  This provision does not authorize compensation, but rather <i>assumes</i> (through the words \xe2\x80\x9cany compensation awarded\xe2\x80\x9d) pre-existing authorization under \xc2\xa7330(a).  And the majority cannot convincingly explain why, under its reading of the statute, fee-application is a compensable \xe2\x80\x9cactual, necessary servic[e] rendered\xe2\x80\x9d to the estate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority asserts that a fee application, unlike fee defense, can be construed as a \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d to the bankruptcy estate.  See <i>ante, </i>at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  The majority draws an analogy between a fee application and an itemized bill prepared by a car mechanic.  See <i>ibid</i>.  It argues that, like an itemized bill, a fee application is a \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d to the customer.  But customers do not generally pay their mechanics for time spent preparing the bill.  A mechanic\xe2\x80\x99s bill is not a separate \xe2\x80\x9cservice,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather is a medium through which the mechanic conveys what he or she wants to be paid.  Similarly, a legal bill is not a \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d rendered to a client.  In fact, ASARCO concedes that attorneys do not charge their clients for time spent preparing legal bills.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  A bill prepared by an attorney, or another bankruptcy professional, is not a \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d to the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority suggests that a fee application <i>must</i> be a service \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98because the preparation of a fee application is not required for lawyers practicing in areas other than bankruptcy as a condition to getting paid.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10 (quoting 78 Fed. Reg. 36250 (2013)).  But if the existence of a legal requirement specific to bankruptcy were sufficient to make an activity a compensable service, then the time that a professional spends at a hearing defending his or her fees would also be compensable.  After all, the statute permits a court to award compensation only after \xe2\x80\x9ca hearing\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to the issue.  \xc2\xa7330(a)(1).  And there is no such requirement for most attorneys, who simply bill their clients and are paid their fees.  But the majority does not believe that preparing for or appearing at such a hearing\xe2\x80\x94an integral part of fee-defense work\xe2\x80\x94is compensable.  The majority simply cannot reconcile its narrow interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable compensation\xe2\x80\x9d with \xc2\xa7330(a)(6)\xe2\x80\x99s provision for fee-application preparation fees.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In my view, the majority is wrong to distinguish between the costs of fee preparation and the costs of fee litigation.  Cf. <i>Jean</i>, 496 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 162 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe find no textual or logical argument for treating .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. differently a party\xe2\x80\x99s preparation of a fee application and its ensuing efforts to support that same application\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the majority should not distinguish between the compensability of fee litigation under the Equal Access to Justice Act and fee litigation under the Bankruptcy Code.  Its decision to do so creates anomalies and undermines the basic purpose of the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x99s fee award provision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
