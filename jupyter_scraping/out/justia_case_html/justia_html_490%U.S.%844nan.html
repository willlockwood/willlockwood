The court\'s ultimate holding was that a bankruptcy court\'s injunction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="846">Page 490 U. S. 846</a></p><p> against the assessment of a state sales tax upon the proceeds of a trustee\'s liquidation sale of an inventory of skis also barred the collection of a use tax from the purchaser\'s lessees.  In the process of reaching its decision, the Ninth Circuit rejected an argument that a case well known to California bankruptcy lawyers as "<em>Goggin II</em>" [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] was wrongly decided.  The three-judge panel that heard the case concluded that it was not within its power -- "and not within its heart -- to change a rule of this circuit that has been in force for over thirty years."  <em>In re China Peak Resort,</em> 847 F.2d 570, 572 (1988).  Because the rule of "<em>Goggin II</em>" conflicts with the rule applied in other Circuits, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and because we have both the power and the duty to resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari.  488 U.S. 992 (1988). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="847">Page 490 U. S. 847</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The <em>Goggin</em> cases concerned the attempt by the California State Board of Equalization, petitioner here, to assess sales and use taxes on a bankruptcy liquidation sale.  In <em>Goggin I,</em> 191 F.2d 726 (CA9 1951), <em>cert. denied,</em> 342 U.S. 909 (1952), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the Board\'s attempt to assess a nondiscriminatory sales tax imposed on retailers to a liquidation sale made by a bankruptcy trustee under court order.  Although the court based its decision on a construction of state law that excluded the trustee from the definition of retailer, Judge Fee, in concurrence, wrote that the assessment constituted an unlawful tax upon court processes.  Six years later, Judge Fee, writing for the Circuit panel in <em>Goggin II,</em> made those views law.  245 F.2d 44 (CA9), <em>cert. denied,</em> 353 U.S. 961 (1957).  At issue was a California law which required the bankruptcy trustee to collect and remit use taxes imposed on the use of goods from a liquidation sale on which no sales tax had been paid.  The court held the tax unlawful, finding that, while it was nondiscriminatory, it nonetheless burdened the "essential processes" of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p>The <em>Goggin</em> opinions were based on two premises, each of which respondent argues supports the judgment here.  First, the court held that a tax on liquidation sales places a burden on the federal function of the bankruptcy court, and therefore violates principles of intergovernmental tax immunity first recognized in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).  Second, it found that a federal statute specifically authorizing the States to impose taxes on business operations of the bankruptcy trustee negated by implication their power to tax bankruptcy liquidations.  Neither argument is persuasive. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="848">Page 490 U. S. 848</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The argument that a tax on a bankruptcy liquidation sale places an undue burden on a governmental operation derives from the once-established view that a state tax on income or assets an individual receives from a contract with the Federal Government constituted a tax on the contract, and thereby imposed a burden on governmental operations.  <em>See, e.g., Panhandle Oil Co. v. Knox,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/218/case.html">277 U. S. 218</a></span> (1928); <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/113/case.html">Collector v. Day,</a></span></em> 11 Wall. 113 (1871); <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/41/435/case.html">Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County,</a></span></em> 16 Pet. 435 (1842); <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/27/449/case.html">Weston v. City Council of Charleston,</a></span></em> 2 Pet. 449 (1829).  The Court drew a distinction between a tax imposed on a Government agent\'s property and a tax imposed on its operations.  While the former was permissible, the latter was constitutionally proscribed.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/85/5/case.html">85 U. S. </a></span> v. Peniston,</em> 18 Wall. 5, 33 (1873); <em>McCulloch v. Maryland,</em> 4 Wheat. at 345 [argument of counsel; omitted in electronic version]; <em>see also James v. Dravo Contracting Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/134/case.html">302 U.

S. 163</a></span> (1937) (footnotes omitted) (Roberts, J., dissenting) ("No tax can be laid upon th[e] franchises or operations [of government instrumentalities], but their local property is subject to nondiscriminating state taxation").  Thus, although this Court held as early as 1904 that States could impose a property tax on a bankrupt estate, <em>see Swarts v. Hammer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/194/441/case.html">194 U. S. 441</a></span> (1904), other courts reasonably concluded that the State could not tax the operations of the bankruptcy trustee.  <em>See, e.g., In re Flatbush Gum Co.,</em> 73 F.2d 283 (CA2 1934), <em>cert. denied sub nom. New York v. Arnold,</em> 294 U.S. 713 (1935).</p>\n<p>In <em>James v. Dravo Contracting Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/134/case.html">302 U. S. 134</a></span> (1937), however, this Court rejected the distinction between a tax on the property of an agent and a tax on the agent\'s operations.  With the Court\'s decision in <em>Dravo Contracting,</em> "the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity started a long path in decline, and [it] has now been <em>thoroughly repudiated.\'"  <em>Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, ante</em> at 174 (quoting <em>South Carolina v. Baker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/505/case.html">485 U.

There is no claim, nor could there be, that the tax discriminates against bankruptcy trustees or those with whom they deal.  As Judge Augustus Hand observed on similar facts in 1936:</p>\n<p>"The purchaser at the judicial sale was only required to pay the same tax he would have been bound to pay if he had purchased from anyone else."</p>\n<p><em>In re Leavy,</em> 85 F.2d 25, 27 (CA2).

Nothing in the plain language of the statute, its legislative history, or the structure of the Bankruptcy Code indicates that Congress intended to exclude taxes on the liquidation process from those taxes the States may impose on the bankrupt estate.</p>\n<p>Eighty-five years ago, in <em>Swarts v. Hammer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/194/441/case.html">194 U. S. 441</a></span> (1904), we held that property in the hands of a bankruptcy trustee was subject to taxation by state and municipal authorities.  The appellant in that case argued, in much the same manner as respondent does here, that the transfer of assets to a bankruptcy trustee vested the Federal Government with exclusive control of the bankrupt estate, and that</p>\n<p>"no other sovereignty, be it State or foreign, is permitted to exercise any power that burdens or in any manner interferes with the distribution prescribed by the act."</p>\n<p>Statement, Specification of Error and Argument for Appellant in <em>Swarts v.

Although the majority may well be correct that <em>California State Board of Equalization v. Goggin,</em> 245 F.2d 44 (CA9) (<em>Goggin II</em>), <em>cert. denied,</em> 353 U.S. 961 (1957), is not good law, I respectfully dissent from the majority\'s resolution of an issue that is <em>res judicata</em> in this litigation.</p>\n<p>The history of this case, notably missing from the majority opinion, has its genesis in 1980, when China Peak Resort, Ltd., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief.  After a variety of proceedings, the receiver, Robert T. Ford, entered into negotiations with Snow Summit Ski Corporation and respondent Sierra Summit, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, for the sale of China Peak\'s assets.  <em>See In re China Peak Resort,</em> 847 F.2d 570, 571 (CA9 1988).  The sale was consummated with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and China Peak dismissed its bankruptcy petition.  After the sale, petitioner Board attempted to assess the debtor\'s principals </p><p><a class="page-number" name="855">Page 490 U. S. 855</a></p><p> and Mr. Ford for taxes on the sale of China Peak\'s assets to Snow Summit.  The bankruptcy trustee moved to reopen the bankruptcy case and filed an adversary proceeding on his own behalf and on behalf of the debtor, seeking to bar the tax assessment.  After full briefing, the Bankruptcy Court found that the sale amounted to a liquidation of the China Peak estate and that, therefore, a tax on the sale was prohibited by <em>Goggin II</em>.  <em>In re China Peak,</em> Advisory Proceeding No. 183-0344 (Bkrtcy.Ct.ED Cal.1983), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-27.  The Bankruptcy Court\'s judgment prohibited the Board from assessing or enforcing any tax against the trustee, China Peak, its principals, or other parties "by reason of the sale of the assets of China Peak Resort, Ltd. to Snow Summit."  <em>Id.</em> at A-28.  <em>Petitioner did not appeal this 1983 judgment,</em> and it became final when the time for appeal expired later that year.</p>\n<p>The instant case arose when petitioner attempted to assess a use tax against Sierra Summit for revenues collected from the rental of ski equipment obtained in the China Peak sale.  Sierra Summit claimed that the 1983 order precluded the assessment of these taxes, and sought enforcement of the injunction.  The Court of Appeals ultimately granted Sierra Summit relief, remanding the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to issue a contempt citation against petitioner.  847 F.2d at 572-573.</p>\n<p>Petitioner now argues to this Court, and the majority agrees, that <em>Goggin II</em> -- the legal basis for the order from which the contempt arises -- was wrongly decided.  In my view, petitioner\'s challenge to the wisdom of <em>Goggin II</em> comes far too late.  Petitioner had ample opportunity to challenge the continuing validity of <em>Goggin II</em> in the litigation resulting in the 1983 order, but failed to appeal the adverse judgment.  That final judgment, and the legal precedents underlying it, are not now subject to collateral attack in these contempt proceedings.  This Court, in <em>Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/394/case.html">452 U. S. 394</a></span> (1981), wrote: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="856">Page 490 U.

S. 56</a></span> (1948), the Court applied these principles in a situation strikingly similar to the case at hand.  There, in an appeal from a contempt order, the losing party attempted to challenge the merits of the judgment that he violated.  The Court refused to hear the challenge because,</p>\n<p>"when completed and terminated in a final order, [the decision] becomes <em>res judicata,</em> and not subject to collateral attack in the contempt proceedings."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/56/case.html#68">333 U. S. 68</a></span>.  The Court elaborated:</p>\n<p>"It would be a disservice to the law if we were to depart from the longstanding rule that a contempt proceeding does not open to reconsideration the legal or factual basis of the order alleged to have been disobeyed, and thus become a retrial of the original controversy. . . .

S. 69</a></span>.</p>\n<p>None of the cases cited by the majority as authorizing its race to the merits persuades me to set aside these time-honored principles of appellate review.  <em>See ante</em> at 846-847, n. 3.  Neither <em>Canton v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/378/case.html">489 U. S. 378</a></span> (1989), nor <em>Oklahoma City v. Tuttle,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/808/case.html">471 U. S. 808</a></span> (1985), concerned the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em> <em>Donovan v. City of Dallas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/408/case.html">377 U. S. 408</a></span> (1964), did involve review both of a contempt citation and of the order underlying the contempt.  In contrast to this case, however, the Court in <em>Donovan</em> did not reach the merits of a final underlying order as part of its review of a contempt citation.  Rather, the Court simultaneously </p><p><a class="page-number" name="857">Page 490 U. S. 857</a></p><p> granted Donovan\'s petition for certiorari seeking review of the underlying State Supreme Court injunction and his separate petition seeking review of the subsequent contempt conviction.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/408/case.html#411">377 U. S. 411</a></span>.  Far from revisiting the merits of an unappealed judgment, the Court in <em>Donovan</em> reviewed the underlying judgment itself in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, in my view, the only issue properly before the Court is the application of the 1983 order to the facts underlying the issuance of the contempt citation.  Although of obvious importance to the parties, this wholly case-specific inquiry does not merit this Court\'s attention, and I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as having been improvidently granted.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
