BEVERIDGE, 4 U.S. 272 (1803)</h3><b> <p> 4 U.S. 272 (Dall.) </p><p> Bell <br/>v.<br/> Beveridge. </p><p> Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. </p></b><p><b> March Term, 1803</b> </p><p> THIS was an action upon an open policy, dated the 10th of March 1793, on goods on board the Andrew, capt. Macken, bound from Charleston to Amsterdam. The ship, sailing on the voyage insured, was captured, on the 11th of April 1793, by a French privateer, and carried into L\'Orient, where, after a few days detention, she was acquitted and restored. On the 26th of April 1793, however, the French government seized the cargo, for public use, promising to pay a liberal fixed price for it to the owners; but, after repeated solicitations, the consignee, in 1796, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="273">Page 4 U.S. 272, 273</a></p><p> abandoned the hope of seeing a performance of the promise, and returned to America. It appeared, on the trial of the cause, that the captain\'s protest, dated the 17th of May 1793, had been transmitted to the owners of the ship, in Philadelphia, under cover of a letter from Amsterdam, dated the 17th of May 1793; and the notice of the capture was given by them to the plaintiff, at least, as early as the month of August 1793. The yellow fever soon afterwards made its appearance in the city; and the plaintiff retired, with his family, into the country, on the 10th of September; but, in common with the rest of the citizens, he returned, after the calamity had ceased, about the 19th of November; and then went on a journey of business to South Carolina. It was not, however, until the 21st of January 1794, that he intimated to the underwriters an intention of abandonment; and, even then, he did not directly abandon, but only stated, in a letter, \'that he meant to abandon.\' </p><p> The general question was, whether the abandonment, had been made in due season, to entitle the plaintiff, in this case, to recover for a total loss? </p><p> The defendant contended, that the words of the letter from the plaintiff, did not amount to an actual abandonment; but only imported an intention to abandon; that by such equivocal language, he was enabled to take for himself all the chances of an advantageous settlement in France: while the defendant was not empowered to pursue the property on account of the underwriters; that, independent of the ambiguity of the letter, intimating his intention to abandon, the abandonment was not made in a reasonable time, on the 21st of January 1794, notice of the loss having been received in August 1793; and that the excuse of the yellow fever, though it would apply to a personal interview, would not apply to a communication by writing.

That an abandonment must be made within a reasonable time; but that what constituted a reasonable time, was a question of fact, depending upon the relative situation of the parties, the time, and the place, <font color="#005500" size="-1"><a name="274">[4 U.S. 272, 274]</a> <br/><br/><br/>\n</font></p></span></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n</font></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1948839">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> BELL v.
