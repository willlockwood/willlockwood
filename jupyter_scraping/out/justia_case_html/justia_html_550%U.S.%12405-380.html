S. 914</a>, decision that Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpartial birth abortion\xe2\x80\x9d statute violated the Federal Constitution, as interpreted in <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/833/index.html">505 U. S. 833</a>, and <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Wade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/index.html">410 U. S. 113</a>, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 (Act) to proscribe a particular method of ending fetal life in the later stages of pregnancy.  The Act does not regulate the most common abortion procedures used in the first trimester of pregnancy, when the vast majority of abortions take place.  In the usual second-trimester procedure, \xe2\x80\x9cdilation and evacuation\xe2\x80\x9d (D&amp;E), the doctor dilates the cervix and then inserts surgical instruments into the uterus and maneuvers them to grab the fetus and pull it back through the cervix and vagina.  The fetus is usually ripped apart as it is removed, and the doctor may take 10 to 15 passes to remove it in its entirety.  The procedure that prompted the federal Act and various state statutes, including Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s, is a variation of the standard D&amp;E, and is herein referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cintact D&amp;E.\xe2\x80\x9d  The main difference between the two procedures is that in intact D&amp;E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or largely intact with only a few passes, pulling out its entire body instead of ripping it apart.  In order to allow the head to pass through the cervix, the doctor typically pierces or crushes the skull.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act responded to <em>Stenberg</em> in two ways.  First, Congress found that unlike this Court in <em>Stenberg,</em> it was not required to accept the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings, and that that there was a moral, medical, and ethical consensus that partial-birth abortion is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.  Second, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language differs from that of the Nebraska statute struck down in <em>Stenberg</em>.  Among other things, the Act prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly perform[ing] a partial-birth abortion\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 that is [not] necessary to save the life of a mother,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531(a).  It defines \xe2\x80\x9cpartial-birth abortion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71531(b)(1), as a procedure in which the doctor: \xe2\x80\x9c(A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the [mother\xe2\x80\x99s] body \xe2\x80\xa6 , or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the [mother\xe2\x80\x99s] body \xe2\x80\xa6 , for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9c(B) performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the fetus.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, respondent abortion doctors challenged the Act\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality on its face, and the Federal District Court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting petitioner Attorney General from enforcing the Act in all cases but those in which there was no dispute the fetus was viable.  The court found the Act unconstitutional because it (1) lacked an exception allowing the prohibited procedure where necessary for the mother\xe2\x80\x99s health and (2) covered not merely intact D&amp;E but also other D&amp;Es.  Affirming, the Eighth Circuit found that a lack of consensus existed in the medical community as to the banned procedure\xe2\x80\x99s necessity, and thus <em>Stenberg</em> required legislatures to err on the side of protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s health by including a health exception.  In No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382, respondent abortion advocacy groups brought suit challenging the Act.  The District Court enjoined the Attorney General from enforcing the Act, concluding it was unconstitutional on its face because it (1) unduly burdened a woman\xe2\x80\x99s ability to choose a second-trimester abortion, (2) was too vague, and (3) lacked a health exception as required by <em>Stenberg</em>.  The Ninth Circuit agreed and affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Respondents have not demonstrated that the Act, as a facial matter, is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health exception.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9339.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The <em>Casey </em>Court reaffirmed what it termed <em>Roe</em>\xe2\x80\x99s three-part \xe2\x80\x9cessential holding\xe2\x80\x9d:\xc2\xa0First, a woman has the right to choose to have an abortion before fetal viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State.  Second, the State has the power to restrict abortions after viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies endangering the woman\xe2\x80\x99s life or health.  And third, the State has legitimate interests from the pregnancy\xe2\x80\x99s outset in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.  505 U. S., at 846.  Though all three are implicated here, it is the third that requires the most extended discussion.  In deciding whether the Act furthers the Government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in protecting fetal life, the Court assumes, <em>inter alia,</em>  that an undue burden on the previability abortion right exists if a regulation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the [woman\xe2\x80\x99s] path,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 878, but that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]egulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State \xe2\x80\xa6 may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of the right to choose,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 877.  <em>Casey </em>struck a balance that was central to its holding, and the Court applies <em>Casey</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard here.  A central premise of <em>Casey</em>\xe2\x80\x99s joint opinion\xe2\x80\x94that the government has a legitimate, substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life\xe2\x80\x94would be repudiated were the Court now to affirm the judgments below.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Act, on its face, is not void for vagueness and does not impose an undue burden from any overbreadth.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s text demonstrates that it regulates and proscribes performing the intact D&amp;E procedure.  First, since the doctor must \xe2\x80\x9cvaginally delive[r] a living fetus,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A), the Act does not restrict abortions involving delivery of an expired fetus or those not involving vaginal delivery, <em>e.g.,</em> hysterotomy or hysterectomy.  And it applies both previability and postviability because, by common understanding and scientific terminology, a fetus is a living organism within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb.  Second, because the Act requires the living fetus to be delivered to a specific anatomical landmark depending on the fetus\xe2\x80\x99 presentation, <em>ibid.,</em> an abortion not involving such partial delivery is permitted.  Third, because the doctor must perform an \xe2\x80\x9covert act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered fetus,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(B), the \xe2\x80\x9covert act\xe2\x80\x9d must be separate from delivery.  It must also occur after delivery to an anatomical landmark, since killing \xe2\x80\x9cthe partially delivered\xe2\x80\x9d fetus, when read in context, refers to a fetus that has been so delivered, <em>ibid.  </em>Fourth, given the Act\xe2\x80\x99s scienter requirements, delivery of a living fetus past an anatomical landmark by accident or inadvertence is not a crime because it is not \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberat[e] and intentiona[l], \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A).  Nor is such a delivery prohibited if the fetus [has not] been delivered \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Act is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.  It satisfies both requirements of the void-for-vagueness doctrine.  First, it provides doctors \xe2\x80\x9cof ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Grayned</em> v. <em>City of Rockford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/index.html">408 U. S. 104</a>, 108, setting forth \xe2\x80\x9crelatively clear guidelines as to prohibited conduct\xe2\x80\x9d and providing \xe2\x80\x9cobjective criteria\xe2\x80\x9d to evaluate whether a doctor has performed a prohibited procedure, <em>Posters \xe2\x80\x98N\xe2\x80\x99 Things, Ltd.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/513/index.html">511 U. S. 513</a>, 525\xe2\x80\x93526.  Second, it does not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.  <em>Kolender</em> v. <em>Lawson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/352/index.html">461 U. S. 352</a>, 357.  Its anatomical landmarks \xe2\x80\x9cestablish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Goguen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/566/index.html">415 U. S. 566</a>, 574, and its scienter requirements narrow the scope of its prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion, see <em>Kolender, supra</em>, at 358.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arbitrary enforcement arguments, furthermore, are somewhat speculative, since this is a preenforcement challenge.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the Act imposes an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on second-trimester abortions are too broad.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s text discloses that it prohibits a doctor from intentionally performing an intact D&amp;E.  Its dual prohibitions correspond with the steps generally undertaken in this procedure:\xc2\xa0The doctor (1) delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, usually past the anatomical landmark for a breech presentation, see \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A), and (2) proceeds to the overt act of piercing or crushing the fetal skull after the partial delivery, see \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(B).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s scienter requirements limit its reach to those physicians who carry out the intact D&amp;E, with the intent to undertake both steps at the outset.  The Act excludes most D&amp;Es in which the doctor intends to remove the fetus in pieces from the outset.  This interpretation is confirmed by comparing the Act with the Nebraska statute in <em>Stenberg.</em>  There, the Court concluded that the statute encompassed D&amp;E, which \xe2\x80\x9coften involve[s] a physician pulling a \xe2\x80\x98substantial portion\xe2\x80\x99 of a still living fetus \xe2\x80\xa6 , say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus,\xe2\x80\x9d 530 U. S., at 939, and rejected the Nebraska Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s limiting interpretation that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reference to a \xe2\x80\x9cprocedure\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ckill[s] the unborn child\xe2\x80\x9d was to a distinct procedure, not to the abortion procedure as a whole, <em>id.,</em> at 943.  It is apparent Congress responded to these concerns because the Act adopts the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdelivers a living fetus,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A), instead of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98delivering \xe2\x80\xa6 a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 530 U. S., at 938, thereby targeting extraction of an entire fetus rather than removal of fetal pieces; identifies specific anatomical landmarks to which the fetus must be partially delivered, \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A), thereby clarifying that the removal of a small portion of the fetus is not prohibited; requires the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially \xe2\x80\x9coutside the [mother\xe2\x80\x99s] body,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A), thereby establishing that delivering a substantial portion of the fetus into the vagina would not subject a doctor to criminal sanctions; and adds the overt-act requirement, \xc2\xa71531(b)(1), thereby making the distinction the Nebraska statute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General advanced).  Finally, the canon of constitutional avoidance, see, <em>e.g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</em> v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/index.html">485 U. S. 568</a>, 575, extinguishes any lingering doubt.  Interpreting the Act not to prohibit standard D&amp;E is the most reasonable reading and understanding of its terms.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contrary arguments are unavailing.  The contention that any D&amp;E may result in the delivery of a living fetus beyond the Act\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical landmarks because doctors cannot predict the amount the cervix will dilate before the procedure does not take account of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s intent requirements, which preclude liability for an accidental intact D&amp;E.  The evidence supports the legislative determination that an intact delivery is almost always a conscious choice rather than a happenstance, belying any claim that a standard D&amp;E cannot be performed without intending or foreseeing an intact D&amp;E.  That many doctors begin every D&amp;E with the objective of removing the fetus as intact as possible based on their belief that this is safer does not prove, as respondents suggest, that every D&amp;E might violate the Act, thereby imposing an undue burden.  It demonstrates only that those doctors must adjust their conduct to the law by not attempting to deliver the fetus to an anatomical landmark.  Respondents have not shown that requiring doctors to intend dismemberment before such a delivery will prohibit the vast majority of D&amp;E abortions.  Pp.\xc2\xa024\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0The Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, does not impose a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial obstacle\xe2\x80\x9d to late-term, but previability, abortions, as prohibited by the <em>Casey</em> plurality, 505 U. S., at 878.  Pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9337.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The contention that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s congressional purpose was to create such an obstacle is rejected.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s stated purposes are protecting innocent human life from a brutal and inhumane procedure and protecting the medical community\xe2\x80\x99s ethics and reputation.  The government undoubtedly \xe2\x80\x9chas an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 731.  Moreover, <em>Casey </em>reaffirmed that the government may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its profound respect for the life within the woman.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 505 U. S., at 873.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s ban on abortions involving partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Government\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.  Congress determined that such abortions are similar to the killing of a newborn infant.  This Court has confirmed the validity of drawing boundaries to prevent practices that extinguish life and are close to actions that are condemned.  <em>Glucksberg, supra,</em> at 732\xe2\x80\x93735, and n. 23.  The Act also recognizes that respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in a mother\xe2\x80\x99s love for her child.  Whether to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision, <em>Casey, </em>505 U. S., at 852\xe2\x80\x93853, which some women come to regret.  In a decision so fraught with emotional consequence, some doctors may prefer not to disclose precise details of the abortion procedure to be used.  It is, however, precisely this lack of information that is of legitimate concern to the State.  <em>Id., </em>at 873.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in respect for life is advanced by the dialogue that better informs the political and legal systems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole of the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abortion.  The objection that the Act accomplishes little because the standard D&amp;E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than intact D&amp;E, is unpersuasive.  It was reasonable for Congress to think that partial-birth abortion, more than standard D&amp;E, undermines the public\xe2\x80\x99s perception of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate role during delivery, and perverts the birth process.  Pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s failure to allow the banned procedure\xe2\x80\x99s use where \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for preservation of the [mother\xe2\x80\x99s] health,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ayotte</em> v. <em>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/320/index.html">546 U. S. 320</a>, 327\xe2\x80\x93328, does not have the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on the abortion right.  The Court assumes the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition would be unconstitutional, under controlling precedents, if it \xe2\x80\x9csubject[ed] [women] to significant health risks.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 328.  Whether the Act creates such risks was, however, a contested factual question below: The evidence presented in the trial courts and before Congress demonstrates both sides have medical support for their positions.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents instruct that the Act can survive facial attack when this medical uncertainty persists.  See, <em>e.g., Kansas</em> v. <em>Hendricks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/346/index.html">521 U. S. 346</a>, 360, n.\xc2\xa03.  This traditional rule is consistent with <em>Casey</em>, which confirms both that the State has an interest in promoting respect for human life at all stages in the pregnancy, and that abortion doctors should be treated the same as other doctors.  Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of legislative power in the abortion context any more than it does in other contexts.  Other considerations also support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, including the fact that safe alternatives to the prohibited procedure, such as D&amp;E, are available.  In addition, if intact D&amp;E is truly necessary in some circumstances, a prior injection to kill the fetus allows a doctor to perform the procedure, given that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition only applies to the delivery of \xe2\x80\x9ca living fetus,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A).  <em>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</em> v. <em>Danforth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/index.html">428 U. S. 52</a>, 77\xe2\x80\x9379, distinguished.  The Court rejects certain of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments.  On the one hand, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the Act should be upheld based on the congressional findings alone fails because some of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s recitations are factually incorrect and some of the important findings have been superseded.  Also unavailing, however, is respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contention that an abortion regulation must contain a health exception if \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular procedure could endanger women\xe2\x80\x99s health,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Stenberg</em>, 530 U. S., at 938.  Interpreting <em>Stenberg</em> as leaving no margin for legislative error in the face of medical uncertainty is too exacting a standard.  Marginal safety considerations, including the balance of risks, are within the legislative competence where, as here, the regulation is rational and pursues legitimate ends, and standard, safe medical options are available.  Pp.\xc2\xa031\xe2\x80\x9337.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.\xc2\xa0These facial attacks should not have been entertained in the first instance.  In these circumstances the proper means to consider exceptions is by as-applied challenge.  Cf. <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 546 U. S. ___, ___.  This is the proper manner to protect the woman\xe2\x80\x99s health if it can be shown that in discrete and well-defined instances a condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used.  No as-applied challenge need be brought if the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition threatens a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life, because the Act already contains a life exception.  18 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), a federal statute regulating abortion procedures.  In recitations preceding its operative provisions the Act refers to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Stenberg</em> v. <em>Carhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/914/index.html">530 U. S. 914</a> (2000), which also addressed the subject of abortion procedures used in the later stages of pregnancy.  Compared to the state statute at issue in <em>Stenberg</em>, the Act is more specific concerning the instances to which it applies and in this respect more precise in its coverage.  We conclude the Act should be sustained against the objections lodged by the broad, facial attack brought against it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380 <em>(Carhart)</em> respondents are LeRoy Carhart, William G. Fitzhugh, William H. Knorr, and Jill L. Vibhakar, doctors who perform second-trimester abortions.  These doctors filed their complaint against the Attorney General of the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.  They challenged the constitutionality of the Act and sought a permanent injunction against its enforcement.  <em>Carhart</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 331 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 805 (2004).  In 2004, after a 2-week trial, the District Court granted a permanent injunction that prohibited the Attorney General from enforcing the Act in all cases but those in which there was no dispute the fetus was viable.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1048.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  413 F.\xc2\xa03d 791 (2005).  We granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/1169/index.html">546 U. S. 1169</a> (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382 <em>(Planned Parenthood)</em> respondents are Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., Planned Parenthood Golden Gate, and the City and County of San Francisco.  The Planned Parenthood entities sought to enjoin enforcement of the Act in a suit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  <em>Planned Parenthood Federation of Am.</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 957 (2004).  The City and County of San Francisco intervened as a plaintiff.  In 2004, the District Court held a trial spanning a period just short of three weeks, and it, too, enjoined the Attorney General from enforcing the Act.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1035.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  435 F.\xc2\xa03d 1163 (2006).  We granted certiorari.  547 U. S. ___ (2006).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act proscribes a particular manner of ending fetal life, so it is necessary here, as it was in <em>Stenberg</em>, to discuss abortion procedures in some detail.  Three United States District Courts heard extensive evidence describing the procedures.  In addition to the two courts involved in the instant cases the District Court for the Southern District of New York also considered the constitutionality of the Act.  <em>Nat. Abortion Federation</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 436 (2004).  It found the Act unconstitutional, <em>id.,</em> at 493, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, <em>Nat. Abortion Federation</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 437 F.\xc2\xa03d 278 (2006).  The three District Courts relied on similar medical evidence; indeed, much of the evidence submitted to the <em>Carhart</em> court previously had been submitted to the other two courts.  331 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 809\xe2\x80\x93810.  We refer to the District Courts\xe2\x80\x99 exhaustive opinions in our own discussion of abortion procedures.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abortion methods vary depending to some extent on the preferences of the physician and, of course, on the term of the pregnancy and the resulting stage of the unborn child\xe2\x80\x99s development.  Between 85 and 90 percent of the approximately 1.3 million abortions performed each year in the United States take place in the first three months of pregnancy, which is to say in the first trimester.  <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 960, and n. 4; App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382, pp. 45\xe2\x80\x9348.  The most common first-trimester abortion method is vacuum aspiration (otherwise known as suction curettage) in which the physician vacuums out the embryonic tissue.  Early in this trimester an alternative is to use medication, such as mifepristone (commonly known as RU\xe2\x80\x93486), to terminate the pregnancy.  <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</em> at 464, n.\xc2\xa020.  The Act does not regulate these procedures.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of the remaining abortions that take place each year, most occur in the second trimester.  The surgical procedure referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cdilation and evacuation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cD&amp;E\xe2\x80\x9d is the usual abortion method in this trimester.  <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 960\xe2\x80\x93961.  Although individual techniques for performing D&amp;E differ, the general steps are the same.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A doctor must first dilate the cervix at least to the extent needed to insert surgical instruments into the uterus and to maneuver them to evacuate the fetus.  <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 465; App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382, at 61.  The steps taken to cause dilation differ by physician and gestational age of the fetus.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Carhart</em>, 331 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 852, 856, 859, 862\xe2\x80\x93865, 868, 870, 873\xe2\x80\x93874, 876\xe2\x80\x93877, 880, 883, 886.  A doctor often begins the dilation process by inserting osmotic dilators, such as laminaria (sticks of seaweed), into the cervix.  The dilators can be used in combination with drugs, such as misoprostol, that increase dilation.  The resulting amount of dilation is not uniform, and a doctor does not know in advance how an individual patient will respond.  In general the longer dilators remain in the cervix, the more it will dilate.  Yet the length of time doctors employ osmotic dilators varies.  Some may keep dilators in the cervix for two days, while others use dilators for a day or less.  <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 464\xe2\x80\x93465; <em>Planned Parenthood, supra</em>, at 961.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After sufficient dilation the surgical operation can commence.  The woman is placed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation.  The doctor, often guided by ultrasound, inserts grasping forceps through the woman\xe2\x80\x99s cervix and into the uterus to grab the fetus.  The doctor grips a fetal part with the forceps and pulls it back through the cervix and vagina, continuing to pull even after meeting resistance from the cervix.  The friction causes the fetus to tear apart.  For example, a leg might be ripped off the fetus as it is pulled through the cervix and out of the woman.  The process of evacuating the fetus piece by piece continues until it has been completely removed.  A doctor may make 10 to 15 passes with the forceps to evacuate the fetus in its entirety, though sometimes removal is completed with fewer passes.  Once the fetus has been evacuated, the placenta and any remaining fetal material are suctioned or scraped out of the uterus.  The doctor examines the different parts to ensure the entire fetal body has been removed.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 465; <em>Planned Parenthood, supra</em>, at 962.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some doctors, especially later in the second trimester, may kill the fetus a day or two before performing the surgical evacuation.  They inject digoxin or potassium chloride into the fetus, the umbilical cord, or the amniotic fluid.  Fetal demise may cause contractions and make greater dilation possible.  Once dead, moreover, the fetus\xe2\x80\x99 body will soften, and its removal will be easier.  Other doctors refrain from injecting chemical agents, believing it adds risk with little or no medical benefit.  <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 907\xe2\x80\x93912; <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 474\xe2\x80\x93475.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The abortion procedure that was the impetus for the numerous bans on \xe2\x80\x9cpartial-birth abortion,\xe2\x80\x9d including the Act, is a variation of this standard D&amp;E.  See M. Haskell, Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion (1992), 1 Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s App. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x933379 (CA8), p. 109 (hereinafter Dilation and Extraction).  The medical community has not reached unanimity on the appropriate name for this D&amp;E variation.  It has been referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cintact D&amp;E,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdilation and extraction\xe2\x80\x9d (D&amp;X), and \xe2\x80\x9cintact D&amp;X.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 440, n.\xc2\xa02; see also F. Cunningham et\xc2\xa0al., Williams Obstetrics 243 (22d ed. 2005) (identifying the procedure as D&amp;X); Danforth\xe2\x80\x99s Obstetrics and Gynecology 567 (J. Scott, R. Gibbs, B. Karlan, &amp; A. Haney eds. 9th ed. 2003) (identifying the procedure as intact D&amp;X); M. Paul, E. Lichtenberg, L. Borgatta, D. Grimes, &amp; P. Stubblefield, A Clinician\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to Medical and Surgical Abortion 136 (1999) (identifying the procedure as intact D&amp;E).  For discussion purposes this D&amp;E variation will be referred to as intact D&amp;E.  The main difference between the two procedures is that in intact D&amp;E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or largely intact with only a few passes.  There are no comprehensive statistics indicating what percentage of all D&amp;Es are performed in this manner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Intact D&amp;E, like regular D&amp;E, begins with dilation of the cervix.  Sufficient dilation is essential for the procedure.  To achieve intact extraction some doctors thus may attempt to dilate the cervix to a greater degree.  This approach has been called \xe2\x80\x9cserial\xe2\x80\x9d dilation.  <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 856, 870, 873; <em>Planned Parenthood, supra</em>, at 965.  Doctors who attempt at the outset to perform intact D&amp;E may dilate for two full days or use up to 25 osmotic dilators.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Dilation and Extraction 110; <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 865, 868, 876, 886.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an intact D&amp;E procedure the doctor extracts the fetus in a way conducive to pulling out its entire body, instead of ripping it apart.  One doctor, for example, testified:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIf I know I have good dilation and I reach in and the fetus starts to come out and I think I can accomplish it, the abortion with an intact delivery, then I use my forceps a little bit differently.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t close them quite so much, and I just gently draw the tissue out attempting to have an intact delivery, if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382, at 74.</p>\n<p align="left">\nRotating the fetus as it is being pulled decreases the odds of dismemberment.  <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 868\xe2\x80\x93869; App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, pp. 40\xe2\x80\x9341; 5 Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s App. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x933379 (CA8), p. 1469.  A doctor also \xe2\x80\x9cmay use forceps to grasp a fetal part, pull it down, and re-grasp the fetus at a higher level\xe2\x80\x94sometimes using both his hand and a forceps\xe2\x80\x94to exert traction to retrieve the fetus intact until the head is lodged in the [cervix].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carhart</em>, 331 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 886\xe2\x80\x93887.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Intact D&amp;E gained public notoriety when, in 1992, Dr. Martin Haskell gave a presentation describing his method of performing the operation.  Dilation and Extraction 110\xe2\x80\x93111.  In the usual intact D&amp;E the fetus\xe2\x80\x99 head lodges in the cervix, and dilation is insufficient to allow it to pass.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ibid.;</em> App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, at 577; App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382, at 74, 282.  Haskell explained the next step as\nfollows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers of the left [hand] along the back of the fetus and \xe2\x80\x9chooks\xe2\x80\x9d the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers (palm down).</p>\n<p>\n\n \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand.  He carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle finger.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen magnum.  Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents.  With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the patient.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.

Here is another description from a nurse who witnessed the same method performed on a 26-week fetus and who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby\xe2\x80\x99s legs and pulled them down into the birth canal.  Then he delivered the baby\xe2\x80\x99s body and the arms\xe2\x80\x94everything but the head.  The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The baby\xe2\x80\x99s little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking.  Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby\xe2\x80\x99s arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby\xe2\x80\x99s brains out.  Now the baby went completely limp\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98He cut the umbilical cord and delivered the placenta.  He threw the baby in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dr. Haskell\xe2\x80\x99s approach is not the only method of killing the fetus once its head lodges in the cervix, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe process has evolved\xe2\x80\x9d since his presentation.  Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 965.  Another doctor, for example, squeezes the skull after it has been pierced \xe2\x80\x9cso that enough brain tissue exudes to allow the head to pass through.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, at 41; see also <em>Carhart, supra, </em>at 866\xe2\x80\x93867, 874.  Still other physicians reach into the cervix with their forceps and crush the fetus\xe2\x80\x99 skull.  <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 858, 881.  Others continue to pull the fetus out of the woman until it disarticulates at the neck, in effect decapitating it.  These doctors then grasp the head with forceps, crush it, and remove it.  <em>Id.,</em> at 864, 878; see also <em>Planned Parenthood, supra</em>, at 965.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some doctors performing an intact D&amp;E attempt to remove the fetus without collapsing the skull.  See <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 866, 869.  Yet one doctor would not allow delivery of a live fetus younger than 24 weeks because \xe2\x80\x9cthe objective of [his] procedure is to perform an abortion,\xe2\x80\x9d not a birth.  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382, at 408\xe2\x80\x93409.  The doctor thus answered in the affirmative when asked whether he would \xe2\x80\x9chold the fetus\xe2\x80\x99 head on the internal side of the [cervix] in order to collapse the skull\xe2\x80\x9d and kill the fetus before it is born.  <em>Id.,</em> at 409; see also <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 862, 878.  Another doctor testified he crushes a fetus\xe2\x80\x99 skull not only to reduce its size but also to ensure the fetus is dead before it is removed.  For the staff to have to deal with a fetus that has \xe2\x80\x9csome viability to it, some movement of limbs,\xe2\x80\x9d according to this doctor, \xe2\x80\x9c[is] always a difficult situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, at 94; see <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 858.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0D&amp;E and intact D&amp;E are not the only second-trimester abortion methods.  Doctors also may abort a fetus through medical induction.  The doctor medicates the woman to induce labor, and contractions occur to deliver the fetus.  Induction, which unlike D&amp;E should occur in a hospital, can last as little as 6 hours but can take longer than 48.  It accounts for about five percent of second-trimester abortions before 20 weeks of gestation and 15 percent of those after 20 weeks.  Doctors turn to two other methods of second-trimester abortion, hysterotomy and hysterectomy, only in emergency situations because they carry increased risk of complications.  In a hysterotomy, as in a cesarean section, the doctor removes the fetus by making an incision through the abdomen and uterine wall to gain access to the uterine cavity.  A hysterectomy requires the removal of the entire uterus.  These two procedures represent about .07% of second-trimester abortions.  <em>Nat. Abortion Federation</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 467; <em>Planned Parenthood, supra</em>, at 962\xe2\x80\x93963.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After Dr. Haskell\xe2\x80\x99s procedure received public attention, with ensuing and increasing public concern, bans on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98partial birth abortion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d proliferated.  By the time of the <em>Stenberg</em> decision, about 30 States had enacted bans designed to prohibit the procedure.  530 U.

In 1996, Congress also acted to ban partial-birth abortion.  President Clinton vetoed the congressional legislation, and the Senate failed to override the veto.  Congress approved another bill banning the procedure in 1997, but President Clinton again vetoed it.  In 2003, after this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Stenberg</em>, Congress passed the Act at issue here.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 108\xe2\x80\x9358, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.

Congress determined that this Court in <em>Stenberg</em> \xe2\x80\x9cwas required to accept the very questionable findings issued by the district court judge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72(7), 117 Stat. 1202, notes following 18 U.

Second, the District Court found the Act deficient because it covered not merely intact D&amp;E but also certain other D&amp;Es.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1030\xe2\x80\x931037.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit addressed only the lack of a health exception.  413 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 803\xe2\x80\x93804.  The court began its analysis with what it saw as the appropriate question\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhether \xe2\x80\x98substantial medical authority\xe2\x80\x99 supports the medical necessity of the banned procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 796 (quoting <em>Stenberg</em>, 530 U. S., at 938).  This was the proper framework, according to the Court of Appeals, because \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a lack of consensus exists in the medical community, the Constitution requires legislatures to err on the side of protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s health by including a health exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  413 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 796.  The court rejected the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to demonstrate changed evidentiary circumstances since <em>Stenberg</em> and considered itself bound by <em>Stenberg</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that a health exception was required.  413 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 803 (explaining \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he record in [the] case and the record in <em>Stenberg </em>[were] similar in all significant respects\xe2\x80\x9d).

Like the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, it concluded the absence of a health exception rendered the Act unconstitutional.  The court interpreted <em>Stenberg</em> to require a health exception unless \xe2\x80\x9cthere is <em>consensus in the medical community</em> that the banned procedure is never medically necessary to preserve the health of women.\xe2\x80\x9d  435 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1173.  Even after applying a deferential standard of review to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings, the Court of Appeals determined \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial disagreement exists in the medical community regarding whether\xe2\x80\x9d the procedures prohibited by the Act are ever necessary to preserve a woman\xe2\x80\x99s health.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1175\xe2\x80\x931176.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals concluded further that the Act placed an undue burden on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s ability to obtain a second-trimester abortion.  The court found the textual differences between the Act and the Nebraska statute struck down in <em>Stenberg</em> insufficient to distinguish D&amp;E and intact D&amp;E.  435 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1178\xe2\x80\x931180.  As a result, according to the Court of Appeals, the Act imposed an undue burden because it prohibited D&amp;E.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1180\xe2\x80\x931181.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court of Appeals found the Act void for vagueness.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1181.  Abortion doctors testified they were uncertain which procedures the Act made criminal.

See <em>id.,</em> at 979\xe2\x80\x931002 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., <em>inter alios, </em>concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Whatever one\xe2\x80\x99s views concerning the <em>Casey</em> joint opinion, it is evident a premise central to its conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that the government has a legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life\xe2\x80\x94would be repudiated were the Court now to affirm the judgments of the Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Casey</em> involved a challenge to <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Wade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/index.html">410 U. S. 113</a> (1973).  The opinion contains this summary:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be stated at the outset and with clarity that <em>Roe</em>\xe2\x80\x99s essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts.  First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State.  Before viability, the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s effective right to elect the procedure.  Second is a confirmation of the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman\xe2\x80\x99s life or health.  And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.  These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 846 (opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThough all three holdings are implicated in the instant cases, it is the third that requires the most extended discussion; for we must determine whether the Act furthers the legitimate interest of the Government in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To implement its holding, <em>Casey</em> rejected both <em>Roe</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rigid trimester framework and the interpretation of <em>Roe</em> that considered all previability regulations of abortion unwarranted.  505 U. S., at 875\xe2\x80\x93876, 878 (plurality opinion).  On this point <em>Casey</em> overruled the holdings in two cases because they undervalued the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in potential life.  See <em>id.,</em> at 881\xe2\x80\x93883 (joint opinion) (overruling <em>Thornburgh</em> v. <em>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/747/index.html">476 U. S. 747</a> (1986) and <em>Akron</em> v. <em>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/index.html">462 U. S. 416</a> (1983)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We assume the following principles for the purposes of this opinion.  Before viability, a State \xe2\x80\x9cmay not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 879 (plurality opinion).  It also may not impose upon this right an undue burden, which exists if a regulation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 878.  On the other hand, \xe2\x80\x9c[r]egulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of the right to choose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 877.  <em>Casey</em>, in short, struck a balance.  The balance was central to its holding.  We now apply its standard to the cases at bar.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with a determination of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s operation and effect.  A straightforward reading of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text demonstrates its purpose and the scope of its provisions: It regulates and proscribes, with exceptions or qualifications to be discussed, performing the intact D&amp;E procedure.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents agree the Act encompasses intact D&amp;E, but they contend its additional reach is both unclear and excessive.  Respondents assert that, at the least, the Act is void for vagueness because its scope is indefinite.  In the alternative, respondents argue the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text proscribes all D&amp;Es.  Because D&amp;E is the most common second-trimester abortion method, respondents suggest the Act imposes an undue burden.  In this litigation the Attorney General does not dispute that the Act would impose an undue burden if it covered standard D&amp;E.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that the Act is not void for vagueness, does not impose an undue burden from any overbreadth, and is not invalid on its face.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act punishes \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly perform[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cpartial-birth abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  It defines the unlawful abortion in explicit terms.  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the person performing the abortion must \xe2\x80\x9cvaginally delive[r] a living fetus.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A).  The Act does not restrict an abortion procedure involving the delivery of an expired fetus.  The Act, furthermore, is inapplicable to abortions that do not involve vaginal delivery (for instance, hysterotomy or hysterectomy).  The Act does apply both previability and postviability because, by common understanding and scientific terminology, a fetus is a living organism while within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 971\xe2\x80\x93972.  We do not understand this point to be contested by the parties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of partial-birth abortion requires the fetus to be delivered \xe2\x80\x9cuntil, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  The Attorney General concedes, and we agree, that if an abortion procedure does not involve the delivery of a living fetus to one of these \xe2\x80\x9canatomical \xe2\x80\x98landmarks\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94where, depending on the presentation, either the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother\xe2\x80\x94the prohibitions of the Act do not apply.  Brief for Petitioner in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, p. 46.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, to fall within the Act, a doctor must perform an \xe2\x80\x9covert act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  For purposes of criminal liability, the overt act causing the fetus\xe2\x80\x99 death must be separate from delivery.  And the overt act must occur after the delivery to an anatomical landmark.  This is because the Act proscribes killing \xe2\x80\x9cthe partially delivered\xe2\x80\x9d fetus, which, when read in context, refers to a fetus that has been delivered to an anatomical landmark.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the Act contains scienter requirements concerning all the actions involved in the prohibited abortion.  To begin with, the physician must have \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately and intentionally\xe2\x80\x9d delivered the fetus to one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical landmarks.  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A).  If a living fetus is delivered past the critical point by accident or inadvertence, the Act is inapplicable.  In addition, the fetus must have been delivered \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  If either intent is absent, no crime has occurred.  This follows from the general principle that where scienter is required no crime is committed absent the requisite state of mind.  See generally 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa75.1 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave); 1 C. Torcia, Wharton\xe2\x80\x99s Criminal Law \xc2\xa727 (15th ed. 1993).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents contend the language described above is indeterminate, and they thus argue the Act is unconstitutionally vague on its face.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs generally stated, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kolender</em> v. <em>Lawson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/352/index.html">461 U. S. 352</a>, 357 (1983); <em>Posters \xe2\x80\x98N\xe2\x80\x99 Things, Ltd.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/513/index.html">511 U. S. 513</a>, 525 (1994).  The Act satisfies both requirements.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act provides doctors \xe2\x80\x9cof ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Grayned</em> v. <em>City of Rockford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/index.html">408 U. S. 104</a>, 108 (1972).  Indeed, it sets forth \xe2\x80\x9crelatively clear guidelines as to prohibited conduct\xe2\x80\x9d and provides \xe2\x80\x9cobjective criteria\xe2\x80\x9d to evaluate whether a doctor has performed a prohibited procedure.  <em>Posters \xe2\x80\x98N\xe2\x80\x99 Things, supra</em>, at 525\xe2\x80\x93526.  Unlike the statutory language in <em>Stenberg</em> that prohibited the delivery of a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial portion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the fetus\xe2\x80\x94where a doctor might question how much of the fetus is a substantial portion\xe2\x80\x94the Act defines the line between potentially criminal conduct on the one hand and lawful abortion on the other.  <em>Stenberg</em>, 530 U. S., at 922 (quoting Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa728\xe2\x80\x93326(9) (Supp. 1999)).  Doctors performing D&amp;E will know that if they do not deliver a living fetus\nto an anatomical landmark they will not face criminal liability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion is buttressed by the intent that must be proved to impose liability.  The Court has made clear that scienter requirements alleviate vagueness concerns.  <em>Posters \xe2\x80\x98N\xe2\x80\x99 Things, supra</em>, at 526; see also <em>Colautti</em> v. <em>Franklin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/379/index.html">439 U. S. 379</a>, 395 (1979) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court has long recognized that the constitutionality of a vague statutory standard is closely related to whether that standard incorporates a requirement of <em>mens rea</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Act requires the doctor deliberately to have delivered the fetus to an anatomical landmark.  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  Because a doctor performing a D&amp;E will not face criminal liability if he or she delivers a fetus beyond the prohibited point by mistake, the Act cannot be described as \xe2\x80\x9ca trap for those who act in good faith.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colautti, supra</em>, at 395 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents likewise have failed to show that the Act should be invalidated on its face because it encourages arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.  <em>Kolender, supra</em>, at 357.  Just as the Act\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical landmarks provide doctors with objective standards, they also \xe2\x80\x9cestablish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Goguen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/566/index.html">415 U. S. 566</a>, 574 (1974).  The scienter requirements narrow the scope of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion.  It cannot be said that the Act \xe2\x80\x9cvests virtually complete discretion in the hands of [law enforcement] to determine whether the [doctor] has satisfied [its provisions].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kolender, supra</em>, at 358 (invalidating a statute regulating loitering).  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments concerning arbitrary enforcement, furthermore, are somewhat speculative.  This is a preenforcement challenge, where \xe2\x80\x9cno evidence has been, or could be, introduced to indicate whether the [Act] has been enforced in a discriminatory manner or with the aim of inhibiting [constitutionally protected conduct].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hoffman Estates</em> v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/489/index.html">455 U. S. 489</a>, 503 (1982).  The Act is not vague.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We next determine whether the Act imposes an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on second-trimester abortions are too broad.  A review of the statutory text discloses the limits of its reach.  The Act prohibits intact D&amp;E; and, notwithstanding respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments, it does not prohibit the D&amp;E procedure in which the fetus is removed in parts.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act prohibits a doctor from intentionally performing an intact D&amp;E.  The dual prohibitions of the Act, both of which are necessary for criminal liability, correspond with the steps generally undertaken during this type of procedure.  First, a doctor delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, which is usually past the anatomical landmark for a breech presentation.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  Second, the doctor proceeds to pierce the fetal skull with scissors or crush it with forceps.  This step satisfies the overt-act requirement because it kills the fetus and is distinct from delivery.  See \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(B).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s intent<em> </em>requirements, however, limit its reach to those physicians who carry out the intact D&amp;E after intending to undertake both steps at the outset.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act excludes most D&amp;Es in which the fetus is removed in pieces, not intact.  If the doctor intends to remove the fetus in parts from the outset, the doctor will not have the requisite intent to incur criminal liability.  A doctor performing a standard D&amp;E procedure can often \xe2\x80\x9ctak[e] about 10\xe2\x80\x9315 \xe2\x80\x98passes\xe2\x80\x99 through the uterus to remove the entire fetus.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 962.  Removing the fetus in this manner does not violate the Act because the doctor will not have delivered the living fetus to one of the anatomical landmarks or committed an additional overt act that kills the fetus after partial delivery.  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A comparison of the Act with the Nebraska statute struck down in <em>Stenberg</em> confirms this point.  The statute in <em>Stenberg</em> prohibited \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U. S., at 922 (quoting Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa728\xe2\x80\x93326(9) (Supp. 1999)).  The Court concluded that this statute encompassed D&amp;E because \xe2\x80\x9cD&amp;E will often involve a physician pulling a \xe2\x80\x98substantial portion\xe2\x80\x99 of a still living fetus, say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U. S., at 939.  The Court also rejected the limiting interpretation urged by Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney General that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reference to a \xe2\x80\x9cprocedure\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98kill[s] the unborn child\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was to a distinct procedure, not to the abortion procedure as a whole.  <em>Id.,</em> at 943.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress, it is apparent, responded to these concerns because the Act departs in material ways from the statute in <em>Stenberg</em>.  It adopts the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdelivers a living fetus,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), instead of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98delivering\n. . . a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 530 U. S., at 938 (quoting Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa728\xe2\x80\x93326(9) (Supp. 1999)).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s language, unlike the statute in <em>Stenberg</em>, expresses the usual meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver\xe2\x80\x9d when used in connection with \xe2\x80\x9cfetus,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, extraction of an entire fetus rather than removal of fetal pieces.  See Stedman\xe2\x80\x99s Medical Dictionary 470 (27th ed. 2000) (defining deliver as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o assist a woman in childbirth\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o extract from an enclosed place, as the fetus from the womb, an object or foreign body\xe2\x80\x9d); see also I. Dox, B. Melloni, G. Eisner, &amp; J. Melloni, The HarperCollins Illustrated Medical Dictionary 160 (4th ed. 2001); Merriam Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Collegiate Dictionary 306 (10th ed. 1997).  The Act thus displaces the interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cdelivering\xe2\x80\x9d dictated by the Nebraska statute\xe2\x80\x99s reference to a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial portion\xe2\x80\x9d of the fetus.  <em>Stenberg, supra</em>, at 944 (indicating that the Nebraska \xe2\x80\x9cstatute itself specifies that it applies <em>both</em> to delivering \xe2\x80\x98an intact unborn child\xe2\x80\x99 <em>or </em>\xe2\x80\x98a substantial portion thereof\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  In interpreting statutory texts courts use the ordinary meaning of terms unless context requires a different result.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \xc2\xa747:28 (rev. 6th ed. 2000).  Here, unlike in <em>Stenberg</em>, the language does not require a departure from the ordinary meaning.  D&amp;E does not involve the delivery of a fetus because it requires the removal of fetal parts that are ripped from the fetus as they are pulled through the cervix.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The identification of specific anatomical landmarks to which the fetus must be partially delivered also differentiates the Act from the statute at issue in <em>Stenberg</em>.  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  The Court in <em>Stenberg</em> interpreted \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial portion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the fetus to include an arm or a leg.  530 U. S., at 939.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical landmarks, by contrast, clarify that the removal of a small portion of the fetus is not prohibited.  The landmarks also require the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially \xe2\x80\x9coutside the body of the mother.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A).  To come within the ambit of the Nebraska statute, on the other hand, a substantial portion of the fetus only had to be delivered into the vagina; no part of the fetus had to be outside the body of the mother before a doctor could face criminal sanctions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 938\xe2\x80\x93939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By adding an overt-act requirement Congress sought further to meet the Court\xe2\x80\x99s objections to the state statute considered in <em>Stenberg</em>.  Compare 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) with Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa728\xe2\x80\x93326(9) (Supp. 1999).  The Act makes the distinction the Nebraska statute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General advanced) by differentiating between the overall partial-birth abortion and the distinct overt act that kills the fetus.  See <em>Stenberg</em>, 530 U. S., at 943\xe2\x80\x93944.  The fatal overt act must occur after delivery to an anatomical landmark, and it must be something \xe2\x80\x9cother than [the] completion of delivery.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(B).  This distinction matters because, unlike intact D&amp;E, standard D&amp;E does not involve a delivery followed by a fatal act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The canon of constitutional avoidance, finally, extinguishes any lingering doubt as to whether the Act covers the prototypical D&amp;E procedure.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</em> v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/index.html">485 U. S. 568</a>, 575 (1988) (quoting <em>Hooper</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/155/648/index.html">155 U. S. 648</a>, 657 (1895)).  It is true this longstanding maxim of statutory interpretation has, in the past, fallen by the wayside when the Court confronted a statute regulating abortion.  The Court at times employed an antagonistic \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98canon of construction under which in cases involving abortion, a permissible reading of a statute [was] to be avoided at all costs.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Stenberg, supra</em>, at 977 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Thornburgh</em>, 476 U. S., at 829 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting)).  <em>Casey</em> put this novel statutory approach to rest.  <em>Stenberg, supra</em>, at 977 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  <em>Stenberg</em> need not be interpreted to have revived it.  We read that decision instead to stand for the uncontroversial proposition that the canon of constitutional avoidance does not apply if a statute is not \xe2\x80\x9cgenuinely susceptible to two constructions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Almendarez-Torres</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/224/index.html">523 U. S. 224</a>, 238 (1998); see also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Martinez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/371/index.html">543 U. S. 371</a>, 385 (2005).  In <em>Stenberg</em> the Court found the statute covered D&amp;E.  530 U. S., at 938\xe2\x80\x93945.  Here, by contrast, interpreting the Act so that it does not prohibit standard D&amp;E is the most reasonable reading and understanding of its terms.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary arguments by the respondents are unavailing.  Respondents look to situations that might arise during D&amp;E, situations not examined in <em>Stenberg</em>.  They contend\xe2\x80\x94relying on the testimony of numerous abortion doctors\xe2\x80\x94that D&amp;E may result in the delivery of a living fetus beyond the Act\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical landmarks in a significant fraction of cases.  This is so, respondents say, because doctors cannot predict the amount the cervix will dilate before the abortion procedure.  It might dilate to a degree that the fetus will be removed largely intact.  To complete the abortion, doctors will commit an overt act that kills the partially delivered fetus.  Respondents thus posit that any D&amp;E has the potential to violate the Act, and that a physician will not know beforehand whether the abortion will proceed in a prohibited manner.  Brief for Respondent Planned Parenthood et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382, p.\xc2\xa038.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reasoning, however, does not take account of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s intent requirements, which preclude liability from attaching to an accidental intact D&amp;E.  If a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s intent at the outset is to perform a D&amp;E in which the fetus would not be delivered to either of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical landmarks, but the fetus nonetheless is delivered past one of those points, the requisite and prohibited scienter is not present.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  When a doctor in that situation completes an abortion by performing an intact D&amp;E, the doctor does not violate the Act.  It is true that intent to cause a result may sometimes be inferred if a person \xe2\x80\x9cknows that that result is practically certain to follow from his conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 LaFave \xc2\xa75.2(a), at 341.  Yet abortion doctors intending at the outset to perform a standard D&amp;E procedure will not know that a prohibited abortion \xe2\x80\x9cis practically certain to follow from\xe2\x80\x9d their conduct.  <em>Ibid.</em>  A fetus is only delivered largely intact in a small fraction of the overall number of D&amp;E abortions.  <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 965.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence also supports a legislative determination that an intact delivery is almost always a conscious choice rather than a happenstance.  Doctors, for example, may remove the fetus in a manner that will increase the chances of an intact delivery.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382, at 74, 452.  And intact D&amp;E is usually described as involving some manner of serial dilation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Dilation and Extraction 110.  Doctors who do not seek to obtain this serial dilation perform an intact D&amp;E on far fewer occasions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Carhart</em>, 331 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 857\xe2\x80\x93858 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn order for intact removal to occur on a regular basis, Dr. Fitzhugh would have to dilate his patients with a second round of laminaria\xe2\x80\x9d).  This evidence belies any claim that a standard D&amp;E cannot be performed without intending or foreseeing an intact D&amp;E.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many doctors who testified on behalf of respondents, and who objected to the Act, do not perform an intact D&amp;E by accident.  On the contrary, they begin every D&amp;E abortion with the objective of removing the fetus as intact as possible.  See, <em>e.g., id.,</em> at 869 (\xe2\x80\x9cSince Dr. Chasen believes that the intact D &amp; E is safer than the dismemberment D &amp; E, Dr. Chasen\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to perform an intact D &amp; E every time\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id.,</em> at 873, 886.  This does not prove, as respondents suggest, that every D&amp;E might violate the Act and that the Act therefore imposes an undue burden.  It demonstrates only that those doctors who intend to perform a D&amp;E that would involve delivery of a living fetus to one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical landmarks must adjust their conduct to the law by not attempting to deliver the fetus to either of those points.  Respondents have not shown that requiring doctors to intend dismemberment before delivery to an anatomical landmark will prohibit the vast majority of D&amp;E abortions.  The Act, then, cannot be held invalid on its face on these grounds.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the principles accepted as controlling here, the Act, as we have interpreted it, would be unconstitutional \xe2\x80\x9cif its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Casey</em>, 505 U. S., at 878 (plurality opinion).  The abortions affected by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s regulations take place both previability and postviability; so the quoted language and the undue burden analysis it relies upon are applicable.  The question is whether the Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, imposes a substantial obstacle to late-term, but previability, abortions.  The Act does not on its face impose a substantial obstacle, and we reject this further facial challenge to its validity.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes are set forth in recitals preceding its operative provisions.  A description of the prohibited abortion procedure demonstrates the rationale for the congressional enactment.  The Act proscribes a method of abortion in which a fetus is killed just inches before completion of the birth process.  Congress stated as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cImplicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only newborns, but all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly difficult to protect such life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congressional Findings (14)(N), in notes following 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769.  The Act expresses respect for the dignity of human life.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress was concerned, furthermore, with the effects on the medical community and on its reputation caused by the practice of partial-birth abortion.  The findings in the Act explain:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cPartial-birth abortion \xe2\x80\xa6 confuses the medical, legal, and ethical duties of physicians to preserve and promote life, as the physician acts directly against the physical life of a child, whom he or she had just delivered, all but the head, out of the womb, in order to end that life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congressional Findings (14)(J), <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nThere can be no doubt the government \xe2\x80\x9chas an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.\xe2\x80\x9d  Washington</em> v. <em>Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 731 (1997); see also <em>Barsky</em> v. <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of N. Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/442/index.html">347 U. S. 442</a>, 451 (1954) (indicating the State has \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate concern for maintaining high standards of professional conduct\xe2\x80\x9d in the practice of medicine).  Under our precedents it is clear the State has a significant role to play in regulating the medical profession.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Casey </em>reaffirmed these governmental objectives.  The government may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its profound respect for the life within the woman.  A central premise of the opinion was that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents after <em>Roe</em> had \xe2\x80\x9cundervalue[d] the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in potential life.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 873 (plurality opinion); see also <em>id.,</em> at 871.  The plurality opinion indicated \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 874.  This was not an idle assertion.  The three premises of <em>Casey </em>must coexist.  See <em>id.,</em> at 846 (opinion of the Court).  The third premise, that the State, from the inception of the pregnancy, maintains its own regulatory interest in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child, cannot be set at naught by interpreting <em>Casey</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of a health exception so it becomes tantamount to allowing a doctor to choose the abortion method he or she might prefer.  Where it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s ban on abortions that involve partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Government\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.  No one would dispute that, for many, D&amp;E is a procedure itself laden with the power to devalue human life.  Congress could nonetheless conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition.  Congress determined that the abortion methods it proscribed had a \xe2\x80\x9cdisturbing similarity to the killing of a newborn infant,\xe2\x80\x9d Congressional Findings (14)(L), in notes following 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769, and thus it was concerned with \xe2\x80\x9cdraw[ing] a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congressional Findings (14)(G), <em>ibid.</em>  The Court has in the past confirmed the validity of drawing boundaries to prevent certain practices that extinguish life and are close to actions that are condemned.  <em>Glucksberg</em> found reasonable the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfear that permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia.\xe2\x80\x9d  521 U. S., at 732\xe2\x80\x93735, and n. 23.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child.  The Act recognizes this reality as well.  Whether to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision.  <em>Casey, supra</em>, at 852\xe2\x80\x93853 (opinion of the Court).  While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained.  See Brief for Sandra Cano et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, pp. 22\xe2\x80\x9324.  Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a decision so fraught with emotional consequence some doctors may prefer not to disclose precise details of the means that will be used, confining themselves to the required statement of risks the procedure entails.  From one standpoint this ought not to be surprising.  Any number of patients facing imminent surgical procedures would prefer not to hear all details, lest the usual anxiety preceding invasive medical procedures become the more intense.  This is likely the case with the abortion procedures here in issue.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Nat. Abortion Federation</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 466, n. 22 (\xe2\x80\x9cMost of [the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99] experts acknowledged that they do not describe to their patients what [the D&amp;E and intact D&amp;E] procedures entail in clear and precise terms\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id.,</em> at 479.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is, however, precisely this lack of information concerning the way in which the fetus will be killed that is of legitimate concern to the State.  <em>Casey, supra</em>, at 873 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cStates are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning\xe2\x80\x9d).  The State has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is well informed.  It is self-evident that a mother who comes to regret her choice to abort must struggle with grief more anguished and sorrow more profound when she learns, only after the event, what she once did not know: that she allowed a doctor to pierce the skull and vacuum the fast-developing brain of her unborn child, a child assuming the human form.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is a reasonable inference that a necessary effect of the regulation and the knowledge it conveys will be to encourage some women to carry the infant to full term, thus reducing the absolute number of late-term abortions.  The medical profession, furthermore, may find different and less shocking methods to abort the fetus in the second trimester, thereby accommodating legislative demand.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in respect for life is advanced by the dialogue that better informs the political and legal systems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole of the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abortion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is objected that the standard D&amp;E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than the intact D&amp;E, so that the legislation accomplishes little.  What we have already said, however, shows ample justification for the regulation.  Partial-birth abortion, as defined by the Act, differs from a standard D&amp;E because the former occurs when the fetus is partially outside the mother to the point of one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical landmarks.  It was reasonable for Congress to think that partial-birth abortion, more than standard D&amp;E, \xe2\x80\x9cundermines the public\xe2\x80\x99s perception of the appropriate role of a physician during the delivery process, and perverts a process during which life is brought into the world.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congressional Findings (14)(K), in notes following 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769.  There would be a flaw in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s logic, and an irony in its jurisprudence, were we first to conclude a ban on both D&amp;E and intact D&amp;E was overbroad and then to say it is irrational to ban only intact D&amp;E because that does not proscribe both procedures.  In sum, we reject the contention that the congressional purpose of the Act was \xe2\x80\x9cto place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U.

S., at 328.  Here, by contrast, whether the Act creates significant health risks for women has been a contested factual question.  The evidence presented in the trial courts and before Congress demonstrates both sides have medical support for their position.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents presented evidence that intact D&amp;E may be the safest method of abortion, for reasons similar to those adduced in <em>Stenberg</em>.  See 530 U. S., at 932.  Abortion doctors testified, for example, that intact D&amp;E decreases the risk of cervical laceration or uterine perforation because it requires fewer passes into the uterus with surgical instruments and does not require the removal of bony fragments of the dismembered fetus, fragments that may be sharp.  Respondents also presented evidence that intact D&amp;E was safer both because it reduces the risks that fetal parts will remain in the uterus and because it takes less time to complete.  Respondents, in addition, proffered evidence that intact D&amp;E was safer for women with certain medical conditions or women with fetuses that had certain anomalies.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Carhart</em>, 331 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 923\xe2\x80\x93929; <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 470\xe2\x80\x93474; <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 982\xe2\x80\x93983.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These contentions were contradicted by other doctors who testified in the District Courts and before Congress.  They concluded that the alleged health advantages were based on speculation without scientific studies to support them.  They considered D&amp;E always to be a safe alternative.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 930\xe2\x80\x93940; <em>Nat. Abortion Federation</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 470\xe2\x80\x93474;<em> Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 983.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is documented medical disagreement whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition would ever impose significant health risks on women.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 1033 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here continues to be a division of opinion among highly qualified experts regarding the necessity or safety of intact D &amp; E\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 482.  The three District Courts that considered the Act\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality appeared to be in some disagreement on this central factual question.  The District Court for the District of Nebraska concluded \xe2\x80\x9cthe banned procedure is, sometimes, the safest abortion procedure to preserve the health of women.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 1017.  The District Court for the Northern District of California reached a similar conclusion.  <em>Planned Parenthood, supra</em>, at 1002 (finding intact D&amp;E was \xe2\x80\x9cunder certain circumstances \xe2\x80\xa6 significantly safer than D &amp; E by disarticulation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The District Court for the Southern District of New York was more skeptical of the purported health benefits of intact D&amp;E.  It found the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexpert witnesses reasonably and effectively refuted [the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99] proffered bases for the opinion that [intact D&amp;E] has safety advantages over other second-trimester abortion procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nat. Abortion Federation</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 479.  In addition it did \xe2\x80\x9cnot believe that many of [the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99] purported reasons for why [intact D&amp;E] is medically necessary [were] credible; rather [it found them to be] theoretical or false.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 480.  The court nonetheless invalidated the Act because it determined \xe2\x80\x9ca significant body of medical opinion \xe2\x80\xa6 holds that D &amp; E has safety advantages over induction and that [intact D&amp;E] has some safety advantages (however hypothetical and unsubstantiated by scientific evidence) over D &amp; E for some women in some circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question becomes whether the Act can stand when this medical uncertainty persists.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents instruct that the Act can survive this facial attack.  The Court has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.  See <em>Kansas</em> v. <em>Hendricks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/346/index.html">521 U. S. 346</a>, 360, n. 3 (1997); <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/354/index.html">463 U.

Physicians are not entitled to ignore regulations that direct them to use reasonable alternative procedures.  The law need not give abortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of their medical practice, nor should it elevate their status above other physicians in the medical community.  In <em>Casey</em> the controlling opinion held an informed-consent requirement in the abortion context was \xe2\x80\x9cno different from a requirement that a doctor give certain specific information about any medical procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U. S., at 884 (joint opinion).  The opinion stated \xe2\x80\x9cthe doctor-patient relation here is entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>Webster</em> v. <em>Reproductive Health Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/490/index.html">492 U. S. 490</a>, 518\xe2\x80\x93519 (1989) (plurality opinion) (criticizing <em>Roe</em>\xe2\x80\x99s trimester framework because, <em>inter alia,</em> it \xe2\x80\x9cleft this Court to serve as the country\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ex officio</em> medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Mazurek</em> v. <em>Armstrong</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/968/index.html">520 U.

See <em>Hendricks, supra</em>, at 360, n.\xc2\xa03.  The medical uncertainty over whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition creates significant health risks provides a sufficient basis to conclude in this facial attack that the Act does not impose an undue burden.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that the Act does not impose an undue burden is supported by other considerations.  Alternatives are available to the prohibited procedure.  As we have noted, the Act does not proscribe D&amp;E.  One District Court found D&amp;E to have extremely low rates of medical complications.  <em>Planned Parenthood, supra</em>, at 1000.  Another indicated D&amp;E was \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally the safest method of abortion during the second trimester.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carhart</em>, 331 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1031; see also <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 467\xe2\x80\x93468 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xperts testifying for both sides\xe2\x80\x9d agreed D&amp;E was safe).  In addition the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition only applies to the delivery of \xe2\x80\x9ca living fetus.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If the intact D&amp;E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The instant cases, then, are different from <em>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</em> v. <em>Danforth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/index.html">428 U. S. 52</a>, 77\xe2\x80\x9379 (1976), in which the Court invalidated a ban on saline amniocentesis, the then-dominant second-trimester abortion method.  The Court found the ban in <em>Danforth</em> to be \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 79.  Here the Act allows, among other means, a commonly used and generally accepted method, so it does not construct a substantial obstacle to the abortion right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching the conclusion the Act does not require a health exception we reject certain arguments made by the parties on both sides of these cases.  On the one hand, the Attorney General urges us to uphold the Act on the basis of the congressional findings alone.  Brief for Petitioner in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, at 23.  Although we review congressional factfinding under a deferential standard, we do not in the circumstances here place dispositive weight on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 findings.  The Court retains an independent constitutional duty to review factual findings where constitutional rights are at stake.  See <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U. S. 22</a>, 60 (1932) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn cases brought to enforce constitutional rights, the judicial power of the United States necessarily extends to the independent determination of all questions, both of fact and law, necessary to the performance of that supreme function\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As respondents have noted, and the District Courts recognized, some recitations in the Act are factually incorrect.  See <em>Nat. Abortion Federation</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 482, 488\xe2\x80\x93491.  Whether or not accurate at the time, some of the important findings have been superseded.  Two examples suffice.  Congress determined no medical schools provide instruction on the prohibited procedure.  Congressional Findings (14)(B), in notes following 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769.  The testimony in the District Courts, however, demonstrated intact D&amp;E is taught at medical schools.  <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 490; <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1029.  Congress also found there existed a medical consensus that the prohibited procedure is never medically necessary.  Congressional Findings (1), in notes following 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 767.  The evidence presented in the District Courts contradicts that conclusion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Carhart, supra</em>, at 1012\xe2\x80\x931015; <em>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra</em>, at 488\xe2\x80\x93489; <em>Planned Parenthood, supra</em>, at 1025\xe2\x80\x931026.  Uncritical deference to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings in these cases is inappropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, relying on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Stenberg</em>, respondents contend that an abortion regulation must contain a health exception \xe2\x80\x9cif \xe2\x80\x98substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular procedure could endanger women\xe2\x80\x99s health.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, p. 19 (quoting 530 U. S., at 938); see also Brief for Respondent Planned Parenthood et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x931382, at 12 (same).  As illustrated by respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments and the decisions of the Courts of Appeals, <em>Stenberg</em> has been interpreted to leave no margin of error for legislatures to act in the face of medical uncertainty.  <em>Carhart</em>, 413 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 796; <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 435 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1173; see also <em>Nat. Abortion Federation</em>, 437 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 296 (Walker, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring) (explaining the standard under <em>Stenberg</em> \xe2\x80\x9cis a virtually insurmountable evidentiary hurdle\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A zero tolerance policy would strike down legitimate abortion regulations, like the present one, if some part of the medical community were disinclined to follow the proscription.  This is too exacting a standard to impose on the legislative power, exercised in this instance under the Commerce Clause, to regulate the medical profession.  Considerations of marginal safety, including the balance of risks, are within the legislative competence when the regulation is rational and in pursuit of legitimate ends.  When standard medical options are available, mere convenience does not suffice to displace them; and if some procedures have different risks than others, it does not follow that the State is altogether barred from imposing reasonable regulations.  The Act is not invalid on its face where there is uncertainty over whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve a woman\xe2\x80\x99s health, given the availability of other abortion procedures that are considered to be safe alternatives.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The considerations we have discussed support our further determination that these facial attacks should not have been entertained in the first instance.  In these circumstances the proper means to consider exceptions is by as-applied challenge.  The Government has acknowledged that preenforcement, as-applied challenges to the Act can be maintained.  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93380, pp. 21\xe2\x80\x9323.  This is the proper manner to protect the health of the woman if it can be shown that in discrete and well-defined instances a particular condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used.  In an as-applied challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in a facial attack.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The latitude given facial challenges in the First Amendment context is inapplicable here.  Broad challenges of this type impose \xe2\x80\x9ca heavy burden\xe2\x80\x9d upon the parties maintaining the suit.  <em>Rust</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/173/index.html">500 U. S. 173</a>, 183 (1991).  What that burden consists of in the specific context of abortion statutes has been a subject of some question.  Compare <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Akron Center for Reproductive Health</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/502/index.html">497 U. S. 502</a>, 514 (1990) (\xe2\x80\x9c[B]ecause appellees are making a facial challenge to a statute, they must show that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)), with <em>Casey</em>, 505 U. S., at 895 (opinion of the Court) (indicating a spousal-notification statute would impose an undue burden \xe2\x80\x9cin a large fraction of the cases in which [it] is relevant\xe2\x80\x9d and holding the statutory provision facially invalid).  See also <em>Janklow</em> v. <em>Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/1174/index.html">517 U. S. 1174</a> (1996).  We need not resolve that debate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the previous sections of this opinion explain, respondents have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases.  <em>Casey, supra</em>, at 895 (opinion of the Court).  We note that the statute here applies to all instances in which the doctor proposes to use the prohibited procedure, not merely those in which the woman suffers from medical complications.  It is neither our obligation nor within our traditional institutional role to resolve questions of constitutionality with respect to each potential situation that might develop.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would indeed be undesirable for this Court to consider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 21 (1960) (internal quotation marks omitted).  For this reason, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s-applied challenges are the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1321, 1328 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act is open to a proper as-applied challenge in a discrete case.

No as-applied challenge need be brought if the prohibition in the Act threatens a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life because the Act already contains a life exception.  18 U.

The trial courts concluded, in contrast to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 findings, that \xe2\x80\x9csignificant medical authority supports the proposition that in some circumstances, [intact D&amp;E] is the safest procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1033 (quoting <em>Stenberg</em>, 530 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a); <em>Salve Regina College</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/225/index.html">499 U. S. 225</a>, 233 (1991).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion supplies no reason to reject those findings.  Nevertheless, despite the District Courts\xe2\x80\x99 appraisal of the weight of the evidence, and in undisguised conflict with <em>Stenberg</em>, the Court asserts that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act can survive \xe2\x80\x9cwhen \xe2\x80\xa6 medical uncertainty persists.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 33.  This assertion is bewildering.  Not only does it defy the Court\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding precedent affirming the necessity of a health exception, with no carve-out for circumstances of medical uncertainty, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935; it gives short shrift to the records before us, carefully canvassed by the District Courts.  Those records indicate that \xe2\x80\x9cthe majority of highly-qualified experts on the subject believe intact D&amp;E to be the safest, most appropriate procedure under certain circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1034.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court acknowledges some of this evidence, <em>ante</em>, at 31,<em> </em>but insists that, because some witnesses disagreed with the ACOG and other experts\xe2\x80\x99 assessment of risk, the Act can stand.  <em>Ante</em>, at 32\xe2\x80\x9333, 37.  In this insistence, the Court brushes under the rug the District Courts\xe2\x80\x99 well-supported findings that the physicians who testified that intact D&amp;E is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman had slim authority for their opinions.  They had no training for, or personal experience with, the intact D&amp;E procedure, and many performed abortions only on rare occasions.  See <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 980; <em>Carhart</em>, 331 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1025; cf. <em>National Abortion Federation</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 462\xe2\x80\x93464.  Even indulging the assumption that the Government witnesses were equally qualified to evaluate the relative risks of abortion procedures, their testimony could not erase the \xe2\x80\x9csignificant medical authority support[ing] the proposition that in some circumstances, [intact D&amp;E] would be the safest procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stenberg</em>, 530 U.

Today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, the Court declares, advances \xe2\x80\x9ca premise central to [<em>Casey</em>\xe2\x80\x99s] conclusion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 15 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e must determine whether the Act furthers the legitimate interest of the Government in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child.\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the Act scarcely furthers that interest: The law saves not a single fetus from destruction, for it targets only a <em>method</em> of performing abortion.  See <em>Stenberg</em>, 530 U. S., at 930.  And surely the statute was not designed to protect the lives or health of pregnant women.  <em>Id.</em>, at 951 (Ginsburg, J., concurring);<em> </em>cf. <em>Casey</em>, 505 U. S., at 846 (recognizing along with the State\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in the life of the fetus, its \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate interes[t] \xe2\x80\xa6 in protecting the <em>health of the woman</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  In short, the Court upholds a law that, while doing nothing to \xe2\x80\x9cpreserv[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 fetal life,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, bars a woman from choosing intact D&amp;E although her doctor \xe2\x80\x9creasonably believes [that procedure] will best protect [her].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stenberg</em>, 530 U. S., at 946 (Stevens, J., concurring).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As another reason for upholding the ban, the Court emphasizes that the Act does not proscribe the nonintact D&amp;E procedure.  See<em> ante</em>, at 34.  But why not, one might ask.  Nonintact D&amp;E could equally be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cbrutal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 26, involving as it does \xe2\x80\x9ctear[ing] [a fetus] apart\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cripp[ing] off\xe2\x80\x9d its limbs, <em>ante, </em>at 4, 6.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures \xe2\x80\xa6 is more akin to infanticide than the other, or that the State furthers any legitimate interest by banning one but not the other, is simply irrational.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stenberg</em>, 530 U. S., at 946\xe2\x80\x93947 (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Delivery of an intact, albeit nonviable, fetus warrants special condemnation, the Court maintains, because a fetus that is not dismembered resembles an infant. <em> Ante, </em>at<em> </em>28.  But so, too, does a fetus delivered intact after it is terminated by injection a day or two before the surgical evacuation, <em>ante,</em> at 5, 34\xe2\x80\x9335, or a fetus delivered through medical induction or cesarean, <em>ante, </em>at 9.  Yet, the availability of those procedures\xe2\x80\x94along with D&amp;E by dismemberment\xe2\x80\x94the Court says, saves the ban on intact D&amp;E from a declaration of unconstitutionality.  <em>Ante, </em>at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  Never mind that the procedures deemed acceptable might put a woman\xe2\x80\x99s health at greater risk.  See <em>supra</em>, at 13, and n.\xc2\xa06; cf. <em>ante</em>, at 5, 31\xe2\x80\x9332. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, the Court admits that \xe2\x80\x9cmoral concerns\xe2\x80\x9d are at work, concerns that could yield prohibitions on any abortion.  See <em>ante</em>, at<em> </em>28 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress could \xe2\x80\xa6 conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Notably, the concerns expressed are untethered to any ground genuinely serving the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preserving life.  By allowing such concerns to carry the day and case, overriding fundamental rights, the Court dishonors our precedent.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Casey</em>, 505 U. S., at 850 (\xe2\x80\x9cSome of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision.  Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/558/index.html">539 U.

In such a second round, the Court suggests, the challengers could succeed upon demonstrating that \xe2\x80\x9cin discrete and well-defined instances a particular condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 37.  One may anticipate that such a preenforcement challenge will be mounted swiftly, to ward off serious, sometimes irremediable harm, to women whose health would be endangered by the intact D&amp;E prohibition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court envisions that in an as-applied challenge, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But it should not escape notice that the record already includes hundreds and hundreds of pages of testimony identifying \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete and well-defined instances\xe2\x80\x9d in which recourse to an intact D&amp;E would better protect the health of women with particular conditions.  See <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  Record evidence also documents that medical exigencies, unpredictable in advance, may indicate to a well-trained doctor that intact D&amp;E is the safest procedure.  See <em>ibid. </em> In light of this evidence, our unanimous decision just one year ago in <em>Ayotte</em> counsels against reversal.  See 546 U. S., at 331 (remanding for reconsideration of the remedy for the absence of a health exception, suggesting that an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications might suffice).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s allowance only of an \xe2\x80\x9cas-applied challenge in a discrete case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 38\xe2\x80\x94jeopardizes women\xe2\x80\x99s health and places doctors in an untenable position.  Even if courts were able to carve-out exceptions through piecemeal litigation for \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete and well-defined instances,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 37, women whose circumstances have not been anticipated by prior litigation could well be left unprotected.  In treating those women, physicians would risk criminal prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment if they exercise their best judgment as to the safest medical procedure for their patients.  The Court is thus gravely mistaken to conclude that narrow as-applied challenges are \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper manner to protect the health of the woman.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court wrote in <em>Casey</em>, \xe2\x80\x9coverruling <em>Roe</em>\xe2\x80\x99s central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of <em>stare decisis</em>, but would seriously weaken the Court\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U.

A decision so at odds with our jurisprudence should not have staying power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the notion that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act furthers any legitimate governmental interest is, quite simply, irrational.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s defense of the statute provides no saving explanation.
