United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/214/case.html">381 U.S. 214</a>, 85 S.Ct. 1365, 14 L.Ed.2d 345 (1965), 6531 was construed to apply to a situation where the Government had developed its case within the time period prescribed by the statute of limitations, but was unable to obtain an indictment because a grand jury was not in session. Mr. Justice Harlan, in speaking for the Court observed: </p><ul>\'More basically, the evident statutory purpose of the nine-month extension provision is to afford the Government an opportunity to indict criminal tax offenders in the event that a grand jury is not in session at the end of the normal limitation period. This is confirmed by the immediate precursor of the present section which provided for an extension \'until the discharge of the grand jury at its next session within the district.\' I.R.C. 1939, 3748(a). Clearly the statute was not meant to grant the Government greater time in which to make its case (a result which could have been accomplished simply by making the normal period of limitation six years and nine months), but rather was intended to deal <p></p><p><a class="page-number" name="973">Page 419 U.S. 970, 973</a></p><p> with the situation in which the Government has its case made within the normal limitation period but cannot obtain an indictment because of the grand jury schedule.\' (Footnote omitted.) 381 U.S., at 219-220, 85 S.Ct. 1365.</p></ul> <p> Mr. Justice Goldberg, in a separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, and joined by Chief Justice Warren and Mr. Justice Douglas, echoed this conclusion: </p><ul>\'I agree with the Court that the purpose of the tolling provision in the statute of limitations before us, as evidenced by its language and its legislative history, is to avoid penalizing the Government when a criminal defendant cannot be indicated merely because no grand jury is sitting at the time the limitation period expires. In keeping with this purpose, the Government ought to be allowed to present a case prepared before the expiration of the limitation period to the grand jury when it next convenes, but it ought not to be allowed to take advantage of a nine-month extension to prepare a case which was not ready for submission before the end of the statutory period.\' Id. , at 226, 85 S.Ct. 1365.</ul> <p> This analysis of the purpose of the significant sentence of 6531, although not determinative of the issues in Jaben, remains as this Court\'s primary interpretation of the statute. </p><p> The Government\'s position, however, as expressed in its memorandum in opposition to the petition for certiorari,3 is essentially that the 6-year limitation period for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="974">Page 419 U.S. 970, 974</a></p><p> an offense under 7206(1) is automatically extended and converted into a 6-year and 9-month period, at the Government\'s option, by its mere filing of an appropriate complaint with a commissioner of the United States before the expiration of the 6-year period. </p><p> The Government, possibly, is right, but its position, under the circumstances of this case, appears to me to be not entirely consistent with what was said in the respective opinions in Jaben by Justices Harlan and Goldberg. I therefore would grant the petition for certiorari and test the Government\'s position only upon full briefing and argument. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> 7206.
