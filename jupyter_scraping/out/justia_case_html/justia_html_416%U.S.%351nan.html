JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Since at least 1885, Florida has provided for some form of property tax exemption for widows. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The current law granting all widows an annual $500 exemption, Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 196.202 (Supp. 1974-1975), has been essentially unchanged since 1941. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Appellant Kahn is a widower who lives in Florida and applied for the exemption to the Dade County Tax Assessor\'s Office.  It was denied because the statute offers no analogous benefit for widowers.  Kahn then sought a declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Dade County, Florida, and that court held the statute violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the classification "widow" was based upon gender.  The Florida Supreme Court reversed, finding the classification valid because it has a "<em>fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation,\'" [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] that object being the reduction of "the disparity between the economic capabilities of a man and a woman."  Kahn appealed here, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257(2), and we noted probable jurisdiction, 414 U.S. 973.  We affirm. </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 416 U. S. 353</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>There can be no dispute that the financial difficulties confronting the lone woman in Florida or in any other State exceed those facing the man.  Whether from overt discrimination or from the socialization process of a male-dominated culture, the job market is inhospitable to the woman seeking any but the lowest paid jobs. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  There are, of course, efforts under way to remedy this situation.  On the federal level, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits covered employers and labor unions from discrimination on the basis of sex, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(a), (c), as does the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 77 Stat. 56. 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 206(d).  But firmly entrenched practices are resistant to such pressures, and, indeed, data compiled by the Women\'s Bureau of the United States Department of Labor show that, in 1972, a woman working full time had a median income which was only 57.9% of the median for males -- a figure actually six points lower than had been achieved in 1955. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Other data point in the same direction. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 416 U. S. 354</a></p><p> The disparity is likely to be exacerbated for the widow.  While the widower can usually continue in the occupation which preceded his spouse\'s death, in many cases, the widow will find herself suddenly forced into a job market with which she is unfamiliar, and in which, because of her former economic dependency, she will have fewer skills to offer. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="355">Page 416 U. S. 355</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There can be no doubt, therefore, that Florida\'s differing treatment of widows and widowers "<em>rest[s] upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.\'"  <em>Reed v.

In levying such taxes, the State is not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use or value.

S. 355</a></span>.  In my view, however, a legislative classification that distinguishes potential beneficiaries solely by reference to their gender-based status as widows or widowers, like classifications based upon race, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] alienage, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] and national origin, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] must be subjected to close judicial scrutiny, because it focuses upon generally immutable characteristics over which individuals have little or no control, and also because gender-based classifications too often have been inexcusably utilized to stereotype and stigmatize politically powerless segments of society.  <em>See Frontiero v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/677/case.html">411 U. S. 677</a></span> (1973).  The Court is not, therefore, free to sustain the statute on the ground that it rationally promotes legitimate governmental interests; rather, such suspect classifications can be sustained only when the State bears the burden of demonstrating that the challenged legislation serves overriding or compelling interests that cannot be achieved either by a more carefully tailored legislative classification or by the use of feasible, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="358">Page 416 U. S. 358</a></p><p> less drastic means.  While, in my view, the statute serves a compelling governmental interest by "cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden," I think that the statute is invalid because the State\'s interest can be served equally well by a more narrowly drafted statute.</p>\n<p>Gender-based classifications cannot be sustained merely because they promote legitimate governmental interests, such as efficacious administration of government.  <em>Frontiero v. Richardson, supra; Reed v. Reed,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/71/case.html">404 U. S. 71</a></span> (1971).  For</p>\n<p>"when we enter the realm of \'strict judicial scrutiny,\' there can be no doubt that \'administrative convenience\' is not a shibboleth, the mere recitation of which dictates constitutionality.  <em>See Shapiro v.

On the contrary, any statutory scheme which draws a sharp line between the sexes solely for the purpose of achieving administrative convenience necessarily commands \'dissimilar treatment for men and women who are . . . similarly situated,\' and therefore involves the \'very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the [Constitution]. . . .\'  <em>Reed v.

But Florida\'s justification of \xc2\xa7 196.191(7) is not that it serves administrative convenience or helps to preserve the public fisc.  Rather, the asserted justification is that \xc2\xa7 196.191(7) is an affirmative step toward alleviating the effects of past economic discrimination against women. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>I agree that, in providing special benefits for a needy segment of society long the victim of purposeful discrimination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 416 U. S. 359</a></p><p> and neglect, the statute serves the compelling state interest of achieving equality for such groups. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  No one familiar with this country\'s history of pervasive sex discrimination against women [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] can doubt the need for remedial measures to correct the resulting economic imbalances.  Indeed, the extent of the economic disparity between men and women is dramatized by the data cited by the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/351/case.html#353">416 U. S. 353</a></span>-354.  By providing a property tax exemption for widows, \xc2\xa7 196.191(7) assists in reducing that economic disparity for a class of women particularly disadvantaged by the legacy of economic discrimination. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  In that circumstance, the purpose and effect of the suspect classification are ameliorative; the statute neither stigmatizes nor denigrates widowers not also benefited by the legislation.  Moreover, inclusion of needy widowers within the class of beneficiaries would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="360">Page 416 U. S. 360</a></p><p> not further the State\'s overriding interest in remedying the economic effects of past sex discrimination for needy victims of that discrimination.  While doubtless some widowers are in financial need, no one suggests that such need results from sex discrimination as in the case of widows.</p>\n<p>The statute nevertheless fails to satisfy the requirements of equal protection, since the State has not borne its burden of proving that its compelling interest could not be achieved by a more precisely tailored statute or by use of feasible, less drastic means.  Section 196.191(7) is plainly overinclusive, for the $500 property tax exemption may be obtained by a financially independent heiress as well as by an unemployed widow with dependent children.  The State has offered nothing to explain why inclusion of widows of substantial economic means was necessary to advance the State\'s interest in ameliorating the effects of past economic discrimination against women.</p>\n<p>Moreover, alternative means of classification, narrowing the class of widow beneficiaries, appear readily available.  The exemption is granted only to widows who complete and file with the tax assessor a form application establishing their status as widows.  By merely redrafting that form to exclude widows who earn annual incomes, or possess assets in excess of specified amounts, the State could readily narrow the class of beneficiaries to those widows for whom the effects of past economic discrimination against women have been a practical reality.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Loving v.

The disparity is likely to be exacerbated for the widow.  While the widower can usually continue in the occupation which preceded his spouse\'s death, in many cases, the widow will find herself suddenly forced into a job market with which she is unfamiliar, and in which, because of her former economic dependency, she will have fewer skills to offer."</p>\n<p>(Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Florida tax exemption at issue here is available to all widows, but not to widowers.  The presumption is that all widows are financially more needy and less trained </p><p><a class="page-number" name="361">Page 416 U. S. 361</a></p><p> or less ready for the job market than men.  It may be that most widows have been occupied as housewife, mother, and homemaker, and are not immediately prepared for employment.  But there are many rich widows who need no largess from the State; many others are highly trained, and have held lucrative positions long before the death of their husbands.  At the same time, there are many widowers who are needy and who are in more desperate financial straits and have less access to the job market than many widows.  Yet none of them qualifies for the exemption.</p>\n<p>I find the discrimination invidious, and violative of the Equal Protection Clause.  There is merit in giving poor widows a tax break, but gender-based classifications are suspect, and require more justification than the State has offered.</p>\n<p>I perceive no purpose served by the exemption other than to alleviate current economic necessity, but the State extends the exemption to widows who do not need the help, and denies it to widowers who do.  It may be administratively inconvenient to make individual determinations of entitlement and to extend the exemption to needy men as well as needy women, but administrative efficiency is not an adequate justification for discriminations based purely on sex.  <em>Frontiero v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/677/case.html">411 U. S. 677</a></span> (1973); <em>Reed v. Reed,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/71/case.html">404 U. S. 71</a></span> (1971)</p>\n<p>It may be suggested that the State is entitled to prefer widows over widowers because their assumed need is rooted in past and present economic discrimination against women.  But this is not a credible explanation of Florida\'s tax exemption, for if the State\'s purpose was to compensate for past discrimination against females, surely it would not have limited the exemption to women who are widows.  Moreover, even if past discrimination is considered to be the criterion for current tax exemption, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 416 U. S. 362</a></p><p> the State nevertheless ignores all those widowers who have felt the effects of economic discrimination, whether as a member of a racial group or as one of the many who cannot escape the cycle of poverty.  It seems to me that the State in this case is merely conferring an economic benefit in the form of a tax exemption, and has not adequately explained why women should be treated differently from men.</p>\n<p>I dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
