The District Court concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the suit, resting its decision on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), which provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d of both federal and state courts except as provided in the Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71604.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the FSIA does not apply to officials of a foreign state.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The FSIA does not govern petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim of immunity.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Under the common-law doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity, see <em>Schooner Exchange</em> v. <em>McFaddon</em>, 7 Cranch 116, if the State Department granted a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic request for a \xe2\x80\x9csuggestion of immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d the district court surrendered its jurisdiction, <em>Ex parte Peru</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/573/index.html">318 U. S. 573</a>, 581, 587.  If the State Department refused, the court could decide the immunity issue itself.  <em>Id., </em>at 587.  In 1952, the State Department moved from a policy of requesting immunity in most actions against friendly sovereigns to a \xe2\x80\x9crestrictive\xe2\x80\x9d theory that confined immunity \xe2\x80\x9cto suits involving the foreign sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s public acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Verlinden B. V.</em> v. <em>Central Bank of Nigeria</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/480/index.html">461 U. S. 480</a>, 487.  Inconsistent application of sovereign immunity followed, leading to the FSIA, whose primary purposes are (1) to endorse and codify the restrictive theory, and (2) to transfer primary responsibility for deciding \xe2\x80\x9cclaims of foreign states to immunity\xe2\x80\x9d from the State Department to the courts.  \xc2\xa71602.  This Act now governs the determination whether a foreign state is entitled to sovereign immunity.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Reading the FSIA as a whole, there is nothing to suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d should be read to include an official acting on behalf of that state.  The Act specifies that a foreign state \xe2\x80\x9cincludes a political subdivision \xe2\x80\xa6 or an agency or instrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d of that state, \xc2\xa71603(a), and specifically delimits what counts as an \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71603(b).  Textual clues in the \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d definition\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cany entity\xe2\x80\x9d matching three specified characteristics, <em>ibid.</em>\xe2\x80\x94cut against reading it to include a foreign official.  \xe2\x80\x9cEntity\xe2\x80\x9d typically refers to an organization; and the required statutory characteristics\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g</em>., \xe2\x80\x9cseparate legal person,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71603(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94apply awkwardly, if at all, to individuals.  Section 1603(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d definition is also inapplicable.  The list set out there, even if illustrative rather than exclusive, does not suggest that officials are included, since the listed defendants are all entities.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is also supported by the fact that Congress expressly mentioned officials elsewhere in the FSIA when it wished to count their acts as equivalent to those of the foreign state.  Moreover, other FSIA provisions\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g., </em>\xc2\xa71608(a)\xe2\x80\x94point away from reading \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d to include foreign officials.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s history and purposes also do not support petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Act governs his immunity claim.  There is little reason to presume that when Congress codified state immunity, it intended to codify, <em>sub silentio,</em> official immunity.  The canon of construction that statutes should be interpreted consistently with the common law does not help decide the question whether, when a statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage is ambiguous, Congress intended it to govern a particular field.  State and official immunities may not be coextensive, and historically, the Government has suggested common-law immunity for individual officials even when the foreign state did not qualify.  Though a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s immunity may, in some circumstances, extend to an individual for official acts, it does not follow that Congress intended to codify that immunity in the FSIA.  Official immunity was simply not the problem that Congress was addressing when enacting that Act.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Act should not be affected by the risk that plaintiffs may use artful pleading to attempt to select between application of the FSIA or the common law.  This case, where respondents have sued petitioner in his personal capacity and seek damages from his own pockets, is governed by the common law because it is not a claim against a foreign state as defined by the FSIA.

Respondents are natives of Somalia who allege that they, or members of their families, were the victims of torture and extrajudicial killings during those years.  They seek damages from petitioner based on his alleged authorization of those acts.  The narrow question we must decide is whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71330, 1602 <em>et seq.</em>, provides petitioner with immunity from suit based on actions taken in his official capacity.  We hold that the FSIA does not govern the determination of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from suit.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents are members of the Isaaq clan, which included well-educated and prosperous Somalis who were subjected to systematic persecution during the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s by the military regime then governing Somalia.  They allege that petitioner exercised command and control over members of the Somali military forces who tortured, killed, or arbitrarily detained them or members of their families; that petitioner knew or should have known of the abuses perpetrated by his subordinates; and that he aided and abetted the commission of these abuses.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint sought damages from petitioner pursuant to the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350, and the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350.  Petitioner, who was in charge of Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s armed forces before its military regime collapsed, fled Somalia in 1991 and is now a resident of Virginia.  The United States has not recognized any entity as the government of Somalia since the fall of the military regime.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents filed their complaint in November 2004, and petitioner promptly moved to dismiss.  The District Court stayed the proceedings to give the State Department an opportunity to provide a statement of interest regarding petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim of sovereign immunity.  Each month during the ensuing two years, petitioner advised the court that the State Department had the matter \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98still under consideration.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  No. 1:04cv1360 (ED Va., Aug. 1, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a.  In 2007, having received no response from the State Department, the District Court reinstated the case on its active docket.  The court concluded that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction and granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rested squarely on the FSIA.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The FSIA provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d of both federal and state courts except as provided in the Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71604, and the District Court noted that none of the parties had argued that any exception was applicable, App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a\xe2\x80\x9347a.  Although characterizing the statute as silent on its applicability to the officials of a foreign state, the District Court followed appellate decisions holding that a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity under the Act extends to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an individual acting in his official capacity on behalf of a foreign state,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but not to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an official who acts beyond the scope of his authority.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 47a (quoting <em>Velasco</em> v. <em>Government of Indonesia</em>, 370 F.\xc2\xa03d 392, 398, 399 (CA4 2004)).  The court rejected respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that petitioner was necessarily acting beyond the scope of his authority because he allegedly violated international law.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that the FSIA governs petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from suit.  It acknowledged \xe2\x80\x9cthe majority view\xe2\x80\x9d among the Circuits that \xe2\x80\x9cthe FSIA applies to individual officials of a foreign state.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 F.\xc2\xa03d 371, 378 (CA4 2009).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  It disagreed with that view, however, and concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the language and structure of the statute, that the FSIA does not apply to individual foreign government agents like [petitioner].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 381.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Having found that the FSIA does not govern whether petitioner enjoys immunity from suit, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for further proceedings, including a determination of whether petitioner is entitled to immunity under the common law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 383\xe2\x80\x93384.  We granted certiorari.  557 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity developed as a matter of common law long before the FSIA was enacted in 1976.  In <em>Verlinden B. V.</em> v. <em>Central Bank of Nigeria</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/480/index.html">461 U. S. 480</a>, 486 (1983), we explained that in <em>Schooner Exchange</em> v. <em>McFaddon</em>, 7 Cranch 116 (1812), \xe2\x80\x9cChief Justice Marshall concluded that \xe2\x80\xa6 the United States had impliedly waived jurisdiction over certain activities of foreign sovereigns.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s specific holding in <em>Schooner Exchange</em> was that a federal court lacked jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9ca national armed vessel \xe2\x80\xa6 of the emperor of France,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 146, but the opinion was interpreted as extending virtually absolute immunity to foreign sovereigns as \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of grace and comity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Verlinden</em>, 461 U. S., at 486.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following <em>Schooner Exchange</em>, a two-step procedure developed for resolving a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s claim of sovereign immunity, typically asserted on behalf of seized vessels.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Republic of Mexico</em> v. <em>Hoffman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/324/30/index.html">324 U. S. 30</a>, 34\xe2\x80\x9336 (1945); <em>Ex parte Peru</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/578/index.html">318 U. S. 578</a>, 587\xe2\x80\x93589 (1943); <em>Compania Espanola de Navegacion Maritima, S. A.</em> v. <em>The Navemar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/303/68/index.html">303 U. S. 68</a>, 74\xe2\x80\x9375 (1938).  Under that procedure, the diplomatic representative of the sovereign could request a \xe2\x80\x9csuggestion of immunity\xe2\x80\x9d from the State Department.  <em>Ex parte Peru</em>, 318 U. S., at 581.  If the request was granted, the district court surrendered its jurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 588; see also <em>Hoffman</em>, 324 U. S., at 34.  But \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of recognition of the immunity by the Department of State,\xe2\x80\x9d a district court \xe2\x80\x9chad authority to decide for itself whether all the requisites for such immunity existed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte Peru</em>, 318 U. S., at 587; see also <em>Compania Espanola</em>, 303 U. S., at 75 (approving judicial inquiry into sovereign immunity when the \xe2\x80\x9cDepartment of State .\xc2\xa0. . declined to act\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Heaney </em>v. <em>Government of Spain</em>, 445 F.\xc2\xa02d 501, 503, and n.\xc2\xa02  (CA2 1971) (evaluating sovereign immunity when the State Department had not responded to a request for its views).  In making that decision, a district court inquired \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the ground of immunity is one which it is the established policy of the [State Department] to recognize.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hoffman</em>, 324 U. S., at 36.  Although cases involving individual foreign officials as defendants were rare, the same two-step procedure was typically followed when a foreign official asserted immunity.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Heaney</em>, 445 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 504\xe2\x80\x93505; <em>Waltier </em>v. <em>Thomson</em>, 189 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 319 (SDNY 1960).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to 1952, the State Department followed a general practice of requesting immunity in all actions against friendly sovereigns, but in that year the Department announced its adoption of the \xe2\x80\x9crestrictive\xe2\x80\x9d theory of sovereign immunity.  <em>Verlinden</em>, 461 U. S., at 486\xe2\x80\x93487; see also Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, Department of State, to Acting Attorney General Philip B. Perlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull. 984\xe2\x80\x93985 (1952).  Under this theory, \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity is confined to suits involving the foreign sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s public acts, and does not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s strictly commercial acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Verlinden</em>, 461 U. S., at 487.  This change threw \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity determinations into some disarray,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical considerations sometimes led the Department to file \xe2\x80\x98suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/677/index.html">541 U.

S., at 487).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress responded to the inconsistent application of sovereign immunity by enacting the FSIA in 1976.  <em>Altmann</em>, 541 U. S., at 690\xe2\x80\x93691; see also <em>Verlinden,</em> 461 U. S., at 487\xe2\x80\x93488.  Section 1602 describes the Act\xe2\x80\x99s two primary purposes: (1) to endorse and codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, and (2) to transfer primary responsibility for deciding \xe2\x80\x9cclaims of foreign states to immunity\xe2\x80\x9d from the State Department to the courts.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  After the enactment of the FSIA, the Act\xe2\x80\x94and not the pre-existing common law\xe2\x80\x94indisputably governs the determination of whether a foreign state is entitled to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What we must now decide is whether the Act also covers the immunity claims of foreign officials.  We begin with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and then consider petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on its history and purpose.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FSIA provides that \xe2\x80\x9ca foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States\xe2\x80\x9d except as provided in the Act.  \xc2\xa71604.  Thus, if a defendant is a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Act, then the defendant is immune from jurisdiction unless one of the exceptions in the Act applies.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71605\xe2\x80\x931607 (enumerating exceptions).  The Act, if it applies, is the \xe2\x80\x9csole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Argentine Republic</em> v. <em>Amerada Hess Shipping Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/428/index.html">488 U.

The question we face in this case is whether an individual sued for conduct undertaken in his official capacity is a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71603 as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a) A \xe2\x80\x98foreign state\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in subsection (b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b) An \xe2\x80\x98agency or instrumentality of a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99 means any entity\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United States as defined in section 1332(c) and (e) of this title, nor created under the laws of any third country.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d on its face indicates a body politic that governs a particular territory.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Restatement \xc2\xa74 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cstate\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can entity that has a defined territory and population under the control of a government and that engages in foreign relations\xe2\x80\x9d).  In \xc2\xa71603(a), however, the Act establishes that \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d has a broader meaning, by mandating the inclusion of the state\xe2\x80\x99s political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities.  Then, in \xc2\xa71603(b), the Act specifically delimits what counts as an agency or instrumentality.  Petitioner argues that either \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71603(a), or \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71603(b), could be read to include a foreign official.  Although we agree that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is literally possible, our analysis of the entire statutory text persuades us that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reading is not the meaning that Congress enacted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn first to the term \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality of a foreign state,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71603(b).  It is true that an individual official could be an \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality,\xe2\x80\x9d if that term is given the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cany thing or person through which action is accomplished,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>In\xc2\xa0re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001</em>, 538 F.\xc2\xa03d 71, 83 (CA2 2008).  But Congress has specifically defined \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d in the FSIA, and all of the textual clues in that definition cut against such a broad construction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the statute specifies that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98agency or instrumentality \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 means any <em>entity</em>\xe2\x80\x9d matching three specified characteristics, \xc2\xa71603(b) (emphasis added), and \xe2\x80\x9centity\xe2\x80\x9d typically refers to an organization, rather than an individual.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed. 2009).  Furthermore, several of the required characteristics apply awkwardly, if at all, to individuals.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cseparate legal person, corporate or otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71603(b)(1), could conceivably refer to a natural person, solely by virtue of the word \xe2\x80\x9cperson.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cseparate legal person\xe2\x80\x9d typically refers to the legal fiction that allows an entity to hold personhood separate from the natural persons who are its shareholders or officers.  Cf. <em>First Nat. City Bank</em> v. <em>Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/611/index.html">462 U. S. 611</a>, 625 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cSeparate legal personality has been described as \xe2\x80\x98an almost indispensable aspect of the public corporation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is similarly awkward to refer to a person as an \xe2\x80\x9corgan\xe2\x80\x9d of the foreign state.  See \xc2\xa71603(b)(2).  And the third part of the definition could not be applied at all to a natural person.  A natural person cannot be a citizen of a State \xe2\x80\x9cas defined in section 1332(c) and (e),\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71603(b)(3), because those subsections refer to the citizenship of corporations and estates.  Nor can a natural person be \xe2\x80\x9ccreated under the laws of any third country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Thus, the terms Congress chose simply do not evidence the intent to include individual officials within the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Cf. <em>Dole Food Co.</em> v. <em>Patrickson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/468/index.html"></a><a href="/us/538/468/index.html">538 U.

See Brief for Petitioner 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  It is true that use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cinclude\xe2\x80\x9d can signal that the list that follows is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  And, to be sure, there are fewer textual clues within \xc2\xa71603(a) than within \xc2\xa71603(b) from which to interpret Congress\xe2\x80\x99 silence regarding foreign officials.  But even if the list in \xc2\xa71603(a) is merely illustrative, it still suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d does not encompass officials, because the types of defendants listed are all entities.  See <em>Russell Motor Car Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/261/514/index.html">261 U. S. 514</a>, 519 (1923) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] word may be known by the company it keeps\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, elsewhere in the FSIA Congress expressly mentioned officials when it wished to count their acts as equivalent to those of the foreign state, which suggests that officials are not included within the unadorned term \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Kimbrough </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/85/index.html">552 U. S. 85</a>, 103 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cDrawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate \xe2\x80\xa6 [when] Congress has shown that it knows how to [address an issue] in express terms\xe2\x80\x9d).  For example, Congress provided an exception from the general grant of immunity for cases in which \xe2\x80\x9cmoney damages are sought against a foreign state\xe2\x80\x9d for an injury in the United States \xe2\x80\x9ccaused by the tortious act or omission <em>of that foreign state or of any official</em> or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71605(a)(5) (emphasis added).  The same reference to officials is made in a similar, later enacted exception.  See 28 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a)(5) would be unnecessary.  See <em>Dole Food Co.</em>, 538 U. S., at 476\xe2\x80\x93477 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e should not construe the statute in a manner that is strained and, at the same time, would render a statutory term superfluous\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other provisions of the statute also point away from reading \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d to include foreign officials.  Congress made no express mention of service of process on individuals in \xc2\xa71608(a), which governs service upon a foreign state or political subdivision.  Although some of the methods listed could be used to serve individuals\xe2\x80\x94for example, by delivery \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with an applicable international convention,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71608(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x94the methods specified are at best very roundabout ways of serving an individual official.  Furthermore, Congress made specific remedial choices for different types of defendants.  See \xc2\xa71606 (allowing punitive damages for an agency or instrumentality but not for a foreign state); \xc2\xa71610 (affording a plaintiff greater rights to attach the property of an agency or instrumentality as compared to the property of a foreign state).  By adopting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state,\xe2\x80\x9d we would subject claims against officials to the more limited remedies available in suits against states, without so much as a whisper from Congress on the subject.  (And if we were instead to adopt petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s other textual argument, we would subject those claims to the different, more expansive, remedial scheme for agencies).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s careful calibration of remedies among the listed types of defendants suggests that Congress did not mean to cover other types of defendants never mentioned in the text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e do not \xe2\x80\xa6 construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/822/index.html">467 U. S. 822</a>, 828 (1984).  Reading the FSIA as a whole, there is nothing to suggest we should read \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71603(a) to include an official acting on behalf of the foreign state, and much to indicate that this meaning was not what Congress enacted.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The text does not expressly foreclose petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reading, but it supports the view of respondents and the United States that the Act does not address an official\xe2\x80\x99s claim to immunity.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that the FSIA is best read to cover his claim to immunity because of its history and purpose.  As discussed at the outset, one of the primary purposes of the FSIA was to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, which Congress recognized as consistent with extant international law.  See \xc2\xa71602.  We have observed that a related purpose was \xe2\x80\x9ccodification of international law at the time of the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Permanent Mission of India to United Nations</em> v. <em>City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/193/index.html">551 U. S. 193</a>, 199 (2007), and have examined the relevant common law and international practice when interpreting the Act, <em>id.</em>, at 200\xe2\x80\x93201.  Because of this relationship between the Act and the common law that it codified, petitioner argues that we should construe the FSIA consistently with the common law regarding individual immunity, which\xe2\x80\x94in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s view\xe2\x80\x94was coextensive with the law of state immunity and always immunized a foreign official for acts taken on behalf of the foreign state.  Even reading the Act in light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose of codifying <em>state </em>sovereign immunity, however, we do not think that the Act codified the common law with respect to the immunity of individual officials.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The canon of construction that statutes should be interpreted consistently with the common law helps us interpret a statute that clearly covers a field formerly governed by the common law.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  But the canon does not help us to decide the antecedent question whether, when a statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage is ambiguous, Congress intended the statute to govern a particular field\xe2\x80\x94in this case, whether Congress intended the FSIA to supersede the common law of official immunity.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that because state and official immunities are coextensive, Congress must have codified official immunity when it codified state immunity.  See Brief for Petitioner 26\xe2\x80\x9330.  But the relationship between a state\xe2\x80\x99s immunity and an official\xe2\x80\x99s immunity is more complicated than petitioner suggests, although we need not and do not resolve the dispute among the parties as to the precise scope of an official\xe2\x80\x99s immunity at common law.  The very authority to which petitioner points us, and which we have previously found instructive, see<em>, e.g.</em>,<em> Permanent Mission</em>, 551 U. S., at 200, states that the immunity of individual officials is subject to a caveat not applicable to any of the other entities or persons[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] to which the foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s immunity extends.  The Restatement provides that the \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity of a foreign state \xe2\x80\xa6 extends to \xe2\x80\xa6 any other public minister, official, or agent of the state with respect to acts performed in his official capacity <em>if the effect of exercising jurisdiction would be to enforce a rule of law against the state</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement \xc2\xa766 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  And historically, the Government sometimes suggested immunity under the common law for individual officials even when the foreign state did not qualify.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Greenspan</em> v. <em>Crosbie</em>, No. 74 Civ. 4734 (GLG), 1976 WL 841 (SDNY, Nov. 23, 1976).  There is therefore little reason to presume that when Congress set out to codify state immunity, it must also have, <em>sub silentio</em>, intended to codify official immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner urges that a suit against an official must always be equivalent to a suit against the state because acts taken by a state official on behalf of a state are acts of the state.  See Brief for Petitioner 26.  We have recognized, in the context of the act of state doctrine, that an official\xe2\x80\x99s acts can be considered the acts of the foreign state, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe courts of one country will not sit in judgment\xe2\x80\x9d of those acts when done within the territory of the foreign state.  See <em>Underhill</em> v. <em>Hernandez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/168/250/index.html">168 U. S. 250</a>, 252, 254 (1897).  Although the act of state doctrine is distinct from immunity, and instead \xe2\x80\x9cprovides foreign states with a substantive defense on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Altmann</em>, 541 U. S., at 700, we do not doubt that in some circumstances the immunity of the foreign state extends to an individual for acts taken in his official capacity.  But it does not follow from this premise that Congress intended to codify that immunity in the FSIA.  It hardly furthers Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cclarifying the rules that judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 699, to lump individual officials in with foreign states without so much as a word spelling out how and when individual officials are covered.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner would have a stronger case if there were any indication that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to enact a comprehensive solution for suits against states extended to suits against individual officials.  But to the extent Congress contemplated the Act\xe2\x80\x99s effect upon officials at all, the evidence points in the opposite direction.  As we have already mentioned, the legislative history points toward an intent to leave official immunity outside the scope of the Act.  See n.\xc2\xa012, <em>supra</em>.  And although questions of official immunity did arise in the pre-FSIA period, they were few and far between.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The immunity of officials simply was not the particular problem to which Congress was responding when it enacted the FSIA.  The FSIA was adopted, rather, to address \xe2\x80\x9ca modern world where foreign state enterprises are every day participants in commercial activities,\xe2\x80\x9d and to assure litigants that decisions regarding claims against states and their enterprises \xe2\x80\x9care made on purely legal grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 7.  We have been given no reason to believe that Congress saw as a problem, or wanted to eliminate, the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s role in determinations regarding individual official immunity.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, our reading of the FSIA will not \xe2\x80\x9cin effect make the statute optional,\xe2\x80\x9d as some Courts of Appeals have feared, by allowing litigants through \xe2\x80\x9cartful pleading \xe2\x80\xa6 to take advantage of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions or, alternatively, choose to proceed under the old common law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chuidian</em> v. <em>Philippine Nat. Bank,</em> 912 F.\xc2\xa02d 1095, 1102 (CA9 1990).  Even if a suit is not governed by the Act, it may still be barred by foreign sovereign immunity under the common law.  And not every suit can successfully be pleaded against an individual official alone.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Even when a plaintiff names only a foreign official, it may be the case that the foreign state itself, its political subdivision, or an agency or instrumentality is a required party, because that party has \xe2\x80\x9can interest relating to the subject of the action\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdisposing of the action in the person\xe2\x80\x99s absence may .\xc2\xa0. . as a practical matter impair or impede the person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect the interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)(1)(B).  If this is the case, and the entity is immune from suit under the FSIA, the district court may have to dismiss the suit, regardless of whether the official is immune or not under the common law.  See <em>Republic of Philippines </em>v. <em>Pimentel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/851/index.html">553 U. S. 851</a>, 867 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims of the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action must be ordered where there is a potential for injury to the interests of the absent sovereign\xe2\x80\x9d).  Or it may be the case that some actions against an official in his official capacity should be treated as actions against the foreign state itself, as the state is the real party in interest.  Cf. <em>Kentucky</em> v. <em>Graham</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/159/index.html">473 U. S. 159</a>, 166 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n official-capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.  It is <em>not</em> a suit against the official personally, for the real party in interest is the entity\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are thus not persuaded that our construction of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text should be affected by the risk that plaintiffs may use artful pleading to attempt to select between application of the FSIA or the common law.  And we think this case, in which respondents have sued petitioner in his personal capacity and seek damages from his own pockets, is properly governed by the common law because it is not a claim against a foreign state as the Act defines that term.  Although Congress clearly intended to supersede the common-law regime for claims against foreign states, we find nothing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s origin or aims to indicate that Congress similarly wanted to codify the law of foreign official immunity.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our review of the text, purpose, and history of the FSIA leads us to the conclusion that the Court of Appeals correctly held the FSIA does not govern petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim of immunity.  The Act therefore did not deprive the District Court of subject-matter jurisdiction.  We emphasize, however, the narrowness of our holding.  Whether petitioner may be entitled to immunity under the common law, and whether he may have other valid defenses to the grave charges against him, are matters to be addressed in the first instance by the District Court on remand.

Legislative history materials are not generally so misleading that jurists should never employ them in a good-faith effort to discern legislative intent.

But the Department has from the time of the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment understood the Act to leave intact the Department\xe2\x80\x99s role in official immunity cases.  See Digest 1020 (\xe2\x80\x9cThese decisions [of the Department regarding the immunity of officials] may be of some future significance, because the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does not deal with the immunity of individual officials, but only that of foreign states and their political subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Furthermore, a plaintiff seeking to sue a foreign official will not be able to rely on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s service of process and jurisdictional provisions.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71604, does not include foreign officials.  Yet the Court insists on adding legislative history to its analysis.  I could understand that (though not agree with it) if, in the absence of supposed legislative-history support, the Court would reach a different result.  Or even if there was something in the legislative history that clearly contradicted the Court\xe2\x80\x99s result, and had to be explained away.  That is not the situation here (or at least the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not think it to be so).  The Court assures us, however (if this could be thought assurance), that legislative history is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not generally so misleading\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that it should \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98never\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d be used.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa09 (quoting <em>Wisconsin Public Intervenor</em> v. <em>Mortier</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/index.html">501 U. S. 597</a>, 611\xe2\x80\x93612, n.\xc2\xa04 (1991)).  Surely that is damning by faint praise.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s mention of the past practice of using legislative history,<em> ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa09, does not support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s use of it today.  The past practice was \xe2\x80\x9c<em>not</em> the practice of using legislative history for the purpose of giving authoritative content to the meaning of a statutory text,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mortier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 622 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s introduction of legislative history serves no purpose except needlessly to inject into the opinion a mode of analysis that not all of the Justices consider valid.  And it does so, to boot, in a fashion that does not isolate the superfluous legislative history in a section that those of us who disagree categorically with its use, or at least disagree with its superfluous use, can decline to join.  I therefore do not join the opinion, and concur only in the result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court relies on legislative history to support three of its positions.  First, after explaining why the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cagency or instrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cforeign state,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa71603(a), (b), does not refer to natural persons, <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, the Court says \xe2\x80\x9c[n]or does anything in the legislative history suggest that Congress intended the term \xe2\x80\x98agency or instrumentality\xe2\x80\x99 to include individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa09.  According to the Court, \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislative history, like the statute, speaks in terms of entities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Apparently, the legislative history must be consulted, not to show that it <em>supports </em>the Court\xe2\x80\x99s textual analysis, or even to explain why its seeming contradiction of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is inconsequential, but to show nothing more than that it contains the same ambiguous language as the text.  This is beyond all reason.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, after concluding its review of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, the Court states that the \xe2\x80\x9clegislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend the [Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976] to address position-based individual immunities such as diplomatic and consular immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, n.\xc2\xa012.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 17.  It cites for this proposition a House Committee Report that we have no reason to believe was read (much less approved) by the Senate\xe2\x80\x94or, indeed, by the Members of the House who were not on the Committee\xe2\x80\x94or even, for that matter, by the members of the Committee, who never voted on the Report.  In any case, the quoted excerpt does not address \xe2\x80\x9cposition-based individual immunities\xe2\x80\x9d in general but only \xe2\x80\x9cconsular and diplomatic immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d which is not at issue here.  Unless consular and diplomatic immunity, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, what <em>is</em> at issue here\xe2\x80\x94state-agent immunity\xe2\x80\x94are always treated the same (which I doubt and the Court does not attempt to establish), the passage contributes nothing to analysis of the present case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same footnote also quotes a portion of the same House Report as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The bill does not attempt to deal with questions of discovery. \xe2\x80\xa6 [I]f a plaintiff sought to depose a diplomat in the United States or a high-ranking official of a foreign government, diplomatic and official immunity would apply.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13, n.\xc2\xa012.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIf anything, this passage cuts against the Court\xe2\x80\x99s result.  The two sentences omitted from the above quotation read as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cExisting law appears to be adequate in this area.  For example, if a private plaintiff sought the production of sensitive governmental documents of a foreign state, concepts of governmental privilege would apply.\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x931487, p.\xc2\xa023 (1976).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, the House Report makes it clear that the bill\xe2\x80\x99s failure to deal with discovery applies to <em>both </em>discovery against sovereigns <em>and</em> discovery against foreign officials.  But the latter would have been unnecessary if the bill dealt only with sovereigns.  The implication (if any) is that the bill\xe2\x80\x99s provisions regarding immunity from suit apply to both sovereigns and foreign officials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, and finally, the Court points to legislative history to establish the purpose of the statute.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17, and n.\xc2\xa019.  This is particularly puzzling, because the <em>enacted </em>statutory text itself includes findings and a declaration of purpose\xe2\x80\x94the very same purpose (surprise!) that the Court finds evidenced in the legislative history.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71602.  To make matters worse, the Court itself notes this statutory declaration of purpose twice earlier, in the body of its opinion, see <em>ante</em>, at 6, 13.  If those textual references to the statute itself were deleted, the footnoted citation of legislative history would at least perform some function.  As it is, however, it adds nothing except the demonstration of assiduous law-clerk research.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It should be no cause for wonder that, upon careful examination, all of the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s excerpts from legislative history turn out to be, at best, nonprobative or entirely duplicative of text.  After all, legislative history is almost never the real reason for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision\xe2\x80\x94and make-weights do not deserve a lot of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s time.  </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963280">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n560 U.
