A jury convicted Greene.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court upheld the conviction, reasoning that the rule announced in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123, did not apply because the confessions were redacted to remove any specific reference to Greene.  While Greene\xe2\x80\x99s petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was pending, this Court announced in Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185, that Bruton does apply to some redacted confessions.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear Greene\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, and he then sought federal habeas relief.  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court may not grant such relief to a state prisoner on any claim that has been \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d unless that adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).

The trial court denied the motion to sever, but agreed to require redaction of the confessions to eliminate proper names.  As redacted, the confessions replaced names with words like \xe2\x80\x9cthis guy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csomeone,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cother guys,\xe2\x80\x9d or with the word \xe2\x80\x9cblank,\xe2\x80\x9d or simply omitted the names without substitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA jury convicted Greene of second-degree murder, robbery, and conspiracy.  He appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, arguing that severance of his trial was demanded by the rule announced in Bruton v.

While that petition was pending, we held in Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185, 195 (1998), that \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered as a class, redactions that replace a proper name with an obvious blank, the word \xe2\x80\x98delete,\xe2\x80\x99 a symbol, or similarly notify the jury that a name has been deleted are similar enough to Bruton\xe2\x80\x99s unredacted confessions as to warrant the same legal results.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted the petition for allowance of appeal, limited to the question whether admission of the redacted confessions violated Greene\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment rights.

Adopting the report and recommendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court denied the petition.  It concluded that since our decision in Gray was not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d when the Pennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause claim, that court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.

Lane, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288 (1989).  Teague held that, with two exceptions not pertinent here, a prisoner seeking federal habeas relief may rely on new constitutional rules of criminal procedure announced before the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final.  Id., at 310 (plurality opinion); see also Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.\xc2\xa0S. 302, 313 (1989) (affirming and applying Teague rule).  Finality occurs when direct state appeals have been exhausted and a petition for writ of certiorari from this Court has become time barred or has been disposed of.  Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.\xc2\xa0S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987).  Greene contends that, because finality marks the temporal cutoff for Teague purposes, it must mark the temporal cutoff for \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d under AEDPA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe analogy has been rejected by our cases.  We have explained that AEDPA did not codify Teague, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe AEDPA and Teague inquiries are distinct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Horn v. Banks, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 266, 272 (2002) (per curiam).  The retroactivity rules that govern federal habeas review on the merits\xe2\x80\x94which include Teague\xe2\x80\x94are quite separate from the relitigation bar imposed by AEDPA; neither abrogates or qualifies the other.  If \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) was, indeed, pegged to Teague, it would authorize relief when a state-court merits adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that became contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, before the conviction became final.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute says no such thing, and we see no reason why Teague should alter AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGreene alternatively contends that the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cdecision\xe2\x80\x9d to which the \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d criterion must be applied is the decision of the state supreme court that disposes of a direct appeal from a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction or sentence, even when (as here) that decision does not adjudicate the relevant claim on the merits.  This is an implausible reading of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The text, we repeat, provides that habeas relief\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cshall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x83(Emphasis added.)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe words \xe2\x80\x9cthe adjudication\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d clause obviously refer back to the \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicat[ion] on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d and the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d clause obviously refers to the decision produced by that same adjudication on the merits.  A later affirmance of that decision on alternative procedural grounds, for example, would not be a decision resulting from the merits adjudication.  And much less would be (what is at issue here) a decision by the state supreme court not to hear the appeal\xe2\x80\x94that is, not to decide at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Third Circuit held, and the parties do not dispute, that the last state-court adjudication on the merits of Greene\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause claim occurred on direct appeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court.  606 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 92, and n.\xc2\xa01.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision predated our decision in Gray by nearly three months.  The Third Circuit thus correctly held that Gray was not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d against which it could measure the Pennsylvania Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  606 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 99.  The panel then concluded (and the parties do not dispute) that the Pennsylvania Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision neither was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to,\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved an unreasonable application of,\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d that existed at the time.  Id., at 106.  Consequently, \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) bars the federal courts from granting Greene\xe2\x80\x99s application for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe must observe that Greene\xe2\x80\x99s predicament is an unusual one of his own creation.  Before applying for federal habeas, he missed two opportunities to obtain relief under Gray: After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed his appeal, he did not file a petition for writ of certiorari from this Court, which would almost certainly have produced a remand in light of the intervening Gray decision.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere intervening developments .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity for further consideration, and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of the litigation, [an order granting the petition, vacating the judgment below, and remanding the case (GVR)] is, we believe, potentially appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam).  See, e.g., Stanbridge v. New York, 395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 709 (1969) (per curiam) (GVR in light of Bruton).  Nor did Greene assert his Gray claim in a petition for state postconviction relief.  Having forgone two obvious means of asserting his claim, Greene asks us to provide him relief by interpreting AEDPA in a manner contrary to both its text and our precedents.
