Petitioner, along with several others, was indicted for violating \xc2\xa7 1955 in a single count charging that the defendants\' gambling business involved numbers betting and betting on horse races in violation of a specified Massachusetts statute.  The Government\'s evidence at trial in the District Court showed that the defendants had been engaged in both horse betting and numbers betting.  At the close of the Government\'s case, defense counsel argued that the Government had failed to prove a violation of the Massachusetts statute because that statute did not prohibit numbers betting, but only horse betting.  After the defendants had rested, the trial judge granted their motion to exclude all evidence of numbers betting, and then granted a motion to acquit petitioner because of lack of evidence of his connection with the horse betting business.  The case against the remaining defendants went to the jury, and they were all convicted.  The Government appealed under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731 (1976 ed.) from the order excluding the numbers betting evidence and from the judgment acquitting petitioner, and sought a new trial on the portion of the indictment relating to numbers betting.  The Court of Appeals held that it had jurisdiction of the appeal, taking the view that, although \xc2\xa7 3731, by its terms, authorizes the Government to appeal only from orders "dismissing an indictment . . . as to any one or more counts," the word "counts" refers to any discrete basis for imposing criminal liability, that, since the horse betting and numbers allegations were discrete bases for liability duplicitously joined in a single count, the District Court\'s action constituted a "dismissal" of the numbers "charge" and an acquittal for insufficient evidence on the horse betting charge, and that therefore \xc2\xa7 3731 authorized an appeal from the "dismissal" of the numbers charge.  The court went on to hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment did not bar a retrial, because petitioner had voluntarily terminated the proceedings on the numbers portion of the count by moving, in effect, to dismiss it.

Resolution of this issue depends on the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the somewhat unusual facts of this case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner was indicted, along with several others, for violating 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1955 (1976 ed.), which makes it a federal offense to conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of an "illegal gambling business." \xc2\xa7 1955(a).  Such a business is defined as one that is conducted by five or more persons in violation of the law of the place where the business is located and that operates for at least 30 days or earns at least $2,000 in any one day.  \xc2\xa7 1955(b)(1). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 437 U. S. 57</a></p><p> single-count indictment here charged in relevant part that the defendants\' gambling business involved</p>\n<p>"accepting, recording and registering bets and wagers on a parimutual [<em>sic</em>] number pool and on the result of a trial and contest of skill, speed, and endurance of beast,"</p>\n<p>and that the business "was a violation of the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to-wit, M.G.L.A. Chapter 271, Section 17." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government\'s evidence at trial showed the defendants to have been engaged primarily in horse betting and numbers betting.  At the close of the Government\'s case, petitioner\'s counsel, who represented 8 of the 11 defendants, moved for a judgment of acquittal as to all of his clients.  Joined by counsel for other defendants, he argued, <em>inter alia,</em> that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="58">Page 437 U. S. 58</a></p><p> Government had failed to prove that there was a violation of the state statutory section as alleged in the indictment, since Mass.Gen.Laws Ann., ch. 271, \xc2\xa7 17 (West 1970), as construed by the state courts, did not prohibit numbers betting, but applied only to betting on "games of competition" such as horse races.  The Government responded that "violation of the State law is a jurisdictional element of [the federal] statute," and that "not every [defendant] must be found to be violating this State law."  The District Court accepted the Government\'s theory and denied the defendants\' motion, stating that "a defendant, to be convicted, must [only] be found to have joined in [the illegal] enterprise in some way."</p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s counsel then sought clarification of whether "the numbers pool allegation [was] still in the case."  The court indicated that it was, because counsel had not presented any state court authority for the proposition that \xc2\xa7 17 did not include numbers betting.  The court also expressed the view, however, that, if petitioner\'s counsel were correct, "we would have to exclude . . . all of the evidence that has to do with bets o[n] numbers."  The Government demurred, arguing that exclusion of the numbers evidence would "not necessarily follow" from acceptance of petitioner\'s theory. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Taking his lead from the court, petitioner\'s counsel next moved "to strike or limit the evidence."  The motion was denied.</p>\n<p>After the defendants had rested, the trial judge announced that he was reversing his earlier ruling on the motion to exclude evidence, because he had discovered a Massachusetts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="59">Page 437 U. S. 59</a></p><p> case holding that numbers betting was not prohibited by \xc2\xa7 17, but only by \xc2\xa7 7 of ch. 271. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The court then struck all evidence of numbers betting, apparently because it believed such action to be required by the indictment\'s failure to set forth the proper section. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>At this point counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal as to petitioner alone, arguing that there was no evidence of his connection with horse betting activities.  The Government did not disagree that the evidence was insufficient to show petitioner\'s involvement with a horse betting operation, but repeated its earlier argument relating to the "jurisdictional" nature of the state law violation.  The court rejected this contention, stating that the offense had "to be established in the terms that you [the Government] charged it, which was as a violation of \xc2\xa7 17," and that petitioner had to be "connected with this operation, and, by that, I mean a horse operation."  The court concluded:  "I don\'t think you\'ve done it."  It then granted petitioner\'s motion for a judgment of acquittal [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and entered an order embodying this ruling later that day. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The next day, the Government moved the court to reconsider both "its ruling . . . striking . . . evidence concerning the operation of an illegal . . . numbers pool" and "its decision granting defendant Thomas Sanabria\'s motion for judgement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="60">Page 437 U. S. 60</a></p><p> [<em>sic</em>] of acquittal." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Prompted by the Government\'s arguments in support of reconsideration, the court asked defense counsel why he had not raised the objection to the indictment\'s citation of \xc2\xa7 17 earlier, and what prejudice resulted to petitioner from the failure to cite the proper section.  Counsel responded that the objection had not "ripened" until, at the end of the Government\'s case, the court was asked to take judicial notice of \xc2\xa7 17, and that he need not and did not allege actual prejudice.  The court denied the motions to reconsider, but indicated that, had it granted the motion to restore the numbers evidence, it also would have vacated the judgment of acquittal. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The case against the remaining 10 defendants went to the jury on a theory that the gambling business was engaged in horse betting; all were convicted.</p>\n<p>The Government filed a timely appeal</p>\n<p>"from [the] decision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="61">Page 437 U. S. 61</a></p><p> and order . . . excluding evidence and entering a judgment of acquittal . . . and . . . denying the Motion for Reconsideration."</p>\n<p>Conceding that there could be no review of the District Court\'s ruling that there was insufficient evidence of petitioner\'s involvement with horse betting, the Government sought a new trial on the portion of the indictment relating to numbers betting.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held first that it had jurisdiction of the appeal.  Although the jurisdictional statute, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731 (1976 ed.), by its terms authorizes the Government to appeal only from orders "dismissing an indictment . . . as to any one or more counts," [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] the word "count" was "interpret[ed] . . . to refer to any discrete basis for the imposition of criminal liability."  548 F.2d 1, 5 (197).  Viewing the horse betting and numbers allegations as "discrete bas[es] of criminal liability" duplicitously joined in a single count, the court characterized the District Court\'s action as a "dismissal" of the numbers "charge" and an acquittal for insufficient evidence on the horse betting charge.  <em>Id.</em> at 4-5, and n. 4.  It concluded that \xc2\xa7 3731 authorized an appeal from the "dismissal" of the numbers charge, "if the double jeopardy clause does not bar a future prosecution on this charge."  54 F.2d at 5.</p>\n<p>Consistent with its above analysis, the court found that petitioner had voluntarily terminated the proceedings on the numbers portion of the count by moving, in effect, to dismiss it.  Since the "dismissal" imported no ruling on petitioner\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="62">Page 437 U. S. 62</a></p><p> "criminal liability as such," and since petitioner\'s motion was not attributable to "prosecutorial or judicial overreaching," the court applied the rule permitting retrials after a prosecution is terminated by a defendant\'s request for a mistrial.  <em>Id.</em> at 7-8, citing <em>United States v. Dinitz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/600/case.html">424 U. S. 600</a></span> (1976).  There being no double jeopardy bar to a new trial, the court went on to resolve the merits of the appeal in the Government\'s favor.  It held, based on an intervening First Circuit decision, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] that the District Court had erred in "dismissing" the numbers theory.  Accordingly, the judgment of acquittal was "vacated," and the case</p>\n<p>"remanded so that the government may try defendant on that portion of the indictment that charges a violation of \xc2\xa7 1955 based upon numbering [<em>sic</em>] activities."</p>\n<p>548 F.2d at 8.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 433 U.S. 907 (1977), [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] limiting our review to the related issues of appealability and double jeopardy. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  We now reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="63">Page 437 U. S. 63</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>United States v. Wilson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/332/case.html">420 U. S. 332</a></span> (1975), we found that the primary purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause was to prevent successive trials, and not Government appeals <em>per se.</em>  Thus, we held that, where an indictment is dismissed after a guilty verdict is rendered, the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar an appeal, since the verdict could simply be reinstated without a new trial if the Government were successful. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  That a new trial will follow upon a Government appeal does not necessarily forbid it, however, because, in limited circumstances, a second trial on the same offense is constitutionally permissible. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Appealability in this case therefore turns on whether the new trial ordered by the court below would violate the command of the Fifth Amendment that no "person [shall] be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb." [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 437 U. S. 64</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In deciding whether a second trial is permissible here, we must immediately confront the fact that petitioner was acquitted on the indictment.  That " \'[a] verdict of acquittal . . . [may] not be reviewed . . . without putting [the defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution\'" has recently been described as "the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence."  <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/564/case.html">430 U. S. 564</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/564/case.html#571">430 U. S. 571</a></span> (1977), quoting <em>United States v. Ball,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/163/662/case.html">163 U. S. 662</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/163/662/case.html#671">163 U. S. 671</a></span> (1896).  The fundamental nature of this rule is manifested by its explicit extension to situations where an acquittal is "based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation."  <em>Fong Foo v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/141/case.html">369 U. S. 141</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/141/case.html#143">369 U. S. 143</a></span> (1962); <em>see Green v.

In <em>Fong Foo,</em> the Court of Appeals held that the District Court had erred in various rulings and lacked power to direct a verdict of acquittal before the Government rested its case. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  We accepted the Court of Appeals\' holding that the District Court had erred, but nevertheless found that the Double Jeopardy Clause was "violated when the Court of Appeals set aside the judgment of acquittal and directed that petitioners be tried again for the same offense."  369 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/141/case.html#143">369 U. S. 143</a></span>.  Thus, when a defendant has been acquitted at trial, he may not be retried on the same offense, even if the legal rulings underlying the acquittal were erroneous.</p>\n<p>The Government does not take issue with these basic principles.  Indeed, it concedes that the acquittal for insufficient evidence on what it refers to as the horse betting theory of liability is unreviewable, and bars a second trial on that charge. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The disputed question, however, is whether a retrial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 437 U. S. 65</a></p><p> on the numbers theory of liability would be on the "same offense" as that on which petitioner has been acquitted.</p>\n<p>The Government contends, in accordance with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, that the numbers theory was dismissed from the count before the judgment of acquittal was entered, and therefore that petitioner was not acquitted of the numbers theory.  Petitioner responds that the District Court did not "dismiss" anything, but rather struck evidence and acquitted petitioner on the entire count; further, assuming <em>arguendo</em> that there was a "dismissal" of the numbers theory, he urges that a retrial on this theory would nevertheless be barred as a second trial on the same statutory offense.  We first consider whether the Court of Appeals correctly characterized the District Court\'s action as a "dismissal" of the numbers theory.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In the Government\'s view, the numbers theory was "dismissed" from the case as effectively as if the Government had actually charged the crime in two counts and the District Court had dismissed the numbers count.  The first difficulty this argument encounters is that the Government did not, in fact, charge this offense in two counts.  Legal consequences ordinarily flow from what has actually happened, not from what a party might have done from the vantage of hindsight.  <em>See Central Tablet Mfg. Co. v.

Whether a particular course of conduct involves one or more distinct "offenses" under the statute depends on this congressional choice. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>The allowable unit of prosecution under \xc2\xa7 1955 is defined as participation in a single "illegal gambling business."  Congress did not assimilate state gambling laws <em>per se</em> into the federal penal code, nor did it define discrete acts of gambling as independent federal offenses.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 91-1549, p. 53 (1970).  <em>See also Iannelli v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/770/case.html">420 U.

The Government need not prove that the defendant himself performed any act of gambling prohibited by state law. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  It is participation in the gambling business that is a federal offense, and it is only the gambling business that must violate state law.

With regard to this single business, participation in which is concededly only a single offense, we have no doubt that petitioner was truly acquitted.</p>\n<p>We have recently defined an acquittal as "<em>a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\'"  <em>Lee v.

Brief for United States 33.  Although there may be circumstances in which this is true, petitioner here was acquitted for insufficient proof of an element of the crime which both such counts would share -- that he was "connected with" the single gambling business.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#59">437 U. S. 59</a></span>.  This finding of fact stands as an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="73">Page 437 U. S. 73</a></p><p> absolute bar to any further prosecution for participation in that business. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government having charged only a single gambling business, the discrete violations of state law which that business may have committed are not severable in order to avoid the Double Jeopardy Clause\'s bar on retrials for the "same offense." [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  Indeed, the Government\'s argument that these are discrete bases of liability warranting reprosecution following a final judgment of acquittal on one such "discrete basis" is quite similar to an unsuccessful argument that it presented in <em>Braverman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/49/case.html">317 U. S. 49</a></span> (1942).  Braverman had been convicted of and received consecutive sentences on four separate counts of conspiracy, each count alleging a conspiracy to violate a separate substantive provision of the federal narcotics laws.  The Government conceded that only a single conspiracy existed, as it concedes here that only a single gambling business existed; nonetheless, it urged that separate punishments were appropriate because the single conspiracy had several discrete objects.  We firmly rejected that argument:</p>\n<p>"[T]he precise nature and extent of the conspiracy must be determined by reference to the agreement which embraces and defines its objects.  Whether the object of a single agreement is to commit one or many crimes, it is, in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 437 U. S. 74</a></p><p> either case, that agreement which constitutes the conspiracy which the statute punishes.  The one agreement cannot be taken to be several agreements, and hence several conspiracies, because it envisages the violation of several statutes, rather than one."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/49/case.html#53">317 U. S. 53</a></span>.  The same reasoning must also apply where the essence of the crime created by Congress is participation in a "business," rather than participation in an "agreement." [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>The Double Jeopardy Clause is no less offended because the Government here seeks to try petitioner twice for this single offense, instead of seeking to punish him twice. as it did in <em>Braverman.</em> [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>"If two offenses are the same . . . for purposes of barring consecutive sentences at a single trial, they necessarily will be the same for purposes of barring successive prosecutions."</p>\n<p><em>Brown v. Ohio, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/161/case.html#166">432 U. S. 166</a></span>.  Accordingly, even if the numbers allegation were "dismissed," we conclude that a subsequent trial of petitioner for conducting the same illegal gambling business as that at issue in the first trial would subject him to a second trial on the "same offense" of which he was acquitted. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 437 U. S. 75</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The only question remaining is whether any of the exceptions to the constitutional rule forbidding successive trials on the same offense, <em>see</em> <a href="#F15" name="T15">n</a> 15, <em>supra,</em> apply here.  The short answer to this question is that there is no exception permitting retrial once the defendant has been acquitted, no matter how "egregiously erroneous," <em>Fong Foo v. United States,</em> 369 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/141/case.html#143">369 U. S. 143</a></span>, the legal rulings leading to that judgment might be.  The Government nevertheless argues, relying principally on <em>Lee v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/23/case.html">432 U. S. 23</a></span> (1977), and <em>Jeffers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html">432 U. S. 137</a></span> (1977), that petitioner waived his double jeopardy rights by moving to "dismiss" the numbers allegation and by not objecting to the form of the allegation prior to trial.</p>\n<p>In <em>Lee,</em> we held a retrial permissible because the District Court\'s midtrial decision granting the defendant\'s motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense was "functionally indistinguishable from a declaration of mistrial" at the defendant\'s request. 432 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/1/case.html#3">432 U. S. 31</a></span>.  The mistrial analogy relied on in <em>Lee</em> is manifestly inapposite here.  Although jeopardy had attached in <em>Lee,</em> no verdict had been rendered; indeed, petitioner conceded that "the District Court\'s termination of the first trial was not an acquittal," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/23/case.html#30">432 U. S. 30</a></span> n. 8.  Here, by contrast, the trial proceeded to verdict, and petitioner was acquitted.  While, in <em>Lee,</em> the trial court clearly did contemplate a reprosecution when it granted defendant\'s motion, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/23/case.html#30">432 U. S. 30</a></span>-31, neither petitioner\'s motion here nor the trial court\'s rulings contemplated a second trial -- nor could they have, since only a single offense was involved and petitioner went to judgment on that offense.  Where a trial terminates with a judgment of acquittal, as here, "double jeopardy principles governing the permissibility of retrial after a declaration of mistrial," <em>Lee v. United States,</em> 432 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/1/case.html#3">432 U. S. 31</a></span>, have no bearing.</p>\n<p>Nor does <em>Jeffers</em> support the Government\'s position.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 437 U. S. 76</a></p><p> defendant there was first tried and convicted of conspiring to distribute narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 846.  Eight Members of the Court agreed that his subsequent trial for conducting a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 848 during the same time period was on the "same offense," since the \xc2\xa7 846 violation was a lesser included offense to the \xc2\xa7 848 violation.  Prior to the first trial, however, Jeffers had specifically opposed the Government\'s effort to try both indictments together, in part on the ground that they involved distinct offenses.  432 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html#144">432 U. S. 144</a></span> n. 8.  Reasoning that Jeffers necessarily contemplated a second trial, four Members of the Court found that he had "elect[ed] to have the two offenses tried separately," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html#152">432 U. S. 152</a></span>, and, by not raising the potential double jeopardy problem, had waived any objection on that ground to successive trials, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html#152">432 U. S. 152</a></span>-154. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  The instant case presents quite a different situation.  Petitioner\'s counsel never argued that horse betting and numbers were distinct offenses, [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>] <em>a fortiori</em> did not argue for or contemplate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="77">Page 437 U. S. 77</a></p><p> separate trials on each theory, and a <em>multo fortiori,</em> did not "elect" to undergo successive trials.</p>\n<p>Finally, we agree with the Court of Appeals that this case does not present the hypothetical situation on which we reserved judgment in <em>Serfass v. United States,</em> of</p>\n<p>"\'a defendant who is afforded an opportunity to obtain a determination of a legal defense prior to trial, and nevertheless knowingly allows himself to be placed in jeopardy before raising the defense.\'"</p>\n<p>420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/377/case.html#394">420 U. S. 394</a></span>, quoting Solicitor General; <em>see</em> 548 F.2d at 7.  Petitioner did not have a "legal defense" to the single offense charged:  participating in an illegal gambling business in violation of \xc2\xa7 1955.  Unlike questions of whether an indictment states an offense, a statute is unconstitutional, or conduct set forth in an indictment violates the statute, what proof may be presented in support of a valid indictment and the sufficiency of that proof are not "legal defenses" required to be, or even capable of being, resolved before trial.  In all of the former instances, a ruling in the defendant\'s favor completely precludes conviction, at least on that indictment.  Here, even if the numbers language had been struck before trial, there was no "legal" reason why petitioner could not have been convicted on this indictment, as were his 10 codefendants.  The acquittal resulted from the insufficiency of the Government\'s proof at trial to establish petitioner\'s connection with the gambling business, as the trial judge erroneously understood it to have been charged.</p>\n<p>The Government\'s real quarrel is with the judgment of acquittal.  While the numbers evidence was erroneously excluded, the judgment of acquittal produced thereby is final and unreviewable.  Neither 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731 (1976 ed.) nor </p><p><a class="page-number" name="78">Page 437 U. S. 78</a></p><p> the Double Jeopardy Clause permits the Government to obtain relief from all of the adverse rulings -- most of which result from defense motions -- that lead to the termination of a criminal trial in the defendant\'s favor.  <em>See United States v. Wilson,</em> 420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/35/case.html">420 U. S. 351</a></span>-352; S.Rep. No. 91-1296, p. 2 (1970).  To hold that a defendant waives his double jeopardy protection whenever a trial court error in his favor on a mid-trial motion leads to an acquittal would undercut the adversary assumption on which our system of criminal justice rests, <em>see Jeffers v. United States,</em> 432 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html#159">432 U.

The Government does not contend that the ruling excluding numbers evidence was appealable under this provision.  By its plain terms, moreover, this second paragraph of \xc2\xa7 3731 does not authorize this appeal, since the ruling excluding evidence occurred after the defendant had been put in jeopardy and before verdict.  <em>Cf.

In that event, however, petitioner could not have been acquitted of the horse betting count, and the instant problem would not have arisen.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals erred in its apparent view that the Government should have drawn the indictment in two counts because the single count was duplicitous.  548 F.2d at 5 n. 4.  Only a single gambling business was alleged, and hence only a single offense.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#70">437 U. S. 70</a></span>-71.  A single offense should normally be charged in one count, rather than several, even if different means of committing the offense are alleged.  <em>See</em> Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 7(c)(1); Advisory Committee\'s Notes on Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 7, 18 U.S.C.App. p. 1413 (1976 ed.);  <a href="#F19" name="T19">n</a>19, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals might have been warranted in dismissing the appeal for failure of the notice to specify the only arguably appealable ruling rendered below.  The court believed that "[t]he critical ruling by the district court was that the indictment failed to charge a violation of \xc2\xa7 1955 on a numbers theory."  548 F.2d at 5 n. 5.  But this "critical ruling," which the court below concluded was a "dismissal," is not set forth in the notice of appeal.  Since the Government is not authorized to appeal from all adverse rulings in criminal cases, it is especially important that it specify precisely what it claims to have been the appealable ruling.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, however, must have concluded that the notice was sufficient to bring up for review the legal ruling preceding the order excluding evidence.  A mistake in designating the judgment appealed from is not always fatal, so long as the intent to appeal from a specific ruling can fairly be inferred by probing the notice and the other party was not misled or prejudiced.  <em>Daily Mirror, Inc. v. New York News, Inc.,</em> 533 F.2d 53 (CA2 1976) (per curiam); <em>Jones v. Nelson,</em> 484 F.2d 1165 (CA10 1973).  The Government\'s "Designation of Issue [<em>sic</em>] on Appeal," apparently filed after the notice, did set forth that</p>\n<p>"[t]he trial judge erred in ruling that M.G.L.A. Chapter 271, Section 17, does not encompass an illegal numbers operation and as a result erred in granting the Motion to Strike and the Motion for Judgment of Acquittal."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court\'s interpretation of the indictment as not encompassing a charge that the gambling business engaged in numbers betting in violation of state law did not, by itself, require that numbers evidence be excluded.  Even if the indictment had charged only that the defendants had conducted an illegal gambling business engaged in horse betting activities in violation of state law, evidence relating to numbers betting would have been admissible, absent actual surprise or prejudice, to  show the defendants\' connection with "all or part of [that] illegal gambling business."  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1955(a) (1976 ed.).  As the Government repeatedly argued to the District Court, the violation of state law is a jurisdictional element which need only be proved with respect to the business.</p>\n<p>The District Court\'s erroneous assumption that the numbers evidence had to be excluded may have resulted in part from the government\'s failure to repeat in full its earlier argument, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#58">437 U. S. 58</a></span>, when the judge ruled that \xc2\xa7 17 did not encompass numbers betting, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#58">437 U. S. 58</a></span>-59.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  Had the numbers evidence not been excluded, the judgment of acquittal would not have been entered, even if the court adhered to its ruling on the scope of the indictment, and the case would have gone to the jury, presumably with instructions that the jurors had to find the gambling business to have engaged in horse betting, and the defendants to have conducted "all or part" of that gambling business.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>We agree with the Court of Appeals, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#61">437 U. S. 61</a></span>, that there is no statutory barrier to an appeal from an order dismissing only a portion of a count.  One express purpose of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731 (1976 ed.) is to permit appeals from orders dismissing indictments "as to any one or more counts."  A "count" is the usual organizational subunit of an indictment, and it would therefore appear that Congress intended to authorize appeals from any order dismissing an indictment in whole or in part.  Congress could hardly have meant appealability to depend on the initial decision of a prosecutor to charge in one count what could also have been charged in two, a decision frequently fortuitous for purposes of the interests served by \xc2\xa7 3731.  To so rule would import an empty formalism into a statute expressly designed to eliminate "[t]echnical distinctions in pleadings as limitations on appeals by the United States."  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 91-1768, p. 21 (1970); <em>accord,</em> S.Rep. No. 91-1296, p. 5 (1970).  We note that the only Court of Appeals other than the court below that has considered this question reached a similar result.  <em>United State v.

Because only a single violation of a single statute is at issue here, we do not analyze this case under the so-called "same evidence" test, which is frequently used to determine whether a single transaction may give rise to separate prosecutions, convictions, and/or punishments under separate statutes.  <em>See, e.g., Gavieres v.

They relied in part on the fact that Jeffers, who had argued in the District Court that the two statutes involved distinct offenses, had "never affirmatively argued that the difference in the two statutes was so great as to authorize separate punishments. . . ."  432 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html#154">432 U.

[The dog betting] stands by itself as a separate business, and . . . the government [must] prove one business here.  It\'s like having multiple conspiracy."</p>\n<p>Record 229.  The motion for exclusion was denied because the District Court found that dog betting was part of the single gambling business shown to have been conducted from the office at 63 Bickford Avenue.  <em>Id.</em> at 29-30.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.</p>\n<p>Although I join the text of the Court\'s opinion, I cannot agree with the dictum in footnote 23.  It is true "that there is no statutory barrier to an appeal from an order dismissing only a portion of a count," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#69">437 U. S. 69</a></span> n. 23, but it is equally true that there is no statutory authority for such an appeal.  It necessarily follows -- at least if we are faithful to the concept that federal courts have only such jurisdiction as is conferred by Congress -- that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction of this appeal.</p>\n<p>The Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731 (1976 ed.), authorizes the United States to appeal an order of a district </p><p><a class="page-number" name="79">Page 437 U. S. 79</a></p><p> court</p>\n<p>"dismissing an indictment or information <em>as to any one or more counts,</em> except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  By its plain terms, this statute does not encompass the present case.</p>\n<p>Putting to one side the question whether an acquittal may properly be regarded as an order "dismissing an indictment" within the meaning of the statute, <em>see United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/564/case.html">430 U. S. 564</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/564/case.html#576">430 U. S. 576</a></span> (STEVENS, J., concurring), the statutory grant of appellate jurisdiction is still unequivocally limited to review of a dismissal "as to any one or more counts."  The statute does not refer to "subunit[s] of an indictment" or "portion[s] of a count," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#69">437 U. S. 69</a></span> n. 23, but only to "counts," a well known and unambiguous term of art.</p>\n<p>Prior to the amendment of \xc2\xa7 3731 in 1971, this Court\'s rule of statutory interpretation was that</p>\n<p>"the Criminal Appeals Act [should be] strictly construed against the Government\'s right of appeal, <em>Carroll v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/354/394/case.html">354 U. S. 394</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/354/394/case.html#399">354 U. S. 399</a></span>-400 (1957)."</p>\n<p><em>Will v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/90/case.html">389 U. S. 90</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/90/case.html#96">389 U. S. 96</a></span>-97.  The Court\'s present pattern of interpretation of \xc2\xa7 3731, as exemplified by <em>Martin Linen, supra,</em> does more than simply abandon this approach; it reverses direction entirely and reads the statute in whatever manner would favor a Government appeal.  It is, of course, true that the legislative history of the Act indicates that Congress intended \xc2\xa7 3731 "to be liberally construed," S.Rep. No. 91-1296, p. 18 (1970), but this expression of legislative intent does not give us a license to ignore the words of the statute.  In fact, the Court does not even suggest that the language "one or more counts" is ambiguous; instead, it argues that the words cannot be given their proper meaning, because the Act was intended "to eliminate <em>[t]echnical distinctions in pleadings. . . .\'" <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#69">437 U. S. 69</a></span> n. 23.  This argument has a hollow ring in light of the Court\'s prior assertion </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="80">Page 437 U. S. 80</a></em></p><p><em> that\n</em></p>\n<p>"[t]he precise manner in which an indictment is drawn cannot be ignored, because an important function of the indictment is to ensure that, \'in case any other proceedings are taken against [the defendant] for a similar offence, . . . the record [will] show with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#65">437 U. S. 65</a></span>-66.  Furthermore, in my judgment, a rule that the Government may appeal from the "dismissal" of a portion of a count, provided that the portion establishes a "discrete basis of liability," fosters. rather than eliminates. technical distinctions. and encourages exactly the sort of nearsighted parsing of indictments that the amendment was intended to discourage.</p>\n<p>I cannot, therefore, join that portion of the Court\'s decision which states that the Criminal Appeals Act permits an appeal from only a portion of a count.  It clearly does not, and, for that reason, as well as for the reasons stated in the text of the Court\'s opinion, the Court of Appeals\' decision must be reversed.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This case, of course, is an odd and an unusual one, factually and procedurally.  Because it is, the case will afford little guidance as precedent in the Court\'s continuing struggle to create order and understanding out of the confusion of the lengthening list of its decisions on the Double Jeopardy Clause.  I would have thought, however, that the principles enunciated late last Term in <em>Lee v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/23/case.html">432 U. S. 23</a></span> (1977) -- which I deem a more difficult case for the Government than this one -- had application to the facts here.  I do not share the Court\'s distinction of <em>Lee, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html#75">437 U. S. 75</a></span>, and I do not agree that <em>Lee</em> is "manifestly inapposite."  Here, as in <em>Lee,</em> there is misdescription by the trial court of the nature of its order, and, as in <em>Lee,</em> the defendant-petitioner\'s maneuvers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="81">Page 437 U. S. 81</a></p><p> should result in a surrender of his right to receive a verdict by the jury that had been drawn.  Further, it appears to me that petitioner has succeeded in having the indictment read one way in the trial court, and another way here, as the situation required.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
