The Amendment\'s requirement that the venire from which the jury is chosen represent a fair cross section of the community constitutes a means of assuring, not a <em>representative</em> jury (which the Constitution does not demand), but an <em>impartial</em> one (which it does).

S. 476</a></p><p> challenge to the prosecutor\'s exercise of peremptory challenges to exclude all black potential jurors from his petit jury, and (2) whether such exclusion violates his Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner Daniel Holland was charged in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, with aggravated kidnaping, rape, deviate sexual assault, armed robbery, and aggravated battery.  According to his allegations, a venire of 30 potential jurors was assembled, 2 of whom were black.  Petitioner\'s counsel objected to those of the State\'s peremptory challenges that struck the two black venire members from the petit jury, on the ground that petitioner had a Sixth Amendment right to "be tried by a representative cross section of the community."  App. 7-8.  The trial judge overruled the objection, and petitioner was subsequently convicted of all except the aggravated battery charge.  The convictions were reversed by the Illinois Appellate Court, First District, 147 Ill.App.3d 323, 100 Ill.Dec. 868, 497 N.E.2d 1230 (1986), on grounds that are irrelevant here, but, on further appeal by the State, were reinstated by the Illinois Supreme Court, which rejected petitioner\'s Equal Protection Clause and Sixth Amendment challenges to the exclusion of the black jurors.  121 Ill.2d 136, 117 Ill.Dec. 109, 520 N.E.2d 270 (1987).  We granted Holland\'s petition for certiorari asserting that the Sixth Amendment holding was error.  489 U.S. 1051 (1989).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The threshold question is whether petitioner, who is white, has standing to raise a Sixth Amendment challenge to the exclusion of blacks from his jury.  We hold that he does.</p>\n<p>In <em>Batson v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html">476 U. S. 79</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#96">476 U. S. 96</a></span> (1986), we said that, to establish a <em>prima facie</em> Equal Protection Clause violation in the discriminatory exclusion of petit jurors, the defendant</p>\n<p>"must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 493 U. S. 477</a></p><p> group . . . and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire <em>members of the defendant\'s race. . . .</em>"</p>\n<p>(emphasis added).  We have never suggested, however, that such a requirement of correlation between the group identification of the defendant and the group identification of excluded venire members is necessary for Sixth Amendment standing.  To the contrary, our cases hold that the Sixth Amendment entitles every defendant to object to a venire that is not designed to represent a fair cross section of the community, whether or not the systematically excluded groups are groups to which he himself belongs.  <em>See, e.g., Duren v. Missouri,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/357/case.html">439 U. S. 357</a></span> (1979); <em>Taylor v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html">419 U. S. 522</a></span> (1975).  Thus, in <em>Taylor,</em> we found standing in circumstances analogous to petitioner\'s:</p>\n<p>"The State first insists that Taylor, a male, has no standing to object to the exclusion of women from his jury.  But Taylor\'s claim is that he was constitutionally entitled to a jury drawn from a venire constituting a fair cross section of the community and that the jury that tried him was not such a jury by reason of the exclusion of women.  Taylor was not a member of the excluded class; but there is no rule that claims such as Taylor presents may be made only by those defendants who are members of the group excluded from jury service."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html#526">419 U. S. 526</a></span>.  Of course, in this case petitioner seeks an extension of the fair cross-section requirement from the venire to the petit jury -- but that variation calls into question the scope of the Sixth Amendment guarantee, not his standing to assert it.  We proceed, then, to the merits of the claim.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner asserts that the prosecutor intentionally used his peremptory challenges to strike all black prospective jurors solely on the basis of their race, thereby preventing a distinctive group in the community from being represented </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 493 U. S. 478</a></p><p> on his jury.  This, he contends, violated the Sixth Amendment by denying him a "fair possibility" of a petit jury representing a cross section of the community.  Petitioner invites us to remedy the perceived violation by incorporating into the Sixth Amendment the test we devised in <em>Batson</em> to permit black defendants to establish a <em>prima facie</em> violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Under petitioner\'s approach, a defendant of any race could establish a <em>prima facie</em> violation of the Sixth Amendment by objecting to the use of peremptory challenges to exclude all blacks from the jury.  The burden would then shift to the prosecutor to show that the exercise of his peremptory challenges was not based on intentional discrimination against the black potential jurors solely because of their race.  Only if the prosecutor could then show nonracial grounds for the strikes would no Sixth Amendment violation be found.</p>\n<p>We reject petitioner\'s fundamental thesis that a prosecutor\'s use of peremptory challenges to eliminate a distinctive group in the community deprives the defendant of a Sixth Amendment right to the "fair possibility" of a representative jury.  While statements in our prior cases have alluded to such a "fair possibility" requirement, satisfying it has not been held to require anything beyond the inclusion of all cognizable groups in the venire, <em>see Lockhart v. McCree,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/162/case.html">476 U. S. 162</a></span> (1986); <em>Duren, supra; Taylor, supra,</em> and the use of a jury numbering at least six persons, <em>see Ballew v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/223/case.html">435 U. S. 223</a></span> (1978); <em>Williams v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/78/case.html">399 U. S. 78</a></span> (1970).  A prohibition upon the exclusion of cognizable groups through peremptory challenges has no conceivable basis in the text of the Sixth Amendment, is without support in our prior decisions, and would undermine, rather than further, the constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury.</p>\n<p>It has long been established that racial groups cannot be excluded from the venire from which a jury is selected.  That constitutional principle was first set forth not under the Sixth Amendment, but under the Equal Protection Clause.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 493 U. S. 479</a></p><p> <em>Strauder v. West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/303/case.html">100 U. S. 303</a></span> (1880).  In that context, the object of the principle and the reach of its logic are not established by our common law traditions of jury trial, but by the Fourteenth Amendment\'s prohibition of unequal treatment in general and racial discrimination in particular.  That prohibition therefore has equal application at the petit jury and the venire stages, as our cases have long recognized.  Thus, in a decision rendered only 12 years after the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted, striking down a West Virginia law that excluded blacks from jury service, we said:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is hard to see why the Statute of West Virginia should not be regarded as discriminating against a colored man when he is put upon trial for an alleged criminal offence against the State.  It is not easy to comprehend how it can be said that, while every white man is entitled to a trial by a jury selected from persons of his own race or color, or, rather, selected without discrimination against his color, and a negro is not, the latter is equally protected by the law with the former.  Is not protection of life and liberty against race or color prejudice, a right, a legal right, under the constitutional amendment?  And how can it be maintained that compelling a colored man to submit to a trial for his life by a jury drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of his race, because of color alone, however well qualified in other respects, is not a denial to him of equal legal protection?"</p>\n<p><em>Strauder, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/303/case.html#309">100 U. S. 309</a></span>.  Four Terms ago, in <em>Batson,</em> we squarely held that race-based exclusion is no more permissible at the individual petit jury stage than at the venire stage -- not because the two stages are inseparably linked, but because the intransigent prohibition of racial discrimination contained in the Fourteenth Amendment applies to both of them. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 493 U. S. 480</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Our relatively recent cases, beginning with <em>Taylor v. Louisiana,</em> hold that a fair-cross-section venire requirement is imposed by the Sixth Amendment, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed. . . ."</p>\n<p>The fair-cross-section venire requirement is obviously not explicit in this text, but is derived from the traditional understanding of how an "impartial jury" is assembled.  That traditional understanding includes a representative venire, so that the jury will be, as we have said, "drawn <em>from</em> a fair cross section of the community," <em>Taylor,</em> 419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html#527">419 U. S. 527</a></span> (emphasis added).  But it has never included the notion that, in the process of drawing the jury, that initial representativeness cannot be diminished by allowing both the accused and the State to eliminate persons thought to be inclined against their interests -- which is precisely how the traditional peremptory challenge system operates.  As we described that system in <em>Swain v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html">380 U. S. 202</a></span> (1965):</p>\n<p>"[The peremptory challenge] is often exercised . . . on grounds normally thought irrelevant to legal proceedings or official action, namely, the race, religion, nationality, occupation or affiliations of people summoned for jury duty.  For the question a prosecutor or defense counsel must decide is not whether a juror of a particular race or nationality is in fact partial, but whether one from a different group is less likely to be."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#220">380 U. S. 220</a></span>-221 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment requirement of a fair cross section on the venire is a means of assuring, not a <em>representative</em> jury (which the Constitution does not demand), but an <em>impartial</em> one (which it does).  Without that requirement, the State could draw up jury lists in such manner as to produce a pool of prospective jurors disproportionately ill-disposed towards one or all classes of defendants, and thus more likely to yield </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 493 U. S. 481</a></p><p> petit juries with similar disposition.  The State would have, in effect, unlimited peremptory challenges to compose the pool in its favor.  The fair-cross-section venire requirement assures, in other words, that in the process of selecting the petit jury the prosecution and defense will compete on an equal basis.</p>\n<p>But to say that the Sixth Amendment deprives the State of the ability to "stack the deck" in its favor is not to say that each side may not, once a fair hand is dealt, use peremptory challenges to eliminate prospective jurors belonging to groups it believes would unduly favor the other side.  Any theory of the Sixth Amendment leading to that result is implausible.  The tradition of peremptory challenges for both the prosecution and the accused was already venerable at the time of Blackstone, <em>see</em> 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 346-348 (1769), was reflected in a federal statute enacted by the same Congress that proposed the Bill of Rights, <em>see</em> Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, \xc2\xa7 30, 1 Stat. 112, 119, was recognized in an opinion by Justice Story to be part of the common law of the United States, <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/25/480/case.html">United States v. Marchant,</a></span></em> 12 Wheat. 480,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/480/case.html#483">25 U. S. 483</a></span>-484 (1827), and has endured through two centuries in all the States, <em>see Swain, supra,</em> 380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#215">380 U. S. 215</a></span>-217.  The constitutional phrase "impartial jury" must surely take its content from this unbroken tradition. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  One could plausibly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 493 U. S. 482</a></p><p> argue (though we have said the contrary, <em>see Stilson v.

S. 586</a></span> (1919)), that the requirement of an "impartial jury" impliedly <em>compels</em> peremptory challenges, but in no way could it be interpreted directly or indirectly to prohibit them.  We have gone out of our way to make this clear in our opinions.  In <em>Lockhart,</em> we said:</p>\n<p>"We have never invoked the fair-cross-section principle to invalidate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 493 U.

This goal, it seems to us, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 493 U.

That is true enough, but inasmuch as those groups happen to constitute all the groups we have considered in the venire context, what it demonstrates is not how difficult it is to meet our standards for distinctiveness, but how few groups are systematically excluded from the venire.  As we have discussed, however, many groups are regularly excluded from the petit jury through peremptory challenge.  Lockhart itself suggests, quite rightly, that even so exotic a group as "<em>Witherspoon</em>-excludables" would be a distinctive group whose rejection at the venire stage would violate the Sixth Amendment.  476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/162/case.html#176">476 U.

In short, there is no substance to the contention that what we hold today "ignor[es] precedent after precedent."</p>\n<p>Justice MARSHALL\'s dissent rolls out the ultimate weapon, the accusation of insensitivity to racial discrimination -- which will lose its intimidating effect if it continues to be fired so randomly.

His Sixth Amendment claim would be just as strong if the object of the exclusion had been, not blacks, but postmen, or lawyers, or clergymen, or any number of other identifiable groups.  Race as such has nothing to do with the legal issue in this case.  We do not hold that the systematic exclusion of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 493 U.

Nor do we even hold that this particular (white) defendant does not have a valid constitutional challenge to such racial exclusion. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  All we hold is that he does not have a valid constitutional challenge based on the Sixth Amendment -- which no more forbids the prosecutor to strike jurors on the basis of race than it forbids him to strike them on the basis of innumerable other generalized characteristics.</p>\n<p>To be sure, as Justice MARSHALL says, the Sixth Amendment sometimes operates "as a weapon to combat racial discrimination," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#504">493 U. S. 504</a></span>, n. 2 -- just as statutes against murder sometimes operate that way.  But it is no more reasonable to portray this as a civil rights case than it is to characterize a proposal for increased murder penalties as an antidiscrimination law.  Since <em>only</em> the Sixth Amendment claim, and not the equal protection claim, is at issue, the question before us is not whether the defendant has been unlawfully discriminated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 493 U. S. 488</a></p><p> against because he was white, or whether the excluded jurors have been unlawfully discriminated against because they were black, but whether the defendant has been denied the right to "trial by an impartial jury."  The earnestness of this Court\'s commitment to racial justice is not to be measured by its willingness to expand constitutional provisions designed for other purposes beyond their proper bounds.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS asserts that our "historical claims are significantly overstated," and that we "will have to do better than Blackstone and the 1790 Congress" for support.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#518">493 U.

As to the former, he quotes "[w]hat Blackstone actually said" -- namely, that the King had no peremptory challenges but only challenges for cause.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But Justice STEVENS\' quotation should have continued to the next two sentences of what Blackstone actually said:</p>\n<p>"However it is held, that the king need not assign his cause of challenge, till all the panel is gone through, and unless there cannot be a full jury without the persons so challenged.  And then, and not sooner, the king\'s counsel must shew the cause:  otherwise the juror shall be sworn."</p>\n<p>4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 347 (1769).</p>\n<p>The 1790 legislation provided that if, in a treason or capital prosecution, the defendant should refuse to plead, or should repeatedly exercise peremptory challenges past a certain number (35 for treason, 20 for other capital cases), "the court . . . shall notwithstanding proceed to . . . trial . . . as if [the defendant] had pleaded not guilty."  1 Stat. 119.  The statute\'s relevance to the present inquiry is that it constitutes acknowledgment of the common law practice of peremptory challenge, a practice that unquestionably extended to defense and prosecution alike.  The Supreme Court decision cited in text, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/480/case.html">United States v. Marchant,</a></span></em> 12 Wheat. 480 (1827), specifically interpreted the Act to permit</p>\n<p>"[t]he acknowledged right of peremptory challenge existing <em>in the crown</em> before the statute of 33 Edw. 1., and the uniform practice which has prevailed since that statute,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/480/case.html#484">25 U.

This entirely misses our point -- which is not that the 1790 Act made the prosecutor\'s peremptory challenge a part of federal statutory law, but merely that (as <em>Marchant</em> held) it acknowledged the prosecutor\'s peremptory challenge to be part of the well established common law that formed the background of the Sixth Amendment.  Far from refuting this, <em>Shackleford</em> reinforces it, referring to the "qualified right [of peremptory challenge], existing at common law, by the government."  18 How. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/59/588/case.html#590">59 U.

But that is quite different from saying that <em>adherence</em> to historical practice can deny the right of jury trial.  Under an historically unencumbered Sixth Amendment of the sort Justice STEVENS apparently envisions, it would be conceivable that a 12-person or a unanimous jury is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS states that a prosecutor\'s "assumption that a black juror may be presumed to be partial simply because he is black . . . is impermissible since <em>Batson.</em>"  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#519">493 U. S. 519</a></span>.  It is undoubtedly true that, since <em>Batson,</em> such an assumption violates the Equal Protection Clause.  That has nothing to do with whether it (and, necessarily, many other group-based assumptions) violates the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>As noted at the outset, petitioner did not seek review of the denial of his Equal Protection Clause claim.

It is almost unprecedented to accept certiorari on a question involving one constitutional provision and then to decide the case under a different constitutional provision neither presented, briefed, nor argued.

We decline to convert <em>Batson</em> from an unexplained departure to an unexplained rule.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join Justice SCALIA\'s opinion, and agree with him that we must reject petitioner\'s claim that the fair cross-section requirement under the Sixth Amendment was violated.  The contention is not supported by our precedents, and admits of no limiting principle to make it workable in practice.  I write this separate concurrence to note that our disposition of the Sixth Amendment claim does not alter what I think to be the established rule, which is that exclusion of a juror on the basis of race, whether or not by use of a peremptory challenge, is a violation of the juror\'s constitutional rights.  <em>Batson v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html">476 U. S. 79</a></span> (1986).  I agree with Justice MARSHALL, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#490">493 U. S. 490</a></span>-491, that this case does not resolve the question whether a defendant of a race different than that of the juror may challenge the race-motivated exclusion of jurors under the constitutional principles that underpin <em>Batson.</em>  Like Justice MARSHALL, I find it essential to make clear that, if the claim here were based on the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause, it would have merit.</p>\n<p>Many of the concerns expressed in <em>Batson,</em> a case where a black defendant objected to the exclusion of black jurors, support as well an equal protection claim by a defendant whose race or ethnicity is different from the dismissed juror\'s.  To bar the claim whenever the defendant\'s race is not the same as the juror\'s would be to concede that racial exclusion of citizens from the duty, and honor, of jury service will </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 493 U. S. 489</a></p><p> be tolerated, or even condoned.  We cannot permit even the inference that this principle will be accepted, for it is inconsistent with the equal participation in civic life that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.  I see no obvious reason to conclude that a defendant\'s race should deprive him of standing in his own trial to vindicate his own jurors\' right to sit.  As Justice MARSHALL states, <em>Batson</em> is based in large part on the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected by nondiscriminatory criteria and on the need to preserve public confidence in the jury system.  These are not values shared only by those of a particular color; they are important to all criminal defendants.</p>\n<p>Support can be drawn also from our established rules of standing, given the premise that a juror\'s right to equal protection is violated when he is excluded because of his race.  <em>See Batson, supra,</em> at 87.  Individual jurors subjected to peremptory racial exclusion have the legal right to bring suit on their own behalf, <em>Carter v. Jury Comm\'n of Greene County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/320/case.html">396 U. S. 320</a></span> (1970), but, as a practical matter, this sort of challenge is most unlikely.  The reality is that a juror dismissed because of his race will leave the courtroom with a lasting sense of exclusion from the experience of jury participation, but possessing little incentive or resources to set in motion the arduous process needed to vindicate his own rights.  We have noted that a substantial relation may entitle one party to raise the rights of another.  <em>See Singleton v. Wulff,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/106/case.html">428 U. S. 106</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/106/case.html#114">428 U. S. 114</a></span>-115 (1976).  An important bond of this type links the accused and an excluded juror.  In sum, the availability of a Fourteenth Amendment claim by a defendant not of the same race as the excluded juror is foreclosed neither by today\'s decision nor by <em>Batson.</em></p>\n<p><em>Batson</em> did contain language indicating that the peremptory challenge of jurors of the same race as the defendant presents a different situation from the peremptory challenge of jurors of another race, but I consider the significance of the discussion to be procedural.  An explicit part of the evidentiary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 493 U. S. 490</a></p><p> scheme adopted in <em>Batson</em> was the defendant\'s showing that he was a member of a "cognizable racial group," and that the excluded juror was a member of the same group.  <em>See</em> 476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#96">476 U. S. 96</a></span>-98.  The structure of this scheme rests upon grounds for suspicion where the prosecutor uses his strikes to exclude jurors whose only connection with the defendant is the irrelevant factor of race.  It is reasonable in this context to suspect the presence of an illicit motivation, the "belief that blacks could not fairly try a black defendant."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#101">476 U. S. 101</a></span> (WHITE, J., concurring).  Where this obvious ground for suspicion is absent, different methods of proof may be appropriate.</p>\n<p>With these observations touching upon the matters raised in Justice MARSHALL\'s dissent, I concur in the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justices BRENNAN and BLACKMUN join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court decides today that a prosecutor\'s racially motivated exclusion of Afro-Americans from the petit jury does not violate the fair-cross-section requirement of the Sixth Amendment.  To reach this startling result, the majority misrepresents the values underlying the fair-cross-section requirement, overstates the difficulties associated with the elimination of racial discrimination in jury selection, and ignores the clear import of well-grounded precedents.  I dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Before proceeding to what the Court does decide, I pause to note what it does not.  For reasons that are not immediately apparent, petitioner expressly disavows the argument that a white defendant has standing to raise an equal protection challenge, based on our decision in <em>Batson v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html">476 U. S. 79</a></span> (1986), to a prosecutor\'s racially motivated peremptory strikes of Afro-American venirepersons.  <em>See</em> Brief for Petitioner 6, 17; Reply Brief for Petitioner 2; Tr. of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 493 U. S. 491</a></p><p> Oral Arg. 21-23.  Our grant of certiorari did not encompass the question whether a white defendant has standing to make a <em>Batson</em> claim, <em>see</em> Pet. for Cert. 1, and the parties did not brief the question; it is therefore not before us today.  Recognizing this, the majority explicitly leaves open the question whether a white defendant is without standing to make such a claim.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#487">493 U. S. 487</a></span>.  Another of the majority\'s statements, however, could be read to prefigure how the Court would resolve that question if faced with it.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#477">493 U. S. 477</a></span> (implying "a requirement of correlation between the group identification of the defendant and the group identification of excluded venire members" for standing to raise the equal protection claim).  It is important, therefore, briefly to examine the <em>Batson</em> question.</p>\n<p>As a majority of this Court has now concluded, a close reading of <em>Batson</em> shows that a defendant\'s race is irrelevant to his standing to raise the equal protection claim recognized in that case.  <em>See infra</em> this page and  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#493">493 U.

Because <em>Batson</em> was Afro-American, it is not surprising that the Court held that he could make out a <em>prima facie</em> case of an equal protection violation by showing, <em>inter alia,</em> that "the prosecutor ha[d] exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\'s race."  476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#96">476 U.

More fundamentally, Batson was permitted to raise not only his rights, but also those of the members of the venire and of the general public.  If Batson could do so, there is no reason a white defendant cannot do so as well.</p>\n<p>In any event, the question whether a defendant\'s race affects his standing to invoke <em>Batson</em> is one on which the Court has not ruled.  For the reader who seeks guidance on how the Court would rule if the issue were presented and argued, the agreement of five Justices that a defendant\'s race is irrelevant to the Fourteenth Amendment standing inquiry is far more illuminating than the majority\'s veiled intimations and cryptic turns of phrase.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The issue that <em>is</em> presented and decided today is whether a prosecutor\'s exercise of peremptory challenges for the sole </p><p><a class="page-number" name="493">Page 493 U. S. 493</a></p><p> purpose of excluding Afro-Americans from a petit jury contravenes the Sixth Amendment.  I think that it does.</p>\n<p>The fundamental premise underlying the majority\'s analysis in this case is the assertion that the sole purpose of the Sixth Amendment\'s jury trial requirement is to secure for the defendant an impartial jury.  The majority defends this thesis by constructing a false dichotomy:  the fair-cross-section requirement <em>either</em> protects impartiality or guarantees a petit jury that mirrors the community from which it is drawn.  From these two options, the majority selects impartiality as its governing principle.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#480">493 U. S. 480</a></span> ("The Sixth Amendment requirement of fair-cross-section on the venire is a means of assuring, not a <em>representative</em> jury (which the Constitution does not demand), but an <em>impartial</em> one (which it does)").  The remainder of its analysis proceeds from and is dependent upon the assumption that impartiality is the sole end of the fair-cross-section requirement.  That assumption is flatly false, and the conclusion to which it leads is one that I cannot imagine that even the majority would accept in all its implications. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to a trial "by an impartial jury."  Obviously, then, impartiality is one concern addressed by the Amendment.  Just as self-evident is the proposition that a criminal defendant is entitled to have his case decided by a "jury."  We have made clear that "jury" is a term of art, and that a body of people assembled to decide a case must meet certain constitutional minimums before it qualifies as a "jury" in the constitutional sense.  <em>See, e.g., Ballew v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/223/case.html">435 U. S. 223</a></span> (1978) (holding, without relying on the impartiality </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 493 U. S. 494</a></p><p> requirement, that a five-person "jury" is insufficient to satisfy Constitution\'s demand of a "jury" trial).  Contrary to the majority\'s implication, the fair-cross-section requirement is not based on the constitutional demand for impartiality; it is founded on the notion that what is denominated a "jury" is not a "jury" in the eyes of the Constitution unless it is drawn from a fair-cross-section of the community.</p>\n<p>Thus, in <em>Taylor v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html">419 U. S. 522</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html#526">419 U. S. 527</a></span> (1975), we stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he Court has unambiguously declared that the American concept of the jury trial contemplates a jury drawn from a fair-cross-section of the community.

S. 536</a></span> (acknowledging the "Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury drawn from a fair-cross-section of the community").</p>\n<p>That the two protections are distinct is shown as well by <em>Duren v. Missouri,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/357/case.html">439 U. S. 357</a></span> (1979), where we reaffirmed <em>Taylor</em> in holding that a state law permitting women, but not men, to opt out of jury service violated the fair-cross-section requirement.  Duren did not contend that any juror was biased against him.  Rather, he claimed that his right to a jury trial was violated by the <em>de facto</em> exclusion of women from his venire.  Only the dissent in <em>Duren</em> suggested that the Sixth Amendment serves nothing but impartiality.  439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/357/case.html#370">439 U.

McCree,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/162/case.html">476 U. S. 162</a></span> (1986), the Court, in an opinion written by Justice REHNQUIST, again confirmed that the fair-cross-section requirement and the impartiality requirement are different constitutional mandates serving different purposes.  The Court therefore analyzed the two requirements separately, never suggesting that its resolution of the impartiality question in any way affected its resolution of the fair-cross-section issue.  <em>Compare id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/162/case.html#174">476 U.

S. 177</a></span>-184 (rejecting "alternative" argument that resulting jury was "slanted" in favor of a guilty verdict in violation of impartiality requirement).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Our precedents thus belie the majority\'s assertion that the fair-cross-section requirement is merely "a means of assuring" impartiality.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#480">493 U. S. 480</a></span>.  Rather, the fair-cross-section requirement serves entirely different purposes.  In <em>Lockhart,</em> the Court identified these purposes as</p>\n<p>"(1) \'guard[ing] against the exercise of arbitrary power\' and ensuring that the \'common-sense judgment of the community\' will act as \'a hedge against the overzealous or mistaken prosecutor,\' (2) preserving \'public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system,\' and (3) implementing our belief that \'sharing in the administration of justice is a phase of civic responsibility.\'"</p>\n<p>476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/162/case.html#174">476 U.

S. 530</a></span>-531).</p>\n<p>Had the majority in this case acknowledged that the fair-cross-section requirement serves these purposes, it would have been hard-pressed to deny that the exclusion of Afro-Americans from petit juries on the basis of their race violates the Sixth Amendment.  Indeed, in <em>Lockhart</em> itself, the Court noted that the exclusion of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 493 U. S. 496</a></p><p> such groups as blacks, women, and Mexican-Americans . . . from jury service clearly contravene[s] all three of the aforementioned purposes of the fair-cross-section requirement.  Because these groups [are] excluded for reasons completely unrelated to the ability of members of the group to serve as jurors in a particular case, the exclusion raise[s] at least the possibility that the composition of juries would be arbitrarily skewed in such a way as to deny criminal defendants the benefit of the common-sense judgment of the community.  In addition, the exclusion from jury service of large groups of individuals not on the basis of their inability to serve as jurors, but on the basis of some immutable characteristic such as race, gender, or ethnic background, undeniably [gives] rise to an "appearance of unfairness."  Finally, such exclusion improperly deprive[s] members of these often historically disadvantaged groups of their right as citizens to serve on juries in criminal cases.</p>\n<p>476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/162/case.html#175">476 U. S. 175</a></span> (citations omitted).  To be sure, the Court was referring to exclusion of prospective jurors from venires, not their exclusion from petit juries by means of peremptory challenges.  But the particular context does not affect the analysis.  A defendant\'s interest in obtaining the "common-sense judgment of the community" is impaired by the exclusion from his jury of a significant segment of the community; whether the exclusion is accomplished in the selection of the venire or by peremptory challenge is immaterial.  <em>Batson v. Kentucky,</em> 476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#86">476 U. S. 86</a></span>.  A prosecutor\'s race-based peremptory challenge of all Afro-American venirepersons, no less than a State\'s exclusion of Afro-Americans from the venire, destroys even the possibility that this distinctive group will be represented on the defendant\'s petit jury.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the second purpose animating the fair-cross-section requirement -- preserving public confidence in the fairness of our criminal justice system -- applies equally to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 493 U. S. 497</a></p><p> selection of the petit jury as to the selection of the venire.  Racially motivated peremptory challenges are as destructive of the public\'s perception that our system of criminal justice is fair as are exclusions of certain racial groups from the venire.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#87">476 U. S. 87</a></span>-88.</p>\n<p>Finally, the goal of ensuring that no distinctive group be excluded from full participation in our criminal justice system is impaired when the prosecutor implies, through the use of racially motivated peremptory challenges, that he does not trust Afro-Americans to be fair enough or intelligent enough to serve on the case he is trying.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#87">476 U. S. 87</a></span>.  That the juror may eventually be seated on a jury in another case is immaterial; no one can be expected to perceive himself to be a full participant in our system of criminal justice, or in our society as a whole, when he is told by a representative of the government that, because of his race, he is too stupid or too biased to serve on a particular jury.  That he might not have to suffer such an indignity in <em>every</em> case is not an answer to the injury inflicted by the one instance of racism he is forced to endure.</p>\n<p>Thus, no rational distinction can be drawn in the context of our fair-cross-section jurisprudence between the claims we accepted in <em>Taylor</em> and <em>Duren</em> and the claim at issue here.  The majority avoids reaching this conclusion only by the expedient of ignoring the clear import of our cases.  It justifies its refusal to confront the logic underlying those cases by suggesting that "<em>all three of those opinions</em> [<em>Taylor, Duren,</em> and <em>Lockhart</em>] specifically disclaimed application of their analysis to the petit jury."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#485">493 U. S. 485</a></span>-486.  The majority\'s semantic games aside, these cases do not suggest that fair-cross-section principles are inapplicable to the petit jury; the cases simply recognize that those principles do not mandate a petit jury that mirrors the population of distinctive groups in the community.   <em>See Taylor, supra,</em> 419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html#538">419 U.

Moreover, I have shown, <em>supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#495">493 U. S. 495</a></span>-498, and the majority does not attempt to deny, that, when analyzed in terms of those principles, petitioner\'s claim is clearly meritorious.  The conclusion the majority reaches thus rests entirely on its refusal to apply those principles to this case.  So far as I can discern, that refusal, in turn, rests entirely on a claim the majority presents almost as an afterthought -- that acceptance of Holland\'s argument would be the first step down a slippery slope leading to a criminal justice system in which trial judges would be required to engineer each jury to reflect, in its few members, all of the myriad demographic groups of which American society is composed.  <em>See, e.g., ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#482">493 U. S. 482</a></span>-483,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#484">493 U. S. 484</a></span>.  Of course, as the majority is forced to admit, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#484">493 U. S. 484</a></span>, petitioner disclaims any argument that such a regime is constitutionally compelled, or even possible.  Thus, the majority is not frightened by petitioner\'s argument, but by the consequences that the majority fancies would flow from our acceptance of that argument.</p>\n<p>The majority\'s apparent concern that applying the fair-cross-section requirement to the petit jury would, as a logical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 493 U. S. 499</a></p><p> matter, require recognition of a right to a jury that mirrors the population of distinctive groups in the community is chimerical.  Although the purposes of the fair-cross-section requirement cannot be served unless prosecutors are precluded from exercising racially motivated peremptory challenges of prospective jurors, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#494">493 U. S. 494</a></span>-498, those purposes do not support an argument for any more than a fair possibility that the petit jury will reflect the population of Afro-Americans (or of any other distinctive group).  They do not support, in other words, the claim that any particular jury must comprise some specific number of members of each distinctive group.  Only if prospective jurors are purposely excluded on account of their membership in a distinctive group -- whether in the selection of the venire or in the prosecutor\'s exercise of peremptory challenges -- is the defendant denied the possibility of a fair-cross-section of the community.</p>\n<p>It is arguably true that the first purpose underlying the fair-cross-section requirement -- the defendant\'s interest in obtaining the common-sense judgment of the community -- would be served by a requirement that all distinctive groups in the community be represented on each petit jury.  <em>But see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#512">493 U. S. 512</a></span>, and n. 10 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (showing that representative jury requirement might well <em>interfere</em> with a jury\'s expression of the common-sense judgment of the community).  <em>Lockhart</em>\'s second and third purposes, however, do not support such a requirement.  The public is unlikely to perceive that our system of criminal justice is unfair simply because a particular jury does not represent every segment of the community, especially where the jury\'s composition is merely the result of a spin of the jury wheel.  Public confidence is undermined by the appearance that the government is trying to stack the deck against criminal defendants and to remove Afro-Americans from jury service solely because of their race.  No similar inference can be drawn from the operations of chance.  Similarly, the fair-cross-section requirement\'s goal of ensuring that each distinctive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 493 U. S. 500</a></p><p> group be a full participant in our system of criminal justice is simply not impaired when a juror is seated, by the luck of the draw, on one panel instead of on another.</p>\n<p>Finally, this Court\'s refusal to read the fair-cross-section requirement as mandating a petit jury representing all of the community\'s distinctive groups is born not of principle, but of necessity, of the recognition that no such requirement could as a practical matter be enforced.  As the Court stated in <em>Lockhart,</em></p>\n<p>"[t]he limited scope of the fair-cross-section requirement is a direct and inevitable consequence of the practical impossibility of providing each criminal defendant with a truly \'representative\' petit jury."</p>\n<p>476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/162/case.html#173">476 U.

S. 483</a></span>-485; and (3) the Sixth Amendment is therefore not implicated by racially motivated peremptory exclusions, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#483">493 U. S. 483</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#483">493 U. S. 487</a></span>.  Each step in the majority\'s logic is plainly fallacious.</p>\n<p>First, as even the majority admits, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#481">493 U. S. 481</a></span>-482, this Court has repeatedly recognized that a State need not permit peremptory challenges.  <em>See, e.g., Stilson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/250/583/case.html">250 U. S. 583</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/250/583/case.html#586">250 U. S. 586</a></span> (1919).  It is difficult to reconcile that holding with the notion that peremptory challenges are somehow essential to an impartial jury, the right to which <em>is</em> constitutionally protected.  That "one could plausibly argue" that the peremptory challenge system is constitutionally compelled, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#481">493 U. S. 481</a></span>, is hardly an answer to the contrary statements in our cases.  Plausible arguments can be made for many erroneous propositions, but that does not make them any less wrong.  Moreover, Justice STEVENS clearly demonstrates that invocations of our "venerable" peremptory challenge system are insufficient to defeat Holland\'s claims.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#517">493 U. S. 517</a></span>-518, and n. 15.</p>\n<p>In support of the second step in its analysis, the majority quotes <em>Swain v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html">380 U. S. 202</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#219">380 U. S. 219</a></span> (1965), for the proposition that even racially motivated peremptory challenges are essential to eliminate "<em>extremes of partiality on both sides.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#484">493 U. S. 484</a></span>.  What the majority neglects to mention is that <em>Batson,</em> in overruling <em>Swain</em> in part, expressly rejected the proposition for which the majority cites <em>Swain:</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>"The State contends that our holding will eviscerate the fair trial values served by the peremptory challenge. . . .  While we recognize, of course, that the peremptory challenge occupies an important position in our </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 493 U. S. 502</a></p><p> trial procedures, we do not agree that our decision today will undermine the contribution the challenge generally makes to the administration of justice.  The reality of practice, amply reflected in many state- and federal-court opinions, shows that the challenge may be, and unfortunately at times has been, used to discriminate against black jurors.  By requiring trial courts to be sensitive to the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, our decision . . . furthers the ends of justice."</p>\n<p>476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#98">476 U. S. 98</a></span>-99 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>A prohibition on the use of peremptory challenges purposely to exclude members of distinctive groups on the basis of their "distinctive" attribute would leave the peremptory challenge system almost entirely untouched.  The majority\'s exaggerated claim that "postmen, or lawyers, or clergymen" are distinctive groups within the meaning of our fair-cross-section cases, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#486">493 U. S. 486</a></span>, will no doubt be quickly interred if ever a litigant reaches the Supreme Court claiming that such groups are "distinctive."  To date, at least, this Court has found only women and certain racial minorities to have the sorts of characteristics that would make a group "distinctive" for fair-cross-section purposes.  <em>See Lockhart,</em> 476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/162/case.html#175">476 U. S. 175</a></span> (citing cases).</p>\n<p>More fundamentally, the majority\'s conclusion proves far more than I think even it intends.  Unless it is limited by some principle that is not apparent on its face, the Court\'s decision today provides that the fair-cross-section requirement is unconcerned even with a prosecutor\'s systematic use of peremptory challenges to exclude Afro-American prospective jurors on the ground that they, as a class, lack the intelligence or impartiality fairly to fill the juror\'s role.  Indeed, there is no principle by which the majority could distinguish such a case from a similar policy of the state attorney general\'s office.  Although I cannot conceive that the majority intends any such holding, the lack of a limiting principle makes me wonder on what basis I should be so sanguine. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 493 U. S. 503</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Perhaps the most obvious answer to the majority\'s concerns about destruction of the peremptory challenge system is that the acceptance of Holland\'s argument in this case will have absolutely no effect on the peremptory challenge system.  We have held that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits prosecutors from exercising peremptory challenges to exclude Afro-American jurors on the basis of their race.  <em>Batson, supra.</em>  Five members of the Court today make clear that the race of the defendant is irrelevant to the operation of that prohibition.  <em>See supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#491">493 U.

Whatever "damage" my interpretation of the Sixth Amendment would do to the peremptory challenge system has already been done under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The practical effect of this case (in the arena with which the majority is concerned) is nil.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The majority today insulates an especially invidious form of racial discrimination in the selection of petit juries from Sixth Amendment scrutiny.  To reach this result, the majority chooses to pretend that it writes on a blank slate, ignoring precedent after precedent.  The majority then conjures up specters -- of the dreaded "representative jury" requirement and of the destruction of our "venerable" system of peremptory challenges -- as though they were real sources of concern.  Our recent refusal in <em>Batson</em> to permit such fantastic fears to override our constitutional duty in the equal protection context makes clear, however, that these apparitions vanish on close examination.</p>\n<p>Even had the majority marshaled the sorts of arguments that normally accompany the rejection of the principles underlying a whole line of cases, I would remain dubious.  The elimination of racial discrimination in our system of criminal justice is not a constitutional goal that should lightly be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 493 U. S. 504</a></p><p> set aside.  Because the majority apparently disagrees, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, as Justice STEVENS has persuasively shown, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#508">493 U. S. 508</a></span>-520 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), even if impartiality were the only goal the fair-cross-section requirement is designed to serve, peremptory exclusion of Afro-American jurors on account of their race makes a truly impartial jury impossible to achieve, and thus violates the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority considers "random[]" my suggestion that its opinion today signals a retreat from our previous efforts to eradicate racial discrimination.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#486">493 U. S. 486</a></span>.  Our cases have repeatedly used the Sixth Amendment\'s fair-cross-section requirement as a weapon to combat racial discrimination.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#493">493 U. S. 493</a></span>-495.  Yet today the majority says that the Sixth Amendment is no more concerned with discrimination against Afro-Americans than it is with discrimination against "postmen."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#486">493 U. S. 486</a></span>.  The majority concludes that "[r]ace as such has nothing to do with the legal issue in this case."  <em>Ibid.</em>  I read these statements as a retreat; that the majority has so little understanding of our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence that it considers that criticism "random[]" is, if anything, proof that it is right on the mark.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>When jury selection began for petitioner Daniel Holland\'s trial, he was presented with 40 jurors eligible for service.  In accordance with Illinois law, the panel was blindly drawn from an active jury list, [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] which in turn was composed at random, [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>] from a broad cross-section of the community. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 493 U. S. 505</a></p><p> At the commencement of <em>voir dire,</em> however, the State abandoned this neutral selection process.  Rather than eliminating jurors on an individualized basis on the grounds of partiality or necessity, the prosecutor allegedly removed all the black jurors in the belief that no black citizen could be a satisfactory juror or could fairly try the case.  As the Court acknowledges, that practice is "obviously" unlawful.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#487">493 U. S. 487</a></span>.  The Court nonetheless does not reach the equal protection issue and, with respect to petitioner\'s Sixth Amendment claim, holds that the fair-cross-section principle of that Amendment does not "require anything beyond the inclusion of all cognizable groups in the venire."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#478">493 U. S. 478</a></span>.  In my opinion, it is appropriate to review petitioner\'s equal protection claim, because a showing that black jurors have been eliminated solely on account of their race not only is sufficient to establish a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 493 U. S. 506</a></p><p> but also is sufficient to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment.  A jury that is the product of such a racially discriminatory selection process cannot possibly be an "impartial jury" within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner presented two arguments to the Illinois Supreme Court in support of his claim that the racially discriminatory exclusion of black jurors from his jury violated the Federal Constitution.  First, he argued that the discriminatory exclusion of all the potential black jurors from his jury violated his personal right under the Sixth Amendment to a jury drawn from a cross-section of the community.  Second, he argued that the State\'s discriminatory use of peremptory challenges also violated the jurors\' equal protection rights which he had third party standing to assert.  The state court addressed and rejected both claims on the merits.</p>\n<p>The Court today decides only petitioner\'s Sixth Amendment claim and refuses to reach the equal protection argument, even though we are unanimous in agreeing that "the systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury system through peremptory challenges" is "obviously" unlawful.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#486">493 U.

It does so because petitioner did not reiterate before this Court his argument that the discriminatory exclusion of black jurors violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The same situation was presented in <em>Batson v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html">476 U. S. 79</a></span> (1986).  There, as here, the petitioner declined to challenge the discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges on equal protection grounds, framing the issue at argument and in his briefs in Sixth Amendment terms.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#112">476 U. S. 112</a></span>-115 (Burger, C.J., dissenting). [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  We nonetheless prescinded the Sixth Amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 493 U.

S. 85</a></span>, n. 4, and rested our decision in the petitioner\'s favor entirely on the Equal Protection Clause.  Our decision in <em>Batson</em> makes it appropriate to begin our analysis by recognizing that petitioner\'s equal protection argument is plainly meritorious and entitles him to relief.</p>\n<p>As Justice KENNEDY and Justice MARSHALL note, the concerns that were expressed in <em>Batson</em> are not properly confined to the context in which a defendant objects to the exclusion of jurors of his own race but support also "an equal protection claim by a defendant whose race or ethnicity is different from the dismissed juror\'s."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#488">493 U. S. 488</a></span> (KENNEDY, J., concurring); <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#491">493 U. S. 491</a></span>-492 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  Our decision in <em>Batson</em> was based on the conclusion that "[r]acial discrimination in the selection of jurors harms not only the accused whose life or liberty they are summoned to try," but also "the excluded juror."  476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#87">476 U. S. 87</a></span>.</p>\n<p>"Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Batson was a black citizen, but he had no interest in serving as a juror, and thus was not a member of the excluded class.  His standing to vindicate the interests of potential black jurors was based on his status as a defendant. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  Indeed, the suggestion that only defendants of the same race or ethnicity as the excluded jurors can enforce the jurors\' right to equal treatment and equal respect recognized in <em>Batson</em> is itself inconsistent with the central message of the Equal Protection Clause. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 493 U. S. 508</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"[T]he Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State\'s case."</p>\n<p><em>Batson,</em> 476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#89">476 U. S. 89</a></span>.  As Justice KENNEDY states, while the inference that the discriminatory motive is at work is stronger when the excluded jurors are of the same race or ethnicity as the defendant, the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges is not limited to that situation, but may be present when, as here, the excluded jurors are not of the same race as the defendant.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#490">493 U. S. 490</a></span> (concurring opinion).  Petitioner, however, was not permitted to present any evidence to support his claim because the state court ruled that he did not have standing to assert the rights of the excluded jurors.  For the reasons stated by Justice KENNEDY, that ruling was plainly wrong.  My opinion, however, that petitioner should have been permitted to prove that the exclusion of black jurors violated the Equal Protection Clause also leads me to the conclusion that petitioner should be entitled to prove that the State has violated the fair-cross-section principle of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Fifteen years ago, in <em>Taylor v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html">419 U.

In <em>Taylor,</em> we held unconstitutional a state provision that required women, but not men, to file a written declaration before they were placed in the jury pool.  Because the provision was directed at excluding a distinctive group from jury service and was not based on any legitimate state purpose, it ran afoul of the "defendant\'s Sixth Amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 493 U. S. 514</a></p><p> right to a jury drawn from a fair-cross-section of the community."  419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html#534">419 U.

S. 357</a></span> (1979), a Missouri provision gave women an automatic exemption from jury service.  Like the Louisiana provision in <em>Taylor,</em> Missouri\'s automatic exemption resulted in underrepresentation of women at the venire stage and was justified only by the stereotype that most women would be unable to serve because of their domestic responsibilities.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/357/case.html#369">439 U.

A reasonably representative jury pool, however, is not the ultimate goal of the Sixth Amendment:  a State surely could not place all of its citizens in the jury pool, but then arbitrarily provide that members of certain cognizable groups would not be permitted to serve on a jury or could only serve if they overcame a special hurdle not applicable to other jurors.  The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused "an impartial jury," not just an impartial jury venire or jury pool.  The State may remove jurors at any stage on the grounds, among others, that service would cause hardship to the individual or community, <em>see Taylor,</em> 419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html#534">419 U.

[<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]  The state courts rejected this claim without a hearing, holding that the exercise of peremptory challenges can never violate the fair-cross-section requirement.

That presumption could not be overcome by the prosecutor\'s use of peremptories to eliminate all the black jurors on the venire, <em>ibid.,</em> but only by a showing that</p>\n<p>"the prosecutor in a county, in case after case, whatever the circumstances, whatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be, is responsible for the removal of Negroes who have been selected as qualified jurors by the jury commissioners and who have survived challenges for cause, with the result that no Negroes ever serve on petit juries."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#223">380 U. S. 223</a></span>. Under previous law, the Illinois Supreme Court and this Court would have been correct in presuming along with the Swain Court that all peremptory challenges are exercised for nondiscriminatory reasons.</p>\n<p><em>Batson,</em> however, created an important, though limited, exception to the <em>Swain</em> presumption.  Under <em>Batson,</em> a defendant is permitted to establish from "the totality of relevant facts," 476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#94">476 U. S. 94</a></span>, that black jurors have been excluded on the basis of race and that the system of peremptory challenges has been operated in a discriminatory fashion.  The peremptory challenge procedure, when it is used to remove members of a particular racial group, is no longer presumed to serve the State\'s interest in obtaining a fair and impartial jury.  If a defendant is able to prove for equal protection purposes that the prosecutor\'s "strikes were based on the belief that no black citizen could be a satisfactory juror or fairly try" the case, <em>Batson,</em> 476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#101">476 U.

S. 87</a></span>, that same showing necessarily establishes that the defendant does not have a fair possibility of obtaining a representative cross-section for Sixth Amendment purposes.  As we have explained, <em>Batson</em> has underpinnings </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 493 U.

Significantly, the new rule joins other procedures that protect a defendant\'s interest in a neutral factfinder.  Those other mechanisms existed prior to our decisions in <em>Batson,</em> creating a high probability that the individual jurors seated in a particular case were free from bias."</p>\n<p><em>Allen v. Hardy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/255/case.html">478 U. S. 255</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/255/case.html#259">478 U.

The operation of a facially neutral peremptory challenge procedure in a discriminatory manner is no less a violation of the defendant\'s Sixth Amendment right to a jury chosen from a fair-cross-section of the community than it is a violation of the juror\'s right to equal protection. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court rejects petitioner\'s Sixth Amendment claim on the basis of three assumptions, two explicit and one implicit.  First, it asserts that the tradition of peremptory challenges for the prosecution was "venerable" at the time of the ratification of the Sixth Amendment and thereby presumably immune </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 493 U. S. 518</a></p><p> from challenge.  This assertion is both misleading [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>] and an insufficient response to petitioner\'s claim that the State operated a system of discriminatory peremptory challenges.  The Court has forsworn reliance on venerable history to give meaning to the Sixth Amendment\'s numerosity and unanimity requirements, <em>see Apodaca v. Oregon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/404/case.html">406 U. S. 404</a></span> (1972); <em>Williams v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/78/case.html">399 U. S. 78</a></span> (1970); the less venerable history of nondiscriminatory peremptory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 493 U. S. 519</a></p><p> challenges surely cannot resolve any conflict between the fair-cross-section requirement and the exercise of discriminatory peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p>Second, the Court contends that the exercise of peremptory challenges always serves the State\'s "legitimate interest" in obtaining an impartial jury.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#483">493 U. S. 483</a></span>.  That contention rests on the assumption that a black juror may be presumed to be partial simply because he is black -- an assumption that is impermissible since <em>Batson.</em>  Petitioner\'s claim is that the State may not operate a jury selection mechanism, including a system of peremptory challenges, that eliminates black jurors solely on account of race. [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]  It hardly answers petitioner\'s claim to state that the system of peremptory challenges "traditional[ly]" operates "by allowing both the accused and the State to eliminate persons thought to be inclined against their interests."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#480">493 U. S. 480</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court contends that recognition of the Sixth Amendment right "would cripple the device of peremptory challenge."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#484">493 U. S. 484</a></span>.  The same argument was made in <em>Batson</em> in the same context:  a defendant\'s claim that peremptory challenges were used to discriminate against black jurors.  After our recognition that a defendant could bring an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 493 U. S. 520</a></p><p> equal protection challenge to the removal of black jurors in a single case, it is difficult to see why recognition of a Sixth Amendment right would impose any additional burden.  In any event, our answer to the State in <em>Batson</em> is a sufficient response to the Court here:</p>\n<p>"While we recognize, of course, that the peremptory challenge occupies an important position in our trial procedures, we do not agree that our decision today will undermine the contribution the challenge generally makes to the administration of justice.  The reality of practice, amply reflected in many state- and federal-court opinions, shows that the challenge may be, and unfortunately at times has been, used to discriminate against black jurors.  By requiring trial courts to be sensitive to the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, our decision enforces the mandate of equal protection and furthers the ends of justice.  In view of the heterogeneous population of our Nation, public respect for our criminal justice system and the rule of law will be strengthened if we ensure that no citizen is disqualified from jury service because of his race."</p>\n<p>"Nor are we persuaded by the State\'s suggestion that our holding will create serious administrative difficulties.  In those States applying a version of the evidentiary standard we recognize today, courts have not experienced serious administrative burdens, and the peremptory challenge system has survived.  We decline, however, to formulate particular procedures to be followed upon a defendant\'s timely objection to a prosecutor\'s challenges."</p>\n<p><em>Batson v.

Our law recognizes as much in several other respects.  Even though each individual juror might be impartial, the Sixth Amendment still requires that the jury have at least six members, <em>Ballew v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/223/case.html">435 U. S. 223</a></span> (1978), that the verdict be agreed upon by at least five jurors, <em>Burch v.

Although that requirement is not expressed in the text of the Sixth Amendment, it is inherent in its purpose that the defendant be judged by a body fairly selected and fully independent of the State.  Indeed, in his first Inaugural Address, President Thomas Jefferson identified among the "principles [that] form the bright constellation which has gone before us, and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation," that of "trial by juries <em>impartially selected.</em>"  3 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 322 (Memorial ed. 1903) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/8" name="F3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Our decision in <em>McCleskey v.

The computer attempting to structure each jury would have to consider the race, sex, age, income, occupation, educational level, and religion of each juror -- and perhaps other factors as well -- in order to be sure that all relevant demographic characteristics would be considered.  Furthermore, a juror selected under this system might feel that she or he is filling some predetermined \'slot\' and might attempt to give the view generally associated with those demographic characteristics rather than the juror\'s personal feelings about the case.  The jurors might find it harder to work together as a group because they may be more conscious of their identified differences than the much stronger common bonds that unite them as people."</p>\n<p>"The logical, and desirable, way to impanel an impartial and representative jury -- and the method chosen by Congress -- is to put together a complete list of eligible jurors and select randomly from it, on the assumption that the laws of statistics will produce representative juries most of the time.  This approach safeguards the selection process from possible manipulation and ensures the independence of the jury.  Such a randomly selected jury will not necessarily be \'impartial\' in the strict sense of that term, because the jurors bring to the jury box prejudice and perspectives gained from their lifetimes of experience.  But they will be impartial in the sense that they will reflect the range of the community\'s attitudes, which is the best we can do.  The random approach recognizes that our \'community\' has enlarged because of the technological revolution that has provided us with communication links and common sources of information, but it also ensures that the diversity within our society is reflected on our juries because each population group is represented insofar as possible in proportion to its strength in the population."</p>\n<p>J.

To the extent that his Sixth Amendment claim is based on the contention that the State prevented a "distinctive group in the community from being represented on his jury," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#477">493 U. S. 477</a></span>-478, I agree with the Court that a defendant is not entitled to jurors of any particular race on his jury.  The Sixth Amendment no more permits the prosecutor to remove a white juror on the categorical assumption that he will not represent the views of prospective black jurors than it permits the prosecutor to remove a black juror on the assumption that he is incompetent to serve.  In both instances, the prosecutor would be determining qualification to serve on the basis of race, a determination that the prosecutor is not permitted to make.  <em>Cf. Cassell v.

Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/419/522/case.html">419 U. S. 522</a></span> (1975).  This has been interpreted to guarantee that the jury venire be selected in a nondiscriminatory manner from a source fairly representative of the community, even though <em>Taylor</em> does not go so far as to guarantee a representative petit jury.  But as already mentioned, <em>Batson</em> has added an additional dimension to this analysis:  although a petit jury selected from a proper panel need not necessarily reflect a cross-section of the community, discriminatory tactics designed to manipulate the ultimate composition of the petit jury will no longer be tolerated."</p>\n<p>121 Ill.2d 136, 184-185, 117 Ill.Dec. 109, 131, 520 N.E.2d 270, 292 (1987).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/15" name="F3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]</p>\n<p>Even as to the use of peremptory challenges to remove partial jurors, the Court\'s historical claims are significantly overstated.  If the Court wishes to have it that the exercise of peremptory challenges by the prosecution has a venerable tradition, it will have to do better than Blackstone and the 1790 Congress.  What Blackstone actually said with respect to peremptory challenges was that peremptory challenges were allowed the prisoner "in criminal cases, or at least in capital ones, . . . <em>in favorem vitae,</em>" but that</p>\n<p>"[t]his privilege, of peremptory challenges, though granted to the prisoner, is denied to the king, by the statute of 33 Edw. 1. st. 4, which enacts, that the king shall challenge no jurors without assigning a cause certain, to be tried and approved by the court."</p>\n<p>4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 346-347 (1769).  The statute passed by the 1790 Congress, Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, \xc2\xa7 30, 1 Stat. 112, 119, similarly recognized the defendant\'s right of peremptory challenges, but was silent with respect to the Government\'s.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/59/588/case.html">United States v. Shackleford,</a></span></em> 18 How. 588 (1856).  Although <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/480/case.html">United States v. Marchant,</a></span></em> 12 Wheat. 480 (1827), suggests that the government\'s common law right to "stand aside" survived the 1790 Act, the Court has rejected the proposition that the 1790 Act reflects or "draws" with it the prosecutor\'s right of peremptory challenge.  <em>See</em> 18 How. at 590.  Contrary to the Court\'s contention, the prosecutor has not had the right of peremptory challenge "through two centuries in all the States."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#481">493 U. S. 481</a></span>.  The exercise of peremptory challenges by the prosecution was a subject of debate throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the two most populous States in the Nation\'s first century, New York and Virginia, did not permit the prosecutor peremptories until 1881 and 1919, respectively.  <em>See</em> Van Dyke, <em>supra,</em> n. 10, at 147-150, 167; <em>see also</em> Goldwasser, Limiting a Criminal Defendant\'s Use of Peremptory Challenges: On Symmetry and the Jury in a Criminal Trial, 102 Harv.L. Rev. 808, 827-828 (1989).  It is also worthy of note that a clause providing the "right of challenge" was contained within the original draft of the Sixth Amendment, but was eliminated by the Senate prior to ratification.  <em>See</em> I Annals of Cong. 435 (1789).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/16" name="F3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court misconstrues petitioner\'s claim as one that the Sixth Amendment requires representation of all identifiable groups on the petit jury.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/case.html#484">493 U. S. 484</a></span>.  Petitioner, however, makes no such claim.  The Sixth Amendment does not forbid the State from removing jurors on the basis of partiality or other <em>relevant</em> individual characteristics.  Even if the prosecutor\'s peremptory challenges based on such considerations, when aggregated, could be considered to result in the exclusion of a "cognizable group," that group by definition would be one that is ineligible for jury service for legitimate state reasons.  The defendant\'s right to "a <em>fair</em> possibility" for obtaining a representative cross-section would not be impaired.  Petitioner does argue, however, that the State may not remove jurors for unconstitutional reasons or reasons relevant only to eliminating a group from the community eligible for jury service.  That is, the State may not remove jurors solely on account of race.  In that case, the defendant is being "unfairly" deprived of the opportunity for obtaining a cross-section.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
