Counsel for respondent Oneida Indian Nation advised the Court through a letter on November 30, 2010, that the Nation had, on November 29, 2010, passed a tribal declaration and ordinance waiving \xe2\x80\x9cits sovereign immunity to enforcement of real property taxation through foreclosure by state, county and local governments within and throughout the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oneida Indian Nation, Ordinance No. O&amp;nbhyph;10\xe2\x80\x931 (2010).
