Under that system, a city would create an initial assessment, dividing the total estimated cost by the number of lots and making any necessary adjustments.  Upon a project\xe2\x80\x99s completion, the city would issue a final lot-by-lot assessment.  Lot owners could elect to pay the assessment in a lump sum or over time in installments.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter the City completed the Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers Project, it sent affected homeowners formal notice of their payment obligations.  Of the 180 affected homeowners, 38 elected to pay the lump sum.  The following year, the City abandoned Barrett Law financing and adopted the Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP), which financed projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering individual owner\xe2\x80\x99s sewer-connection costs.  In implementing STEP, the City\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Public Works enacted a resolution forgiving all assessment amounts still owed pursuant to Barrett Law financing.  Homeowners who had paid the Brisbane/Manning Project lump sum received no refund, while homeowners who had elected to pay in installments were under no obligation to make further payments.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe 38 homeowners who paid the lump sum asked the City for a refund, but the City denied the request.  Thirty-one of these homeowners brought suit in Indiana state court claiming, in relevant part, that the City\xe2\x80\x99s refusal violated the Federal Equal Protection Clause.  The trial court granted summary judgment to the homeowners, and the State Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Indiana Supreme Court reversed, holding that the City\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between those who had already paid and those who had not was rationally related to its legitimate interests in reducing administrative costs, providing financial hardship relief to homeowners, transitioning from the Barrett Law system to STEP, and preserving its limited resources.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The City had a rational basis for its distinction and thus did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0The City\xe2\x80\x99s classification does not involve a fundamental right or suspect classification.  See Heller v. Doe, \n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 312\n\xe2\x80\x93320.  Its subject matter is local, economic, social, and commercial.  See United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n\n304 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144\n.  It is a tax classification.  See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., \n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 540\n.  And no one claims that the City has discriminated against out-of-state commerce or new residents.  Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, \n\n472 U.\xc2\xa0S. 612\n.  Hence, the City\xe2\x80\x99s distinction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause as long as \xe2\x80\x9cthere is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification,\xe2\x80\x9d FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., \n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 307\n, and the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98burden is on the one attacking the [classification] to negative every conceivable basis which might support it,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Heller, supra, at 320.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Administrative concerns can ordinarily justify a tax-related distinction, see, e.g., Carmichael v. Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co., \n\n301 U.\xc2\xa0S. 495\n\xe2\x80\x93512, and the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision to stop collecting outstanding Barrett Law debts finds rational support in the City\xe2\x80\x99s administrative concerns.  After the City switched to the STEP system, any decision to continue Barrett Law debt collection could have proved complex and expensive.  It would have meant maintaining an administrative system for years to come to collect debts arising out of 20-plus different construction projects built over the course of a decade, involving monthly payments as low as $25 per household, with the possible need to maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debtors and bringing legal action.  The rationality of the City\xe2\x80\x99s distinction draws further support from the nature of the line-drawing choices that confronted it.  To have added refunds to forgiveness would have meant adding further administrative costs, namely the cost of processing refunds.  And limiting refunds only to Brisbane/Manning homeowners would have led to complaints of unfairness, while expanding refunds to the apparently thousands of other Barrett Law project homeowners would have involved an even greater administrative burden.  Finally, the rationality of the distinction draws support from the fact that the line that the City drew\xe2\x80\x94distinguishing past payments from future obligations\xe2\x80\x94is well known to the law.  See, e.g., \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7108(a)(1)(E).  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contrary arguments are unpersuasive.  Whether financial hardship is a factor supporting rationality need not be considered here, since the City\xe2\x80\x99s administrative concerns are sufficient to show a rational basis for its distinction.  Petitioners propose other forgiveness systems that they argue are superior to the City\xe2\x80\x99s system, but the Constitution only requires that the line actually drawn by the City be rational.  Petitioners further argue that administrative considerations alone should not justify a tax distinction lest a city justify an unfair system through insubstantial administrative considerations.  Here it was rational for the City to draw a line that avoided the administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small sums for years to come.  Petitioners have not shown that the administrative concerns are too insubstantial to justify the classification.  Finally, petitioners argue that precedent makes it more difficult for the City to show a rational basis, but the cases to which they refer involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence.  The one exception, Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336\n, is distinguishable.

The Law also permitted those lot owners to pay either immediately in the form of a lump sum or over time in installments. In 2005, the city of Indianapolis (City) adopted a new as- sessment and payment method, the \xe2\x80\x9cSTEP\xe2\x80\x9d plan, and it forgave any Barrett Law installments that lot owners had not yet paid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA group of lot owners who had already paid their entire Barrett Law assessment in a lump sum believe that the City should have provided them with equivalent refunds.

When a city built a Barrett Law project, the city\xe2\x80\x99s public works board would create an initial lot-owner assessment by \xe2\x80\x9cdividing the estimated total cost of the sewage works by the total number of lots.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa736\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x9339\xe2\x80\x9316(a).

But in 2005, the City adopted a new system, called the Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP), which fi- nanced projects in part through bonds, thereby lowering in- dividual lot owners\xe2\x80\x99 sewer-connection costs.  By that time, the City had constructed more than 40 Barrett Law projects.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a.

The Brisbane/Manning Project began in 2001.  It connected about 180 homes to the City\xe2\x80\x99s sewage system.  Construction was completed in 2003.  The Indianapolis Board of Public Works held an assessment hearing in June 2004.  And in July 2004 the Board sent the 180 affected homeowners a formal notice of their payment obligations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe notice made clear that each homeowner could pay the entire assessment\xe2\x80\x94$9,278 per property\xe2\x80\x94in a lump sum or in installments, which would include interest at a 3.5% annual rate.  Under an installment plan, payments would amount to $77.27 per month for 10 years; $38.66 per month for 20 years; or $25.77 per month for 30 years.  In the event, 38 homeowners chose to pay up front; 47 chose the 10-year plan; 27 chose the 20-year plan; and 68 chose the 30-year plan.  And in the first year each homeowner paid the amount due ($9,278 upfront; $927.80 under the 10-year plan; $463.90 under the 20-year plan, or $309.27 under the 30-year plan).

It thought that the Barrett Law\xe2\x80\x99s lot-by-lot payments had become too burdensome for many homeowners to pay, discouraging changes from less healthy septic tanks to healthier sewer systems.  See id., at 4a\xe2\x80\x935a.  (For example, homes helped by the Brisbane/Manning Project, at a cost of more than $9,000 each, were then valued at $120,000 to $270,000.  App. 67.)  The City\xe2\x80\x99s new STEP method of financing would charge each connecting lot owner a flat $2,500 fee and make up the difference by floating bonds eventually paid for by all lot owners citywide.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, n.\xc2\xa05.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn October 31, 2005, the City enacted an ordinance implementing its decision.  In December, the City\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Public Works enacted a further resolution, Resolution 101, which, as part of the transition, would \xe2\x80\x9cforgive all assessment amounts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. established pursuant to the Barrett Law Funding for Municipal Sewer programs due and owing from the date of November 1, 2005 forward.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 72 (emphasis added).  In its preamble, the Resolution said that the Barrett Law \xe2\x80\x9cmay present financial hardships on many middle to lower income participants who most need sanitary sewer service in lieu of failing septic systems\xe2\x80\x9d; it pointed out that the City was transitioning to the new STEP method of financing; and it said that the STEP method was based upon a financial model that had \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered the current assessments being made by participants in active Barrett Law projects\xe2\x80\x9d as well as future projects.  Id., at 71\xe2\x80\x9372.  The upshot was that those who still owed Barrett Law assessments would not have to make further payments but those who had already paid their assessments would not receive refunds.  This meant that homeowners who had paid the full $9,278 Brisbane/ Manning Project assessment in a lump sum the preced- ing year would receive no refund, while homeowners who had elected to pay the assessment in installments, and had paid a total of $309.27, $463.90, or $927.80, would be under no obligation to make further payments.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn February 2006, the 38 homeowners who had paid the full Brisbane/Manning Project assessment asked the City for a partial refund (in an amount equal to the smallest forgiven Brisbane/Manning installment debt, apparently $8,062).  The City denied the request in part because \xe2\x80\x9c[r]efunding payments made in your project area, or any portion of the payments, would establish a precedent of unfair and inequitable treatment to all other property owners who have also paid Barrett Law assessments .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and while [the November 1, 2005, cutoff date] might seem arbitrary to you, it is essential for the City to establish this date and move forward with the new funding approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 50\xe2\x80\x9351.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThirty-one of the thirty-eight Brisbane/Manning Project lump-sum homeowners brought this lawsuit in Indiana state court seeking a refund of about $8,000 each.  They claimed in relevant part that the City\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to provide them with refunds at the same time that the City forgave the outstanding Project debts of other Brisbane/Manning homeowners violated the Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Equal Pro- tection Clause, Amdt. 14, \xc2\xa71; see also Rev.

In its view, the City\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between those who had already paid their Barrett Law assessments and those who had not was \xe2\x80\x9crationally related to its legitimate interests in reducing its administrative costs, providing relief for property owners experiencing financial hardship, establishing a clear transition from [the] Barrett Law to STEP, and preserving its limited resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a.

Its subject matter is local, economic, social, and commercial.  It is a tax classification.

Hence, this case falls directly within the scope of our precedents holding such a law constitutionally valid if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a plausible policy reason for the classification, the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker, and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nordlinger, supra, at 11 (citations omitted).  And it falls within the scope of our precedents holding that there is such a plausible reason if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\xe2\x80\x9d  FCC v.

Further, because the classification is presumed constitutional, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Heller, supra, at 320 (quoting Lehnhausen, supra, at 364).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn our view, Indianapolis\xe2\x80\x99 classification has a rational basis.  Ordinarily, administrative considerations can jus- tify a tax-related distinction.  See, e.g., Carmichael v. Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co., \n\n301 U.\xc2\xa0S. 495\n\xe2\x80\x93512 (1937) (tax exemption for businesses with fewer than eight employees rational in light of the \xe2\x80\x9c[a]dministrative convenience and expense\xe2\x80\x9d involved); see also Lehnhausen, supra, at 365 (comparing administrative cost of taxing corporations versus individuals); Madden, supra, at 90 (comparing administrative cost of taxing deposits in local banks versus those elsewhere).  And the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision to stop collecting outstanding Barrett Law debts finds rational support in related administrative concerns.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe City had decided to switch to the STEP system.  After that change, to continue Barrett Law unpaid-debt collection could have proved complex and expensive.  It would have meant maintaining an administrative system that for years to come would have had to collect debts arising out of 20-plus different construction projects built over the course of a decade, involving monthly payments as low as $25 per household, with the possible need to maintain credibility by tracking down defaulting debtors and bringing legal action.  The City, for example, would have had to maintain its Barrett Law operation within the City Controller\xe2\x80\x99s Office, keep files on old, small, installment-plan debts, and (a City official says) possibly spend hundreds of thousands of dollars keeping computerized debt-tracking systems current.  See Brief for International City/County Management Association et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 13, n.\xc2\xa012 (citing Affidavit of Charles White \xc2\xb613, Record in Cox, Doc. No. 57\xe2\x80\x933).  Unlike the collection system prior to abandonment, the City would not have added any new Barrett Law installment-plan debtors.  And that fact means that it would have had to spread the fixed administrative costs of collection over an ever-declining number of debtors, thereby continuously increasing the per-debtor cost of collection.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsistent with these facts, the Director of the City\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Public Works later explained that the City decided to forgive outstanding debt in part because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he administrative costs to service and process remaining balances on Barrett Law accounts long past the transition to the STEP program would not benefit the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d and would defeat the purpose of the transition.  App. 76.  The four other members of the City\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Public Works have said the same.  See Affidavit of Gregory Taylor \xc2\xb66, Record in Cox, Doc.

To have added refunds to forgiveness would have meant adding yet further administrative costs, namely the cost of processing refunds.  At the same time, to have tried to limit the City\xe2\x80\x99s costs and lost revenues by limiting forgiveness (or refund) rules to Brisbane/Manning homeowners alone would have led those involved in other Barrett Law projects to have justifiably complained about unfairness.  Yet to have granted refunds (as well as pro- viding forgiveness) to all those involved in all Barrett Law projects (there were more than 40 projects) or in all open projects (there were more than 20) would have involved even greater administrative burden.  The City could not just \xe2\x80\x9ccut .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. checks,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 4 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting), without taking funding from other programs or finding additional revenue.  If, instead, the City had tried to keep the amount of revenue it lost constant (a rational goal) but spread it evenly among the apparently thousands of homeowners involved in any of the Barrett Laws projects, the result would have been yet smaller individual payments, even more likely to have been too small to justify the administrative expense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the rationality of the distinction draws support from the fact that the line that the City drew\xe2\x80\x94distinguishing past payments from future obligations\xe2\x80\x94is a line well known to the law.  Sometimes such a line takes the form of an amnesty program, involving, say, mortgage payments, taxes, or parking tickets.  E.g., \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7108(a)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (federal income tax provision allowing homeowners to omit from gross income newly forgiven home mortgage debt); United States v. Martin, 523 F.\xc2\xa03d 281, 284 (CA4 2008) (tax amnesty program whereby State newly forgave penalties and liabilities if taxpayer satisfied debt); Horn v. Chicago, 860 F.\xc2\xa02d 700, 704, n.\xc2\xa09 (CA7 1988) (city parking ticket amnesty program whereby outstanding tickets could be newly set- tled for a fraction of amount specified).  This kind of line is consistent with the distinction that the law often makes between actions previously taken and those yet to come.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contrary arguments are not sufficient to change our conclusion. Petitioners point out that the Indiana Supreme Court also listed a different consideration, namely \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial hardship,\xe2\x80\x9d as one of the factors supporting rationality.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a.  They refer to the City\xe2\x80\x99s resolution that said that the Barrett Law \xe2\x80\x9cmay present financial hardships on many middle to lower income participants who most need sanitary sewer service in lieu of failing septic systems.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 71.  And they argue that the tax distinction before us would not necessarily favor low-income homeowners.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe need not consider this argument, however, for the administrative considerations we have mentioned are sufficient to show a rational basis for the City\xe2\x80\x99s distinction.  The Indiana Supreme Court wrote that the City\xe2\x80\x99s classification was \xe2\x80\x9crationally related\xe2\x80\x9d in part \xe2\x80\x9cto its legitimate interests in reducing its administrative costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a (emphasis added).  The record of the City\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings is consistent with that determination.  See App. 72 (when developing transition, the City \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered the current assessments being made by participants in active Barrett Law projects\xe2\x80\x9d).  In any event, a legislature need not \xe2\x80\x9cactually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nordlinger, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 15; see also Fitzgerald, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 108 (similar).  Rather, the \xe2\x80\x9cburden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Madden, 309 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 88; see Heller, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 320 (same); Lehnhausen, 410 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 364 (same); see also Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v.

Petitioners have not \xe2\x80\x9cnegative[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the Indiana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s first listed justification, namely the administrative concerns we have discussed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners go on to propose various other forgiveness systems that would have included refunds for at least some of those who had already paid in full.  They argue that those systems are superior to the system that the City chose.  We have discussed those, and other possible, systems earlier.  Supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Each has advantages and disadvantages.  But even if petitioners have found a superior system, the Constitution does not require the City to draw the perfect line nor even to draw a line superior to some other line it might have drawn.  It requires only that the line actually drawn be a rational line.  And for the reasons we have set forth in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, supra, we believe that the line the City drew here is rational.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners further argue that administrative considerations alone should not justify a tax distinction, lest a city arbitrarily allocate taxes among a few citizens while forgiving many similarly situated citizens on the ground that it is cheaper and easier to collect taxes from a few people than from many.  Brief for Petitioners 45.  Petitioners are right that administrative considerations could not justify such an unfair system.  But that is not because administrative considerations can never justify tax differences (any more than they can always do so).  The question is whether reducing those expenses, in the particular circumstances, provides a rational basis justifying the tax difference in question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, \xe2\x80\x9cin the light of the facts made known or generally assumed,\xe2\x80\x9d Carolene Products Co., 304 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 152, it is reasonable to believe that to graft a refund system onto the City\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness decision could have (for example) imposed an administrative burden of both collecting and paying out small sums (say, $25 per month) for years.  As we have said, supra, at 7\xe2\x80\x939, it is rational for the City to draw a line that avoids that burden.  Petitioners, who are the ones \xe2\x80\x9cattacking the legislative arrangement,\xe2\x80\x9d have the burden of showing that the circumstances are otherwise, i.e., that the administrative burden is too insubstantial to justify the classification.  That they have not done.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, petitioners point to precedent that in their view makes it more difficult than we have said for the City to show a \xe2\x80\x9crational basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  With but one exception, however, the cases to which they refer involve discrimination based on residence or length of residence.  E.g., Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, \n\n472 U.\xc2\xa0S. 612\n (state tax preference distinguishing between long-term and short-term resident veterans); Williams v. Vermont, \n\n472 U.\xc2\xa0S. 14\n (state use tax that burdened out-of-state car buyers who moved in-state); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, \n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 869\n (state law that taxed out-of-state insurance companies at a higher rate than in-state companies); Zobel v. Williams, \n\n457 U.\xc2\xa0S. 55\n (state dividend distribution system that favored long-term residents).  But those circumstances are not present here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe exception consists of Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336 (1989)\n.  The Court there took into account a state constitution and related laws that required equal valuation of equally valuable property.  Id., at 345.  It considered the constitutionality of a county tax assessor\xe2\x80\x99s practice (over a period of many years) of determining property values as of the time of the property\xe2\x80\x99s last sale; that practice meant highly unequal valuations for two identical properties that were sold years or decades apart.  Id., at 341.  The Court first found that the assessor\xe2\x80\x99s practice was not rationally re- lated to the county\xe2\x80\x99s avowed purpose of assessing properties equally at true current value because of the intentional systemic discrepancies the practice created.  Id., at 343\xe2\x80\x93344.  The Court then noted that, in light of the state constitution and related laws requiring equal valuation, there could be no other rational basis for the practice.  Id., at 344\xe2\x80\x93345.  Therefore, the Court held, the assessor\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory policy violated the Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s insistence upon \xe2\x80\x9cequal protection of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 346.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners argue that the City\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to add refunds to its forgiveness decision is similar, for it constitutes a refusal to apply \xe2\x80\x9cequally\xe2\x80\x9d an Indiana state law that says that the costs of a Barrett Law project shall be equally \xe2\x80\x9capportioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ind. Code \xc2\xa736\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x9339\xe2\x80\x9315(b)(3).  In other words, petitioners say that even if the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision might otherwise be related to a rational purpose, state law (as in Allegheny) makes this the rare case where the facts preclude any rational basis for the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision other than to comply with the state mandate of equality.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAllegheny, however, involved a clear state law requirement clearly and dramatically violated.  Indeed, we have described Allegheny as \xe2\x80\x9cthe rare case where the facts precluded\xe2\x80\x9d any alternative reading of state law and thus any alternative rational basis.  Nordlinger, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 16.  Here, the City followed state law by apportioning the cost of its Barrett Law projects equally.  State law says nothing about forgiveness, how to design a forgiveness program, or whether or when rational distinctions in doing so are permitted.  To adopt petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view would risk transforming ordinary violations of ordinary state tax law into violations of the Federal Constitution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, we conclude that the City has not violated the Federal Equal Protection Clause.

Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336 (1989)\n.  In Allegheny Pittsburgh, we held that a county failed to comport with equal protection requirements when it assessed property taxes primarily on the basis of purchase price, with no appropriate adjustments over time.  The result was that new property owners were assessed at \xe2\x80\x9croughly 8 to 35 times\xe2\x80\x9d the rate of those who had owned their property longer.  Id., at 344.

Code \xc2\xa736\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x9339\xe2\x80\x9315(b)(3) (2011).  In the case of Brisbane/Manning, the cost came to $9,278 for each property owner.  Some of the property owners\xe2\x80\x94petitioners here\xe2\x80\x94paid the full $9,278 up front.  Others elected the option of paying in installments.  Shortly after hook-up, the City switched to a new financing system and decided to forgive the hook-up debts of those paying on an installment plan.  The City refused, however, to refund any portion of the payments made by their identically sit- uated neighbors who had already paid the full amount due.  The result was that while petitioners each paid the City $9,278 for their hook-ups, more than half their neighbors paid less than $500 for the same improvement\xe2\x80\x94some as little as $309.27.  Another quarter paid less than $1,000.  Petitioners thus paid between 10 and 30 times as much for their sewer hook-ups as their neighbors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn seeking to justify this gross disparity, the City explained that it was presented with three choices: First, it could have continued to collect the installment plan payments of those who had not yet settled their debts under the old system.  Second, it could have forgiven all those debts and given equivalent refunds to those who had made lump sum payments up front.  Or third, it could have forgiven the future payments and not refunded payments that had already been made.  The first two choices had the benefit of complying with state law, treating all of Indianapolis\xe2\x80\x99s citizens equally, and comporting with the Constitution.  The City chose the third option.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd what did the City believe was sufficient to justify a system that would effectively charge petitioners 30 times more than their neighbors for the same service\xe2\x80\x94when state law promised equal treatment?  Two things: the desire to avoid administrative hassle and the \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal[\xc2\xa0] chal- leng[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of giving back money it wanted to keep.  Brief for Respondents 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  I cannot agree that those reasons pass constitutional muster, even under rational basis review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe City argues that either of the other options for transitioning away from the Barrett Law would have been \xe2\x80\x9cimmensely difficult from an administrative standpoint.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 36.  The Court accepts this rationale, observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]rdinarily, administrative considerations can justify a tax-related distinction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7.  The cases the Court cites, however, stand only for the proposition that a legislature crafting a tax scheme may take administrative concerns into consideration when creating classes of tax- able entities that may be taxed differently.  See, e.g., Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., \n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356, \n359 (1973)\n (a State may \xe2\x80\x9cdraw lines that treat one class of individuals or entities differently from the others\xe2\x80\x9d); Madden v. Kentucky, \n\n309 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83, \n87 (1940)\n (referring to the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad discretion as to classification possessed by a legislature\xe2\x80\x9d); Carmichael v. Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co., \n\n301 U.\xc2\xa0S. 495\n\xe2\x80\x93511 (1937) (discussing permissible considerations for the legislature in establishing a tax scheme).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, however, Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s tax scheme explicitly provides that costs will \xe2\x80\x9cbe primarily apportioned equally among all abutting lands or lots.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ind. Code \xc2\xa736\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x9339\xe2\x80\x9315(b)(3) (emphasis added).  The legislature has therefore decreed that all abutting landowners are within the same class.  We have never before held that administrative burdens justify grossly disparate tax treatment of those the State has provided should be treated alike.  Indeed, in Allegheny Pittsburgh the County argued that its unequal assessments were based on \xe2\x80\x9c[a]dministrative cost[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d concerns, to no avail.  Brief for Respondent, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1988, No. 87\xe2\x80\x931303, p.\xc2\xa022.  The reason we have rejected this argument is obvious: The Equal Protection Clause does not provide that no State shall \xe2\x80\x9cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, unless it\xe2\x80\x99s too much of a bother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if the Court were inclined to decide that administrative burdens alone may sometimes justify grossly disparate treatment of members of the same class, this would hardly be the case to do that.  The City claims it cannot issue refunds because the process would be too difficult, requiring that it pore over records of old projects to determine which homeowners had overpaid and by how much.  Brief for Respondents 36.  But holding that the City must refund petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 overpayments would not mean that it has to refund overpayments in every Barrett Law project.  The Equal Protection Clause is concerned with \xe2\x80\x9cgross\xe2\x80\x9d dis- parity in taxing.  Because the Brisbane/Manning project was initiated shortly before the Barrett Law transition, the disparity between what petitioners paid in compar- ison to their installment plan neighbors was dramatic.  Not so with respect to, for example, a project initiated 10 years earlier, because for those projects even installment plan payers will have largely satisfied their debts, resulting in far less significant disparities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo the extent a ruling for petitioners would require issuing refunds to others who overpaid under the Barrett Law, I think the city workers are up to the task.  The City has in fact already produced records showing exactly how much each lump-sum payer overpaid in every active Barrett Law Project\xe2\x80\x94to the penny.  Record in Cox v. Indianapolis, No. 1:09\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x930435 (SD Ind.), Doc. 98\xe2\x80\x931 (Exh. A).  What the city employees would need to do, therefore, is cut the checks and mail them out.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCertainly the job need not involve the complicated procedure the Court describes in an attempt to bolster its administrative convenience argument.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view the City would apparently continue to accept monthly payments from installment plan homeowners in order to gradually repay the money it owes to those who paid in a lump sum.  Ante, at 9, 12.  But this approach was never dreamt of by the City itself.  See Brief for Respondents 18 (setting out City\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthree basic [transition] options,\xe2\x80\x9d none of which involved the Court\xe2\x80\x99s gradual refund scheme).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court suggests that the City\xe2\x80\x99s administrative convenience argument is one with which the law is comfort- able.  The Court compares the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision to forgive the installment balances to the sort of parking ticket and mortgage payment amnesty programs that currently abound.  Ante, at 9.  This analogy is misplaced:  Amnesty programs are designed to entice those who are unlikely ever to pay their debts to come forward and pay at least a portion of what they owe.  It is not administrative convenience alone that justifies such schemes.  In a sense, these schemes help remedy payment inequities by prompting those who would pay nothing to pay at least some of their fair share.  The same cannot be said of the City\xe2\x80\x99s system.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court is willing to concede that \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative considerations could not justify .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an unfair system\xe2\x80\x9d in which \xe2\x80\x9ca city arbitrarily allocate[s] taxes among a few citizens while forgiving many others on the ground that it is cheaper and easier to collect taxes from a few people than from many.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11.  Cold comfort, that.  If the quoted language does not accurately describe this case, I am not sure what it would reach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court wisely does not embrace the City\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that the unequal tax burden is justified because \xe2\x80\x9cit would have been fiscally challenging to issue refunds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 35.  \xe2\x80\x9cFiscally challenging\xe2\x80\x9d gives euphemism a bad name.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it has already spent petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 money is hardly worth a response, and the City recognizes as much when it admits it could provide refunds to petitioners by \xe2\x80\x9carrang[ing] for payments from non-Barrett Law sources.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 36.  One cannot evade returning money to its rightful owner by the simple expedient of spending it.  The \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal challenge\xe2\x80\x9d justification seems particularly inappropriate in this case, as the City\xe2\x80\x94with an annual budget of approximately $900 million\xe2\x80\x94admits that the cost of refunding all of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 money would be approximately $300,000.  Adopted 2012 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County (Oct. 17, 2011), p.\xc2\xa07; Tr. of Oral Arg. 17, 58.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEqually unconvincing is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to distinguish Allegheny Pittsburgh.  The Court claims that case was different because it involved \xe2\x80\x9ca clear state law requirement clearly and dramatically violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.  Nothing less is at stake here.  Indiana law requires that the costs of sewer projects be \xe2\x80\x9capportioned equally among all abutting lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ind. Code \xc2\xa736\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x9339\xe2\x80\x9315(b)(3).  The City has instead apportioned the costs of the Brisbane/ Manning project such that petitioners paid between 10 and 30 times as much as their neighbors.  Worse still, it has done so in order to avoid administrative hassle and save a bit of money.  To paraphrase A Man for All Seasons: \xe2\x80\x9cIt profits a city nothing to give up treating its citizens equally for the whole world .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. but for $300,000?\xe2\x80\x9d  See R. Bolt, A Man for All Seasons, act II, p. 158 (1st Vintage Int\xe2\x80\x99l ed. 1990).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur precedents do not ask for much from government in this area\xe2\x80\x94only \xe2\x80\x9crough equality in tax treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Allegheny Pittsburgh, 488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 343.  The Court reminds us that Allegheny Pittsburgh is a \xe2\x80\x9crare case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.  It is and should be; we give great leeway to taxing authorities in this area, for good and sufficient reasons.  But every generation or so a case comes along when this Court needs to say enough is enough, if the Equal Protection Clause is to retain any force in this context.  Allegheny Pittsburgh was such a case; so is this one.  Indiana law promised neighboring homeowners that they would be treated equally when it came to paying for sewer hook-ups.  The City then ended up charging some homeowners 30 times what it charged their neighbors for the same hook-ups.  The equal protection violation is plain.  I would accordingly reverse the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court, and respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to do otherwise.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
