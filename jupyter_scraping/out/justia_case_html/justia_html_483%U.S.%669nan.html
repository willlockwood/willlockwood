Upon being informed by the Army that he had been given LSD, respondent filed a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) suit.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by the doctrine of <em>Feres v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/135/case.html">340 U.

Respondent then amended his complaint to add <em>Bivens</em> claims and attempted to resurrect his FTCA claim.  Although dismissing the latter claim, the District Court refused to dismiss the <em>Bivens</em> claims, rejecting, <em>inter alia,</em> the Government\'s argument that the same considerations giving rise to the <em>Feres</em> doctrine should constitute "special factors" barring a <em>Bivens</em> action.  Although it then vacated the portion of its order ruling on the <em>Bivens</em> claims, the court subsequently reaffirmed its <em>Bivens</em> decision as to the individual federal employee defendants, ruling that <em>Chappell v.

The court certified its order for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1292(b), and the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling on respondent\'s <em>Bivens</em> claims.

The Court of Appeals\' reinstatement of respondent\'s FTCA claim was in error, since \xc2\xa7 1292(b) authorizes an appeal only from the order certified by the District Court, and not from any other orders that may have been entered in the case.  The Court of Appeals\' jurisdiction was therefore limited to the order refusing to dismiss respondent\'s <em>Bivens</em> claim.

The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that respondent can proceed with his <em>Bivens</em> claims notwithstanding <em>Chappell.</em>  Respondent\'s argument that there is no evidence that his injury was "incident to service" is unavailable to him, since the issue of service incidence was decided adversely to him by the Court of Appeals\' original <em>Feres</em> ruling.  The argument that the chain-of-command concerns allegedly at the heart of <em>Chappell</em> are not implicated here, since the defendants were not respondent\'s superior officers, is also unavailing, because the argument ignores <em>Chappell\'s</em> plain statement that its <em>Bivens</em> analysis was guided by <em>Feres.</em>  Thus, a <em>Bivens</em> action should be disallowed whenever the serviceman\'s injury arises out of activity "incident to service."  As in <em>Chappell,</em> the "special factors" that counsel against a <em>Bivens</em> action in these circumstances are the constitutional authorization for Congress, rather than the judiciary, to make rules governing the military, the unique disciplinary structure of the Military Establishment, Congress\' establishment of a comprehensive internal system of military justice, and the greater degree of disruption respondent\'s chain-of-command rule would have on the military than does the "incident to service" test.  It is irrelevant to a "special factors" analysis whether current laws afford servicemen an "adequate" federal remedy for their injuries.  Similarly irrelevant is <em>Chappell\'s</em> statement that the Court was not there holding that military personnel are barred from all redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrongs suffered in the course of military service, since that statement referred to traditional forms of relief designed to halt or prevent constitutional violations, rather than to the award of money damages, a new kind of cause of action.

Stanley, a master sergeant in the Army stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, volunteered to participate in a program ostensibly designed to test the effectiveness of protective clothing and equipment as defenses against chemical warfare.  He was released from his then-current duties and went to the Army\'s Chemical Warfare Laboratories at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland.  Four times that month, Stanley was secretly administered doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), pursuant to an Army plan to study the effects of the drug on human subjects.  According to his Second Amended Complaint (the allegations of which we accept for purposes of this decision), as a result of the LSD exposure, Stanley has suffered from hallucinations and periods of incoherence and memory loss, was impaired in his military performance, and would on occasion "awake from sleep at night and, without reason, violently beat his wife and children, later being unable to recall the entire incident."  App. 5.  He was discharged from the Army in 1969.  One year later, his marriage dissolved because of the personality changes wrought by the LSD.</p>\n<p>On December 10, 1975, the Army sent Stanley a letter soliciting his cooperation in a study of the long-term effects of LSD on "volunteers who participated" in the 1958 tests.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="672">Page 483 U. S. 672</a></p><p> This was the Government\'s first notification to Stanley that he had been given LSD during his time in Maryland.  After an administrative claim for compensation was denied by the Army, Stanley filed suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2671 <em>et seq.,</em> alleging negligence in the administration, supervision, and subsequent monitoring of the drug testing program.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted the Government\'s motion for summary judgment, finding that Stanley "was at all times on active duty and participating in a <em>bona fide</em> Army program during the time the alleged negligence occurred," No. 788141-Civ-CF, p. 2 (SD Fla., May 14, 1979), and that his FTCA suit was therefore barred by the doctrine of <em>Feres v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/135/case.html">340 U. S. 135</a></span> (1950), which determined that "the Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/135/case.html#146">340 U. S. 146</a></span>.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed that the <em>Feres</em> doctrine barred Stanley\'s FTCA suit against the United States, but held that the District Court should have dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, rather than disposing of the case on the merits.  <em>Stanley v. CIA,</em> 639 F.2d 1146 (1981).  The Government contended that a remand would be futile, because <em>Feres</em> would bar any claims that Stanley could raise either under the FTCA or directly under the Constitution against individual officers under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span> (1971).  The court concluded, however, that Stanley "has at least a colorable constitutional claim based on <em>Bivens,</em>" 639 F.2d at 1159, and remanded "for the consideration of the trial court of any amendment which the appellant may offer, seeking to cure the jurisdictional defect."  <em>Id.</em> at 1159-1160.</p>\n<p>Stanley then amended his complaint to add claims against unknown individual federal officers for violation of his constitutional rights.  He also specifically alleged that the United States\' failure to warn, monitor, or treat him after he </p><p><a class="page-number" name="673">Page 483 U. S. 673</a></p><p> was discharged constituted a separate tort which, because occurring subsequent to his discharge, was not "incident to service" within the <em>Feres</em> exception to the FTCA.  <em>See United States v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/110/case.html">348 U. S. 110</a></span> (1954).  The District Court dismissed the FTCA claim because the alleged negligence was not "separate and distinct from any acts occurring before discharge, so as to give rise to a separate actionable tort not barred by the <em>Feres</em> doctrine."  549 F.Supp. 327, 329 (SD Fla.1982).  It refused, however, to dismiss the <em>Bivens</em> claims.  The court rejected, <em>inter alia,</em> the Government\'s argument that the same considerations giving rise to the <em>Feres</em> exception to the FTCA should constitute "special factors" of the sort alluded to in <em>Bivens, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#396">403 U. S. 396</a></span>, and other cases as bars to a <em>Bivens</em> action.  It cited as sole authority for that rejection the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\'s decision in <em>Wallace v. Chappell,</em> 661 F.2d 729 (1981).  <em>Sua sponte,</em> the court certified its order for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1292(b).</p>\n<p>Following issuance of the order, the Government moved for partial final judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] on behalf of itself and three federal agencies that had (improperly) been named as FTCA defendants throughout the proceedings.  The Government also argued that, because no individual defendants had been named or served, and thus had neither appeared as parties nor sought representation from the Department of Justice, there was no one to seek interlocutory review of the court\'s refusal to dismiss the <em>Bivens</em> actions.  The court concluded that the Government\'s contentions were "well taken," <em>Stanley v. CIA,</em> 552 F.Supp. 619 (SD Fla.1982), and on November 9, 1982, it granted the motion for partial final judgment, ordered the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="674">Page 483 U. S. 674</a></p><p> Clerk to "enter final judgment in favor of the United States forthwith," <em>ibid.,</em> and vacated the portion of its prior order ruling on the <em>Bivens</em> claims against the individual defendants, giving Stanley 90 days to serve at least one individual defendant.  The docket sheet for the case reflects the terms of that order ("The clerk to enter final judgment in favor of USA," App. to Brief in Opposition A4), but does not indicate that an additional "separate document," Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 58, containing the judgment was entered.  <em>See</em> Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 79(a).</p>\n<p>Stanley then filed his Second Amended Complaint, naming as defendants nine individuals (seven of whom are before us as petitioners) and the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and asserting civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1983 and 1985.  Motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue were filed on behalf of some of the defendants (it was alleged that proper service had not been made on the others), but before those motions were ruled on, we issued our decision in <em>Chappell v. Wallace,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html">462 U. S. 296</a></span> (1983), holding that "enlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#305">462 U. S. 305</a></span>, and reversing the sole authority cited by the District Court in its prior order refusing to dismiss Stanley\'s <em>Bivens</em> claims.  Stanley\'s counsel brought the <em>Chappell</em> decision to the attention of the District Court, which, apparently treating the filing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="675">Page 483 U. S. 675</a></p><p> of the Second Amended Complaint as automatically reinstating its previously vacated order concerning the <em>Bivens</em> claims, <em>sua sponte</em> reconsidered and reaffirmed its prior decision.  It concluded that, despite the broadly stated holding of the case, <em>Chappell</em> did not "totally ba[r] <em>Bivens</em> actions by servicemen for torts committed against them during their term of service."  574 F.Supp. 474, 478 (1983).  Rather, it said, <em>Chappell</em> only bars <em>Bivens</em> actions when</p>\n<p>"a member of the military brings a suit against a superior officer for wrongs which involve direct orders in the performance of military duty and the discipline and order necessary thereto,"</p>\n<p>574 F.Supp. at 479, factors that in its view were not involved in Stanley\'s claim.  Nor could the court find in congressionally prescribed remedies, such as the Veterans\' Benefits Act, 38 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 301 <em>et seq.,</em> any expression of exclusivity of the sort <em>Bivens</em> contemplated would preclude recovery.  <em>See</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#397">403 U. S. 397</a></span>.  The court again certified its order for interlocutory appeal under \xc2\xa7 1292(b), which petitioners sought and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit granted.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the conclusion that <em>Chappell</em> does not require dismissal of Stanley\'s <em>Bivens</em> claims, on essentially the grounds relied upon by the District Court.  786 F.2d 1490 (1986).  The court did not think that Congress\' activity in the military justice field was a "special facto[r]" precluding Stanley\'s claim, as</p>\n<p>"[t]hose intramilitary administrative procedures which the Court found adequate to redress the servicemen\'s racial discrimination complaints in <em>Chappell</em> are clearly inadequate to compensate Stanley for the violations complained of here."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1496.</p>\n<p>Although the issue had not been addressed in the order from which the interlocutory appeal was taken, the Court of Appeals further determined that recent precedent in the Eleventh Circuit, including <em>Johnson v. United States,</em> 749 F.2d 1530 (1985), <em>rev\'d,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/681/case.html">481 U. S. 681</a></span> (1987), indicated that Stanley might have a viable FTCA claim against the United States, and that law-of-the-case principles therefore did not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="676">Page 483 U. S. 676</a></p><p> require adherence to the 1982 holding that Stanley\'s FTCA claim was barred by <em>Feres.</em>  It remanded with instructions to the District Court to "allow Stanley the opportunity to amend to plead consistent with recent precedent."  786 F.2d at 1499.</p>\n<p>Because the Courts of Appeals have not been uniform in their interpretation of the holding in <em>Chappell,</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and because the Court of Appeals\' reinstatement of Stanley\'s FTCA claims seems at odds with sound judicial practice, we granted certiorari.  479 U.S. 1005 (1986).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>We first address the Court of Appeals\' instruction to the District Court to allow Stanley to replead his FTCA claim.  While petitioners advance several reasons why that action was improper, and additional reasons can perhaps be found in our recent decision in <em>United States v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/681/case.html">481 U. S. 681</a></span> (1987), we find it necessary to discuss only one.  The case did not come before the Court of Appeals on appeal from a final decision of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291.  Rather, the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1292(b), which provides:</p>\n<p>"When a district judge in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that <em>such order</em> involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal <em>from the order</em> may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="677">Page 483 U. S. 677</a></p><p> such order.  The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken <em>from such order. . . .</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  An appeal under this statute is from the <em>certified order,</em> not from any other orders that may have been entered in the case.  Even if the Court of Appeals\' jurisdiction is not confined to the precise question certified by the lower court (because the statute brings the "order," not the question, before the court), that jurisdiction <em>is</em> confined to the particular order appealed from.  Commentators and courts have consistently observed that</p>\n<p>"the scope of the issues open to the court of appeals is closely limited to the order appealed from [and] [t]he court of appeals will not consider matters that were ruled upon in other orders."</p>\n<p>16 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; E. Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 3929, p. 143 (1977).  <em>See Pritchard-Keang Nam Corp. v. Jaworski,</em> 751 F.2d 277, 281, n. 3 (CA8 1984), <em>cert. dism\'d,</em> 472 U.S. 1022 (1985); <em>United States v.

S. 304</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Stanley seeks to distance himself from this holding in several ways.  First, he argues that the defendants in this case were not Stanley\'s superior military officers, and indeed may well have been civilian personnel, and that the chain-of-command concerns at the heart of <em>Chappell</em> and cases such as <em>Gaspard v. United States,</em> 713 F.2d 1097, 1103-1104 (CA5 1983) (plaintiff was ordered to expose himself to radiation from nuclear test), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Sheehan v. United States,</em> 466 U.S. 975 (1984), are thus not implicated.  Second, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="680">Page 483 U. S. 680</a></p><p> Stanley argues that there is no evidence that this injury was "incident to service," because we do not know the precise character of the drug testing program, the titles and roles of the various individual defendants, or Stanley\'s duty status when he was at the Maryland testing grounds.  If that argument is sound, then even if <em>Feres</em> principles apply fully to <em>Bivens</em> actions, further proceedings are necessary to determine whether they apply to this case.</p>\n<p>The second argument, however, is not available to Stanley here.  The issue of service incidence, as that term is used in <em>Feres,</em> was decided adversely to him by the Court of Appeals in 1981, 639 F.2d at 1150-1153, and there is no warrant for reexamining that ruling here.  <em>See Allen v. McCurry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/case.html">449 U. S. 90</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/case.html#94">449 U. S. 94</a></span> (1980).  As for his first argument, Stanley and the lower courts may well be correct that <em>Chappell</em> implicated military chain-of-command concerns more directly than do the facts alleged here; in the posture of this case, one must assume that at least some of the defendants were not Stanley\'s superior officers, and that he was not acting under orders from superior officers when he was administered LSD.  It is therefore true that <em>Chappell</em> is not strictly controlling, in the sense that no holding can be broader than the facts before the court.  It is even true that some of the language of <em>Chappell,</em> explicitly focusing on the officer-subordinate relationship that existed in the case at hand, would not be applicable here.  To give controlling weight to those facts, however, is to ignore our plain statement in <em>Chappell</em> that</p>\n<p>"[t]he \'special factors\' that bear on the propriety of respondents\' <em>Bivens</em> action also formed the basis of this Court\'s decision in <em>Feres v. United States,</em>"</p>\n<p>462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#298">462 U. S. 298</a></span>, and that,</p>\n<p>"[a]lthough this case concerns the limitations on the type of nonstatutory damages remedy recognized in <em>Bivens,</em> rather than Congress\' intent in enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Court\'s analysis in <em>Feres</em> guides our analysis in this case."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#299">462 U. S. 299</a></span>.  Since <em>Feres</em> did not consider the officer-subordinate relationship crucial, but established instead an "incident to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="681">Page 483 U. S. 681</a></p><p> service" test, it is plain that our reasoning in <em>Chappell</em> does not support the distinction Stanley would rely on.</p>\n<p>As we implicitly recognized in <em>Chappell,</em> there are varying levels of generality at which one may apply "special factors" analysis.  Most narrowly, one might require reason to believe that in the particular case the disciplinary structure of the military would be affected -- thus not even excluding all officer-subordinate suits, but allowing, for example, suits for officer conduct so egregious that no responsible officer would feel exposed to suit in the performance of his duties.  Somewhat more broadly, one might disallow <em>Bivens</em> actions whenever an officer-subordinate relationship underlies the suit.  More broadly still, one might disallow them in the officer-subordinate situation and also beyond that situation when it affirmatively appears that military discipline would be affected.  (This seems to be the position urged by Stanley.)  Fourth, as we think appropriate, one might disallow <em>Bivens</em> actions whenever the injury arises out of activity "incident to service."  And finally, one might conceivably disallow them by servicemen entirely.  Where one locates the rule along this spectrum depends upon how prophylactic one thinks the prohibition should be (<em>i.e.,</em> how much occasional, unintended impairment of military discipline one is willing to tolerate), which in turn depends upon how harmful and inappropriate judicial intrusion upon military discipline is thought to be.  This is essentially a policy judgment, and there is no scientific or analytic demonstration of the right answer.  Today, no more than when we wrote <em>Chappell,</em> do we see any reason why our judgment in the <em>Bivens</em> context should be any less protective of military concerns than it has been with respect to FTCA suits, where we adopted an "incident to service" rule.  In fact, if anything, we might have felt freer to compromise military concerns in the latter context, since we were confronted with an explicit congressional authorization for judicial involvement that was, on its face, unqualified, whereas here we are confronted with an explicit constitutional authorization </p><p><a class="page-number" name="682">Page 483 U. S. 682</a></p><p> for Congress "[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces," U.S.Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 14, and rely upon inference for our own authority to allow money damages. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  This is not to say, as JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s dissent characterizes it, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/669/case.html#707">483 U. S. 707</a></span>, that all matters within congressional power are exempt from <em>Bivens.</em>  What is distinctive here is the specificity of that technically superfluous grant of power, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and the insistence (evident from the number of Clauses devoted to the subject) with which the Constitution confers authority over the Army, Navy, and militia upon the political branches.  All this counsels hesitation in our creation of damages remedies in this field.</p>\n<p>The other major factor determining at which point, along the spectrum of generality, one should apply <em>Chappell\'s</em> "special factors" analysis consists of the degree of disruption which each of them will in fact produce.  This is an analytic, rather than a policy, judgment -- but once again, we see no reason why it should differ in the <em>Bivens</em> and the <em>Feres</em> contexts.  Stanley underestimates the degree of disruption that would be caused by the rule he proposes.  A test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decisionmaking would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters.  Whether a case implicates those concerns would often be problematic, raising the prospect of compelled depositions and trial testimony by military officers concerning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="683">Page 483 U. S. 683</a></p><p> the details of their military commands.  Even putting aside the risk of erroneous judicial conclusions (which would becloud military decisionmaking), the mere process of arriving at correct conclusions would disrupt the military regime.  The "incident to service" test, by contrast, provides a line that is relatively clear, and that can be discerned with less extensive inquiry into military matters.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, 786 F.2d at 1496, it is irrelevant to a "special factors" analysis whether the laws currently on the books afford Stanley, or any other particular serviceman, an "adequate" federal remedy for his injuries.  The "special facto[r]" that "counsel[s] hesitation" is not the fact that Congress has chosen to afford some manner of relief in the particular case, but the fact that congressionally uninvited intrusion into military affairs by the judiciary is inappropriate.  Similarly irrelevant is the statement in <em>Chappell,</em> erroneously relied upon by Stanley and the lower courts, that we have</p>\n<p>"never held, nor do we now hold, that military personnel are barred from all redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrongs suffered in the course of military service."</p>\n<p>462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#304">462 U. S. 304</a></span>.  As the citations immediately following that statement suggest, it referred to redress designed to halt or prevent the constitutional violation, rather than the award of money damages.  <em>See Brown v. Glines,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/348/case.html">444 U. S. 348</a></span> (1980); <em>Parker v. Levy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/733/case.html">417 U. S. 733</a></span> (1974); <em>Frontiero v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/677/case.html">411 U. S. 677</a></span> (1973).  Such suits, like the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/48/89/case.html">Wilkes v. Dinsman,</a></span></em> 7 How. 89 (1849), distinguished in <em>Chappell,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#305">462 U. S. 305</a></span>, n. 2, sought traditional forms of relief, and "did not ask the Court to imply a new kind of cause of action."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We therefore reaffirm the reasoning of <em>Chappell</em> that the "special factors counseling hesitation" -- "the unique disciplinary structure of the Military Establishment and Congress\' activity in the field," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#304">462 U.

S. 684</a></p><p> as the exception to the FTCA established by <em>Feres</em> and <em>United States v. Johnson.</em>  We hold that no <em>Bivens</em> remedy is available for injuries that "arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service."  340 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/135/case.html#146">340 U. S. 146</a></span>.</p>\n<p><span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/669/case.html#690">483 U. S. </a></span> because the refusal to entertain a <em>Bivens</em> action has the same effect as a grant of unqualified immunity, we should find "special factors" sufficient to preclude a <em>Bivens</em> action only when our immunity decisions would absolutely foreclose a money judgment against the defendant officials.  The short answer to this argument is that <em>Chappell</em> made no reference to immunity principles, and <em>Bivens</em> itself explicitly distinguished the question of immunity from the question whether the Constitution directly provides the basis for a damages action against individual officers.  403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#397">403 U. S. 397</a></span>.  The analytic answer is that the availability of a damages action under the Constitution for particular <em>injuries</em> (those incurred in the course of military service) is a question logically distinct from immunity to such an action on the part of particular <em>defendants.</em>  When liability is asserted under a statute, for example, no one would suggest that whether a cause of action exists should be determined by consulting the scope of common law immunity enjoyed by actors in the area to which the statute pertains.  Rather, one applies that immunity (unless the statute says otherwise) to whatever actions and remedies the terms of the statute are found to provide.  Similarly, the <em>Bivens</em> inquiry in this case -- whether a damages action for injury in the course of military service can be founded directly upon the Constitution -- is analytically distinct from the question of official immunity from <em>Bivens</em> liability.</p>\n<p>We do not understand JUSTICE BRENNAN to dispute this.  Rather, he argues that the answer to the former inquiry should be such that it produces a result coextensive with the answer to the latter.  That is of course quite possible to achieve, since one can adjust the definition of a cause of action </p><p><a class="page-number" name="685">Page 483 U. S. 685</a></p><p> to produce precisely the same results as a given definition of immunity.  For example, if a State wanted to eliminate driver liability for automobile accidents, it could <em>either</em> prescribe that all automobile drivers are immune from suit for injuries caused by their negligent driving <em>or</em> prescribe that no cause of action exists for injuries caused by negligent driving.  But what JUSTICE BRENNAN fails to produce is any <em>reason</em> for creating such an equivalency in the present case (and, presumably, in all <em>Bivens</em> actions).  In the sole case he relies upon for his novel analysis, <em>Davis v. Passman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html">442 U. S. 228</a></span> (1979), there was a reason.  There, the Constitution itself contained an applicable immunity provision -- the Speech or Debate Clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6, cl. 1 -- which rendered Members of Congress immune from suit for their legislative activity.  The Court held that the "special concerns counseling hesitation" in the inference of <em>Bivens</em> actions in that area "are coextensive with the protections afforded by the Speech or Debate Clause."  442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html#246">442 U. S. 246</a></span>.  That is to say, the Framers addressed the special concerns in that field through an immunity provision -- and had they believed further protection was necessary, they would have expanded that immunity provision.  It would therefore have distorted their plan to achieve the same effect as more expansive immunity by the device of denying a cause of action for injuries caused by Members of Congress where the constitutionally prescribed immunity does not apply.</p>\n<p>Thus, <em>Davis v. Passman</em> would be relevant here if the Constitution contained a grant of immunity to military personnel similar to the Speech or Debate Clause.  It does not, of course, and so we are compelled in the military field, as in others, to make our own assessment of whether, given the "special concerns counseling hesitation," <em>Bivens</em> actions will lie.  There is no more reason why court-created rules of immunity (as opposed to immunity specifically prescribed in the Constitution) should be held <em>a priori</em> to describe the limit of those concerns here than in any other field.  Thus, the rule </p><p><a class="page-number" name="686">Page 483 U. S. 686</a></p><p> JUSTICE BRENNAN proposes is not an application, but a repudiation, of the "special factors" limitation upon the inference of <em>Bivens</em> actions.  That limitation is quite hollow if it does nothing but duplicate preexisting immunity from suit.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Court of Appeals\' judgment that Stanley can assert an FTCA claim on remand to the District Court and reverse its judgment refusing to dismiss the <em>Bivens</em> claims against petitioners.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part and vacated in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>* JUSTICE STEVENS joins Part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>"When more than one claim for relief is presented . . the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The named defendants are Joseph R.

What this case and others like it demonstrate, however, is that Government officials (military or civilian) must not be left with such freedom.  <em>See, e.g., Jaffee v.

But the Court today holds that no <em>Bivens</em> remedy is available for service-connected injuries, because "special factors counse[l] hesitation."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#396">403 U.

The practical result of this decision is absolute immunity from liability for money damages for all federal officials who intentionally violate the constitutional rights of those serving in the military.</p>\n<p>First, I will demonstrate that the Court has reached this result only by ignoring governing precedent.  The Court confers absolute immunity from money damages on federal officials (military and civilian alike) without consideration of longstanding case law establishing the general rule that such officials are liable for damages caused by their intentional violations of well-established constitutional rights.  If applied here, that rule would require a different result.  Then I will show that the Court denies Stanley\'s <em>Bivens</em> action solely on the basis of an unwarranted extension of the narrow exception to this rule created in <em>Chappell v. Wallace,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html">462 U. S. 296</a></span> (1983).  The Court\'s reading of <em>Chappell</em> tears it from its analytical moorings, ignores the considerations decisive in our immunity cases, and leads to an unjust and illogical result.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court acknowledges that Stanley may bring a <em>Bivens</em> action for damages under the Constitution unless there are "special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress."  <em>Bivens, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#396">403 U.

Ascertaining the propriety of a damages award is the purpose of both the <em>Bivens</em> "special factors" analysis and the inquiry into whether these federal officials are entitled to absolute immunity from money damages.

The Court recognized that</p>\n<p>"a suit against a Congressman for putatively unconstitutional actions taken in the course of his official conduct does raise special concerns counseling hesitation"</p>\n<p>under <em>Bivens,</em> but held that "these concerns are coextensive with the protections afforded by the Speech or Debate Clause," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/case.html#246">442 U.

I contend only that the "special factors" analysis of <em>Bivens</em> and the functional analysis of immunity are based on identical judicial concerns which, when correctly applied, should not and do not (as either a logical or practical matter) produce different outcomes.  JUSTICE STEVENS explained it well:</p>\n<p>"The practical consequences of a holding that no remedy has been authorized against a public official are essentially the same as those flowing from a conclusion that the official has absolute immunity.  Moreover, similar factors are evaluated in deciding whether to recognize an implied cause of action or a claim of immunity.  In both situations, when Congress is silent, the Court makes an effort to ascertain its probable intent."</p>\n<p><em>Mitchell v.

Thus, the redundance which so troubles the Court in equation of the "special factors" analysis and the immunity analysis strikes me as evidence only that the analyses are being properly performed.  And <em>Davis</em> cannot be characterized, as the Court asserts, as a <em>unique</em> case in which the "special factors" of <em>Bivens</em> were coextensive with the immunity granted.

[<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>Whoever the officials in this case are (and we do not know), and whatever their functions, it is likely that, under the Court\'s usual analysis, they, like most Government officials, are not entitled to absolute immunity.  The record does not reveal what offices the individual petitioners held, let alone what functions they normally performed, or what functions they were performing at the time they (somehow) participated in the decision to administer LSD to Stanley (and 1,000 other soldiers).  The Court has no idea whether those officials can carry "the burden of showing that public policy requires [absolute immunity]" for effective performance of those functions.  <em>Butz,</em> 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#506">438 U.

My conclusion that qualified, rather than absolute, immunity is the norm for Government officials, even in cases involving military matters, is buttressed by the common law.</p>\n<p>At common law, even military superiors received no exemption from the general rule that officials may be held accountable for their actions in damages in a civil court of law.

In that case, this Court permitted a Navy seaman to bring a claim against his superior officer for injuries resulting from willful torts.

Repeatedly referring to the "<em>peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors,\'" and to the need for "immediate compliance with military procedures and orders," the Court held that "enlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations."  462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#300">462 U.

[<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  Although the Court concedes this central focus of <em>Chappell,</em> it gives short shrift to the obvious and important distinction between </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="701">Page 483 U. S. 701</a></em></p><p><em> <em>Chappell</em> and the present case, namely, that the defendants are not alleged to be Stanley\'s superior officers.  Instead, the Court seizes upon the statement in <em>Chappell</em> that our analysis in that case was guided by the concerns underlying the <em>Feres</em> doctrine, and dramatically expands the carefully limited holding in <em>Chappell,</em> extending its reasoning beyond logic, and its meaning beyond recognition.\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court reasons as follows:  in <em>Chappell,</em> we stated that the concern for "military discipline" underlying the <em>Feres</em> doctrine would guide our analysis of the soldiers\' <em>Bivens</em> claims against their superior officers.  462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#299">462 U.

S. 681</a></span> (1987), we held that the concerns underlying the <em>Feres</em> doctrine precluded a soldier\'s FTCA claim for service-connected injury, even against civilian federal officials.  Thus, the Court concludes, the concerns underlying the <em>Feres</em> doctrine preclude Stanley\'s <em>Bivens</em> action for service-connected injury against civilian federal officials.</p>\n<p>This argument has a number of flaws.  First, in <em>Chappell,</em> we said with good reason that our analysis would be "guided," not governed, by concerns underlying <em>Feres.</em>  The <em>Bivens</em> context differs significantly from the FTCA context; <em>Bivens</em> involves not negligent acts, but intentional constitutional violations that must be deterred and punished.  Because <em>Chappell</em> involved the relationship at the heart of the <em>Feres</em> doctrine -- the relationship between soldier and superior -- the Court found <em>Feres</em> considerations relevant, and provided direct military superiors with absolute immunity from damages actions filed by their subordinates.  Here, however, the defendants are federal officials who perform <em>unknown</em> functions and bear an <em>unknown</em> relationship to Stanley.  Thus, we must assure ourselves that concerns underlying the <em>Feres</em> doctrine actually do require absolute immunity from money damages before we take the drastic step of insulating officials from liability for intentional constitutional violations.  This the Court utterly fails to do. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="702">Page 483 U. S. 702</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Second, two of the three <em>Feres</em> rationales that decided <em>Johnson, supra,</em> are entirely inapplicable here. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  Thus, the Court relies solely upon the third <em>Feres</em> rationale -- a solicitude for military discipline.  The <em>Feres</em> concern for military discipline itself has three components.  The first, the concern for the instinctive obedience of soldiers to orders, is of central importance in the <em>Feres</em> doctrine. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]  That rationale profoundly and exclusively concerned the Court in <em>Chappell,</em> which involved the relationship between a superior officer and those in his or her command. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]  This concern for instinctive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="703">Page 483 U.

[<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]</p>\n<p>As for the other components of the concern for military discipline, their application is entirely different in the <em>Bivens</em> context.  The Court fears that military affairs might be disrupted by factual inquiries necessitated by <em>Bivens</em> actions.  The judiciary is already involved, however, in cases that implicate military judgments and decisions, as when a soldier sues for nonservice-connected injury, when a soldier sues civilian contractors with the Government for service-connected injury, and when a civilian is injured and sues a civilian contractor with the military or a military tortfeasor.  <em>See Johnson,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="704">Page 483 U.

[<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]  Although the desire to <em>limit</em> the number of such cases might justify the decision not to allow soldiers\' FTCA suits arising from <em>negligent</em> conduct by civilian Government employees, <em>see United States v. Johnson, supra,</em> it is insufficient to preclude suits against civilians for <em>intentional</em> violations of constitutional rights.  Unless the command relationship (or some other consideration requiring absolute immunity) is involved, these violations should receive moral condemnation and legal redress without limitation to that accorded negligent acts.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court fears that the vigor of military decisionmaking will be sapped if damages can be awarded for an incorrect (albeit intentionally incorrect) choice.  Of course, this case involves civilian decisionmakers, but, because the injury was service connected, we must assume that these civilian judgments are somehow intertwined with conduct of the military mission.  <em>See Johnson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/681/case.html#691">481 U. S. 691</a></span>.  The significant difference between the <em>Feres</em> (FTCA) and <em>Bivens</em> (constitutional claim) contexts, however, is that, in the latter, the vigorous decisionmaking concern has already been taken into account in our determination that qualified immunity is the general rule for federal officials, who <em>should</em> be required "on occasion . . . to pause to consider whether a proposed course of action can be squared with the Constitution."  <em>Mitchell,</em> 472 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/case.html#524">472 U.

Given the significant interests protected by <em>Bivens</em> actions, the Court must consider a constitutional claim in light of the concerns underlying <em>Feres.</em>  If those concerns are not implicated by a soldier\'s constitutional claim, <em>Feres</em> should not thoughtlessly be imposed to prevent redress of an intentional constitutional violation. [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court decides that here (as indeed in any case) one might select a higher level of generality for the <em>Chappell</em> holding, and concludes that any <em>Bivens</em> action arising from a service-connected injury is foreclosed by "special factors counseling hesitation."  <em>Bivens,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#396">403 U.

First, the existence of a constitutional provision authorizing Congress to make intramilitary rules does not answer the question whether <em>civilian</em> federal officials are immune from damages in actions arising from service-connected injury.  Second, <em>any time</em> Congress acts, it does so pursuant to either an express or implied grant of power in the Constitution.  If a <em>Bivens</em> action were precluded any time Congress possessed a constitutional grant of authority to act in a given area, there would be no <em>Bivens.</em>  In fact, many administrative agencies exist and function entirely at the pleasure of Congress, yet the Court has not hesitated to infer <em>Bivens</em> actions against these agencies\' officials.  This is so no matter how explicitly or frequently the Constitution authorizes Congress to act in a given area.  Even when considering matters most clearly within Congress\' constitutional authority, we have found that a <em>Bivens</em> action will lie.  <em>See Davis v.

In contrast, <em>Bivens</em> actions are governed by uniform federal law.

But the VBA fails to address the violation of constitutional rights unaccompanied by personal injury that is not defined as disabling.  Those whose constitutional rights are infringed, resulting in humiliation or "in mere pain and suffering, but no lasting permanent physical injury, would not be compensated at all."

Of course, this aspect of military discipline would not be implicated in <em>Johnson,</em> or in any cases involving tortious conduct by a civilian official.  But in <em>Johnson,</em> two of the three major rationales underlying <em>Feres</em> -- the concern for uniformity and the congressional provision of thoroughgoing compensation -- were relevant.  Neither of these rationales applies here.  <em>See</em> <l=|483 22|="" 669fn2="" u.s.="">n. 22, <em>supra.</em></l=|483></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/25" name="F2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p>Stanley points out that he was administered LSD without his knowledge, so that he could not have disobeyed any order given him.  Had his military superior surreptitiously administered the LSD to him, this fact alone might distinguish a suit for damages against that official from the suit in <em>Chappell.</em>  Here, however, the fact that the LSD was given Stanley without his knowledge simply removes the case one step further from the concern for obedience to orders that the Court chose to protect in <em>Chappell.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/26" name="F2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]</p>\n<p>I do not mean to imply that <em>Chappell</em> suggests that <em>Bivens</em> actions against military officials <em>other than</em> direct superiors are precluded.

Moreover, the military does not require instinctive or reflexive obedience of the soldier in all contexts (combat being the obvious counterexample).  Soldiers are subject to criminal sanctions if they obey certain orders.  <em>See United States v.

S. 681</a></span>-682.  One could approach the question from an entirely different angle.  The usual rule with regard to suing the United States is sovereign immunity, so the FTCA creates an exception to that rule which must be narrowly interpreted.  The usual rule is individual accountability for injury done, and qualified immunity of federal officials represents a judge-made exception to that rule.  Our decision to find "special factors" in a <em>Bivens</em> case and grant absolute immunity to federal officials with regard to a certain class of injuries represents a further and indefensible enlargement of a special status.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/29" name="F2/29">Footnote 2/29</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Chappell,</em> the Court makes plain that, standing alone, the "special nature of [the] military" would not have sufficed to confer absolute immunity upon military superiors for wrongs inflicted upon those in their command.  It was the "unique disciplinary structure of the Military Establishment <em>and</em> Congress\' activity in the field" that, "<em>[t]aken together,</em>" constituted those special factors precluding any damages award.  462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#304">462 U. S. 304</a></span> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree with both the Court and JUSTICE BRENNAN that James Stanley\'s cause of action under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2671 <em>et seq.,</em> should not have been reinstated by the Court of Appeals.  I therefore join Part I of the Court\'s opinion.  I further agree with the Court that, under <em>Chappell v. Wallace,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html">462 U. S. 296</a></span> (1983), there is generally no remedy available under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.

S. 683</a></span>-684.  In <em>Chappell v. Wallace, supra,</em> this Court unanimously held that enlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations.  The "special factors" that we found relevant to the propriety of a <em>Bivens</em> action by enlisted personnel against their military superiors "also formed the basis" of this Court\'s decision in <em>Feres v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/135/case.html">340 U. S. 135</a></span> (1950), that the FTCA does not extend to injuries arising out of military service.  <em>Chappell, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/296/case.html#298">462 U. S. 298</a></span>.  In my view, therefore, <em>Chappell</em> and <em>Feres</em> must be read together; both cases unmistakably stand for the proposition that the special circumstances of the military mandate that civilian courts avoid entertaining a suit involving harm caused as a result of military service.  Thus, no amount of negligence, recklessness, or perhaps even deliberate indifference on the part of the military would justify the entertainment of a <em>Bivens</em> action involving actions incident to military service.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the <em>Chappell</em> exception to the availability of a <em>Bivens</em> action applies only to "injuries that <em>arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/669/case.html#684">483 U. S. 684</a></span> (quoting <em>Feres v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/135/case.html#146">340 U. S. 146</a></span>).  In my view, conduct of the type alleged in this case is so far beyond the bounds of human decency that, as a matter of law, it simply cannot be considered a part of the military mission.  The bar created by <em>Chappell</em> -- a judicial exception to an implied remedy for the violation of constitutional rights -- surely cannot insulate defendants from liability for deliberate and calculated exposure of otherwise healthy military personnel to medical experimentation without their consent, outside of any combat, combat training, or military exigency, and for no other reason than to gather information on the effect of lysergic acid diethylamide on human beings.\n</em></p>\n<p>No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="710">Page 483 U. S. 710</a></p><p> to have occurred in this case.  Indeed, as JUSTICE BRENNAN observes, the United States military played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/669/case.html#687">483 U. S. 687</a></span>, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the "voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential . . . to satisfy moral, ethical and legal concepts."  <em>United States v. Brandt (The Medical Case),</em> 2 Trials of War Criminals Before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals Under Control Council Law No. 10, p. 181 (1949).  If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.  I am prepared to say that our Constitution\'s promise of due process of law guarantees this much.  Accordingly, I would permit James Stanley\'s <em>Bivens</em> action to go forward, and I therefore dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
