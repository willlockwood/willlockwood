The plan provides for payment of covered medical expenses and has an \xe2\x80\x9cActs of Third Parties\xe2\x80\x9d provision.  This provision requires a beneficiary who is injured as a result of an act or omission of a third party to reimburse Mid Atlantic for benefits it pays on account of those injuries, if the beneficiary recovers for those injuries from the third party.  The Sereboffs were involved in an automobile accident and suffered injuries.  The plan paid the couple\xe2\x80\x99s medical expenses.  The Sereboffs sought compensatory damages for the accident from third parties in state court.  After the Sereboffs settled their tort suit, Mid Atlantic filed suit in District Court under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) of ERISA, seeking to collect from the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 tort recovery the medical expenses it had paid on the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 behalf.  The Sereboffs agreed to set aside from their tort recovery a sum equal to the amount Mid Atlantic claimed, and preserve this sum in an investment account pending the outcome of the suit.  The court found in Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s favor and ordered the Sereboffs to turn over the amount set aside.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed in relevant part, and observed that the Courts of Appeals are divided on the question whether \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) authorizes recovery in these circumstances.  This Court granted review to resolve this disagreement.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s action properly sought \xe2\x80\x9cequitable relief\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).

Relying on such a provision, Great-West<em> </em>sought equitable restitution of benefits it had paid when Knudson recovered in tort from a third party.  In considering whether \xc2\xa7502(a)(3)(b) authorized such relief, this Court asked whether the restitutionary remedy Great-West sought would have been equitable in \xe2\x80\x9cthe days of the divided bench,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 212.  This Court found that it would not have been equitable, because the funds Great-West sought were not in Knudson\xe2\x80\x99s possession but had been placed in a trust under California law.  That impediment is not present here.  Mid Atlantic sought identifiable funds within the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 possession and control\xe2\x80\x94that part of the tort settlement due Mid Atlantic under the ERISA plan and set aside in the investment account.

In <em>Barnes</em> v. <em>Alexander,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/232/117/index.html">232 U. S. 117</a>, attorney Barnes promised two other attorneys \xe2\x80\x9cone-third of the contingent fee\xe2\x80\x9d he expected in a case, <em>id.,</em> at 119.  Based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe familiar rul[e] of equity that a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 121, the Court found that Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 undertaking \xe2\x80\x9ccreate[d] a lien\xe2\x80\x9d upon the portion of the recovery due him from the client, <em>ibid.</em>, which the other attorneys could \xe2\x80\x9cfollow \xe2\x80\xa6 into [Barnes\xe2\x80\x99] hands\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as [the fund] was identified,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 123.  The \xe2\x80\x9cActs of Third Parties\xe2\x80\x9d provision in the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 plan, like Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 promise, specifically identified a particular fund distinct from the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 general assets, and a particular share of that fund to which Mid Atlantic was entitled.  Thus, Mid Atlantic could rely on a \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar rul[e] of equity\xe2\x80\x9d to collect for the medical bills it had paid by following a portion of the recovery \xe2\x80\x9cinto the [Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99] hands\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as [the settlement fund] was identified,\xe2\x80\x9d and imposing on that portion a constructive trust or equitable lien.  <em>Ibid.  </em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The Sereboffs object that Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s suit would not have satisfied the strict tracing rules that they say accompanied equitable restitution at common law.  But <em>Barnes </em>confirms that no such tracing requirement applies to equitable liens imposed by agreement or assignment, like that in <em>Barnes </em>itself.  And <em>Knudson</em> did not endorse application of all restitutionary conditions, like the tracing rules the Sereboffs<em> </em>identify, to every action for an equitable lien under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).  <em>Knudson </em>simply held that equitable restitution was unavailable because the funds Great-West sought were not in Knudson\xe2\x80\x99s possession.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sereboffs also argue that equitable relief is inappropriate, even under <em>Barnes</em>, because at the time they agreed to the plan terms, no fund existed in which they could grant Mid Atlantic an equitable interest.  But<em> Barnes</em> explicitly disapproved of a rule requiring identification at the time a contract is made of the fund to which a lien specified in the contract attached.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sereboffs also claim that the rule announced in <em>Barnes </em>applies only to equitable liens claimed under an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s contingency fee arrangement.  But <em>Barnes </em>did not attach any particular significance to the identify of the parties seeking recovery, and other cases of this Court, not involving attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 contingency fees, have applied the same \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar rul[e] of equity\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>Barnes </em>did.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Walker</em> v. <em>Brown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/654/index.html">165 U. S. 654</a>.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the lower courts erred in allowing enforcement of the \xe2\x80\x9cActs of Third Parties\xe2\x80\x9d provision, without imposing limitations that would apply to an equitable subrogation action, is rejected.  Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s claim is not considered equitable because it is a subrogation claim.  Rather, it is considered equitable because it is indistinguishable from an action to enforce an equitable lien established by agreement, of the sort epitomized by <em>Barnes.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p align="left">407 F.\xc2\xa03d 212, affirmed in relevant part.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962097">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF THE COURT<br/>\nSEREBOFF V.

This provision \xe2\x80\x9capplies when [a beneficiary is] sick or injured as a result of the act or omission of another person or party,\xe2\x80\x9d and requires a beneficiary who \xe2\x80\x9creceives benefits\xe2\x80\x9d under the plan for such injuries to \xe2\x80\x9creimburse [Mid Atlantic]\xe2\x80\x9d for those benefits from \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll recoveries from a third party (whether by lawsuit, settlement, or otherwise).\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a.

Pursuant to the plan\xe2\x80\x99s coverage provisions, the plan paid the couple\xe2\x80\x99s medical expenses.  The Sereboffs filed a tort action in state court against several third parties, seeking compensatory damages for injuries suffered as a result of the accident.  Soon after the suit was commenced, Mid Atlantic sent the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 attorney a letter asserting a lien on the anticipated proceeds from the suit, for the medical expenses Mid Atlantic paid on the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 behalf.  App. 87\xe2\x80\x9390.  On several occasions over the next 2 years, Mid Atlantic sent similar correspondence to the attorney and to the Sereboffs, repeating its claim to a lien on a portion of the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 recovery, and detailing the medical expenses as they accrued and were paid by the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 tort suit eventually settled for $750,000.  Neither the Sereboffs nor their attorney sent any money to Mid Atlantic in satisfaction of its claimed lien which, after Mid Atlantic completed its payments on the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 behalf, totaled $74,869.37.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mid Atlantic filed suit in District Court under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) of ERISA, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(3), seeking to collect from the Sereboffs the medical expenses it had paid on their behalf.  Since the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 attorney had already distributed the settlement proceeds to them, Mid Atlantic sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction requiring the couple to retain and set aside at least $74,869.37 from the proceeds.  The District Court approved a stipulation by the parties, under which the Sereboffs agreed to \xe2\x80\x9cpreserve $74,869.37 of the settlement funds\xe2\x80\x9d in an investment account, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil the [District] Court rules on the merits of this case and all appeals, if any, are exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 69.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the merits, the District Court found in Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s favor and ordered the Sereboffs to pay Mid Atlantic the $74,869.37, plus interest, with a deduction for Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s share of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and court costs the Sereboffs had incurred in state court.  See 303 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 691, 316 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 265 (Md. 2004).  The Sereboffs appealed and the Fourth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.  407 F.\xc2\xa03d 212 (2005).

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(3).  There is no dispute that Mid Atlantic is a fiduciary under ERISA and that its suit in District Court was to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce \xe2\x80\xa6 the terms of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cActs of Third Parties\xe2\x80\x9d provision in the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 plan.  The only question is whether the relief Mid Atlantic requested from the District Court was \xe2\x80\x9cequitable\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3)(B).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not the first time we have had occasion to clarify the scope of the remedial power conferred on district courts by \xc2\xa7502(a)(3)(B).  In <em>Mertens</em> v. <em>Hewitt Associates,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/248/index.html">508 U. S. 248</a> (1993), we construed the provision to authorize only \xe2\x80\x9cthose categories of relief that were <em>typically </em>available in equity,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus rejected a claim that we found sought \xe2\x80\x9cnothing other than compensatory <em>damages</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 255\xe2\x80\x93256.  We elaborated on this construction of \xc2\xa7502(a)(3)(B) in <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Knudson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/204/index.html">534 U. S. 204</a> (2002), which involved facts similar to those in this case.  Much like the \xe2\x80\x9cActs of Third Parties\xe2\x80\x9d provision in the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 plan, the plan in <em>Knudson </em>reserved \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a first lien upon any recovery, whether by settlement, judgment or otherwise,\xe2\x80\x99 that the beneficiary receives from [a] third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 207.  After Knudson was involved in a car accident, Great-West paid medical bills on her behalf and, when she recovered in tort from a third party for her injuries, Great-West sought to collect from her for the medical bills it had paid.  <em>Id.,</em> at 207\xe2\x80\x93209.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to the argument that Great-West\xe2\x80\x99s claim in <em>Knudson</em> was for \xe2\x80\x9crestitution\xe2\x80\x9d and thus equitable under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3)(B) and <em>Mertens</em>, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cnot all relief falling under the rubric of restitution [was] available in equity.\xe2\x80\x9d  534 U. S.<em>,</em> at 212.  To decide whether the restitutionary relief sought by Great-West was equitable or legal, we examined cases and secondary legal materials to determine if the relief would have been equitable \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the days of the divided bench.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We explained that one feature of equitable restitution was that it sought to impose a constructive trust or equitable lien on \xe2\x80\x9cparticular funds or property in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 213.  That requirement was not met in <em>Knudson</em>, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe funds to which petitioners claim[ed] an entitlement\xe2\x80\x9d were not in Knudson\xe2\x80\x99s possession, but had instead been placed in a \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial Needs Trust\xe2\x80\x9d under California law.  <em>Id.,</em> at 207, 214.  The kind of relief Great-West sought, therefore, was \xe2\x80\x9cnot equitable\xe2\x80\x94the imposition of a constructive trust or equitable lien on particular property\xe2\x80\x94but legal\xe2\x80\x94the imposition of personal liability for the benefits that [Great-West] conferred upon [Knudson].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 214.  We accordingly determined that the suit could not proceed under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That impediment to characterizing the relief in <em>Knudson </em>as equitable is not present here.  As the Fourth Circuit explained below, in this case Mid Atlantic sought \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically identifiable\xe2\x80\x9d funds that were \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the possession and control of the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that portion of the tort settlement due Mid Atlantic under the terms of the ERISA plan, set aside and \xe2\x80\x9cpreserved [in the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99] investment accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d  407 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>,</em> at 218.  Unlike Great-West, Mid Atlantic did not simply seek \xe2\x80\x9cto impose personal liability \xe2\x80\xa6 for a contractual obligation to pay money.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Knudson, </em>534 U. S.<em>,</em> at 210.  It alleged breach of contract and sought money, to be sure, but it sought its recovery through a constructive trust or equitable lien on a specifically identified fund, not from the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 assets generally, as would be the case with a contract action at law.  ERISA provides for equitable remedies <em>to enforce plan terms</em>, so the fact that the action involves a breach of contract can hardly be enough to prove relief is not equitable; that would make \xc2\xa7502(a)(3)(B)(ii) an empty promise.  This Court in <em>Knudson</em> did not reject Great-West\xe2\x80\x99s suit out of hand because it alleged a breach of contract and sought money, but because Great-West did not seek to recover a particular fund from the defendant.  Mid Atlantic does.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s case for characterizing its relief as equitable thus does not falter because of the nature of the recovery it seeks, Mid Atlantic must still establish that the basis for its claim is equitable.  See <em>id.,</em> at 213 (whether remedy \xe2\x80\x9cis legal or equitable depends on \xe2\x80\x98the basis for [the plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s] claim\xe2\x80\x99 and the nature of the underlying remedies sought\xe2\x80\x9d).  Our case law from the days of the divided bench confirms that Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s claim is equitable.  In <em>Barnes</em> v. <em>Alexander,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/232/117/index.html">232 U. S. 117</a> (1914), for instance, attorneys Street and Alexander performed work for Barnes, another attorney, who promised them \xe2\x80\x9cone-third of the contingent fee\xe2\x80\x9d he expected in the case.  <em>Id.,</em> at 119.  In upholding their equitable claim to this portion of the fee, Justice Holmes recited \xe2\x80\x9cthe familiar rul[e] of equity that a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 121.  On the basis of this rule, he concluded that Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 undertaking \xe2\x80\x9ccreate[d] a lien\xe2\x80\x9d upon the portion of the monetary recovery due Barnes from the client, <em>ibid.</em>, which Street and Alexander could \xe2\x80\x9cfollow \xe2\x80\xa6 into the hands of \xe2\x80\xa6 Barnes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as [the fund] was identified,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 123.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Much like Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 promise to Street and Alexander, the \xe2\x80\x9cActs of Third Parties\xe2\x80\x9d provision in the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 plan specifically identified a particular fund, distinct from the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 general assets\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll recoveries from a third party (whether by lawsuit, settlement, or otherwise)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and a particular share of that fund to which Mid Atlantic was entitled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat portion of the total recovery which is due [Mid Atlantic] for benefits paid.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a.  Like Street and Alexander in <em>Barnes</em>, therefore, Mid Atlantic could rely on a \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar rul[e] of equity\xe2\x80\x9d to collect for the medical bills it had paid on the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 behalf.  <em>Barnes</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 121.

S.<em>,</em> at 123.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sereboffs object that Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s suit would not have satisfied the conditions for \xe2\x80\x9cequitable restitution\xe2\x80\x9d at common law, particularly the \xe2\x80\x9cstrict tracing rules\xe2\x80\x9d that allegedly accompanied this form of relief.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 8.  When an equitable lien was imposed as restitutionary relief, it was often the case that an asset belonging to the plaintiff had been improperly acquired by the defendant and exchanged by him for other property.  A central requirement of equitable relief in these circumstances, the Sereboffs argue, was the plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s ability to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98trac[e]\xe2\x80\x99 the asset into its products or substitutes,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctrace his money or property to some particular funds or assets.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \xc2\xa74.3(2), pp. 591, n.\xc2\xa010, 592 (2d ed. 1993).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But as the Sereboffs themselves recognize, an equitable lien sought as a matter of restitution, and an equitable lien \xe2\x80\x9cby agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d of the sort at issue in <em>Barnes</em>, were different species of relief.  See Brief for Petitioners 24\xe2\x80\x9325; Reply Brief for Petitioners 11; see also 1 Dobbs, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa74.3(3), at 601; 1 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution \xc2\xa71.5, p.\xc2\xa020 (1978).  <em>Barnes </em>confirms that no tracing requirement of the sort asserted by the Sereboffs applies to equitable liens by agreement or assignment: The plaintiffs in <em>Barnes </em>could not identify an asset they originally possessed, which was improperly acquired and converted into property the defendant held, yet that did not preclude them from securing an equitable lien.  To the extent Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s action is proper under <em>Barnes</em>, therefore, its asserted inability to satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cstrict tracing rules\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cequit-\nable restitution\xe2\x80\x9d is of no consequence.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sereboffs concede as much, stating that they \xe2\x80\x9cdo not contend\xe2\x80\x94and have never suggested\xe2\x80\x94that any tracing was historically required when an equitable lien was imposed <em>by agreement</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 11.  Their argument is that such tracing was required when an equitable lien was \xe2\x80\x9cpredicated on a theory of <em>equitable restitution</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Sereboffs appear to assume that <em>Knudson</em> endorsed application of all the restitutionary conditions\xe2\x80\x94including restitutionary tracing rules\xe2\x80\x94to every action for an equitable lien under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).  This assumption is inaccurate.  <em>Knudson </em>simply described in general terms the conditions under which a fiduciary might recover when it was seeking equitable restitution under a provision like that at issue in this case.  There was no need in <em>Knudson </em>to catalog all the circumstances in which equitable liens were available in equity; Great-West claimed a right to recover in restitution, and the Court concluded only that equitable restitution was unavailable because the funds sought were not in Knudson\xe2\x80\x99s possession.  534 U. S.<em>,</em> at  214.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sereboffs argue that, even under <em>Barnes</em>, equitable relief would not have been available to fiduciaries relying on plan provisions like the one at issue here, because when the beneficiary agrees to such a provision \xe2\x80\x9cno third-party recovery\xe2\x80\x9d exists which the beneficiary can \xe2\x80\x9cplace \xe2\x80\xa6 beyond his control and grant [the fiduciary] a complete and present right therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It may be true that, in contract cases, equity originally required identification at the time the contract was made of the fund to which a lien specified in the contract attached.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Trist</em> v. <em>Child,</em> 21 Wall. 441, 447 (1875) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] mere agreement to pay out of such fund is not sufficient.  Something more is necessary.  There must be an appropriation of the fund <em>pro tanto</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  But <em>Barnes </em>explicitly disapproved of this rule, observing that <em>Trist </em>addressed the issue only in dicta (since the contract containing the lien provision in <em>Trist</em> was illegal), and treating the \xe2\x80\x9cquestion as at large,\xe2\x80\x9d even in light of earlier opinions that had dealt with it head on.  <em>Barnes</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 120 (citing <em>Trist</em>,<em> supra;</em> <em>Christmas</em> v. <em>Russell,</em> 14 Wall. 69 (1872); <em>Wright</em> v. <em>Ellison,</em> 1 Wall. 16 (1864)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from those cases, which <em>Barnes </em>discredited, the Sereboffs offer little to undermine the plain indication in <em>Barnes </em>that the fund over which a lien is asserted need not be in existence when the contract containing the lien provision is executed.  See 4 S. Symons, Pomeroy\xe2\x80\x99s Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa71236, pp. 699\xe2\x80\x93700 (5th ed. 1941) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n agreement to charge, or to assign \xe2\x80\xa6 property not yet in existence,\xe2\x80\x9d although \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[ing] no legal estate or interest in the things when they afterwards come into existence \xe2\x80\xa6 does constitute an equitable lien upon the property\xe2\x80\x9d just as would \xe2\x80\x9ca lien upon specific things existing and owned by the contracting party at the date of the contract\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Peugh</em> v. <em>Porter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/112/737/index.html">112 U. S. 737</a>, 742 (1885) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n contemplation of equity, [it] is not material\xe2\x80\x9d that the \xe2\x80\x9cvery fund now in dispute\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\xa6 in existence\xe2\x80\x9d when an equitable lien over that fund was created).  Indeed, the most they can muster in this regard are several state cases predating <em>Barnes</em> and a single decision that rests, contrary to the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 characterization, on the simple conclusion that a contractual provision purporting to secure an equitable lien did not properly do so.  See Brief for Petitioners 26; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12; <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Wharton</em>, 43 App. D.\xc2\xa0C. 104 (1915). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sereboffs finally fall back on the argument that <em>Barnes </em>announced a special rule for attorneys claiming an equitable lien over funds promised under a contingency fee arrangement.  Outside of this context, they say, the \xe2\x80\x9ctypical rules regarding equitable liens by assignment\xe2\x80\x9d persisted and would have prevented recovery here.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But <em>Barnes </em>did not attach any particular significance to the identity of the parties seeking recovery.  See 232 U. S.<em>,</em> at 119.  And as <em>Barnes </em>itself makes clear, other cases of this Court\xe2\x80\x94not involving attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 contingency fees\xe2\x80\x94apply the same \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar rul[e] of equity that a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 121.  In <em>Walker</em> v. <em>Brown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/654/index.html">165 U. S. 654</a> (1897), for instance, the Court approved an equitable lien over municipal bonds transferred to a company to facilitate its business.  When a supplier of the company suspended shipments because of delinquent debts, the individual who had transferred the bonds assured the supplier that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any indebtedness that they may be owing you at any time, shall be paid before the return to me of these bonds \xe2\x80\xa6 and that these bonds \xe2\x80\xa6 are at the risk of the business of [the company], so far as any claim you may have against [it].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 663.  The Court found that this undertaking created an equitable lien on the bonds, which the supplier could enforce against the individual after the bonds had been returned to him when the company became insolvent.  <em>Id.,</em> at 666.  As in <em>Barnes</em>, the Court resolved the case by applying general equitable principles, stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o dedicate property to a particular purpose, to provide that a specified creditor and that creditor alone shall be authorized to seek payment of his debt from the property or its value, is unmistakably to create an equitable lien.\xe2\x80\x9d  165 U. S., at 666.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shifting gears, the Sereboffs contend that the lower courts erred in allowing enforcement of the \xe2\x80\x9cActs of Third Parties\xe2\x80\x9d provision, without imposing various limitations that they say would apply to \xe2\x80\x9ctruly equitable relief grounded in principles of subrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioners 5.  According to the Sereboffs, they would in an equitable <em>subrogation</em> action be able to assert certain equitable defenses, such as the defense that subrogation may be pursued only after a victim had been made whole for his injuries.  <em>Id.,</em> at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Such defenses should be available against Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s action, the Sereboffs claim, despite the plan provision that \xe2\x80\x9c[Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s] share of the recovery will not be reduced because [the beneficiary] has not received the full damages claimed, unless [Mid Atlantic] agrees in writing to a reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s claim is not considered equitable because it is a subrogation claim.  As explained, Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s action to enforce the \xe2\x80\x9cActs of Third Parties\xe2\x80\x9d provision qualifies as an equitable remedy because it is indistinguishable from an action to enforce an equitable lien established by agreement, of the sort epitomized by our decision in <em>Barnes</em>.  See 4 Palmer, Law of Restitution \xc2\xa723.18<em>(d)</em>, at 470 (A subrogation lien \xe2\x80\x9cis not an express lien based on agreement, but instead is an equitable lien impressed on moneys on the ground that they ought to go to the insurer\xe2\x80\x9d).  Mid Atlantic need not characterize its claim as a freestanding action for equitable subrogation.  Accordingly, the parcel of equitable defenses the Sereboffs claim accompany any such action are beside the point.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the teaching of <em>Barnes</em> and similar cases, Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s action in the District Court properly sought \xe2\x80\x9cequitable relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3); the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is affirmed in relevant part.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Compare <em>Administrative Comm. of Wal-Mart Assoc.
