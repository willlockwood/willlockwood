As of April 11, 1979, the Alabama Supreme Court had not yet set a new execution date for John Louis Evans. </p><p> The above stated facts may make it unnecessary for the Court to rule on her application for a stay at its conference on Friday, April 13. Should the District Court grant her son\'s application for a stay of execution, the application for a stay before this Court would become moot. Applicant is aware that the temporary stay granted in this action expires at 5:00 p. m. on April 13, 1979. No harm will come to applicant by the expiration of the temporary stay since the Alabama Supreme Court has not yet set a new execution date for her son and, until such date is set, her son cannot be executed." </p><p> In view of the foregoing, it is apparent that there is now no need to grant the application. </p><p> Mr. Justice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of this application.[ Evans v.
