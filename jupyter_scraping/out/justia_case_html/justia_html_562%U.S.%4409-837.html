Those programs train doctors primarily through hands-on experience.  Although residents are required to take part in formal educational activities, these doctors generally spend the bulk of their time\xe2\x80\x94typically 50 to 80 hours a week\xe2\x80\x94caring for patients.  Mayo pays its residents annual \xe2\x80\x9cstipends\xe2\x80\x9d of over $40,000 and also provides them with health insurance, malpractice insurance, and paid vacation time.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) requires employees and employers to pay taxes on all \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d employees receive, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73101(a), 3111(a), and defines \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9call remuneration for employment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73121(a).  FICA defines \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany service \xe2\x80\xa6 performed \xe2\x80\xa6 by an employee for the person employing him,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73121(b), but excludes from taxation any \xe2\x80\x9cservice performed in the employ of \xe2\x80\xa6 a school, college, or university \xe2\x80\xa6 if such service is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at [the school],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73121(b)(10).  Since 1951, the Treasury Department has construed the student exception to exempt from taxation students who work for their schools \xe2\x80\x9cas an incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.\xe2\x80\x9d  16 Fed. Reg. 12474.  In 2004, the Department issued regulations providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he services of a full-time employee\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which includes an employee normally scheduled to work 40 hours or more per week\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9care not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 CFR \xc2\xa731.3121(b)(10)\xe2\x80\x932(d)(3)(iii).  The Department explained that this analysis \xe2\x80\x9cis not affected by the fact that the services \xe2\x80\xa6 may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The rule offers as an example a medical resident whose normal schedule requires him to perform services 40 or more hours per week, and concludes that the resident is not a student.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mayo filed suit asserting that this rule was invalid, and the District Court agreed.  It found the full-time employee rule inconsistent with \xc2\xa73121\xe2\x80\x99s unambiguous text and concluded that the factors governing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in <em>National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/472/index.html">440 U. S. 472</a>, also indicated that the rule was invalid.  The Eighth Circuit reversed.  Applying <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s regulation was a permissible interpretation of an ambiguous statute. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s full-time employee rule is a reasonable construction of \xc2\xa73121(b)(10).  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Under <em>Chevron</em>\xe2\x80\x99s two-part framework, the Court first asks whether Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly addressed the precise question at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U. S., at 842-843.  Congress has not done so here; the statute does not define \xe2\x80\x9cstudent\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise attend to the question whether medical residents are subject to FICA.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0 The parties debate whether the Court should next apply <em>Chevron </em>step two or the multi-factor analysis used to review a tax regulation<em> </em>in <em>National Muffler</em>.  Absent a justification to do so, this Court is not inclined to apply a less deferential framework to evaluate Treasury Department regulations than it uses to review rules adopted by any other agency.  The Court has \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of maintaining a uniform approach to judicial review of administrative action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dickinson</em> v. <em>Zurko</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/150/index.html">527 U. S. 150</a>, 154.  And the principles underlying <em>Chevron</em> apply with full force in the tax context.  <em>Chevron</em> recognized that an agency\xe2\x80\x99s power \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to administer a congressionally created \xe2\x80\xa6 program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left \xe2\x80\xa6 by Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U. S., at 843.  Filling gaps in the Internal Revenue Code plainly requires the Treasury Department to make interpretive choices for statutory implementation at least as complex as the ones made by other agencies in administering their statutes. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that the full-time employee rule, like the rule at issue in <em>National Muffler,</em> was promulgated under the Department\xe2\x80\x99s general authority to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of the Internal Revenue Code.  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77805(a).  It is also true that this Court, in opinions predating <em>Chevron, </em>stated that it owed less deference to a rule adopted under that general grant of authority than it would afford rules issued pursuant to more specific grants.  See <em>Rowan Cos.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/247/index.html">452 U. S. 247</a>, 253; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Vogel Fertilizer Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/16/index.html">455 U. S. 16</a>, 24.  Since then<em>,</em> however, the Court has found <em>Chevron</em> deference appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 226\xe2\x80\x93227.  <em>Chevron</em> and <em>Mead</em> provide the appropriate framework for evaluating the full-time employee rule.  The Department issued the rule pursuant to an explicit authorization to prescribe needful rules and regulations, and only after notice-and-comment procedures.  The Court has recognized these to be good indicators of a rule meriting <em>Chevron </em>deference, <em>Mead</em>, 533 U. S., at 229\xe2\x80\x93231.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The rule easily satisfies <em>Chevron</em>\xe2\x80\x99s second step.<em> </em>Mayo accepts the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s determination that an individual may not qualify for the student exception unless the educational aspect of his relationship with his employer predominates over the service aspect of that relationship, but objects to the Department\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that residents working more than 40 hours per week categorically cannot satisfy that requirement.  Mayo argues that the Treasury Department should be required to engage in a case-by-case inquiry into what each employee does and why he does it, and that the Department has arbitrarily distinguished between hands-on training and classroom instruction.  But regulation, like legislation, often requires drawing lines.  The Department reasonably sought to distinguish between workers who study and students who work.  Focusing on the hours spent working and those spent in studies is a sensible way to accomplish that goal.  The Department thus has drawn a distinction between education and service, not between classroom instruction and hands-on training.  The Treasury Department also reasonably concluded that its full-time employee rule would \xe2\x80\x9cimprove administrability,\xe2\x80\x9d 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, and thereby \xe2\x80\x9chas avoided the wasteful litigation and continuing uncertainty that would inevitably accompany [a] case-by-case approach\xe2\x80\x9d like the one Mayo advocates, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Correll</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/299/index.html">389 U. S. 299</a>, 302.  Moreover, the rule reasonably takes into account the Social Security Administration\xe2\x80\x99s concern that exempting residents from FICA would deprive them and their families of vital social security disability and survivorship benefits.

The question presented in this case is whether doctors who serve as medical residents are properly viewed as \xe2\x80\x9cstudent[s]\xe2\x80\x9d whose service Congress has exempted from FICA taxes under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73121(b)(10).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most doctors who graduate from medical school in the United States pursue additional education in a specialty to become board certified to practice in that field.  Petitioners Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Mayo Clinic, and the Regents of the University of Minnesota (collectively Mayo) offer medical residency programs that provide such instruction.  Mayo\xe2\x80\x99s residency programs, which usually last three to five years, train doctors primarily through hands-on experience.  Residents often spend between 50 and 80 hours a week caring for patients, typically examining and diagnosing them, prescribing medication, recommending plans of care, and performing certain procedures.  Residents are generally supervised in this work by more senior residents and by faculty members known as attending physicians.  In 2005, Mayo paid its residents annual \xe2\x80\x9cstipends\xe2\x80\x9d ranging between $41,000 and $56,000 and provided them with health insurance, malpractice insurance, and paid vacation time.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mayo residents also take part in \xe2\x80\x9ca formal and structured educational program.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 5 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Residents are assigned textbooks and journal articles to read and are expected to attend weekly lectures and other conferences.  Residents also take written exams and are evaluated by the attending faculty physicians.  But the parties do not dispute that the bulk of residents\xe2\x80\x99 time is spent caring for patients.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Through the Social Security Act and related legislation, Congress has created a comprehensive national insurance system that provides benefits for retired workers, disabled workers, unemployed workers, and their families.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/252/index.html">455 U. S. 252</a>, 254, 258, and nn.\xc2\xa01, 7 (1982).  Congress funds Social Security by taxing both employers and employees under FICA on the wages employees earn.  See 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73101(a) (tax on employees); \xc2\xa73111(a) (tax on employers).  Congress has defined \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d broadly, to encompass \xe2\x80\x9call remuneration for employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73121(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. III).  The term \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d has a similarly broad reach, extending to \xe2\x80\x9cany service, of whatever nature, performed \xe2\x80\xa6 by an employee for the person employing him.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73121(b).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress has, however, exempted certain categories of service and individuals from FICA\xe2\x80\x99s demands.  As relevant here, Congress has excluded from taxation \xe2\x80\x9cservice performed in the employ of \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0 a school, college, or university \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0 if such service is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at such school, college, or university.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73121(b)(10) (2006 ed.).  The Social Security Act, which governs workers\xe2\x80\x99 eligibility for benefits, contains a corresponding student exception materially identical to \xc2\xa73121(b)(10).  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7410(a)(10).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since 1951, the Treasury Department has applied the student exception to exempt from taxation students who work for their schools \xe2\x80\x9cas an incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study\xe2\x80\x9d there.  16 Fed. Reg. 12474 (adopting Treas. Regs. 127, \xc2\xa7408.219(c)); see Treas. Reg. \xc2\xa731.3121(b)(10)\xe2\x80\x932(d), 26 CFR \xc2\xa731.3121(b)(10)\xe2\x80\x932(d) (2010).  Until 2005, the Department determined whether an individual\xe2\x80\x99s work was \xe2\x80\x9cincident to\xe2\x80\x9d his studies by performing a case-by-case analysis.  The primary considerations in that analysis were the number of hours worked and the course load taken.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Rev. Rul. 78\xe2\x80\x9317, 1978\xe2\x80\x931 Cum.\xc2\xa0Bull. 307 (services of individual \xe2\x80\x9cemployed on a full-time basis\xe2\x80\x9d with a part-time course load are \xe2\x80\x9cnot incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For its part, the Social Security Administration (SSA) also articulated in its regulations a case-by-case approach to the corresponding student exception in the Social Security Act.  See 20 CFR \xc2\xa7404.1028(c) (1998).  The SSA has, however, \xe2\x80\x9calways held that resident physicians are not students.\xe2\x80\x9d  SSR 78\xe2\x80\x933, 1978 Cum. Bull. 55\xe2\x80\x9356.  In 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the SSA could not categorically exclude residents from student status, given that its regulations provided for a case-by-case approach.  See <em>Minnesota</em> v. <em>Apfel</em>, 151 F.\xc2\xa03d 742, 747\xe2\x80\x93748.  Following that decision, the Internal Revenue Service received more than 7,000 claims seeking FICA tax refunds on the ground that medical residents qualified as students under \xc2\xa73121(b)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code.  568 F.\xc2\xa03d 675, 677 (CA8 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Facing that flood of claims, the Treasury Department \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined that it [wa]s necessary to provide additional clarification of the ter[m]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstudent\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa73121(b)(10), particularly with respect to individuals who perform \xe2\x80\x9cservices that are in the nature of on the job training.\xe2\x80\x9d  69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (2004).  The Department proposed an amended rule for comment and held a public hearing on it.  See <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 76405.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December 21, 2004, the Department adopted an amended rule prescribing that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s service is \xe2\x80\x9cincident\xe2\x80\x9d to his studies only when \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he educational aspect of the relationship between the employer and the employee, as compared to the service aspect of the relationship, [is] predominant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 76408; Treas.

The rule categorically provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he services of a full-time employee\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as defined by the employer\xe2\x80\x99s policies, but in any event including any employee normally scheduled to work 40 hours or more per week\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9care not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.\xe2\x80\x9d  69 Fed. Reg. 76408; Treas. Reg. \xc2\xa731.3121(b)(10)\xe2\x80\x932(d)(3)(iii), 26 CFR \xc2\xa731.3121(b)(10)\xe2\x80\x932(d)(3)(iii) (the full-time employee rule).  The amended provision clarifies that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s analysis \xe2\x80\x9cis not affected by the fact that the services performed \xe2\x80\xa6 may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The rule also includes as an example the case of \xe2\x80\x9cEmployee E,\xe2\x80\x9d who is employed by \xe2\x80\x9cUniversity V\xe2\x80\x9d as a medical resident.  69 Fed.

Because Employee E\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnormal work schedule calls for [him] to perform services 40 or more hours per week,\xe2\x80\x9d the rule provides that his service is \xe2\x80\x9cnot incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study,\xe2\x80\x9d and he accordingly is not an exempt \xe2\x80\x9cstudent\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa73121(b)(10).  69 Fed.

The statute does not define the term \xe2\x80\x9cstudent,\xe2\x80\x9d and does not otherwise attend to the precise question whether medical residents are subject to FICA.  See 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73121(b)(10).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mayo nonetheless contends that the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s full-time employee rule must be rejected under <em>Chevron</em> step one.  Mayo argues that the dictionary definition of \xe2\x80\x9cstudent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94one \xe2\x80\x9cwho engages in \xe2\x80\x98study\xe2\x80\x99 by applying the mind \xe2\x80\x98to the acquisition of learning, whether by means of books, observation, or experiment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94plainly encompasses residents.  Brief for Petitioners 22 (quoting Oxford Universal Dictionary 2049\xe2\x80\x932050 (3d ed. 1955)).  And, Mayo adds, residents are not excluded from that category by the only limitation on students Congress has imposed under the statute\xe2\x80\x94that they \xe2\x80\x9cbe \xe2\x80\x98enrolled and regularly attending classes at [a] school.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 22 (quoting 26 U.

In its reply brief, Mayo acknowledges that a full-time professor taking evening classes\xe2\x80\x94a person who presumably would satisfy the statute\xe2\x80\x99s class-enrollment requirement and apply his mind to learning\xe2\x80\x94could be excluded from the exemption and taxed because he is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98predominant[ly]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a student.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 7.  Medical residents might likewise be excluded on the same basis; the statute itself does not resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court interpreted \xc2\xa73121(b)(10) as unambiguously foreclosing the Department\xe2\x80\x99s rule by mandating that an employee be deemed \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98student\xe2\x80\x99 so long as the educational aspect of his service predominates over the service aspect of the relationship with his employer.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1175.  We do not think it possible to glean so much from the little that \xc2\xa73121 provides.  In any event, the statutory text still would offer no insight into how Congress intended predominance to be determined or whether Congress thought that medical residents would satisfy the requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent Congress has specifically addressed medical residents in \xc2\xa73121, moreover, it has expressly excluded these doctors from exemptions they might otherwise invoke.  See 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73121(b)(6)(B), (7)(C)(ii) (excluding medical residents from exemptions available to employees of the District of Columbia and the United States).

In this case, however, the parties disagree over the proper framework for evaluating an ambiguous provision of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mayo asks us to apply the multi-factor analysis we used to review a tax regulation in <em>National Muffler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/472/index.html"></a><a href="/us/440/472/index.html">440 U. S. 472</a>.  There we explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA regulation may have particular force if it is a substantially contemporaneous construction of the statute by those presumed to have been aware of congressional intent.  If the regulation dates from a later period, the manner in which it evolved merits inquiry.  Other relevant considerations are the length of time the regulation has been in effect, the reliance placed on it, the consistency of the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, and the degree of scrutiny Congress has\ndevoted to the regulation during subsequent re-enactments of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 477.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Government, on the other hand, contends that the <em>National Muffler</em> standard has been superseded by <em>Chevron</em>.  The sole question for the Court at step two under the <em>Chevron</em> analysis is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the agency\xe2\x80\x99s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U. S., at 843.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since deciding <em>Chevron</em>, we have cited both <em>National Muffler</em> and <em>Chevron</em> in our review of Treasury Department regulations.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/200/index.html">532 U. S. 200</a>, 219 (2001) (citing <em>National Muffler</em>); <em>Cottage Savings Assn.</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/554/index.html">499 U.

S. 382</a>, 387, 389 (1998) (citing <em>Chevron</em> and <em>Cottage Savings</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we have not thus far distinguished between<em> National Muffler</em> and <em>Chevron</em>, they call for different analyses of an ambiguous statute.  Under <em>National Muffler</em>, for example, a court might view an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of a statute with heightened skepticism when it has not been consistent over time, when it was promulgated years after the relevant statute was enacted, or because of the way in which the regulation evolved.  440 U. S., at 477.  The District Court in this case cited each of these factors in rejecting the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s rule, noting in particular that the regulation had been promulgated after an adverse judicial decision.  See 503 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1176; see also Brief for Petitioners 41\xe2\x80\x9344 (relying on the same considerations).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under <em>Chevron</em>, in contrast, deference to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of an ambiguous statute does not turn on such considerations.  We have repeatedly held that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]gency inconsistency is not a basis for declining to analyze the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation under the <em>Chevron</em> framework.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U. S. 967</a>, 981 (2005); accord, <em>Eurodif S.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 10).  We have instructed that \xe2\x80\x9cneither antiquity nor contemporaneity with [a] statute is a condition of [a regulation\xe2\x80\x99s] validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smiley</em> v. <em>Citibank (South Dakota), N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/735/index.html">517 U.

Indeed, in <em>United Dominion Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/822/index.html">532 U. S. 822</a>, 838 (2001), we expressly invited the Treasury Department to \xe2\x80\x9camend its regulations\xe2\x80\x9d if troubled by the consequences of our resolution of the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Aside from our past citation of <em>National Muffler</em>, Mayo has not advanced any justification for applying a less deferential standard of review to Treasury Department regulations than we apply to the rules of any other agency.  In the absence of such justification, we are not inclined\nto carve out an approach to administrative review good\nfor tax law only.  To the contrary, we have expressly \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ecogniz[ed] the importance of maintaining a uniform approach to judicial review of administrative action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dickinson</em> v. <em>Zurko</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/150/index.html">527 U. S. 150</a>, 154 (1999).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Skinner</em> v. <em>Mid-America Pipeline Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/212/index.html">490 U. S. 212</a>, 222\xe2\x80\x93223 (1989) (declining to apply \xe2\x80\x9ca different and stricter nondelegation doctrine in cases where Congress delegates discretionary authority to the Executive under its taxing power\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principles underlying our decision in <em>Chevron</em> apply with full force in the tax context.  <em>Chevron</em> recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created \xe2\x80\xa6 program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U. S., at 843 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It acknowledged that the formulation of that policy might require \xe2\x80\x9cmore than ordinary knowledge respecting the matters subjected to agency regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 844 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Filling gaps in the Internal Revenue Code plainly requires the Treasury Department to make interpretive choices for statutory implementation at least as complex as the ones other agencies must make in administering their statutes.  Cf. <em>Bob Jones Univ.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/574/index.html">461 U. S. 574</a>, 596 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n an area as complex as the tax system, the agency Congress vests with administrative responsibility must be able to exercise its authority to meet changing conditions and new problems\xe2\x80\x9d).  We see no reason why our review of tax regulations should not be guided by agency expertise pursuant to <em>Chevron </em>to the same extent as our review of other regulations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As one of Mayo\xe2\x80\x99s <em>amici</em> points out, however, both the full-time employee rule and the rule at issue in <em>National Muffler</em> were promulgated pursuant to the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s general authority under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77805(a) to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of the Internal Revenue Code.  See Brief for Carlton M. Smith 4\xe2\x80\x937.  In two decisions predating <em>Chevron</em>, this Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9cwe owe the [Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s] interpretation less deference\xe2\x80\x9d when it is contained in a rule adopted under that \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral authority\xe2\x80\x9d than when it is \xe2\x80\x9cissued under a specific grant of authority to define a statutory term or prescribe a method of executing a statutory provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rowan Cos.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/247/index.html">452 U.

S. 16</a>, 24 (1982) (quoting <em>Rowan</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since <em>Rowan </em>and <em>Vogel </em>were decided, however, the administrative landscape has changed significantly.  We have held that <em>Chevron</em> deference is appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mead</em>, 533 U. S., at 226\xe2\x80\x93227.  Our inquiry in that regard does not turn on whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99s delegation of authority was general or specific.  For example, in <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em>, <em>supra,</em> we held that the Federal Communications Commission was delegated \xe2\x80\x9cthe authority to promulgate binding legal rules\xe2\x80\x9d entitled to <em>Chevron</em> deference under statutes that gave the Commission \xe2\x80\x9cthe authority to \xe2\x80\x98execute and enforce,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto \xe2\x80\x98prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions\xe2\x80\x99 of,\xe2\x80\x9d the Communications Act of 1934.  545 U. S.<em>,</em> at 980\xe2\x80\x93981 (quoting 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7151, 201(b)).  See also <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Everhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/83/index.html">494 U.

The Department issued the full-time employee rule pursuant to the explicit authorization to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of the Internal Revenue Code.   26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77805(a).  We have found such \xe2\x80\x9cexpress congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9ca very good indicator of delegation meriting <em>Chevron</em> treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mead</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 229.  The Department issued the full-time employee rule only after notice-and-comment procedures, 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, again a consideration identified in our precedents as a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d sign that a rule merits <em>Chevron</em> deference.  <em>Mead</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 230\xe2\x80\x93231; see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Long Island Care at Home, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Coke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/158/index.html">551 U. S. 158</a>, 173\xe2\x80\x93174 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate question is whether Congress would have intended, and expected, courts to treat [the regulation] as within, or outside, its delegation to the agency of \xe2\x80\x98gap-filling\xe2\x80\x99 authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).  In the <em>Long Island Care</em> case, we found that <em>Chevron </em>provided the appropriate standard of review \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here an agency rule sets forth important individual rights and duties, where the agency focuses fully and directly upon the issue, where the agency uses full notice-and-comment procedures to promulgate a rule, [and] where the resulting rule falls within the statutory grant of authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U. S.<em>,</em> at 173.  These same considerations point to the same result here.  This case falls squarely within the bounds of, and is properly analyzed under, <em>Chevron </em>and <em>Mead</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The full-time employee rule easily satisfies the second step of <em>Chevron</em>, which asks whether the Department\xe2\x80\x99s rule is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of the enacted text.  467 U. S., at 844.  To begin, Mayo accepts that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98educational aspect of the relationship between the employer and the employee, as compared to the service aspect of the relationship, [must] be predominant\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in order for an individual to qualify for the exemption.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 6\xe2\x80\x937 (quoting Treas. Reg. \xc2\xa731.3121(b)(10)\xe2\x80\x932(d)(3)(i), 26 CFR \xc2\xa731.3121(b)(10)\xe2\x80\x932(d)(3)(i)).  Mayo objects, however, to the Department\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that residents who work more than 40 hours per week categorically cannot satisfy that requirement.  Because residents\xe2\x80\x99 employment is itself educational, Mayo argues, the hours a resident spends working make him \xe2\x80\x9cmore of a student, not less of one.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, n.\xc2\xa03 (emphasis deleted).  Mayo contends that the Treasury Department should be required to engage in a case-by-case inquiry into \xe2\x80\x9c<em>what </em>[each] employee does [in his service] and <em>why</em>\xe2\x80\x9d he does it.  <em>Id.,</em> at 7.  Mayo also objects that the Department has drawn an arbitrary distinction between \xe2\x80\x9chands-on training\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cclassroom instruction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 35.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree.  Regulation, like legislation, often requires drawing lines.  Mayo does not dispute that the Treasury Department reasonably sought a way to distinguish between workers who study and students who work, see IRS Letter Ruling 9332005 (May 3, 1993).  Focusing on the hours an individual works and the hours he spends in studies is a perfectly sensible way of accomplishing that goal.  The Department explained that an individual\xe2\x80\x99s service and his \xe2\x80\x9ccourse of study are separate and distinct activities\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cthe vast majority of cases,\xe2\x80\x9d and reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]mployees who are working enough hours to be considered full-time employees . . . have filled the conventional measure of available time with work, and not study.\xe2\x80\x9d  69 Fed. Reg. 8607.  The Department thus did not distinguish classroom education from clinical training but rather education from service.  The Department reasonably concluded that its full-time employee rule would \xe2\x80\x9cimprove administrability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 76405, and it thereby \xe2\x80\x9chas avoided the wasteful litigation and continuing uncertainty that would inevitably accompany any purely case-by-case approach\xe2\x80\x9d like the one Mayo advocates, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Correll</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/299/index.html">389 U. S. 299</a>, 302 (1967).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Treasury Department has explained, moreover, the full-time employee rule has more to recommend it than administrative convenience.  The Department reasonably determined that taxing residents under FICA would further the purpose of the Social Security Act and comport with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  As the Treasury Department appreciated, this Court has understood the terms of the Social Security Act to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98import a breadth of coverage,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (quoting <em>Social Security Bd.</em> v. <em>Nierotko</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/358/index.html">327 U. S. 358</a>, 365 (1946)), and we have instructed that \xe2\x80\x9cexemptions from taxation are to be construed narrowly,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bingler</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/741/index.html">394 U.

Although Mayo contends that medical residents have not yet begun their \xe2\x80\x9cworking lives\xe2\x80\x9d because they are not \xe2\x80\x9cfully trained,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief for Petitioners 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwho work long hours, serve as highly skilled professionals, and typically share some or all of the terms of employment of career employees\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute to and benefit from the Social Security system.  69 Fed.

Mayo wonders whether the full-time employee rule will result in residents being taxed under FICA but denied coverage by the SSA.  The Government informs us, however, that the SSA continues to adhere to its longstanding position that medical residents are not students and thus remain eligible for coverage.
