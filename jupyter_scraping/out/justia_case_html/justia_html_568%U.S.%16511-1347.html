The International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA) implements the Convention in the United States, granting federal and state courts concurrent jurisdiction over Convention actions and directing those courts to decide cases in accordance with the Convention.  ICARA also requires defendants to pay various expenses incurred by plaintiffs associated with the return of children.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Mr. Chafin, a United States citizen and member of the military, married respondent Ms. Chafin, a United Kingdom citizen, in Germany, where they later had a daughter, E.\xc2\xa0C.  When Mr. Chafin was deployed to Afghanistan, Ms. Chafin took E.\xc2\xa0C. to Scotland.  Mr. Chafin was later transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and Ms. Chafin eventually traveled there with E.\xc2\xa0C.  Soon after Ms. Chafin\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, Mr. Chafin filed for divorce and child custody in Alabama.  Ms. Chafin was subsequently deported, but E.\xc2\xa0C. remained in Alabama with Mr. Chafin.  Several months later, Ms. Chafin filed a petition under the Convention and ICARA, seeking E.\xc2\xa0C.\xe2\x80\x99s return to Scotland.  The District Court concluded that E.\xc2\xa0C.\xe2\x80\x99s country of habitual residence was Scotland and granted the petition for return.  Ms. Chafin immediately departed for Scotland with E.\xc2\xa0C.  Ms. Chafin then initiated custody proceedings in Scotland and was granted interim custody and a preliminary injunction prohibiting Mr. Chafin from removing E.\xc2\xa0C. from Scotland.  Mr. Chafin appealed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order, but the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot, on the ground that once a child has been returned to a foreign country, a U.\xc2\xa0S. court becomes powerless to grant relief.

The question is whether such relief would be effectual.  In arguing that this case is moot because the District Court has no authority to issue a re-return order either under the Convention or pursuant to its inherent equitable powers, Ms. Chafin confuses mootness with the merits.  See, e.g., Powell v. McCormack, \n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 486\n.  Mr. Chafin\xe2\x80\x99s claim for re-return cannot be dismissed as so implausible that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction, and his prospects of success are therefore not pertinent to the mootness inquiry.  As to the effectiveness of any relief, even if Scotland were to ignore a re-return order, this case would not be moot.  The U.\xc2\xa0S. courts continue to have personal jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin and may command her to take action under threat of sanctions.  She could decide to comply with an order against her and return E.\xc2\xa0C. to the United States.  Enforcement of the order may be uncertain if Ms. Chafin chooses to defy it, but such uncertainty does not typically render cases moot.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0Mr. Chafin also seeks, if he prevails, vacatur of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s expense orders.  That too is common relief on appeal, and the mootness inquiry comes down to its effectiveness.  In contending that this case is moot due to Mr. Chafin\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pursue an appeal of the expense orders, which were entered as separate judgments, Ms. Chafin again confuses mootness with the merits.  Because there is authority for the proposition that failure to appeal such judgments separately does not preclude relief, it is for lower courts at later stages of the litigation to decide whether Mr. Chafin is in fact entitled to the relief he seeks.  That relief would not be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fully satisfactory,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9ceven the availability of a \xe2\x80\x98partial remedy\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98sufficient to prevent [a] case from being moot,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Calderon v.

If these cases were to become moot upon return, courts would be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course, to prevent the loss of any right to appeal.  Such routine stays would conflict with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s mandate of prompt return.  Courts should instead apply traditional factors in considering whether to stay a return order, see, e.g., Nken v. Holder, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 418\n, thus ensuring that each case will receive the individualized treatment necessary for appropriate consideration of the child\xe2\x80\x99s best interests.  Finally, at both the district and appellate court level, courts should take steps to decide these cases as expeditiously as possible.

Soon thereafter, however, Mr. Chafin filed for divorce and for child custody in Alabama state court.  Towards the end of the year, Ms. Chafin was arrested for domestic violence, an incident that alerted U.\xc2\xa0S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to the fact that she had overstayed her visa.

Mr. Chafin immediately moved for a stay pending appeal, but the court denied his request.  Within hours, Ms. Chafin left the country with E.\xc2\xa0C., headed for Scotland.  By December 2011, she had initiated custody proceedings there.

Mr. Chafin also argues that even if E.\xc2\xa0C.\xe2\x80\x99s habitual residence was Scotland, she should not have been returned because the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s defenses to return apply.  Mr. Chafin seeks custody of E.\xc2\xa0C., and wants to pursue that relief in the United States, while Ms. Chafin is pursuing that right for herself in Scotland.  And Mr. Chafin wants the orders that he pay Ms. Chafin over $94,000 vacated, while Ms. Chafin asserts the money is rightfully owed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn many levels, the Chafins continue to vigorously contest the question of where their daughter will be raised.

In short, Mr. Chafin is asking for typical appellate relief: that the Court of Appeals reverse the District Court and that the District Court undo what it has done.  See Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., \n\n249 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134\n\xe2\x80\x93146 (1919); Northwestern Fuel Co. v.

The question is whether such relief would be effectual in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMs. Chafin argues that this case is moot because the District Court lacks the authority to issue a re-return order either under the Convention or pursuant to its in- herent equitable powers.  But that argument\xe2\x80\x94which goes to the meaning of the Convention and the legal availability of a certain kind of relief\xe2\x80\x94confuses mootness with the merits.  In Powell v. McCormack, \n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 486 (1969)\n, this Court held that a claim for backpay saved the case from mootness, even though the defendants argued that the backpay claim had been brought in the wrong court and therefore could not result in relief.  As the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthis argument .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. confuses mootness with whether [the plaintiff] has established a right to recover .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , a question which it is inappropriate to treat at this stage of the litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 500.  Mr. Chafin\xe2\x80\x99s claim for re-return\xe2\x80\x94under the Convention itself or according to general equitable principles\xe2\x80\x94cannot be dismissed as so implausible that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction, see Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83, \n89 (1998)\n, and his prospects of success are therefore not pertinent to the mootness inquiry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs to the effectiveness of any relief, Ms. Chafin asserts that even if the habitual residence ruling were reversed and the District Court were to issue a re-return order, that relief would be ineffectual because Scotland would simply ignore it.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But even if Scotland were to ignore a U.\xc2\xa0S. re-return order, or decline to assist in enforcing it, this case would not be moot.  The U.\xc2\xa0S. courts continue to have personal jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin, may command her to take action even outside the United States, and may back up any such command with sanctions.  See Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., \n\n344 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280, \n289 (1952)\n; cf. Leman v. Krentler-Arnold Hinge Last Co., \n\n284 U.\xc2\xa0S. 448\n\xe2\x80\x93452 (1932).  No law of physics prevents E.\xc2\xa0C.\xe2\x80\x99s return from Scotland, see Fawcett v. McRoberts, 326 F.\xc2\xa03d 491, 496 (CA4 2003), abrogated on other grounds by Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2010), and Ms. Chafin might decide to comply with an order against her and return E.\xc2\xa0C. to the United States, see, e.g., Larbie v. Larbie, 690 F.\xc2\xa03d 295, 303\xe2\x80\x93304 (CA5 2012) (mother who had taken child to United Kingdom complied with Texas court sanctions order and order to return child to United States for trial), cert. pending, No. 12\xe2\x80\x93304.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  After all, the consequence of compliance presumably would not be relinquishment of custody rights, but simply custody proceedings in a different forum.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEnforcement of the order may be uncertain if Ms. Cha- fin chooses to defy it, but such uncertainty does not typically render cases moot.  Courts often adjudicate disputes where the practical impact of any decision is not assured.  For example, courts issue default judgments against defendants who failed to appear or participate in the proceedings and therefore seem less likely to comply.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 55.  Similarly, the fact that a defendant is insolvent does not moot a claim for damages.  See 13C C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa73533.3, p. 3 (3d ed. 2008) (cases not moot \xe2\x80\x9ceven though the defendant does not seem able to pay any portion of the damages claimed\xe2\x80\x9d).  Courts also decide cases against foreign nations, whose choices to respect final rulings are not guaranteed.  See, e.g., Republic of Austria v. Altmann, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677 (2004)\n (suit against Austria for return of paintings); Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., \n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 607 (1992)\n (suit against Argentina for repayment of bonds).  And we have heard the Government\xe2\x80\x99s appeal from the reversal of a conviction, even though the defendants had been deported, reducing the practical impact of any decision; we concluded that the case was not moot because the defendants might \xe2\x80\x9cre-enter this country on their own\xe2\x80\x9d and encounter the consequences of our ruling.

A re-return order may not result in the return of E.\xc2\xa0C. to the United States, just as an order that an insolvent defendant pay $100 million may not make the plaintiff rich.  But it cannot be said that the parties here have no \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete interest\xe2\x80\x9d in whether Mr. Chafin secures a re-return order.

The District Court ordered Mr. Chafin to pay Ms. Chafin over $94,000 in court costs, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and travel expenses.  See Civ. No. 11\xe2\x80\x931461 (ND Ala., Mar. 7, 2012), pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9316; Civ. No. 11\xe2\x80\x931461 (ND Ala., June 5, 2012), p. 2.  That award was predicated on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier judgment allowing Ms. Chafin to return with her daughter to Scotland.  See Civ. No. 11\xe2\x80\x931461 (ND Ala., Mar. 7, 2012), pp. 2\xe2\x80\x933, and n.\xc2\xa02.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Thus, in conjunction with reversal of the judgment, Mr. Chafin desires vacatur of the award.  That too is common relief on appeal, see, e.g., Fawcett, supra, at 501, n.\xc2\xa06 (reversing costs and fees award when reversing on the issue of wrongful removal), and the mootness inquiry comes down to its effectiveness.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt oral argument, Ms. Chafin contended that such relief was \xe2\x80\x9cgone in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the case was therefore moot, because Mr. Chafin had failed to pursue an appeal of the expense orders, which had been entered as separate judgments.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; see Civ. No. 11\xe2\x80\x931461 (ND Ala., Mar. 7, 2012); Civ. No. 11\xe2\x80\x931461 (ND Ala., June 5, 2012).  But this is another argument on the merits.  Mr. Chafin\xe2\x80\x99s requested relief is not so implausible that it may be disregarded on the question of jurisdiction; there is authority for the proposition that failure to appeal such judgments separately does not preclude relief.  See 15B Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, supra, \xc2\xa73915.6, at 230, and n. 39.5 (2d ed., Supp. 2012) (citing cases).  It is thus for lower courts at later stages of the litigation to decide whether Mr. Chafin is in fact entitled to the relief he seeks\xe2\x80\x94vacatur of the expense orders.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSuch relief would of course not be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fully satisfactory,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but with respect to the case as whole, \xe2\x80\x9ceven the availability of a \xe2\x80\x98partial remedy\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98sufficient to prevent [a] case from being moot.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Calderon v.

We are also sympathetic to the concern that shuttling children back and forth between parents and across international borders may be detrimental to those children.  But courts can achieve the ends of the Convention and ICARA\xe2\x80\x94and protect the well-being of the affected children\xe2\x80\x94through the familiar judicial tools of expediting proceedings and granting stays where appropriate.  There is no need to manipulate constitutional doctrine and hold these cases moot.  Indeed, doing so may very well undermine the goals of the treaty and harm the children it is meant to protect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf these cases were to become moot upon return, courts would be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course, to prevent the loss of any right to appeal.  See, e.g., Garrison v. Hudson, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1301, \n1302 (1984)\n (Burger, C.\xc2\xa0J., in chambers) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the normal course of appellate review might otherwise cause the case to become moot, issuance of a stay is warranted\xe2\x80\x9d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); Nicolson v.

In cases in which a stay would not be granted but for the prospect of mootness, a child would lose precious months when she could have been readjusting to life in her country of habitual residence, even though the appeal had little chance of success.  Such routine stays due to mootness would be likely but would conflict with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s mandate of prompt return to a child\xe2\x80\x99s country of habitual residence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRoutine stays could also increase the number of appeals.

If losing parents were effectively guaranteed a stay, it seems likely that more would appeal, a scenario that would undermine the goal of prompt return and the best interests of children who should in fact be returned.  A mootness holding here might also encourage flight in future Hague Convention cases, as prevailing parents try to flee the jurisdiction to moot the case.  See Bekier, 248 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1055 (mootness holding \xe2\x80\x9cto some degree conflicts with the purposes of the Convention: to prevent parents from fleeing jurisdictions to find a more favorable judicial forum\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCourts should apply the four traditional stay factors in considering whether to stay a return order: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Nken v.

In every case under the Hague Convention, the well-being of a child is at stake; application of the traditional stay factors ensures that each case will receive the individualized treatment necessary for appropriate consideration of the child\xe2\x80\x99s best interests.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tImportantly, whether at the district or appellate court level, courts can and should take steps to decide these cases as expeditiously as possible, for the sake of the children who find themselves in such an unfortunate situation.  Many courts already do so.  See Federal Judicial Center, J. Garbolino, The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction: A Guide for Judges 116, n. 435 (2012) (listing courts that expedite appeals).  Cases in American courts often take over two years from filing to resolution; for a six-year-old such as E.\xc2\xa0C., that is one-third of her lifetime.

A reversal, as opposed to vacatur, of the earlier ruling could change the prevailing party calculus and afford Mr. Chafin effective relief.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970557">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 11\xe2\x80\x931347\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY LEE CHAFIN, PETITIONER v.

See Convention, Oct. 25, 1980, T. I. A. S. No. 11670, Arts.\xc2\xa01, 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\xe2\x80\x9311, p.\xc2\xa07 (Treaty Doc.).  To that end, the Convention instructs Contracting States to use \xe2\x80\x9cthe most expeditious procedures available\xe2\x80\x9d to secure the return of a child wrongfully removed or retained away from her place of habitual residence.  Art. 2, ibid.; see Art. 11, id., at 9 (indicating six weeks as the target time for decision of a return-order petition); Hague Conference on Private International Law, Guide to Good Practice Under the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Part I\xe2\x80\x93Central Authority Practice, \xc2\xa71.5.1, p. 19 (2010) (Guide to Good Practice) (\xe2\x80\x9cExpeditious procedures are essential at all stages of the Convention process.\xe2\x80\x9d).  While \xe2\x80\x9c[the] obligation to process return applications expeditiously . . . extends to appeal procedures,\xe2\x80\x9d id., Part IV\xe2\x80\x93Enforcement, \xc2\xa72.2, \xc2\xb651, at 13, the Convention does not prescribe modes of, or time frames for, appellate review of first instance decisions.  It therefore rests with each Contracting State to ensure that appeals proceed with dispatch.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough alert to the premium the Convention places on prompt return, see \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711601(a)(4), Congress did not specifically address appeal proceedings in the legislation implementing the Convention.  The case before us illus-trates the protraction likely to ensue when the finality of a return order is left in limbo.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUpon determining that the daughter of Jeffrey Chafin and Lynne Chafin resided in Scotland, the District Court denied Mr. Chafin\xe2\x80\x99s request for a stay pending appeal, and authorized the child\xe2\x80\x99s immediate departure for Scotland.  The Eleventh Circuit, viewing the matter as a fait accompli, dismissed the appeal filed by Mr. Chafin as moot.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion explains, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that the child\xe2\x80\x99s removal to Scotland rendered further adjudication in the U.\xc2\xa0S. meaningless.  Reversal of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s return order, I agree, could provide Mr. Chafin with meaningful relief.  A determination that the child\xe2\x80\x99s habitual residence was Alabama, not Scotland, would open the way for an order directing Ms. Chafin to \xe2\x80\x9cre-return\xe2\x80\x9d the child to the United States and for Mr. Chafin to seek a custody adjudication in an Alabama state court.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But that prospect is unsettling.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]huttling children back and forth between parents and across international borders may be detrimental to those children,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 12, whose welfare led the Contracting States to draw up the Convention, see 1980 Conf\xc3\xa9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\xc3\xa9, Enl\xc3\xa8vement d\xe2\x80\x99enfants, E. P\xc3\xa9rez-Vera, Explanatory Report, in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzi\xc3\xa8me session, \xc2\xb623, p. 431 (1982).  And the advent of rival custody proceedings in Scotland and Alabama is just what the Convention aimed to stave off.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case highlights the need for both speed and certainty in Convention decisionmaking.  Most Contracting States permit challenges to first instance return orders.  See Guide to Good Practice, Part IV\xe2\x80\x93Enforcement, \xc2\xa72.3, \xc2\xb657, at 14.  How might appellate review proceed consistent with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on expedition?  According to a Federal Judicial Center guide, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xpedited procedures for briefing and handling of [return-order] appeals have become common in most circuits.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Garbolino, The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction: A Guide for Judges 116 (2012).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  As an example, the guide describes Charalambous v. Charalambous, 627 F.\xc2\xa03d 462 (CA1 2010) (per\xc2\xa0curiam), in which the Court of Appeals stayed a return order, expedited the appeal, and issued a final judgment affirming the return order 57 days after its entry.  Once appellate review established the finality of the return order, custody could be litigated in the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of habitual residence with no risk of a rival proceeding elsewhere.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut as the Court indicates, stays, even of short duration, should not be granted \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of course,\xe2\x80\x9d for they inevitably entail loss of \xe2\x80\x9cprecious months when [the child] could have been readjusting to life in her country of habitual residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 39.

Where no stay is ordered, the risk of a two-front battle over custody will remain real.  See supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  See also Larbie v.

See Brief for Centre for Family Law and Policy 22\xe2\x80\x9324 (Centre Brief).  To pursue an appeal from a return order in those domains, leave must be obtained from the first instance judge or the Court of Appeal.  Family Procedure Rules 2010, Rule 30.3 (U.\xc2\xa0K.).  Leave will be granted only where \xe2\x80\x9cthe appeal would have a real prospect of success; or . . . there is some other compelling reason why the appeal should be heard.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Although an appeal does not trigger an automatic stay, see Rule 30.8, if leave to appeal is granted, we are informed, a stay is ordinarily ordered by the court that granted leave.

And by providing for stays when an appeal is well founded, the system reduces the risk of rival custody proceedings.  Congressional action would be necessary if return-order appeals are not to be available in U.\xc2\xa0S. courts as a matter of right, but legislation requiring leave to appeal would not be entirely novel.  See \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c) (absent a certificate of appealability from a circuit justice or judge, an appeal may not be taken from the final decision of a district judge in a habeas corpus proceeding or a proceeding under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255); cf.
