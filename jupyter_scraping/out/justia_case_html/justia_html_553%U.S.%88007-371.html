STURGELL, ACTING ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93371.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 16, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 12, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">Greg Herrick, an antique aircraft enthusiast seeking to restore a vintage airplane manufactured by the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation (FEAC), filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request asking the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for copies of technical documents related to the airplane.  The FAA denied his request based on FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s exemption for trade secrets, see 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(4).  Herrick took an administrative appeal, but when respondent Fairchild, FEAC\xe2\x80\x99s successor, objected to the documents\xe2\x80\x99 release, the FAA adhered to its original decision.  Herrick then filed an unsuccessful FOIA lawsuit to secure the documents.  Less than a month after that suit was resolved, petitioner Taylor, Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s friend and an antique aircraft enthusiast himself, made a FOIA request for the same documents Herrick had unsuccessfully sued to obtain.  When the FAA failed to respond, Taylor filed suit in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Holding the suit barred by claim preclusion, the District Court granted summary judgment to the FAA and to Fairchild, as intervenor in Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s action.  The court acknowledged that Taylor was not a party to Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s suit, but held that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually represented\xe2\x80\x9d by a party.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit affirmed, announcing a five-factor test for \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The first two factors of the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cidentity of interests\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadequate representation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are necessary but not sufficient for virtual representation.  In addition, at least one of three other factors must be established:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9ca close relationship between the present party and his putative representative,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial participation by the present party in the first case,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctactical maneuvering on the part of the present party to avoid preclusion by the prior judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  The D. C. Circuit acknowledged the absence of any indication that Taylor participated in, or even had notice of, Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  It nonetheless found the \xe2\x80\x9cidentity of interests,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cadequate representation,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cclose relationship\xe2\x80\x9d factors satisfied because the two men sought release of the same documents, were \xe2\x80\x9cclose associates,\xe2\x80\x9d had discussed working together to restore Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s plane, and had used the same lawyer to pursue their suits.  Because these conditions sufficed to establish virtual representation, the court left open the question whether Taylor had engaged in tactical maneuvering to avoid preclusion.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The theory of preclusion by \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation\xe2\x80\x9d is disapproved.

S. 793</a>, 798 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indicating the strength of that tradition, this Court has often repeated the general rule that \xe2\x80\x9cone is not bound by a judgment <em>in personam</em> in a litigation in which he is not designated a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hansberry</em> v. <em>Lee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/311/32/index.html">311 U.

First, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person who agrees to be bound by the determination of issues in an action between others is bound in accordance with the [agreement\xe2\x80\x99s] terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa740.  Second, nonparty preclusion may be based on a pre-existing substantive legal relationship between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment, <em>e.g.,</em> assignee and assignor<em>.</em>  Third, \xe2\x80\x9cin certain limited circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d a nonparty may be bound by a judgment because she was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adequately represented by someone with the same interests who [wa]s a party\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the suit.  <em>Richards</em>, 517 U. S., at 798.  Fourth, a nonparty is bound by a judgment if she \xe2\x80\x9cassume[d] control\xe2\x80\x9d over the litigation in which that judgment was rendered.  <em>Montana</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/147/index.html">440 U. S. 147</a>, 154.  Fifth, a party bound by a judgment may not avoid its preclusive force by relitigating through a proxy.  Preclusion is thus in order when a person who did not participate in litigation later brings suit as the designated representative or agent of a person who was a party to the prior adjudication.  Sixth, a special statutory scheme otherwise consistent with due process\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g., </em>bankruptcy proceedings\xe2\x80\x94may \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly foreclos[e] successive litigation by nonlitigants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Wilks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/755/index.html">490 U.

Circuit recognized a broad \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation\xe2\x80\x9d exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion.  None of the arguments advanced by that court, the FAA, or Fairchild justify such an expansive doctrine.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit purported to ground its doctrine in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements that, in some circumstances, a person may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the proceeding yielding that judgment.  But the D. C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cadequate representation\xe2\x80\x9d strayed from the meaning this Court has attributed to that term.  In <em>Richards</em>, the Alabama Supreme Court had held a tax challenge barred by a judgment upholding the same tax in a suit by different taxpayers.  517 U. S., at 795\xe2\x80\x93797.  This Court reversed, holding that nonparty preclusion was inconsistent with due process where there was no showing (1) that the court in the first suit \xe2\x80\x9ctook care to protect the interests\xe2\x80\x9d of absent parties, or (2) that the parties to the first litigation \xe2\x80\x9cunderstood their suit to be on behalf of absent [parties],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 802.  In holding that representation can be \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of nonparty preclusion even where these two factors are absent, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit misapprehended <em>Richards</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Fairchild and the FAA ask this Court to abandon altogether the attempt to delineate discrete grounds and clear rules for nonparty preclusion.  Instead, they contend, only an equitable and heavily fact-driven inquiry can account for all of the situations in which nonparty preclusion is appropriate.  This argument is rejected.  First, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 balancing test is at odds with the constrained approach advanced by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, which have endeavored to delineate discrete, limited exceptions to the fundamental rule that a litigant is not bound by a judgment to which she was not a party, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Richards</em>, 517 U. S., at 798\xe2\x80\x93799.  Second, a party\xe2\x80\x99s representation of a nonparty is \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d for preclusion purposes only if, at a minimum: (1) the interests of the nonparty and her representative are aligned, see <em>Hansberry</em>, 311 U. S., at 43, and (2) either the party understood herself to be acting in a representative capacity or the original court took care to protect the nonparty\xe2\x80\x99s interests, see <em>Richards</em>, 517 U. S., at 801\xe2\x80\x93802.  Adequate representation may also require (3) notice of the original suit to the persons alleged to have been represented.  See <em>id.</em>, at 801.  In the class-action context, these limitations are implemented by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\xe2\x80\x99s procedural safeguards.  But an expansive virtual representation doctrine would recognize a common-law kind of class action shorn of these protections.  Third, a diffuse balancing approach to nonparty preclusion would likely<em> </em>complicate the task of district courts faced in the first instance with preclusion questions.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Finally, the FAA contends that nonparty preclusion should apply more broadly in \xe2\x80\x9cpublic-law\xe2\x80\x9d litigation than in \xe2\x80\x9cprivate-law\xe2\x80\x9d controversies.  First, the FAA points to <em>Richards\xe2\x80\x99</em> acknowledgment that when a taxpayer challenges \xe2\x80\x9can alleged misuse of public funds\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cother public action,\xe2\x80\x9d the suit \xe2\x80\x9chas only an indirect impact on [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] interests,\xe2\x80\x9d 517 U. S., at 803, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe States have wide latitude to establish procedures [limiting] the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>In contrast to the public-law litigation contemplated in <em>Richards</em>, however, a successful FOIA action results in a grant of relief to the individual plaintiff, not a decree benefiting the public at large.  Furthermore, <em>Richards </em>said only that, for the type of public-law claims there envisioned, States were free to adopt procedures limiting repetitive litigation.  While it appears equally evident that <em>Congress</em> can adopt such procedures, it hardly follows that <em>this Court </em>should proscribe or confine successive FOIA suits by different requesters.  Second, the FAA argues that, because the number of plaintiffs in public-law cases is potentially limitless, it is theoretically possible for several persons to coordinate a series of vexatious repetitive lawsuits.  But this risk does not justify departing from the usual nonparty preclusion rules.  <em>Stare decisis </em>will allow courts to dispose of repetitive suits in the same circuit, and even when <em>stare decisis </em>is not dispositive, the human inclination not to waste money should discourage suits based on claims or issues already decided.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The remaining question is whether the result reached by the courts below can be justified based on one of the six the established grounds for nonparty preclusion.  With one exception, those grounds plainly have no application here.  Respondents argue that Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s suit is a collusive attempt to relitigate Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  That argument justifies a remand to allow the courts below the opportunity to determine whether the fifth ground for nonparty preclusion\xe2\x80\x94preclusion because a nonparty to earlier litigation has brought suit as an agent of a party bound by the prior adjudication\xe2\x80\x94applies to Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  But courts should be cautious about finding preclusion on the basis of agency.  A mere whiff of \xe2\x80\x9ctactical maneuvering\xe2\x80\x9d will not suffice; instead, principles of agency law indicate that preclusion is appropriate only if the putative agent\xe2\x80\x99s conduct of the suit is subject to the control of the party who is bound by the prior adjudication.  Finally, the Court rejects Fairchild\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Taylor must bear the burden of proving he is not acting as Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s agent.  Claim preclusion is an affirmative defense for the defendant to plead and prove.

S. 32</a>, 40 (1940).  Several exceptions, recognized in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, temper this basic rule.  In a class action, for example, a person not named as a party may be bound by a judgment on the merits of the action, if she was adequately represented by a party who actively participated in the litigation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 41.  In this case, we consider for the first time whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation\xe2\x80\x9d exception to the general rule against precluding nonparties.  Adopted by a number of courts, including the courts below in the case now before us, the exception so styled is broader than any we have so far approved.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The virtual representation question we examine in this opinion arises in the following context.  Petitioner Brent Taylor filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act seeking certain documents from the Federal Aviation Administration.  Greg Herrick, Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s friend, had previously brought an unsuccessful suit seeking the same records.  The two men have no legal relationship, and there is no evidence that Taylor controlled, financed, participated in, or even had notice of Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s earlier suit.  Nevertheless, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit held Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s suit precluded by the judgment against Herrick because, in that court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment, Herrick qualified as Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representative.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disapprove the doctrine of preclusion by \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation,\xe2\x80\x9d and hold, based on the record as it now stands, that the judgment against Herrick does not bar Taylor from maintaining this suit.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) accords \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d a right to request any records held by a federal agency.  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(a)(3)(A) (2006 ed.).  No reason need be given for a FOIA request, and unless the requested materials fall within one of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated exemptions, see \xc2\xa7552(a)(3)(E), (b), the agency must \xe2\x80\x9cmake the records promptly available\xe2\x80\x9d to the requester, \xc2\xa7552(a)(3)(A).  If an agency refuses to furnish the requested records, the requester may file suit in federal court and obtain an injunction \xe2\x80\x9corder[ing] the production of any agency records improperly withheld.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The courts below held the instant FOIA suit barred by the judgment in earlier litigation seeking the same records.  Because the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions turned on the connection between the two lawsuits, we begin with a full account of each action.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first suit was filed by Greg Herrick, an antique aircraft enthusiast and the owner of an F\xe2\x80\x9345 airplane, a vintage model manufactured by the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation (FEAC) in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s.  In 1997, seeking information that would help him restore his plane to its original condition, Herrick filed a FOIA request asking the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for copies of any technical documents about the F\xe2\x80\x9345 contained in the agency\xe2\x80\x99s records.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To gain a certificate authorizing the manufacture and sale of the F\xe2\x80\x9345, FEAC had submitted to the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Authority, detailed specifications and other technical data about the plane.  Hundreds of pages of documents produced by FEAC in the certification process remain in the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s records.  The FAA denied Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s request, however, upon finding that the documents he sought are subject to FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s exemption for \xe2\x80\x9ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(4) (2006 ed.).  In an administrative appeal, Herrick urged that FEAC and its successors had waived any trade-secret protection.  The FAA thereupon contacted FEAC\xe2\x80\x99s corporate successor, respondent Fairchild Corporation (Fairchild).  Because Fairchild objected to release of the documents, the agency adhered to its original decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Herrick then filed suit in the U. S. District Court for the District of Wyoming.  Challenging the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the trade-secret exemption, Herrick placed heavy weight on a 1955 letter from FEAC to the Civil Aeronautics Authority.  The letter authorized the agency to lend any documents in its files to the public \xe2\x80\x9cfor use in making repairs or replacement parts for aircraft produced by Fairchild.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Garvey</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa03d 1184, 1193 (CA10 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This broad authorization, Herrick maintained, showed that the F\xe2\x80\x9345 certification records held by the FAA could not be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9csecre[t]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconfidential\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7552(b)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rejecting Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the District Court granted summary judgment to the FAA.  <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Garvey</em>, 200 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1321, 1328\xe2\x80\x931329 (Wyo. 2000).  The 1955 letter, the court reasoned, did not deprive the F\xe2\x80\x9345 certification documents of trade-secret status, for those documents were never in fact released pursuant to the letter\xe2\x80\x99s blanket authorization.  See<em> id.</em>, at 1329.  The court also stated that even if the 1955 letter had waived trade-secret protection, Fairchild had successfully \xe2\x80\x9creversed\xe2\x80\x9d the waiver by objecting to the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s release of the records to Herrick.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, the Tenth Circuit agreed with Herrick that the 1955 letter had stripped the requested documents of trade-secret protection.  See <em>Herrick</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1194.  But the Court of Appeals upheld the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s alternative determination\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that Fairchild had restored trade-secret status by objecting to Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA request.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1195.  On that ground, the appeals court affirmed the entry of summary judgment for the FAA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In so ruling, the Tenth Circuit noted that Herrick had failed to challenge two suppositions underlying the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  First, the District Court assumed trade-secret status could be \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d to documents that had lost protection.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1194, n.\xc2\xa010.  Second, the District Court also assumed that Fairchild had regained trade-secret status for the documents even though the company claimed that status only \xe2\x80\x9c<em>after</em> Herrick had initiated his request\xe2\x80\x9d for the F\xe2\x80\x9345 records.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court of Appeals expressed no opinion on the validity of these suppositions.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1194\xe2\x80\x931195, n.\xc2\xa010.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision issued on July 24, 2002.  Less than a month later, on August 22, petitioner Brent Taylor\xe2\x80\x94a friend of Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s and an antique aircraft enthusiast in his own right\xe2\x80\x94submitted a FOIA request seeking the same documents Herrick had unsuccessfully sued to obtain.  When the FAA failed to respond, Taylor filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Like Herrick, Taylor argued that FEAC\xe2\x80\x99s 1955 letter had stripped the records of their trade-secret status.  But Taylor also sought to litigate the two issues concerning recapture of protected status that Herrick had failed to raise in his appeal to the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After Fairchild intervened as a defendant,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] the District Court in D.\xc2\xa0C. concluded that Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s suit was barred by claim preclusion; accordingly, it granted summary judgment to Fairchild and the FAA.  The court acknowledged that Taylor was not a party to Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  Relying on the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Tyus </em>v. <em>Schoemehl</em>, 93 F.\xc2\xa03d 449 (1996), however, it held that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually represented\xe2\x80\x9d by a party.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a\xe2\x80\x9331a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s seven-factor test for virtual representation, adopted by the District Court in Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s case, requires an \xe2\x80\x9cidentity of interests\xe2\x80\x9d between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 31a.  See also <em>Tyus</em>, 93 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 455.  Six additional factors counsel in favor of virtual representation under the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test, but are not prerequisites: (1) a \xe2\x80\x9cclose relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between the present party and a party to the judgment alleged to be preclusive; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cparticipation in the prior litigation\xe2\x80\x9d by the present party; (3) the present party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9capparent acquiescence\xe2\x80\x9d to the preclusive effect of the judgment; (4) \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberat[e] maneuver[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid the effect of the judgment; (5) adequate representation of the present party by a party to the prior adjudication; and (6) a suit raising a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic law\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a \xe2\x80\x9cprivate law\xe2\x80\x9d issue.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (citing <em>Tyus</em>, 93 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 454\xe2\x80\x93456).  These factors, the D.\xc2\xa0C. District Court observed, \xe2\x80\x9cconstitute a fluid test with imprecise boundaries\xe2\x80\x9d and call for \xe2\x80\x9ca broad, case-by-case inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record before the District Court in Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s suit revealed the following facts about the relationship between Taylor and Herrick: Taylor is the president of the Antique Aircraft Association, an organization to which Herrick belongs; the two men are \xe2\x80\x9cclose associate[s],\xe2\x80\x9d App. 54; Herrick asked Taylor to help restore Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s F\xe2\x80\x9345, though they had no contract or agreement for Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the restoration; Taylor was represented by the lawyer who represented Herrick in the earlier litigation; and Herrick apparently gave Taylor documents that Herrick had obtained from the FAA during discovery in his suit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fairchild and the FAA conceded that Taylor had not participated in Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. District Court determined, however, that Herrick ranked as Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s virtual representative because the facts fit each of the other six indicators on the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s list.  See <em>id.</em>, at 32a\xe2\x80\x9335a.  Accordingly, the District Court held Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s suit, seeking the same documents Herrick had requested, barred by the judgment against Herrick.  See <em>id.</em>, at 35a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit affirmed.  It observed, first, that other Circuits \xe2\x80\x9cvary widely\xe2\x80\x9d in their approaches to virtual representation.  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Blakey</em>, 490 F.\xc2\xa03d 965, 971 (2007).  In this regard, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit contrasted the multifactor balancing test applied by the Eighth Circuit and the D.\xc2\xa0C. District Court with the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s narrower approach, which \xe2\x80\x9ctreats a party as a virtual representative only if the party is \xe2\x80\x98accountable to the nonparties who file a subsequent suit\xe2\x80\x99 and has \xe2\x80\x98the tacit approval of the court\xe2\x80\x99 to act on the nonpart[ies\xe2\x80\x99] behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Klugh </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 818 F.\xc2\xa02d 294, 300 (CA4 1987)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rejecting both of these approaches, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit announced its own five-factor test.  The first two factors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cidentity of interests\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadequate representation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are necessary but not sufficient for virtual representation.  490 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 971\xe2\x80\x93972.  In addition, at least one of three other factors must be established: \xe2\x80\x9ca close relationship between the present party and his putative representative,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial participation by the present party in the first case,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctactical maneuvering on the part of the present party to avoid preclusion by the prior judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 972.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this test to the record in Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s case, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit found both of the necessary conditions for virtual representation well met.  As to identity of interests, the court emphasized that Taylor and Herrick sought the same result\xe2\x80\x94release of the F\xe2\x80\x9345 documents.  Moreover, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit observed, Herrick owned an F\xe2\x80\x9345 airplane, and therefore had \xe2\x80\x9cif anything, a stronger incentive to litigate\xe2\x80\x9d than Taylor, who had only a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral interest in public disclosure and the preservation of antique aircraft heritage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 973 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to adequacy of representation, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit acknowledged that some other Circuits regard notice of a prior suit as essential to a determination that a nonparty was adequately represented in that suit.  See <em>id.</em>, at 973\xe2\x80\x93974 (citing <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Volvo Car Corp.</em>, 247 F.\xc2\xa03d 303, 312 (CA1 2001), and <em>Tice </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc.</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa03d 966, 973 (CA7 1998)).  Disagreeing with these courts, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit deemed notice an \xe2\x80\x9cimportant\xe2\x80\x9d but not an indispensable element in the adequacy inquiry.  The court then concluded that Herrick had adequately represented Taylor even though Taylor had received no notice of\nHerrick\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  For this conclusion, the appeals court relied on Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstrong incentive to litigate\xe2\x80\x9d and\nTaylor\xe2\x80\x99s later engagement of the same attorney, which indicated to the court Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction with that attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance in Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s case.  See 490 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 974\xe2\x80\x93975.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit also found its \xe2\x80\x9cclose relationship\xe2\x80\x9d criterion met, for Herrick had \xe2\x80\x9casked Taylor to assist him in restoring his F\xe2\x80\x9345\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprovided information to Taylor that Herrick had obtained through discovery\xe2\x80\x9d; furthermore, Taylor \xe2\x80\x9cdid not oppose Fairchild\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of Herrick as his \xe2\x80\x98close associate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 975.  Because the three above-described factors sufficed to establish virtual representation under the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s five-factor test, the appeals court left open the question whether Taylor had engaged in \xe2\x80\x9ctactical maneuvering.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 976 (calling the facts bearing on tactical maneuvering \xe2\x80\x9cambigu[ous]\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 552 U.

Our inquiry, however, is guided by well-established precedent regarding the propriety of nonparty preclusion.

These exceptions originated \xe2\x80\x9cas much from the needs of property law as from the values of preclusion by judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  18A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E.

Preclusion is thus in order when a person who did not participate in a litigation later brings suit as the designated representative of a person who was a party to the prior adjudication.  See <em>Chicago, R.\xc2\xa0I. &amp; P.\xc2\xa0R. Co.</em> v. <em>Schendel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/270/611/index.html"></a><a href="/us/270/611/index.html">270 U.

And although our decisions have not addressed the issue directly, it also seems clear that preclusion is appropriate when a nonparty later brings suit as an agent for a party who is bound by a judgment.

Decisions of these courts, however, have been far from consistent.  See 18A Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74457, p. 513 (virtual representation lacks a \xe2\x80\x9cclear or coherent theory\xe2\x80\x9d; decisions applying it have \xe2\x80\x9can episodic quality\xe2\x80\x9d).  Some Circuits use the label, but define \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation\xe2\x80\x9d so that it is no broader than the recognized exception for adequate representation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Becherer </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.</em>, 193 F.\xc2\xa03d 415, 423, 427 (CA6 1999).

As the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit saw this case, Herrick adequately represented Taylor for two principal reasons: Herrick had a strong incentive to litigate; and Taylor later hired Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, suggesting Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csatisfaction with the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance in the prior case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 975.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The D.\xc2\xa0C.

As just recounted, our holding that the Alabama Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of res judicata to nonparties violated due process turned on the lack of either special procedures to protect the nonparties\xe2\x80\x99 interests or an understanding by the concerned parties that the first suit was brought in a representative capacity.  See <em>Richards</em>,<em> </em>517 U. S., at 801\xe2\x80\x93802.  <em>Richards</em> thus established that representation is \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of nonparty preclusion only if (at a minimum) one of these two circumstances is present.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We restated <em>Richards\xe2\x80\x99 </em>core holding in <em>South Central Bell Telephone Co.</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/160/index.html">526 U. S. 160</a> (1999).  In that case, as in <em>Richards</em>, the Alabama courts had held that a judgment rejecting a challenge to a tax by one group of taxpayers barred a subsequent suit by a different taxpayer.  See 526 U. S.,<em> </em>at 164\xe2\x80\x93165.  In <em>South Central Bell</em>, however, the nonparty had notice of the original suit and engaged one of the lawyers earlier employed by the original plaintiffs.  See <em>id.</em>, at 167\xe2\x80\x93168.  Under the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s case, these factors apparently would have sufficed to establish adequate representation.  See 490 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 973\xe2\x80\x93975.  Yet <em>South Central Bell</em> held that the application of res judicata in that case violated due process.  Our inquiry came to an end when we determined that the original plaintiffs had not understood themselves to be acting in a representative capacity and that there had been no special procedures to safeguard the interests of absentees.  See 526 U. S., at 168.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decisions recognizing that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the earlier suit thus provide no support for the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s broad theory of virtual representation.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fairchild and the FAA do not argue that the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s virtual representation doctrine fits within any of the recognized grounds for nonparty preclusion.  Rather, they ask us to abandon the attempt to delineate discrete grounds and clear rules altogether.  Preclusion is in order, they contend, whenever \xe2\x80\x9cthe relationship between a party and a non-party is \xe2\x80\x98close enough\xe2\x80\x99 to bring the second litigant within the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.  See also Brief for Respondent FAA 22\xe2\x80\x9324.  Courts should make the \xe2\x80\x9cclose enough\xe2\x80\x9d determination, they urge, through a \xe2\x80\x9cheavily fact-driven\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cequitable\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.  See also Brief for Respondent FAA 22 (\xe2\x80\x9cthere is no clear test\xe2\x80\x9d for nonparty preclusion; rather, an \xe2\x80\x9cequitable and fact-intensive\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry is demanded (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Only this sort of diffuse balancing, Fairchild and the FAA argue, can account for all of the situations in which nonparty preclusion is appropriate.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject this argument for three reasons.  First, our decisions emphasize the fundamental nature of the general rule that a litigant is not bound by a judgment to which she was not a party.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Richards</em>, 517 U. S., at 798\xe2\x80\x93799; <em>Martin</em>, 490 U. S., at 761\xe2\x80\x93762.  Accordingly, we have endeavored to delineate discrete exceptions that apply in \xe2\x80\x9climited circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 762, n.\xc2\xa02.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 amorphous balancing test is at odds with the constrained approach to nonparty preclusion our decisions advance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Resisting this reading of our precedents, respondents call up three decisions they view as supportive of the approach they espouse.  Fairchild quotes our statement in <em>Coryell</em> v. <em>Phipps</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/406/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/406/index.html">317 U. S. 406</a>, 411 (1943), that privity \xe2\x80\x9cturns on the facts of particular cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.  That observation, however, scarcely implies that privity is governed by a diffuse balancing test.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Fairchild also cites<em> Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc.</em> v. <em>University of Ill. Foundation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/313/index.html">402 U. S. 313</a>, 334 (1971), which stated that estoppel questions turn on \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial courts\xe2\x80\x99 sense of justice and equity.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.  This passing statement, however, was not made with nonparty preclusion in mind; it appeared in a discussion recognizing district courts\xe2\x80\x99 discretion to <em>limit </em>the use of issue preclusion against persons who <em>were</em> parties to a judgment.  See <em>Blonder-Tongue</em>, 402 U. S., at 334.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FAA relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Des Moines Valley R. Co.</em>, 84 F. 40 (CA8 1897), an opinion we quoted with approval in <em>Schendel</em>, 270 U. S., at 619\xe2\x80\x93620.  <em>Des Moines Valley</em> was a quiet title action in which the named plaintiff was the United States.  The Government, however, had \xe2\x80\x9cno interest in the land\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9csimply permitted [the landowner] to use its name as the nominal plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  84 F., at 42.<em> </em>The suit was therefore barred, the appeals court held, by an earlier judgment against the landowner.  As the court explained: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here the government lends its name as a plaintiff \xe2\x80\xa6 to enable one private person to maintain a suit against another,\xe2\x80\x9d the government is \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the same defenses which exist \xe2\x80\xa6 against the real party in interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 43.  <em>Des Moines Valley</em>, the FAA contended at oral argument, demonstrates that it is sometimes appropriate to bind a nonparty in circumstances that do not fit within any of the established grounds for nonparty preclusion.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31\xe2\x80\x9333.  Properly understood, however, <em>Des Moines Valley</em> is simply an application of the fifth basis for nonparty preclusion described above: A party may not use a representative or agent to relitigate an adverse judgment.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  We thus find no support in our precedents for the\nlax approach to nonparty preclusion advocated by\nrespondents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our second reason for rejecting a broad doctrine of virtual representation rests on the limitations attending nonparty preclusion based on adequate representation.  A party\xe2\x80\x99s representation of a nonparty is \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d for preclusion purposes only if, at a minimum: (1) the interests of the nonparty and her representative are aligned, see <em>Hansberry</em>, 311 U. S., at 43; and (2) either the party understood herself to be acting in a representative capacity or the original court took care to protect the interests of the nonparty, see <em>Richards</em>, 517 U. S., at 801\xe2\x80\x93802; <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  In addition, adequate representation sometimes requires (3) notice of the original suit to the persons alleged to have been represented, see <em>Richards</em>,<em> </em>517 U. S., at 801.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  In the class-action context, these limitations are implemented by the procedural safeguards contained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An expansive doctrine of virtual representation, however, would \xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[e], in effect, a common-law kind of class action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tice</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 972 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is, virtual representation would authorize preclusion based on identity of interests and some kind of relationship between parties and nonparties, shorn of the procedural protections prescribed in <em>Hansberry</em>, <em>Richards</em>, and Rule 23.  These protections, grounded in due process, could be circumvented were we to approve a virtual representation doctrine that allowed courts to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate <em>de facto</em> class actions at will.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tice</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 973.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, a diffuse balancing approach to nonparty preclusion would likely create more headaches than it relieves.  Most obviously, it could significantly complicate the task of district courts faced in the first instance with preclusion questions.  An all-things-considered balancing approach might spark wide-ranging, time-consuming, and expensive discovery tracking factors potentially relevant under seven- or five-prong tests.  And after the relevant facts are established, district judges would be called upon to evaluate them under a standard that provides no firm guidance.  See <em>Tyus</em>, 93 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 455 (conceding that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no clear test for determining the applicability of\xe2\x80\x9d the virtual representation doctrine announced in that case).  Preclusion doctrine, it should be recalled, is intended to reduce the burden of litigation on courts and parties.  Cf. <em>Montana</em>, 440 U. S., at 153\xe2\x80\x93154.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn this area of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d we agree, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98crisp rules with sharp corners\xe2\x80\x99 are preferable to a round-about doctrine of opaque standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bittinger </em>v. <em>Tecumseh Products Co.</em>, 123 F.\xc2\xa03d 877, 881 (CA6 1997).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, relying on the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Tyus</em>, 93 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 456, the FAA maintains that nonparty preclusion should apply more broadly in \xe2\x80\x9cpublic-law\xe2\x80\x9d litigation than in \xe2\x80\x9cprivate-law\xe2\x80\x9d controversies.  To support this position, the FAA offers two arguments.  First, the FAA urges, our decision in <em>Richards</em> acknowledges that, in certain cases, the plaintiff has a reduced interest in controlling the litigation \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the public nature of the right at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent FAA 28.  When a taxpayer challenges \xe2\x80\x9can alleged misuse of public funds\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cother public action,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed in <em>Richards</em>, the suit \xe2\x80\x9chas only an indirect impact on [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  517 U. S., at 803.  In actions of this character, the Court said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe may assume that the States have wide latitude to establish procedures \xe2\x80\xa6 to limit the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA action falls within the category described in Richards</em>, the FAA contends, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe duty to disclose under FOIA is owed to the public generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Respondent FAA 34.  The opening sentence of FOIA, it is true, states that agencies \xe2\x80\x9cshall make [information] available to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(a) (2006 ed.).  Equally true, we have several times said that FOIA vindicates a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d interest.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>National Archives and Records Admin.</em> v. <em>Favish</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/157/index.html">541 U. S. 157</a>, 172 (2004).  The Act, however, instructs agencies receiving FOIA requests to make the information available not to the public at large, but rather to the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d making the request.  \xc2\xa7552(a)(3)(A).  See also \xc2\xa7552(a)(3)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn making any record available <em>to a person</em> under this paragraph, an agency shall provide the record in any [readily reproducible] form or format requested <em>by the person</em> \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); Brief for National Security Archive et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cGovernment agencies do not systematically make released records available to the general public.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, in contrast to the public-law litigation contemplated in <em>Richards</em>, a successful FOIA action results in a grant of relief to the individual plaintiff, not a decree benefiting the public at large.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, we said in <em>Richards </em>only that, for the type of public-law claims there envisioned, States are free to adopt procedures limiting repetitive litigation.  See 517 U. S., at 803.  In this regard, we referred to instances in which the first judgment foreclosed successive litigation by other plaintiffs because, \xe2\x80\x9cunder state law, [the suit] could be brought only on behalf of the public at large.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 804.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  <em>Richards</em> spoke of state legislation, but it appears equally evident that <em>Congress</em>, in providing for actions vindicating a public interest, may \xe2\x80\x9climit the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 803.  It hardly follows, however, that <em>this Court </em>should proscribe or confine successive FOIA suits by different requesters.  Indeed, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 provision for FOIA suits with no statutory constraint on successive actions counsels against judicial imposition of constraints through extraordinary application of the common law of preclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FAA next argues that \xe2\x80\x9cthe threat of vexatious litigation is heightened\xe2\x80\x9d in public-law cases because \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of plaintiffs with standing is potentially limitless.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent FAA 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FOIA does allow \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d whose request is denied to resort to federal court for review of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(a)(3)(A), (4)(B) (2006 ed.).  Thus it is theoretically possible that several persons could coordinate to mount a series of repetitive lawsuits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we are not convinced that this risk justifies departure from the usual rules governing nonparty preclusion.  First, <em>stare decisis </em>will allow courts swiftly to dispose of repetitive suits brought in the same circuit.  Second, even when <em>stare decisis </em>is not dispositive, \xe2\x80\x9cthe human tendency not to waste money will deter the bringing of suits based on claims or issues that have already been adversely determined against others.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shapiro 97.  This intuition seems to be borne out by experience: The FAA has not called our attention to any instances of abusive FOIA suits in the Circuits that reject the virtual-representation theory respondents advocate here.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we disapprove the theory of virtual representation on which the decision below rested.  The preclusive effects of a judgment in a federal-question case decided by a federal court should instead be determined according to the established grounds for nonparty preclusion described in this opinion.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although references to \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation\xe2\x80\x9d have proliferated in the lower courts, our decision is unlikely to occasion any great shift in actual practice.  Many opinions use the term \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation\xe2\x80\x9d in reaching results at least arguably defensible on established grounds.  See 18A Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74457, pp. 535\xe2\x80\x93539, and n. 38 (collecting cases).  In these cases, dropping the \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation\xe2\x80\x9d label would lead to clearer analysis with little, if any, change in outcomes.  See <em>Tice</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 971. (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term \xe2\x80\x98virtual representation\xe2\x80\x99 has cast more shadows than light on the problem [of nonparty preclusion].\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In some cases, however, lower courts have relied on virtual representation to extend nonparty preclusion beyond the latter doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s proper bounds.  We now turn back to Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s action to determine whether his suit is such a case, or whether the result reached by the courts below can be justified on one of the recognized grounds for nonparty preclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is uncontested that four of the six grounds for nonparty preclusion have no application here: There is no indication that Taylor agreed to be bound by Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s litigation, that Taylor and Herrick have any legal relationship, that Taylor exercised any control over Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s suit, or that this suit implicates any special statutory scheme limiting relitigation.  Neither the FAA nor Fairchild contends otherwise.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is equally clear that preclusion cannot be justified on the theory that Taylor was adequately represented in Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  Nothing in the record indicates that Herrick understood himself to be suing on Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, that Taylor even knew of Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s suit, or that the Wyoming District Court took special care to protect Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s interests.  Under our pathmarking precedent, therefore, Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s representation was not \xe2\x80\x9cadequate.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Richards</em>, 517 U. S., at 801\xe2\x80\x93802.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That leaves only the fifth category: preclusion because a nonparty to an earlier litigation has brought suit as a representative or agent of a party who is bound by the prior adjudication.  Taylor is not Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s legal representative and he has not purported to sue in a representative capacity.  He concedes, however, that preclusion would be appropriate if respondents could demonstrate that he is acting as Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cundisclosed agen[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 23, n.\xc2\xa04.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 24, n.\xc2\xa05.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue here, as they did below, that Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s suit is a collusive attempt to relitigate Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s action.  See Brief for Respondent Fairchild 32, and n. 18; Brief for Respondent FAA 18\xe2\x80\x9319, 33, 39.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit considered a similar question in addressing the \xe2\x80\x9ctactical maneuvering\xe2\x80\x9d prong of its virtual representation test.  See 490 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 976.  The Court of Appeals did not, however, treat the issue as one of agency, and it expressly declined to reach any definitive conclusions due to \xe2\x80\x9cthe ambiguity of the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We therefore remand to give the courts below an opportunity to determine whether Taylor, in pursuing the instant FOIA suit, is acting as Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s agent.  Taylor concedes that such a remand is appropriate.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56\xe2\x80\x9357.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have never defined the showing required to establish that a nonparty to a prior adjudication has become a litigating agent for a party to the earlier case.  Because the issue has not been briefed in any detail, we do not discuss the matter elaboratively here.  We note, however, that courts should be cautious about finding preclusion on this basis.  A mere whiff of \xe2\x80\x9ctactical maneuvering\xe2\x80\x9d will not suffice; instead, principles of agency law are suggestive.  They indicate that preclusion is appropriate only if the putative agent\xe2\x80\x99s conduct of the suit is subject to the control of the party who is bound by the prior adjudication.  See 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency \xc2\xa714, p. 60 (1957) (\xe2\x80\x9cA principal has the right to control the conduct of the agent with respect to matters entrusted to him.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, Fairchild suggests, Taylor should bear the burden of proving he is not acting as Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s agent.  When a defendant points to evidence establishing a close relationship between successive litigants, Fairchild maintains, \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden [should] shif[t] to the second litigant to submit evidence refuting the charge\xe2\x80\x9d of agency.  Brief for Respondent Fairchild 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  Fairchild justifies this proposed burden-shift on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cit is unlikely an opposing party will have access to direct evidence of collusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 28, n.\xc2\xa014.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject Fairchild\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion.  Claim preclusion, like issue preclusion, is an affirmative defense.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa08(c); <em>Blonder-Tongue</em>, 402 U. S., at 350.  Ordinarily, it is incumbent on the defendant to plead and prove such a defense, see <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Bock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/199/index.html">549 U. S. 199</a>, 204 (2007), and we have never recognized claim preclusion as an exception to that general rule, see 18 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74405, p. 83 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] party asserting preclusion must carry the burden of establishing all necessary elements.\xe2\x80\x9d).  We acknowledge that direct evidence justifying nonparty preclusion is often in the hands of plaintiffs rather than defendants.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Montana</em>, 440 U. S., at 155 (listing evidence of control over a prior suit).  But \xe2\x80\x9c[v]ery often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence \xc2\xa7337, p. 475 (6th ed. 2006).  In these situations, targeted interrogatories or deposition questions can reduce the information disparity.  We see no greater cause here than in other matters of affirmative defense to disturb the traditional allocation of the proof burden.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although Fairchild provided documents to the Wyoming District Court and filed an <em>amicus </em>brief in the Tenth Circuit, it was not a party to Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s suit.

The Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, like the Fourth Circuit, have constrained the reach of virtual representation by requiring, <em>inter alia</em>, the existence of a legal relationship between the nonparty to be bound and the putative representative.  See <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Cockrell</em>, 578 F.\xc2\xa02d 1002, 1008 (CA5 1978); <em>Becherer </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, &amp; Smith, Inc.</em>, 193 F.\xc2\xa03d 415, 424 (CA6 1999); <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Pemco Aeroplex, Inc.</em>, 383 F.\xc2\xa03d 1280, 1289 (CA11 2004).  The Seventh Circuit, in contrast, has rejected the doctrine of virtual representation altogether.

The list that follows is meant only to provide a framework for our consideration of virtual representation, not to establish a definitive taxonomy.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Restatement observes that a nonparty may be bound not only by express or implied agreement, but also through conduct inducing reliance by others.  See 2 Restatement \xc2\xa762.  See also 18A Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74453, pp. 425\xe2\x80\x93429.  We have never had occasion to consider this ground for nonparty preclusion, and we express no view on it here.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The substantive legal relationships justifying preclusion are sometimes collectively referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cprivity.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Richards</em> v. <em>Jefferson County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/793/index.html"></a><a href="/us/517/793/index.html">517 U.

The term \xe2\x80\x9cprivity,\xe2\x80\x9d however, has also come to be used more broadly, as a way to express the conclusion that nonparty preclusion is appropriate on any ground.  See 18A Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74449, pp. 351\xe2\x80\x93353, and n.\xc2\xa033 (collecting cases).  To ward off confusion, we avoid using the term \xe2\x80\x9cprivity\xe2\x80\x9d in this opinion.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Moreover, <em>Coryell</em> interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9cprivity\xe2\x80\x9d not in the context of res judicata, but as used in a statute governing shipowner liability.

In that case, we held that the United States was barred from bringing a suit because it had controlled a prior unsuccessful action filed by a federal contractor.  See<em> id.</em>, at 155.
