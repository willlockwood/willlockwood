S. 43</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented in this case, in which the District Court for the District of Colorado granted preliminary injunctive relief, is whether a "home rule" municipality, granted by the state constitution extensive powers of self-government in local and municipal matters, enjoys the "state action" exemption from Sherman Act liability announced in <em>Parker v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent city of Boulder is organized as a "home rule" municipality under the Constitution of the State of Colorado. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The city is thus entitled to exercise "the full right of self-government in both local and municipal matters," and, with respect to such matters, the City Charter and ordinances </p><p><a class="page-number" name="44">Page 455 U. S. 44</a></p><p> supersede the laws of the State.  Under that Charter, all municipal legislative powers are exercised by an elected City Council. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In 1964, the City Council enacted an ordinance granting to Colorado Televents, Inc., a 20-year, revocable, nonexclusive permit to conduct a cable television business within the city limits.  This permit was assigned to petitioner in 1966, and since that time, petitioner has provided cable television service to the University Hill area of Boulder, an area where some 20% of the city\'s population lives and where, for geographical reasons, broadcast television signals cannot be received.</p>\n<p>From 1966 until February, 1980, due to the limited service that could be provided with the technology then available, petitioner\'s service consisted essentially of retransmissions of programming broadcast from Denver and Cheyenne, Wyo.  Petitioner\'s market was therefore confined to the University Hill area.  However, markedly improved technology became available in the late 1970\'s, enabling petitioner to offer many more channels of entertainment than could be provided by local broadcast television. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Thus presented with an opportunity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="45">Page 455 U. S. 45</a></p><p> to expand its business into other areas of the city, petitioner, in May, 1979, informed the City Council that it planned such an expansion.  But the new technology offered opportunities to potential competitors, as well, and in July, 1979, one of them, the newly formed Boulder Communications Co. (BCC), [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] also wrote to the City Council expressing its interest in obtaining a permit to provide competing cable television service throughout the city. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The City Council\'s response, after reviewing its cable television policy, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] was the enactment of an "emergency" ordinance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 455 U. S. 46</a></p><p> prohibiting petitioner from expanding its business into other areas of the city for a period of three months. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The City Council announced that, during this moratorium, it planned to draft a model cable television ordinance and to invite new businesses to enter the Boulder market under its terms, but that the moratorium was necessary because petitioner\'s continued expansion during the drafting of the model ordinance would discourage potential competitors from entering the market. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner filed this suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, and sought, <em>inter alia,</em> a preliminary injunction to prevent the city from restricting petitioner\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="47">Page 455 U. S. 47</a></p><p> proposed business expansion, alleging that such a restriction would violate \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The city responded that its moratorium ordinance could not be violative of the antitrust laws, either because that ordinance constituted an exercise of the city\'s police powers or because Boulder enjoyed antitrust immunity under the <em>Parker</em> doctrine.  The District Court considered the city\'s status as a home rule municipality, but determined that that status gave autonomy to the city only in matters of local concern, and that the operations of cable television embrace "wider concerns, including interstate commerce . . . [and] the First Amendment rights of communicators."  485 F.Supp. 1035, 1038-1039 (1980).  Then assuming, <em>arguendo,</em> that the ordinance was within the city\'s authority as a home rule municipality, the District Court considered <em>City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html">435 U. S. 389</a></span> (1978), and concluded that the <em>Parker</em> exemption was "wholly inapplicable," and that the city was therefore subject to antitrust liability.  485 F.Supp. at 1039. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Petitioner\'s motion for a preliminary injunction was accordingly granted.</p>\n<p>On appeal, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed.  630 F.2d 704 (1980).  The majority, after examining Colorado law, rejected the District Court\'s conclusion that regulation of the cable television business was beyond the home rule authority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="48">Page 455 U. S. 48</a></p><p> of the city.  <em>Id.</em> at 707.  The majority then addressed the question of the city\'s claimed <em>Parker</em> exemption.  It distinguished the present case from <em>City of Lafayette</em> on the ground that, in contrast to the municipally operated revenue-producing utility companies at issue there, "no proprietary interest of the City is here involved."  630 F.2d at 708.  After noting that the city\'s regulation "was the only control or active supervision exercised by state or local government, and . . . represented the only expression of policy as to the subject matter," <em>id.</em> at 707, the majority held that the city\'s actions therefore satisfied the criteria for a <em>Parker</em> exemption, 630 F.2d at 708. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  We granted certiorari, 450 U.S. 1039 (1981).  We reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Parker v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943), addressed the question whether the federal antitrust laws prohibited a State, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, from imposing certain anticompetitive restraints.  These took the form of a "marketing program" adopted by the State of California for the 1940 raisin crop; that program prevented appellee from freely marketing his crop in interstate commerce.  <em>Parker</em> noted that California\'s program "derived its authority . . .  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="49">Page 455 U. S. 49</a></p><p> from the legislative command of the state," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#350">317 U. S. 350</a></span>, and went on to hold that the program was therefore exempt, by virtue of the Sherman Act\'s own limitations, from antitrust attack:</p>\n<p>"We find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature.  In a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state\'s control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to Congress."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#350">317 U. S. 350</a></span>-351.</p>\n<p>The availability of this exemption to a State\'s municipalities was the question presented in <em>City of Lafayette, supra.</em>  In that case, petitioners were Louisiana cities empowered to own and operate electric utility systems both within and beyond their municipal limits.  Respondent brought suit against petitioners under the Sherman Act, alleging that they had committed various antitrust offenses in the conduct of their utility systems, to the injury of respondent.  Petitioners invoked the <em>Parker</em> doctrine as entitling them to dismissal of the suit.  The District Court accepted this argument and dismissed.  But the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that a "subordinate state governmental body is not, <em>ipso facto,</em> exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws," <em>City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.,</em> 532 F.2d 431, 434 (1976) (footnote omitted), and directing the District Court on remand to examine "whether the state legislature contemplated a certain type of anticompetitive restraint," <em>ibid.</em> [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="50">Page 455 U. S. 50</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This Court affirmed.  In doing so, a majority rejected at the outset petitioners\' claim that, quite apart from <em>Parker,</em> "Congress never intended to subject local governments to the antitrust laws."  435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#394">435 U. S. 394</a></span>.  A plurality opinion for four Justices then addressed petitioners\' argument that <em>Parker,</em> properly construed, extended to "all governmental entities, whether state agencies or subdivisions of a State, . . . simply by reason of their status as such."  435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#408">435 U. S. 408</a></span>.  The plurality opinion rejected this argument, after a discussion of <em>Parker, Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html">421 U. S. 773</a></span> (1975), and <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html">433 U. S. 350</a></span> (1977). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  These precedents were construed as holding that the <em>Parker</em> exemption reflects the federalism principle that we are a Nation of States, a principle that makes no accommodation for sovereign subdivisions of States.  The plurality opinion said:</p>\n<p>"Cities are not themselves sovereign; they do not receive all the federal deference of the States that create them.  <em>Parker\'s</em> limitation of the exemption to \'official action directed by a state\' is consistent with the fact that the States\' subdivisions generally have not been treated as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="51">Page 455 U. S. 51</a></p><p> equivalents of the States themselves.  In light of the serious economic dislocation which could result if cities were free to place their own parochial interests above the Nation\'s economic goals reflected in the antitrust laws, we are especially unwilling to presume that Congress intended to exclude anticompetitive municipal action from their reach."</p>\n<p>435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#412">435 U. S. 412</a></span>-413 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The opinion emphasized, however, that the State, as sovereign, might sanction anticompetitive municipal activities, and thereby immunize municipalities from antitrust liability.  Under the plurality\'s standard, the <em>Parker</em> doctrine would shield from antitrust liability municipal conduct engaged in "pursuant to state policy to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public service."  435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#413">435 U. S. 413</a></span>.  This was simply a recognition that a State may frequently choose to effect its policies through the instrumentality of its cities and towns.  It was stressed, however, that the "state policy" relied upon would have to be "clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#410">435 U. S. 410</a></span>.  This standard has since been adopted by a majority of the Court.  <em>New Motor Vehicle Board of California v. Orrin W.

Fox Co.,</em> and <em>Midcal.</em>  Boulder argues that these criteria are met by the direct delegation of powers to municipalities through the Home Rule Amendment to the Colorado Constitution.  It contends that this delegation satisfies both the <em>Parker</em> and the <em>City of Lafayette</em> standards.  We take up these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondent city\'s <em>Parker</em> argument emphasizes that, through the Home Rule Amendment, the people of the State of Colorado have vested in the city of Boulder "<em><em>every power</em> theretofore possessed by the legislature . . . in local and municipal affairs.\'" [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The power thus possessed by Boulder\'s </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 455 U. S. 53</a></em></p><p><em> City Council assertedly embraces the regulation of cable television, which is claimed to pose essentially local problems. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Thus, it is suggested, the city\'s cable television moratorium ordinance is an "act of government" performed by the city <em>acting as the State</em> in local matters, which meets the "state action" criterion of <em>Parker.</em> [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>We reject this argument:  it both misstates the letter of the law and misunderstands its spirit.  The <em>Parker</em> state action exemption reflects Congress\' intention to embody in the Sherman Act the federalism principle that the States possess a significant measure of sovereignty under our Constitution.  But this principle contains its own limitation:  ours is a "<em>dual</em> system of government," <em>Parker,</em> 317 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#351">317 U.

As this Court stated long ago, all sovereign authority "within the geographical limits of the United States" resides either with</p>\n<p>"the Government of the United States, or [with] the States of the Union.  <em>There exist within the broad domain of sovereignty but these two.</em>  There may be cities, counties, and other organized bodies with limited legislative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 455 U.

Thus, <em>Parker</em> recognized Congress\' intention to limit the state action exemption based upon the federalism principle of limited state sovereignty.  <em>City of Lafayette, Orrin W. Fox Co.,</em> and <em>Midcal</em> reaffirmed both the vitality and the intrinsic limits of the <em>Parker</em> state action doctrine.  It was expressly recognized by the plurality opinion in <em>City of Lafayette</em> that municipalities "are not themselves sovereign," 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#412">435 U.

S. 413</a></span>.  The Court adopted this view in <em>Orrin W. Fox Co.,</em> 439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/96/case.html#109">439 U.

We turn then to Boulder\'s contention that its actions were undertaken pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy.</p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p>Boulder first argues that the requirement of "clear articulation and affirmative expression" is fulfilled by the Colorado Home Rule Amendment\'s "guarantee of local autonomy."  It contends, quoting from <em>City of Lafayette,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#394">435 U. S. 394</a></span>, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 455 U. S. 55</a></p><p> that, by this, means Colorado has "comprehended within the powers granted" to Boulder the power to enact the challenged ordinance, and that Colorado has thereby "contemplated" Boulder\'s enactment of an anticompetitive regulatory program.  Further, Boulder contends that it may be inferred, "from the authority given" to Boulder "to operate in a particular area" -- here, the asserted home rule authority to regulate cable television -- "that the <em>legislature</em> contemplated the kind of action complained of."  (Emphasis supplied.)  Boulder therefore concludes that the "adequate state mandate" required by <em>City of Lafayette, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#415">435 U. S. 415</a></span>, is present here. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>But plainly the requirement of "clear articulation and affirmative expression" is not satisfied when the State\'s position is one of mere <em>neutrality</em> respecting the municipal actions challenged as anticompetitive.  A State that allows its municipalities to do as they please can hardly be said to have "contemplated" the specific anticompetitive actions for which municipal liability is sought.  Nor can those actions be truly described as "comprehended within the powers granted," since the term "granted" necessarily implies an affirmative addressing of the subject by the State.  The State did not do so here:  the relationship of the State of Colorado to Boulder\'s moratorium ordinance is one of precise neutrality.  As the majority in the Court of Appeals below acknowledged:</p>\n<p>"[W]e are here concerned with City action in the absence of any regulation whatever by the State of Colorado.  Under these circumstances, there is no interaction of state and local regulation.  We have only the action or exercise of authority by the City."</p>\n<p>630 F.2d at 707.  Indeed, Boulder argues that, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="56">Page 455 U. S. 56</a></p><p> as to local matters regulated by a home rule city, the Colorado General Assembly is without power to act.  <em>Cf. City of Lafayette, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#414">435 U. S. 414</a></span>, and n. 44.  Thus in Boulder\'s view, it can pursue its course of regulating cable television competition, while another home rule city can choose to prescribe monopoly service, while still another can elect free-market competition:  and all of these policies are equally "contemplated," and "comprehended within the powers granted."  Acceptance of such a proposition -- that the general grant of power to enact ordinances necessarily implies state authorization to enact specific anticompetitive ordinances -- would wholly eviscerate the concepts of "clear articulation and affirmative expression" that our precedents require.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondents argue that denial of the <em>Parker</em> exemption in the present case will have serious adverse consequences for cities, and will unduly burden the federal courts.  But this argument is simply an attack upon the wisdom of the longstanding congressional commitment to the policy of free markets and open competition embodied in the antitrust laws. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Those laws, like other federal laws imposing civil or criminal sanctions upon "persons," of course apply to municipalities as well as to other corporate entities. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Moreover, judicial enforcement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 455 U. S. 57</a></p><p> of Congress\' will regarding the state action exemption renders a State</p>\n<p>"no less able to allocate governmental power between itself and its political subdivisions.  It means only that, when the State itself has not directed or authorized an anticompetitive practice, the State\'s subdivisions in exercising their delegated power must obey the antitrust laws."</p>\n<p><em>City of Lafayette,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#416">435 U.

As was observed in that case:</p>\n<p>"Today\'s decision does not threaten the legitimate exercise of governmental power, nor does it preclude municipal government from providing services on a monopoly basis.  <em>Parker</em> and its progeny make clear that a State properly may . . . direct or authorize its instrumentalities to act in a way which, if it did not reflect state policy, would be inconsistent with the antitrust laws. . . .

We surely did not suggest that the members of the Michigan Public Utility Commission who had authorized the program under attack had thereby become parties to a violation of the Sherman Act.

Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943).  The question addressed in <em>Parker</em> and in this case is not whether state and local governments are <em>exempt</em> from the Sherman Act, but whether statutes, ordinances, and regulations enacted as an act of government are <em>preempted</em> by the Sherman Act under the operation of the Supremacy Clause.  Second, in holding that a municipality\'s ordinances can be "exempt" from antitrust scrutiny only if the enactment furthers or implements a "clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/40/case.html#52">455 U. S. 52</a></span>, the Court treats a political subdivision of a State as an entity indistinguishable from any privately owned business.  As I read the Court\'s opinion, a municipality may be said to violate the antitrust laws by enacting legislation in conflict with the Sherman Act, unless the legislation is enacted pursuant to an affirmative state policy to supplant competitive market forces in the area of the economy to be regulated. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="61">Page 455 U. S. 61</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Preemption and exemption are fundamentally distinct concepts.  Preemption, because it involves the Supremacy Clause, implicates our basic notions of federalism.  Preemption analysis is invoked whenever the Court is called upon to examine "the interplay between the enactments of two <em>different</em> sovereigns -- one federal and the other state."  Handler, Antitrust -- 1978, 78 Colum.L.Rev. 1363, 1379 (1978).  We are confronted with questions under the Supremacy Clause when we are called upon to resolve a purported conflict between the enactments of the Federal Government and those of a state or local government, or where it is claimed that the Federal Government has occupied a particular field exclusively, so as to foreclose any state regulation.  Where preemption is found, the state enactment must fall without any effort to accommodate the State\'s purposes or interests.  Because preemption treads on the very sensitive area of federal-state relations, this Court is "reluctant to infer preemption," <em>Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/117/case.html">437 U. S. 117</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/117/case.html#132">437 U. S. 132</a></span> (1978), and the presumption is that preemption is not to be found absent the clear and manifest intention of Congress that the federal Act should supersede the police powers of the States.  <em>Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html">435 U. S. 151</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/151/case.html#157">435 U. S. 157</a></span> (1978).</p>\n<p>In contrast, exemption involves the interplay between the enactments of a single sovereign -- whether one enactment was intended by Congress to relieve a party from the necessity of complying with a prior enactment.  <em>See, e.g., National Broiler Marketing Assn. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/816/case.html">436 U. S. 816</a></span> (1978) (Sherman Act and Capper-Volstead Act); <em>United States v.

Since the enactments of only one sovereign are involved, no problems of federalism are present.  The court interpreting the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="62">Page 455 U. S. 62</a></p><p> statute must simply attempt to ascertain congressional intent, whether the exemption is claimed to be express or implied.  The presumptions utilized in exemption analysis are quite distinct from those applied in the preemption context.  In examining exemption questions,</p>\n<p>"the proper approach . . . is an analysis which reconciles the operation of both statutory schemes with one another, rather than holding one completely ousted."</p>\n<p><em>Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/341/case.html#357">373 U. S. 357</a></span>.</p>\n<p>With this distinction in mind, I think it quite clear that questions involving the so-called "state action" doctrine are more properly framed as being ones of preemption, rather than exemption.  Issues under the doctrine inevitably involve state and local regulation which, it is contended, are in conflict with the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <em>Parker v. Brown, supra,</em> was the genesis of the "state action" doctrine.  That case involved a challenge to a program established pursuant to the California Agricultural Prorate Act, which sought to restrict competition in the State\'s raisin industry by limiting the producer\'s ability to distribute raisins through private channels.  The program thus sought to maintain prices at a level higher than those maintained in an unregulated market.  This Court assumed that the program would violate the Sherman Act were it "organized and made effective solely by virtue of a contract, combination or conspiracy of private persons, individual or corporate," and that</p>\n<p>"Congress could, in the exercise of its commerce power, prohibit a state from maintaining a stabilization program like the present because of its effect on interstate commerce."</p>\n<p>317 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#350">317 U. S. 350</a></span>.  In this regard, we noted that</p>\n<p>"[o]ccupation of a legislative field by Congress in the exercise of a granted power is a familiar example of its constitutional power to suspend state laws."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  We then held, however, that</p>\n<p>"[w]e find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature.  In a dual system of government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="63">Page 455 U. S. 63</a></p><p> in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state\'s control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to Congress."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#350">317 U. S. 350</a></span>-351.</p>\n<p>This is clearly the language of federal preemption under the Supremacy Clause.  This Court decided in <em>Parker</em> that Congress did not intend the Sherman Act to override state legislation designed to regulate the economy.  There was no language of "exemption," either express or implied, nor the usual incantation that "repeals by implication are disfavored."  Instead, the Court held that state regulation of the economy is not necessarily preempted by the antitrust laws even if the same acts by purely private parties would constitute a violation of the Sherman Act.  The Court recognized, however, that some state regulation is preempted by the Sherman Act, explaining that</p>\n<p>"a state does got give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#351">317 U. S. 351</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Our two most recent <em>Parker</em> doctrine cases reveal most clearly that the "state action" doctrine is not an exemption at all, but instead a matter of federal preemption.</p>\n<p>In <em>New Motor Vehicle Bd. of California v. Orrin W. Fox Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/96/case.html">439 U. S. 96</a></span> (1978), we examined the contention that the California Automobile Franchise Act conflicted with the Sherman Act.  That Act required a motor vehicle manufacturer to secure the approval of the California New Motor Vehicle Board before it could open a dealership within an existing franchisee\'s market area, if the competing franchisee objected.  By so delaying the opening of a new dealership whenever a competing dealership protested, the Act arguably gave effect to privately initiated restraints of trade, and thus was invalid under <em>Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/384/case.html">341 U. S. 384</a></span> (1951).  We held that the Act was outside the purview of the Sherman Act because it contemplated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 455 U. S. 64</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"a system of regulation, clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed, designed to displace unfettered business freedom in the matter of the establishment and relocation of automobile dealerships."</p>\n<p>439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/96/case.html#109">439 U. S. 109</a></span>.  We also held that a state statute is not invalid under the Sherman Act merely because the statute will have an anticompetitive effect.  Otherwise, if an adverse effect upon competition were enough to render a statute invalid under the Sherman Act, "<em>the States\' power to engage in economic regulation would be effectively destroyed.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/96/case.html#111">439 U.

In <em>New Motor Vehicle Bd.,</em> we held that a state statute could stand in the face of a purported conflict with the Sherman Act.\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html">445 U. S. 97</a></span> (1980), we invalidated California\'s wine pricing system in the face of a challenge under the Sherman Act.  We first held that the price setting program constituted resale price maintenance, which this Court has consistently held to be a "<em>per se</em>" violation of the Sherman Act.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html#102">445 U. S. 102</a></span>-103.  We then concluded that the program could not fit within the <em>Parker</em> doctrine.  Although the restraint was imposed pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy, the program was not actively supervised by the State itself.  The State merely authorized and enforced price fixing established by private parties, instead of establishing the prices itself or reviewing their reasonableness.  In the absence of sufficient state supervision, we held that the pricing system was invalid under the Sherman Act.  445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html#105">445 U. S. 105</a></span>-106.</p>\n<p>Unlike the instant case, <em>Parker, Midcal,</em> and <em>New Motor Vehicle Bd.</em> involved challenges to a state statute.  There was no suggestion that a State <em>violates</em> the Sherman Act when it enacts legislation not saved by the <em>Parker</em> doctrine from invalidation under the Sherman Act.  Instead, the statute is simply unenforceable because it has been preempted by the Sherman Act.  By contrast, the gist of the Court\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 455 U. S. 65</a></p><p> opinion is that a municipality may actually violate the antitrust laws when it merely enacts an ordinance invalid under the Sherman Act, unless the ordinance implements an affirmatively expressed state policy. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  According to the majority, a municipality may be liable under the Sherman Act for enacting anticompetitive legislation, unless it can show that it is acting simply as the "instrumentality" of the State.</p>\n<p>Viewing the <em>Parker</em> doctrine in this manner will have troubling consequences for this Court and the lower courts who must now adapt antitrust principles to adjudicate Sherman Act challenges to local regulation of the economy.  The majority suggests as much in footnote 20.  Among the many problems to be encountered will be whether the "<em>per se</em>" rules of illegality apply to municipal defendants in the same manner as they are applied to private defendants.  Another is the question of remedies.  The Court understandably leaves open the question whether municipalities may be liable for treble damages for enacting anticompetitive ordinances which are not protected by the <em>Parker</em> doctrine. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Most troubling, however, will be questions regarding the factors which may be examined by the Court pursuant to the Rule of Reason.  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/679/case.html">National Society of Professional Engineers</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 455 U.

S. 696</a></span> (1978), we held that an anticompetitive restraint could not be defended on the basis of a private party\'s conclusion that competition posed a potential threat to public safety and the ethics of a particular profession.  "[T]he Rule of Reason does not support a defense based on the assumption that competition itself is unreasonable."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/679/case.html#696">435 U. S. 696</a></span>.  <em>Professional Engineers</em> holds that the decision to replace competition with regulation is not within the competence of private entities.  Instead, private entities may defend restraints only on the basis that the restraint is not unreasonable in its effect on competition, or because its procompetitive effects outweigh its anticompetitive effects.  <em>See Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/36/case.html">433 U. S. 36</a></span> (1977).</p>\n<p>Applying Professional Engineers to municipalities would mean that an ordinance could not be defended on the basis that its benefits to the community, in terms of traditional health, safety, and public welfare concerns, outweigh its anticompetitive effects.  A local government would be disabled from displacing competition with regulation.  Thus, a municipality would violate the Sherman Act by enacting restrictive zoning ordinances, by requiring business and occupational licenses, and by granting exclusive franchises to utility services, even if the city determined that it would be in the best interests of its inhabitants to displace competition with regulation.  Competition simply does not and cannot further the interests that lie behind most social welfare legislation.  Although state or local enactments are not invalidated by the Sherman Act merely because they may have anticompetitive effects, <em>Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/95/case.html#133">473 U. S. 133</a></span>, this Court has not hesitated to invalidate such statutes on the basis that such a program would violate the antitrust laws if engaged in by private parties.  <em>See California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v.

Unless the municipality could point to an affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition in the given area sought to be regulated, the municipality would be held to violate the Sherman Act and the regulatory scheme would be rendered invalid.  Surely, the Court does not seek to require a municipality to justify every ordinance it enacts in terms of its procompetitive effects.  If municipalities are permitted only to enact ordinances that are consistent with the procompetitive policies of the Sherman Act, a municipality\'s power to regulate the economy would be all but destroyed.  <em>See Exxon Corp. v.

S. 311</a></span> (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, rejecting the rationale of <em>Professional Engineers</em> to accommodate the municipal defendant opens up a different sort of Pandora\'s Box.  If the Rule of Reason were "modified" to permit a municipality to defend its regulation on the basis that its benefits to the community outweigh its anticompetitive effects, the courts will be called upon to review social legislation in a manner reminiscent of the <em>Lochner</em> (<em>Lochner v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/case.html">198 U. S. 45</a></span> (1905)) era.  Once again, the federal courts will be called upon to engage in the same wide-ranging, essentially standardless inquiry into the reasonableness of local regulation that this Court has properly rejected.  Instead of "liberty of contract" and "substantive due process," the procompetitive principles of the Sherman Act will be the governing standard by which the reasonableness of all local regulation will be determined. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  Neither the Due Process Clause nor the Sherman Act authorizes federal courts to invalidate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 455 U. S. 68</a></p><p> local regulation of the economy simply upon opining that the municipality has acted unwisely.  The Sherman Act should not be deemed to authorize federal courts to "substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws."  <em>Ferguson v.

We will not be confronted with the anomaly of holding a municipality liable for enacting anticompetitive ordinances. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  The federal courts will not be required to engage in a standardless review of the reasonableness of local legislation.  Rather, the question simply will be whether the ordinance enacted is preempted by the Sherman Act.  I see no reason why a different rule of preemption should be applied to testing the validity of municipal ordinances than the standard we presently apply in assessing state statutes.

S. 351</a></span>-352.</p>\n<p>Apart from misconstruing the <em>Parker</em> doctrine as a matter of "exemption" rather than preemption, the majority comes to the startling conclusion that our federalism is in no way implicated when a municipal ordinance is invalidated by the Sherman Act.  I see no principled basis to conclude, as does the Court, that municipal ordinances are more susceptible to invalidation under the Sherman Act than are state statutes.  The majority concludes that, since municipalities are not States, and hence are not "sovereigns," our notions of federalism are not implicated when federal law is applied to invalidate otherwise constitutionally valid municipal legislation.  I find this reasoning remarkable indeed.  Our notions of federalism are implicated when it is contended that a municipal ordinance is preempted by a federal statute.  This Court has made no such distinction between States and their subdivisions with regard to the preemptive effects of federal law.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 455 U. S. 70</a></p><p> The standards applied by this Court are the same regardless of whether the challenged enactment is that of a State or one of its political subdivisions.  <em>See, e.g., City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/624/case.html">411 U. S. 624</a></span> (1973); <em>Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/440/case.html">362 U. S. 440</a></span> (1960).  I suspect that the Court has not intended to so dramatically alter established principles of Supremacy Clause analysis.  Yet this is precisely what it appears to have done by holding that a municipality may invoke the <em>Parker</em> doctrine only to the same extent as can a private litigant.  Since the <em>Parker</em> doctrine is a matter of federal preemption under the Supremacy Clause, it should apply in challenges to municipal regulation in similar fashion as it applies in a challenge to a state regulatory enactment.  The distinction between cities and States created by the majority has no principled basis to support it if the issue is properly framed in terms of preemption, rather than exemption.</p>\n<p>As with the States, the <em>Parker</em> doctrine should be employed to determine whether local legislation has been preempted by the Sherman Act.  Like the State, a municipality should not be haled into federal court in order to justify its decision that competition should be replaced with regulation.  The <em>Parker</em> doctrine correctly holds that the federal interest in protecting and fostering competition is not infringed so long as the state or local regulation is so structured to ensure that it is truly the government, and not the regulated private entities, which is replacing competition with regulation.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>By treating the municipal defendant as no different from the private litigant attempting to invoke the <em>Parker</em> doctrine, the Court\'s decision today will radically alter the relationship between the States and their political subdivisions.  Municipalities will no longer be able to regulate the local economy without the imprimatur of a clearly expressed state policy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="71">Page 455 U. S. 71</a></p><p> to displace competition. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  The decision today effectively destroys the "home rule" movement in this country, through which local governments have obtained, not without persistent state opposition, a limited autonomy over matters of local concern. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  The municipalities that stand most to lose by the decision today are those with the most autonomy.  Where the State is totally disabled from enacting legislation dealing with matters of local concern, the municipality will be defenseless from challenges to its regulation of the local economy.  In such a case, the State is disabled from articulating a policy to displace competition with regulation.  Nothing short of altering the relationship between the municipality and the State will enable the local government to legislate on matters important to its inhabitants.  In order to defend itself from Sherman Act attacks, the home rule municipality will have to cede its authority back to the State.  It is unfortunate enough that the Court today holds that our federalism is not implicated when municipal legislation is invalidated by a federal statute.  It is nothing less than a novel and egregious error when this Court uses the Sherman Act to regulate the relationship between the States and their political subdivisions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Most challenges to municipal ordinances undoubtedly will be made pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1.  One of the elements of a \xc2\xa7 1 violation is proof of a contract, combination, or conspiracy.  It may be argued that municipalities will not face liability under \xc2\xa7 1, because it will be difficult to allege that the enactment of an ordinance was the product of such a contract, combination, or conspiracy.  The ease with which the ordinance in the instant case has been labeled a "contract" will hardly give municipalities solace in this regard.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>It will take a considerable feat of judicial gymnastics to conclude that municipalities are not subject to treble damages to compensate any person "injured in his business or property."  Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15, is mandatory:</p>\n<p>"Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws . . . shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained."</p>\n<p><em>See City of Lafayette v.

Brown,</em> 317 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#350">317 U. S. 350</a></span>; <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v.

A statute is not preempted simply because some conduct contemplated by the statute might violate the antitrust laws.  <em>See Joseph E. Seagram. &amp; Sons, Inc. v Hostetter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/35/case.html">384 U.

Conversely, reliance on a state statute does not insulate a private party from liability under the antitrust laws unless the statute satisfies the <em>Midcal</em> criteria.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/6" name="F3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court understandably avoids determining whether local ordinances must satisfy the "active state supervision" prong of the <em>Midcal</em> test.  It would seem rather odd to require municipal ordinances to be enforced by the State, rather than the city itself.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/7" name="F3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Seeing this opportunity to recapture the power it has lost over local affairs, the State of Colorado, joined by 22 other States, has supported petitioner as <em>amicus curiae.</em>  It is curious, indeed, that these States now seek to use the Supremacy Clause as a sword, when they so often must defend their own enactments from its invalidating effects.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
