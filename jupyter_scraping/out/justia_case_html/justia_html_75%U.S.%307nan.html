No appeal in admiralty could be taken directly from the district court to this Court except when, as in the case of the Southern District of Florida, the district court exercised the jurisdiction of the circuit court as well as that of the district court.</p>\n<p>If this state of the law had undergone no change at the date of the decree of condemnation in this case, the allowance of an appeal to this Court would have been quite regular.</p>\n<p>But the effect of the act of July, 1862, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] was to vest in the circuit court for that circuit the whole appellate jurisdiction exercised by other circuit courts in respect to decrees in admiralty.  It left the original jurisdiction in admiralty of the district court untouched.</p>\n<p>It was in virtue of this original jurisdiction that the district court had cognizance of the case of the <em>Lucy.</em>  The appellate jurisdiction of the case was vested by the act in the circuit court.</p>\n<p>It follows that when the decree was pronounced in August, no appeal could be taken to this Court, but only to the circuit court, and that the allowance of an appeal to this Court was a nullity.</p>\n<p>This objections to the jurisdiction is decisive; but if it were otherwise, the fact that no transcript of the record was filed at the next term would be fatal to the appeal. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>No consent of counsel can give jurisdiction.  Appellate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="310">Page 75 U.
