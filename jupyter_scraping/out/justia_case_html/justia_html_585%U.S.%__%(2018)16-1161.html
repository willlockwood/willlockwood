Under the Wisconsin Constitution, the legislature must redraw the boundaries of those districts following each census.  After the 2010 census, the legislature passed a new districting plan known as Act 43.  Twelve Democratic voters, the plaintiffs in this case, alleged that Act 43 harms the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to convert Democratic votes into Democratic seats in the legislature.  They asserted that Act 43 does this by \xe2\x80\x9ccracking\xe2\x80\x9d certain Democratic voters among different districts in which those voters fail to achieve electoral majorities and \xe2\x80\x9cpacking\xe2\x80\x9d other Democratic voters in a few districts in which Democratic candidates win by large margins.  The plaintiffs argued that the degree to which packing and cracking has favored one political party over another can be measured by an \xe2\x80\x9cefficiency gap\xe2\x80\x9d that compares each party\xe2\x80\x99s respective \xe2\x80\x9cwasted\xe2\x80\x9d votes\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, votes cast for a losing candidate or for a winning candidate in excess of what that candidate needs to win\xe2\x80\x94across all legislative districts.  The plaintiffs claimed that the statewide enforcement of Act 43 generated an excess of wasted Democratic votes, thereby violating the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99\n \nFirst Amendment right of association and their\n \nFourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.  The defendants, several members of the state election commission, moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  They argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Act 43 as a whole because, as individual voters, their legally protected interests extend only to the makeup of the legislative district in which they vote.  The three-judge District Court denied the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion and, following a trial, concluded that Act 43 was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.  Regarding standing, the court held that the plaintiffs had suffered a particularized injury to their equal protection rights.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: The plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate Article III standing.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Over the past five decades this Court has repeatedly been asked to decide what judicially enforceable limits, if any, the Constitution sets on partisan gerrymandering.  Previous attempts at an answer have left few clear landmarks for addressing the question and have generated conflicting views both of how to conceive of the injury arising from partisan gerrymandering and of the appropriate role for the Federal Judiciary in remedying that injury.  See <i>Gaffney</i> v. <i>Cummings,</i>\n\n412 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735, <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Bandemer,</i>\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 109, <i>Vieth</i> v. <i>Jubelirer,</i>\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 267, and <i>League of United Latin American Citizens</i> v. <i>Perry,</i>\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0A plaintiff may not invoke federal-court jurisdiction unless he can show \xe2\x80\x9ca personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Baker</i> v. <i>Carr</i>,\n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186, 204.  That requirement ensures that federal courts \xe2\x80\x9cexercise power that is judicial in nature,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Lance</i> v. <i>Coffman</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437, 439, 441.  To meet that requirement, a plaintiff must show an injury in fact\xe2\x80\x94his pleading and proof that he has suffered the \xe2\x80\x9cinvasion of a legally protected interest\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete and particularized,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, which \xe2\x80\x9caffect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lujan</i> v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i>\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555, 560, and n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The right to vote is \xe2\x80\x9cindividual and personal in nature,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Sims,</i>\n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533, 561, and \xe2\x80\x9cvoters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals have standing to sue\xe2\x80\x9d to remedy that disadvantage, <i>Baker</i>, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 206.  The plaintiffs here alleged that they suffered such injury from partisan gerrymandering, which works through the \xe2\x80\x9ccracking\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpacking\xe2\x80\x9d of voters.  To the extent that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 alleged harm is the dilution of their votes, that injury is district specific.  An individual voter in Wisconsin is placed in a single district.  He votes for a single representative.  The boundaries of the district, and the composition of its voters, determine whether and to what extent a particular voter is packed or cracked.  A plaintiff who complains of gerrymandering, but who does not live in a gerrymandered district, \xe2\x80\x9cassert[s] only a generalized grievance against governmental conduct of which he or she does not approve.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Hays</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737, 745.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The plaintiffs argue that their claim, like the claims presented in <i>Baker</i> and <i>Reynolds</i>, is statewide in nature.  But the holdings in those cases were expressly premised on the understanding that the injuries giving rise to those claims were \xe2\x80\x9cindividual and personal in nature,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Reynolds</i>, 377 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561, because the claims were brought by voters who alleged \xe2\x80\x9cfacts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Baker</i>, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 206.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 mistaken insistence that the claims in <i>Baker</i> and <i>Reynolds</i> were \xe2\x80\x9cstatewide in nature\xe2\x80\x9d rests on a failure to distinguish injury from remedy.  In those malapportionment cases, the only way to vindicate an individual plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s right to an equally weighted vote was through a wholesale \xe2\x80\x9crestructuring of the geographical distribution of seats in a state legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reynolds</i>, 377 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561.  Here, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims turn on allegations that their votes have been diluted.  Because that harm arises from the particular composition of the voter\xe2\x80\x99s own district, remedying the harm does not necessarily require restructuring all of the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districts.  It requires revising only such districts as are necessary to reshape the voter\xe2\x80\x99s district.  This fits the rule that a \xe2\x80\x9cremedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 343, 357.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The plaintiffs argue that their legal injury also extends to the statewide harm to their interest \xe2\x80\x9cin their collective representation in the legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d and in influencing the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s overall \xe2\x80\x9ccomposition and policymaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees 31.  To date, however, the Court has not found that this presents an individual and personal injury of the kind required for Article III standing.  A citizen\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the overall composition of the legislature is embodied in his right to vote for his representative.  The harm asserted by the plaintiffs in this case is best understood as arising from a burden on their own votes.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Four of the plaintiffs in this case pleaded such a particularized burden.  But as their case progressed to trial, they failed to pursue their allegations of individual harm.  They instead rested their case on their theory of statewide injury to Wisconsin Democrats, in support of which they offered three kinds of evidence.  First, they presented testimony pointing to the lead plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s hope of achieving a Democratic majority in the legislature.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases to date, that is a collective political interest, not an individual legal interest.  Second, they produced evidence regarding the mapmakers\xe2\x80\x99 deliberations as they drew district lines.  The District Court relied on this evidence in concluding that those mapmakers sought to understand the partisan effect of the maps they were drawing.  But the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 establishment of injury in fact turns on effect, not intent, and requires a showing of a burden on the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 votes that is \xe2\x80\x9cactual or imminent, not \xe2\x80\x98conjectural\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98hypothetical.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 560.  Third, the plaintiffs presented partisan-asymmetry studies showing that Act 43 had skewed Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statewide map in favor of Republicans.  Those studies do not address the effect that a gerrymander has on the votes of particular citizens.  They measure instead the effect that a gerrymander has on the fortunes of political parties.  That shortcoming confirms the fundamental problem with the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 case as presented on this record.  It is a case about group political interests, not individual legal rights.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0Where a plaintiff has failed to demonstrate standing, this Court usually directs dismissal.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</i> v. <i>Cuno,</i>\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 332, 354.  Here, however, where the case concerns an unsettled kind of claim that the Court has not agreed upon, the contours and justiciability of which are unresolved, the case is remanded to the District Court to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to prove concrete and particularized injuries using evidence that would tend to demonstrate a burden on their individual votes.

A group of Wisconsin Democratic voters filed a complaint in the District Court, alleging that the legislature carried out this task with an eye to diminishing the ability of Wisconsin Democrats to convert Democratic votes into Democratic seats in the legislature.  The plaintiffs asserted that, in so doing, the legislature had infringed their rights under the First and\n \nFourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But a plaintiff seeking relief in federal court must first demonstrate that he has standing to do so, including that he has \xe2\x80\x9ca personal stake in the outcome,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Baker</i> v. <i>Carr</i>,\n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186, 204 (1962), distinct from a \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally available grievance about government,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Lance </i>v. <i>Coffman</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437, 439 (2007) (<i>per curiam</i>).

Certain of the plaintiffs before us alleged that they had such a personal stake in this case, but never followed up with the requisite proof.  The District Court and this Court therefore lack the power to resolve their claims.  We vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings, in the course of which those plaintiffs may attempt to demonstrate standing in accord with the analysis in this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature consists of a State Assembly and a State Senate.

The 99 members of the Assembly are chosen from single districts that must \xe2\x80\x9cconsist of contiguous territory and be in as compact form as practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74.  State senators are likewise chosen from single-member districts, which are laid on top of the State Assembly districts so that three Assembly districts form one Senate district.  See \xc2\xa75; Wis. Stat. \xc2\xa74.001 (2011).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Wisconsin Constitution gives the legislature the responsibility to \xe2\x80\x9capportion and district anew the members of the senate and assembly\xe2\x80\x9d at the first session following each census.  Art. IV, \xc2\xa73.  In recent decades, however, that responsibility has just as often been taken up by federal courts.  Following the census in 1980, 1990, and 2000, federal courts drew the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districts when the Legislature and the Governor\xe2\x80\x94split on party lines\xe2\x80\x94were unable to agree on new districting plans.  The Legislature has broken the logjam just twice in the last 40 years.  In 1983, a Democratic Legislature passed, and a Democratic Governor signed, a new districting plan that remained in effect until the 1990 census.  See 1983 Wis. Laws ch.\xc2\xa04.  In 2011, a Republican Legislature passed, and a Republican Governor signed, the districting plan at issue here, known as Act 43.  See Wis. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa04.009, 4.01\xe2\x80\x934.99; 2011 Wis. Laws ch.\xc2\xa04.  Following the passage of Act 43, Republicans won majorities in the State Assembly in the 2012 and 2014 elections.  In 2012, Republicans won 60 Assembly seats with 48.6% of the two-party statewide vote for Assembly candidates.

The plaintiffs identified themselves as \xe2\x80\x9csupporters of the public policies espoused by the Democratic Party and of Democratic Party candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 App. 32, Complaint \xc2\xb615.  They alleged that Act 43 is a partisan gerrymander that \xe2\x80\x9cunfairly favor[s] Republican voters and candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it does so by \xe2\x80\x9ccracking\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpacking\xe2\x80\x9d Democratic voters around Wisconsin.  <i>Id.,</i> at 28\xe2\x80\x9330, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb65\xe2\x80\x937.  As they explained:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cCracking means dividing a party\xe2\x80\x99s supporters among multiple districts so that they fall short of a majority in each one.  Packing means concentrating one party\xe2\x80\x99s backers in a few districts that they win by overwhelming margins.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 29, \xc2\xb65.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Four of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94Mary Lynne Donohue, Wendy Sue Johnson, Janet Mitchell, and Jerome Wallace\xe2\x80\x94alleged that they lived in State Assembly districts where Democrats have been cracked or packed.  <i>Id.</i>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9336, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb620, 23, 24, 26; see <i>id.,</i> at 50\xe2\x80\x9353, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb660\xe2\x80\x9370 (describing packing and cracking in Assembly Districts 22, 26, 66, and 91).  All of the plaintiffs also alleged that, regardless of \xe2\x80\x9cwhether they themselves reside in a district that has been packed or cracked,\xe2\x80\x9d they have been \xe2\x80\x9charmed by the manipulation of district boundaries\xe2\x80\x9d because Democrats statewide \xe2\x80\x9cdo not have the same opportunity provided to Republicans to elect representatives of their choice to the Assembly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 33, \xc2\xb616.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs argued that, on a statewide level, the degree to which packing and cracking has favored one party over another can be measured by a single calculation: an \xe2\x80\x9cefficiency gap\xe2\x80\x9d that compares each party\xe2\x80\x99s respective \xe2\x80\x9cwasted\xe2\x80\x9d votes across all legislative districts.  \xe2\x80\x9cWasted\xe2\x80\x9d votes are those cast for a losing candidate or for a win- ning candidate in excess of what that candidate needs  to win.  <i>Id.,</i> at 28\xe2\x80\x9329, \xc2\xb65.  The plaintiffs alleged that Act 43 resulted in an unusually large efficiency gap that favored Republicans.  <i>Id.,</i> at 30, \xc2\xb67.  They also submitted a \xe2\x80\x9cDemonstration Plan\xe2\x80\x9d that, they asserted, met all of the legal criteria for apportionment, but was at the same time \xe2\x80\x9calmost perfectly balanced in its partisan consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 31, \xc2\xb610.  They argued that because Act 43 gener- ated a large and unnecessary efficiency gap in favor of Re- publicans, it violated the\n \nFirst Amendment right of association of Wisconsin Democratic voters and their\n \nFourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.  The plaintiffs named several members of the state election commission as defendants in the action.  <i>Id.,</i> at 36, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb628\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The election officials moved to dismiss the complaint.  They argued, among other things, that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Act 43 as a whole because, as individual voters, their legally protected interests extend only to the makeup of the legislative districts in which they vote.  A three-judge panel of the District Court, see\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72284(a), denied the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion.  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cidentif[ied] their injury as not simply their inability to elect a representative in their own districts, but also their reduced opportunity to be represented by Democratic legislators across the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Whitford </i>v. <i>Nichol</i>, 151 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d 918, 924 (WD Wis. 2015).  It therefore followed, in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injury in this case relates to their statewide representation, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. they should be permitted to bring a statewide claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 926.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The case proceeded to trial, where the plaintiffs presented testimony from four fact witnesses.  The first was lead plaintiff William Whitford, a retired law professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.  Whitford testified that he lives in Madison in the 76th Assembly District, and acknowledged on cross-examination that this is, under any plausible circumstances, a heavily Democratic district.  Under Act 43, the Democratic share of the Assembly vote in Whitford\xe2\x80\x99s district is 81.9%; under the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ideal map\xe2\x80\x94their Demonstration Plan\xe2\x80\x94the projected Democratic share of the Assembly vote in Whitford\xe2\x80\x99s district would be 82%.  147 Record 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  Whitford therefore conceded that Act 43 had not \xe2\x80\x9caffected [his] ability to vote for and elect a Democrat in [his] district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 37.  Whitford testified that he had nevertheless suffered a harm \xe2\x80\x9crelate[d] to [his] ability to engage in campaign activity to achieve a majority in the Assembly and the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  As he explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he only practical way to accomplish my policy objectives is to get a majority of the Democrats in the Assembly and the Senate ideally in order to get the legislative product I prefer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 33.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs also presented the testimony of legislative aides Adam Foltz and Tad Ottman, as well as that of Professor Ronald Gaddie, a political scientist who helped design the Act 43 districting map, regarding how that map was designed and adopted.  In particular, Professor Gaddie testified about his creation of what he and the District Court called \xe2\x80\x9cS curves\xe2\x80\x9d: color-coded tables of the estimated partisan skew of different draft redistricting maps.  See 218 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 850, 858.  The colors corresponded with assessments regarding whether different districts tilted Republican or Democratic under various statewide political scenarios.  The S curve for the map that was eventually adopted projected that \xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans would maintain a majority under any likely voting scenario,\xe2\x80\x9d with Democrats needing 54% of the statewide vote to secure a majority in the legislature.  <i>Id.,</i> at 852.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the parties presented testimony from four expert witnesses.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 experts, Professor Kenneth Mayer and Professor Simon Jackman, opined that\xe2\x80\x94according to their efficiency-gap analyses\xe2\x80\x94the Act 43 map would systematically favor Republicans for the duration of the decade.  See <i>id.,</i> at 859\xe2\x80\x93861.  The defendants\xe2\x80\x99 experts, Professor Nicholas Goedert and Sean Trende, opined that efficiency gaps alone are unreliable measures of durable partisan advantage, and that the political geography of Wisconsin currently favors Republicans because Democrats\xe2\x80\x94who tend to be clustered in large cities\xe2\x80\x94are inefficiently distributed in many parts of Wisconsin for purposes of winning elections.  See <i>id.,</i> at 861\xe2\x80\x93862.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the close of evidence, the District Court concluded\xe2\x80\x94over the dissent of Judge Griesbach\xe2\x80\x94that the plaintiffs had proved a violation of the First and\n \nFourteenth Amendments.  The court set out a three-part test for identifying unconstitutional gerrymanders: A redistricting map violates the\n \nFirst Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment if it \xe2\x80\x9c(1) is intended to place a severe impediment on the effectiveness of the votes of individual citizens on the basis of their political affiliation, (2) has that effect, and (3) cannot be justified on other, legitimate legislative grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i>  at 884.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court went on to find, based on evidence concerning the manner in which Act 43 had been adopted, that \xe2\x80\x9cone of the purposes of Act 43 was to secure Republican control of the Assembly under any likely future electoral scenario for the remainder of the decade.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 896.  It also found that the \xe2\x80\x9cmore efficient distribution of Republican voters has allowed the Republican Party to translate its votes into seats with significantly greater ease and to achieve\xe2\x80\x94and preserve\xe2\x80\x94control of the Wisconsin legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 905.  As to the third prong of its test, the District Court concluded that the burdens the Act 43 map imposed on Democrats could not be explained by \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate state prerogatives [or] neutral factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 911.  The court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cWisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s political geography, particularly the high concentration of Democratic voters in urban centers like Milwaukee and Madison, affords the Republican Party a natural, but modest, advantage in the districting process,\xe2\x80\x9d but found that this inherent geographic disparity did not account for the magnitude of the Republican advantage.  <i>Id.,</i> at 921, 924.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Regarding standing, the court held that the plaintiffs had a \xe2\x80\x9ccognizable equal protection right against state-imposed barriers on [their] ability to vote effectively for the party of [their] choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 928.  It concluded that Act 43 \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[ed] Wisconsin Democrats from being able to translate their votes into seats as effectively as Wisconsin Republicans,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cWisconsin Democrats, therefore, have suffered a personal injury to their Equal Protection rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  The court turned away the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 injury was not sufficiently particularized by finding that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he harm that the plaintiffs have experienced .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is one shared by Democratic voters in the State of Wisconsin.  The dilution of their votes is both personal and acute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 930.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Judge Griesbach dissented.  He wrote that, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s existing precedents, \xe2\x80\x9cpartisan intent\xe2\x80\x9d to benefit one party rather than the other in districting \xe2\x80\x9cis not illegal, but is simply the consequence of assigning the task of redistricting to the political branches.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 939.  He observed that the plaintiffs had not attempted to prove that \xe2\x80\x9cspecific districts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. had been gerrymandered,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather had \xe2\x80\x9crelied on statewide data and calculations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  And he argued that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proof, resting as it did on statewide data, had \xe2\x80\x9cno relevance to any gerrymandering injury alleged by a voter in a single district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 952.  On that basis, Judge Griesbach would have entered judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court enjoined the defendants from using the Act 43 map in future elections and ordered them to have a remedial districting plan in place no later than November 1, 2017.  The defendants appealed directly to this Court, as provided under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253.  We stayed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and postponed consideration of our jurisdiction.  582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Over the past five decades this Court has been repeat- edly asked to decide what judicially enforceable limits, if any, the Constitution sets on the gerrymandering of voters along partisan lines.  Our previous attempts at an answer have left few clear landmarks for addressing the question.  What our precedents have to say on the topic is, however, instructive as to the myriad competing considerations that partisan gerrymandering claims involve.  Our efforts to sort through those considerations have generated conflicting views both of how to conceive of the injury arising from partisan gerrymandering and of the appropriate role for the Federal Judiciary in remedying that injury.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our first consideration of a partisan gerrymandering claim came in <i>Gaffney </i>v. <i>Cummings</i>,\n\n412 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735 (1973).  There a group of plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of a Connecticut redistricting plan that \xe2\x80\x9cconsciously and overtly adopted and followed a policy of \xe2\x80\x98political fairness,\xe2\x80\x99 which aimed at a rough scheme of proportional representation of the two major political parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 738.  To that end, the redistricting plan broke up numerous towns, \xe2\x80\x9cwiggl[ing] and joggl[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d district boundary lines in order to \xe2\x80\x9cferret out pockets of each party\xe2\x80\x99s strength.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 738, and n.\xc2\xa03, 752, n.\xc2\xa018.  The plaintiffs argued that, notwithstanding the rough population equality of the districts, the plan was unconstitutional because its consciously political design was \xe2\x80\x9cnothing less than a gigantic political gerrymander.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 752.  This Court rejected that claim.  We reasoned that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cidle\xe2\x80\x9d to hold that \xe2\x80\x9cany political consideration taken into account in fashioning a reapportionment plan is sufficient to invalidate it,\xe2\x80\x9d because districting \xe2\x80\x9cinevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at<i> </i>752\xe2\x80\x93753.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thirteen years later came <i>Davis </i>v. <i>Bandemer</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 109 (1986).  Unlike the bipartisan gerrymander at issue in <i>Gaffney</i>, the allegation in <i>Bandemer</i> was that Indiana Republicans had gerrymandered Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districts \xe2\x80\x9cto favor Republican incumbents and candidates and to disadvantage Democratic voters\xe2\x80\x9d through what the plaintiffs called the \xe2\x80\x9cstacking\xe2\x80\x9d (packing) and \xe2\x80\x9csplitting\xe2\x80\x9d (cracking) of Democrats.  478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 116\xe2\x80\x93117 (plurality opinion).  A majority of the Court agreed that the case before it was justiciable.  <i>Id.,</i> at 125, 127.  The Court could not, however, settle on a standard for what constitutes an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Four Justices would have required the <i>Bandemer </i>plaintiffs to \xe2\x80\x9cprove both intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 127.  In that plurality\xe2\x80\x99s view, the plaintiffs had failed to make a sufficient showing on the latter point because their evidence of unfavorable election results for Democrats was limited to a single election cycle.  See <i>id.,</i> at 135.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Three Justices, concurring in the judgment, would have held that the \xe2\x80\x9cEqual Protection Clause does not supply judicially manageable standards for resolving purely political gerrymandering claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 147 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor took issue, in particular, with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s focus on factual questions concerning \xe2\x80\x9cstatewide electoral success.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 158.  She warned that allowing district courts to \xe2\x80\x9cstrike down apportionment plans on the basis of their prognostications as to the outcome of future elections or future apportionments invites \xe2\x80\x98findings\xe2\x80\x99 on matters as to which neither judges nor anyone else can have any confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 160.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Powell, joined by Justice Stevens, concurred in part and dissented in part.  In his view, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim was not simply that their \xe2\x80\x9cvoting strength was diluted statewide,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather that \xe2\x80\x9ccertain key districts were grotesquely gerrymandered to enhance the election prospects of Republican candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 162, 169.  Thus, he would have focused on the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the boundaries of the voting districts have been distorted deliberately and arbitrarily to achieve illegitimate ends.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 165.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Eighteen years later, we revisited the issue in <i>Vieth </i>v. <i>Jubelirer</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 267 (2004).  In that case the plaintiffs argued that Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature had created \xe2\x80\x9cmeandering and irregular\xe2\x80\x9d congressional districts that \xe2\x80\x9cignored all traditional redistricting criteria, including the preservation of local government boundaries,\xe2\x80\x9d in order to provide an advantage to Republican candidates for Congress.  <i>Id.,</i> at 272\xe2\x80\x93273 (plurality opinion) (brackets  omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Vieth </i>Court broke down on numerous lines.  Writing for a four-Justice plurality, Justice Scalia would have held that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims were nonjusticiable because there was no \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially discernible and manageable standard\xe2\x80\x9d by which to decide them.  <i>Id.,</i> at 306.  On those grounds, the plurality affirmed the dismissal of the claims.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Justice Kennedy concurred in the judgment.  He noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting,\xe2\x80\x9d and that, consequently, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden\xe2\x80\x9d on constitutional rights.  <i>Id.,</i> at 307\xe2\x80\x93308.  He rejected the principle advanced by the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9ca majority of voters in [Pennsylvania] should be able to elect a majority of [Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s] congressional delegation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as a \xe2\x80\x9cprecept\xe2\x80\x9d for which there is \xe2\x80\x9cno authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 308.  Yet Justice Kennedy recognized the possibility that \xe2\x80\x9cin another case a standard might emerge that suit- ably demonstrates how an apportionment\xe2\x80\x99s <i>de\xc2\xa0facto</i> incorporation of partisan classifications burdens\xe2\x80\x9d representational rights.  <i>Id.,</i> at 312.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Four Justices dissented in three different opinions.  Justice Stevens would have permitted the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims to proceed on a district-by-district basis, using a legal standard similar to the standard for racial gerrymandering set forth in <i>Shaw </i>v. <i>Hunt</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 899 (1996).  See 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 335\xe2\x80\x93336, 339.  Under this standard, any district with a \xe2\x80\x9cbizarre shape\xe2\x80\x9d for which the only possible explanation was \xe2\x80\x9ca naked desire to increase partisan strength\xe2\x80\x9d would be found unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.  <i>Id.,</i> at 339.  Justice Souter, joined by Justice Ginsburg, agreed that a plaintiff alleging unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering should proceed on a district-by-district basis, as \xe2\x80\x9cwe would be able to call more readily on some existing law when we defined what is suspect at the district level.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.,</i> at 346\xe2\x80\x93347.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Breyer dissented on still other grounds.  In his view, the drawing of single-member legislative districts\xe2\x80\x94even according to traditional criteria\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9crarely .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. politically neutral.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 359.  He therefore would have distinguished between gerrymandering for passing political advantage and gerrymandering leading to the \xe2\x80\x9cunjustified entrenchment\xe2\x80\x9d of a political party.  <i>Id.,</i> at 360\xe2\x80\x93361.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court last took up this question in <i>League of United Latin American Citizens </i>v. <i>Perry</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399 (2006) (<i>LULAC</i>).  The plaintiffs there challenged a mid-decade redistricting map passed by the Texas Legislature.  As in <i>Vieth</i>, a majority of the Court could find no justiciable standard by which to resolve the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 partisan gerrymandering claims.  Relevant to this case, an <i>amicus</i> brief in support of the <i>LULAC </i>plaintiffs proposed a \xe2\x80\x9csymmetry standard\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmeasure partisan bias\xe2\x80\x9d by comparing how the two major political parties \xe2\x80\x9cwould fare hypothetically if they each .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. received a given percentage of the vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 419 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  Justice Kennedy noted some wariness at the prospect of \xe2\x80\x9cadopting a constitutional standard that invalidates a map based on unfair results that would occur in a hypothetical state of affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 420.  Aside from that problem, he wrote, the partisan bias standard shed no light on \xe2\x80\x9chow much partisan dominance is too much.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Justice Kennedy therefore concluded that \xe2\x80\x9casymmetry alone is not a reliable measure of unconstitutional partisanship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Stevens would have found that the Texas<i> </i>map was a partisan gerrymander based in part on the asymmetric advantage it conferred on Republicans in converting votes to seats.  <i>Id.,</i> at 466\xe2\x80\x93467, 471\xe2\x80\x93473 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Justice Souter, writing for himself and Justice Ginsburg, noted that he would not \xe2\x80\x9crule out the utility of a criterion of symmetry,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cfurther attention could be devoted to the administrability of such a criterion at all levels of redistricting and its review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 483\xe2\x80\x93484 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">At argument on appeal in this case, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that this Court <i>can</i> address the problem of partisan gerrymandering because it <i>must</i>: The Court should exercise its power here because it is the \xe2\x80\x9conly institution in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d capable of \xe2\x80\x9csolv[ing] this problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 62.  Such invitations must be answered with care.  \xe2\x80\x9cFailure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Clinton </i>v. <i>City of New York</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 417, 449 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Our power as judges to \xe2\x80\x9csay what the law is,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Marbury </i>v. <i>Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), rests not on the default of politically accountable officers, but is instead grounded in and limited by the necessity of resolving, according to legal principles, a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s particular claim of legal right.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our considerable efforts in <i>Gaffney</i>,<i> Bandemer</i>,<i> Vieth</i>,<i> </i>and <i>LULAC </i>leave unresolved whether such claims may be brought in cases involving allegations of partisan gerrymandering.  In particular, two threshold questions remain: what is necessary to show standing in a case of this sort, and whether those claims are justiciable.  Here we do not decide the latter question because the plaintiffs in this case have not shown standing under the theory upon which they based their claims for relief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To ensure that the Federal Judiciary respects \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper\xe2\x80\x94and properly limited\xe2\x80\x94role of the courts in a democratic society,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Allen </i>v. <i>Wright</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737, 750 (1984), a plaintiff may not invoke federal-court jurisdiction unless he can show \xe2\x80\x9ca personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Baker</i>, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 204.  A federal court is not \xe2\x80\x9ca forum for generalized grievances,\xe2\x80\x9d and the requirement of such a personal stake \xe2\x80\x9censures that courts exercise power that is judicial in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lance</i>, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 439, 441.  We enforce that requirement by insisting that a plaintiff satisfy the familiar three-part test for Article III standing: that he \xe2\x80\x9c(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Spokeo, Inc. </i>v. <i>Robins</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6).  Foremost among these requirements is injury in fact\xe2\x80\x94a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s pleading and proof that he has suffered the \xe2\x80\x9cinvasion of a legally protected interest\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete and particularized,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, which \xe2\x80\x9caffect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lujan</i> v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555, 560, and n.\xc2\xa01 (1992)<i>.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have long recognized that a person\xe2\x80\x99s right to vote is \xe2\x80\x9cindividual and personal in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Sims</i>,\n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533, 561 (1964).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cvoters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals have standing to sue\xe2\x80\x9d to remedy that disadvantage.  <i>Baker</i>, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 206.  The plaintiffs in this case alleged that they suffered such injury from partisan gerrymandering, which works through \xe2\x80\x9cpacking\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccracking\xe2\x80\x9d voters of one party to disadvantage those voters.  1 App. 28\xe2\x80\x9329, 32\xe2\x80\x9333, Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb65, 15.  That is, the plaintiffs claim a constitutional right not to be placed in legislative districts deliberately designed to \xe2\x80\x9cwaste\xe2\x80\x9d their votes in elections where their chosen candidates will win in landslides (packing) or are destined to lose by closer margins (cracking).  <i>Id.,</i> at 32\xe2\x80\x9333, \xc2\xb615.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To the extent the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 alleged harm is the dilution of their votes, that injury is district specific.  An individual voter in Wisconsin is placed in a single district.  He votes for a single representative.  The boundaries of the district, and the composition of its voters, determine whether and to what extent a particular voter is packed or cracked.  This \xe2\x80\x9cdisadvantage to [the voter] as [an] individual[\xc2\xa0],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Baker</i>, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 206, therefore results from the boundaries of the particular district in which he resides.  And a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s remedy must be \xe2\x80\x9climited to the inadequacy that produced [his] injury in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 343, 357 (1996).  In this case the remedy that is proper and sufficient lies in the revision of the boundaries of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s own district.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For similar reasons, we have held that a plaintiff who alleges that he is the object of a racial gerrymander\xe2\x80\x94a drawing of district lines on the basis of race\xe2\x80\x94has standing to assert only that his own district has been so gerrymandered.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hays</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737, 744\xe2\x80\x93745 (1995).  A plaintiff who complains of gerrymandering, but who does not live in a gerrymandered district, \xe2\x80\x9cassert[s] only a generalized grievance against governmental conduct of which he or she does not approve.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 745.  Plaintiffs who complain of racial gerrymandering in their State cannot sue to invalidate the whole State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districting map; such complaints must proceed \xe2\x80\x9cdistrict-by-district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 6).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs argue that their claim of statewide injury is analogous to the claims presented in <i>Baker</i> and <i>Reynolds</i>, which they assert were \xe2\x80\x9cstatewide in nature\xe2\x80\x9d because they rested on allegations that \xe2\x80\x9cdistricts <i>throughout a state</i> [had] been malapportioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees 29.  But, as we have already noted, the holdings in <i>Baker</i> and <i>Reynolds </i>were expressly premised on the understanding that the injuries giving rise to those claims were \xe2\x80\x9cindividual and personal in nature,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Reynolds</i>, 377 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561, because the claims were brought by voters who alleged \xe2\x80\x9cfacts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Baker</i>, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 206.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 mistaken insistence that the claims in <i>Baker </i>and <i>Reynolds </i>were \xe2\x80\x9cstatewide in nature\xe2\x80\x9d rests on a failure to distinguish injury from remedy.  In those malapportionment cases, the only way to vindicate an individual plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s right to an equally weighted vote was through a wholesale \xe2\x80\x9crestructuring of the geographical distribution of seats in a state legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reynolds</i>, 377 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561; see, <i>e.g., Moss </i>v. <i>Burkhart</i>, 220 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 149, 156\xe2\x80\x93160 (WD Okla. 1963) (directing the county-by-county reapportionment of the Oklahoma Legislature), aff\xe2\x80\x99d<i> sub\xc2\xa0nom. Williams </i>v. <i>Moss</i>,\n\n378 U.\xc2\xa0S. 558 (1964) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 partisan gerrymandering claims turn on allegations that their votes have been diluted.  That harm arises from the particular composition of the voter\xe2\x80\x99s own district, which causes his vote\xe2\x80\x94having been packed or cracked\xe2\x80\x94to carry less weight than it would carry in another, hypothetical district.  Remedying the individual voter\xe2\x80\x99s harm, therefore, does not necessarily require restructuring all of the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districts.  It requires revising only such districts as are necessary to reshape the voter\xe2\x80\x99s district\xe2\x80\x94so that the voter may be unpacked or uncracked, as the case may be.  Cf. <i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  This fits the rule that a \xe2\x80\x9cremedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lewis</i>, 518 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 357.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs argue that their legal injury is not limited to the injury that they have suffered as individual voters, but extends also to the statewide harm to their interest \xe2\x80\x9cin their collective representation in the legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d and in influencing the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s overall \xe2\x80\x9ccomposition and policymaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees 31.  But our cases to date have not found that this presents an individual and personal injury of the kind required for Article III standing.  On the facts of this case, the plaintiffs may not rely on \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of undifferentiated, generalized grievance about the conduct of government that we have refused to countenance in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lance</i>, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 442.  A citizen\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the overall composition of the legislature is embodied in his right to vote for his representative.  And the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s abstract interest in policies adopted by the legislature on the facts here is a nonjusticiable \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral interest common to all members of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte L\xc3\xa9vitt</i>,\n\n302 U.\xc2\xa0S. 633, 634 (1937) (<i>per curiam</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We leave for another day consideration of other possible theories of harm not presented here and whether those theories might present justiciable claims giving rise to statewide remedies.  Justice Kagan\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion endeavors to address \xe2\x80\x9cother kinds of constitutional harm,\xe2\x80\x9d see <i>post, </i>at 8, perhaps involving different kinds of plaintiffs, see <i>post, </i>at 9, and differently alleged burdens, see <i>ibid.</i>  But the opinion of the Court rests on the understanding that we lack jurisdiction to decide this case, much less to draw speculative and advisory conclusions regarding others.  See <i>Public Workers</i> v. <i>Mitchell</i>,\n\n330 U.\xc2\xa0S. 75, 90 (1947) (noting that courts must \xe2\x80\x9crespect the limits of [their] unique authority\xe2\x80\x9d and engage in \xe2\x80\x9c[j]udicial exposition .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. only when necessary to decide definite issues between litigants\xe2\x80\x9d).  The reasoning of this Court with respect to the disposition of this case is set forth in this opinion and none other.  And the sum of the standing principles articulated here, as applied to this case, is that the harm asserted by the plaintiffs is best understood as arising from a burden on those plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 own votes.  In this gerrymandering context that burden arises through a voter\xe2\x80\x99s placement in a \xe2\x80\x9ccracked\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpacked\xe2\x80\x9d district.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Four of the plaintiffs in this case\xe2\x80\x94Mary Lynne Donohue, Wendy Sue Johnson, Janet Mitchell, and Jerome Wallace\xe2\x80\x94pleaded a particularized burden along such lines.  They alleged that Act 43 had \xe2\x80\x9cdilut[ed] the influence\xe2\x80\x9d of their votes as a result of packing or cracking in their legislative districts.  See 1 App. 34\xe2\x80\x9336, Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb620, 23, 24, 26.  The facts necessary to establish standing, however, must not only be alleged at the pleading stage, but also proved at trial.  See <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561.  As the proceedings in the District Court progressed to trial, the plaintiffs failed to meaningfully pursue their allegations of individual harm.  The plaintiffs did not seek to show such requisite harm since, on this record, it appears that not a single plaintiff sought to prove that he or she lives in a cracked or packed district.  They instead rested their case at trial\xe2\x80\x94and their arguments before this Court\xe2\x80\x94on their theory of statewide injury to Wisconsin Democrats, in support of which they offered three kinds of evidence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the plaintiffs presented the testimony of the lead plaintiff, Professor Whitford.  But Whitford\xe2\x80\x99s testimony does not support any claim of packing or cracking of himself as a voter.  Indeed, Whitford expressly acknowledged that Act 43 did not affect the weight of his vote.  147 Record 37.  His testimony points merely to his hope of achieving a Democratic majority in the legislature\xe2\x80\x94what the plaintiffs describe here as their shared interest in the composition of \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislature as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees 32.  Under our cases to date, that is a collective political interest, not an individual legal interest, and the Court must be cautious that it does not become \xe2\x80\x9ca forum for generalized grievances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lance</i>, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 439, 441.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the plaintiffs provided evidence regarding the mapmakers\xe2\x80\x99 deliberations as they drew district lines.  As the District Court recounted, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 evidence showed that the mapmakers \xe2\x80\x9ctest[ed] the partisan makeup and performance of districts as they might be configured in different ways.\xe2\x80\x9d  218 F. Supp. 3d, at 891.  Each of the mapmakers\xe2\x80\x99 alternative configurations came with a table that listed the number of \xe2\x80\x9cSafe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLean\xe2\x80\x9d seats for each party, as well as \xe2\x80\x9cSwing\xe2\x80\x9d seats.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The mapmakers also labeled certain districts as ones in which \xe2\x80\x9cGOP seats [would be] strengthened a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 893; 2 App. 344, or which would result in \xe2\x80\x9cStatistical Pick Ups\xe2\x80\x9d for Republicans.  218 F. Supp. 3d, at 893 (alterations omitted).  And they identified still other districts in which \xe2\x80\x9cGOP seats [would be] strengthened a little,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cweakened a little,\xe2\x80\x9d or were \xe2\x80\x9clikely lost.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court relied upon this evidence in concluding that, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the outset of the redistricting process, the drafters sought to understand the partisan effect of the maps they were drawing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 895.  That evidence may well be pertinent with respect to any ultimate determination whether the plaintiffs may prevail in their claims against the defendants, assuming such claims present a justiciable controversy.  But the question at this point is whether the plaintiffs have established injury in fact.  That turns on effect, not intent, and requires a showing of a burden on the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 votes that is \xe2\x80\x9cactual or imminent, not \xe2\x80\x98conjectural\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98hypothetical.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 560.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the plaintiffs offered evidence concerning the impact that Act 43 had in skewing Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s statewide political map in favor of Republicans.  This evidence, which made up the heart of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 case, was derived from partisan-asymmetry studies similar to those discussed in <i>LULAC</i>.  The plaintiffs contend that these studies measure deviations from \xe2\x80\x9cpartisan symmetry,\xe2\x80\x9d which they describe as the \xe2\x80\x9csocial scientific tenet that [districting] maps should treat parties symmetrically.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees 37.  In the District Court, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 case rested largely on a particular measure of partisan asymmetry\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cefficiency gap\xe2\x80\x9d of wasted votes.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  That measure was first developed in two academic articles published shortly before the initiation of this lawsuit.  See Stephanopoulos &amp; McGhee, Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap, 82 U. Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 831 (2015); McGhee, Measuring Partisan Bias in Single-Member District Electoral Systems, 39 Leg. Studies Q. 55 (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs asserted in their complaint that the \xe2\x80\x9cefficiency gap captures in a single number all of a district plan\xe2\x80\x99s cracking and packing.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 App. 28\xe2\x80\x9329, Complaint \xc2\xb65 (emphasis deleted).  That number is calculated by subtracting the statewide sum of one party\xe2\x80\x99s wasted votes from the statewide sum of the other party\xe2\x80\x99s wasted votes and dividing the result by the statewide sum of all votes cast, where \xe2\x80\x9cwasted votes\xe2\x80\x9d are defined as all votes cast for a losing candidate and all votes cast for a winning candidate beyond the 50% plus one that ensures victory.  See Brief for Eric McGhee as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 6, and n.\xc2\xa03.  The larger the number produced by that calculation, the greater the asymmetry between the parties in their efficiency in converting votes into legislative seats.  Though they take no firm position on the matter, the plaintiffs have suggested that an efficiency gap in the range of 7% to 10% should trigger constitutional scrutiny.  See Brief for Appellees 52\xe2\x80\x9353, and n.\xc2\xa017.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The plaintiffs and their <i>amici curiae </i>promise us that the efficiency gap and similar measures of partisan asymmetry will allow the federal courts\xe2\x80\x94armed with just \xe2\x80\x9ca pencil and paper or a hand calculator\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to finally solve the problem of partisan gerrymandering that has confounded the Court for decades.  Brief for Heather K. Gerken et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 27 (citing Wang, Let Math Save Our Democracy, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Dec. 5, 2015).  We need not doubt the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 math.  The difficulty for standing purposes is that these calculations are an average measure.  They do not address the effect that a gerrymander has on the votes of particular citizens.  Partisan-asymmetry metrics such as the efficiency gap measure something else en- tirely: the effect that a gerrymander has on the fortunes of political parties.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider the situation of Professor Whitford, who lives in District 76, where, defendants contend, Democrats are \xe2\x80\x9cnaturally\xe2\x80\x9d packed due to their geographic concentration, with that of plaintiff Mary Lynne Donohue, who lives in Assembly District 26 in Sheboygan, where Democrats like her have allegedly been deliberately cracked.  By all accounts, Act 43 has not affected Whitford\xe2\x80\x99s individual vote for his Assembly representative\xe2\x80\x94even plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 own demonstration map resulted in a virtually identical district for him.  Donohue, on the other hand, alleges that Act 43 burdened her individual vote.  Yet neither the effi- ciency gap nor the other measures of partisan asymmetry offered by the plaintiffs are capable of telling the difference between what Act 43 did to Whitford and what it did to Donohue.  The single statewide measure of partisan advantage delivered by the efficiency gap treats Whitford and Donohue as indistinguishable, even though their individual situations are quite different.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That shortcoming confirms the fundamental problem with the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 case as presented on this record.  It is a case about group political interests, not individual legal rights.  But this Court is not responsible for vindicating generalized partisan preferences.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionally prescribed role is to vindicate the individual rights of the people appearing before it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In cases where a plaintiff fails to demonstrate Article III standing, we usually direct the dismissal of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</i> v.<i> Cuno</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 332, 354 (2006).  This is not the usual case.  It concerns an unsettled kind of claim this Court has not agreed upon, the contours and justiciability of which are unresolved.  Under the circumstances, and in light of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 allegations that Donohue, Johnson, Mitchell, and Wallace live in districts where Democrats like them have been packed or cracked, we decline to direct dismissal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We therefore remand the case to the District Court so that the plaintiffs may have an opportunity to prove concrete and particularized injuries using evidence\xe2\x80\x94unlike the bulk of the evidence presented thus far\xe2\x80\x94that would tend to demonstrate a burden on their individual votes.  Cf. <i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (remanding for further consideration of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 gerrymandering claims on a district-by-district basis).  We express no view on the merits of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 case.  We caution, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cstanding is not dispensed in gross\xe2\x80\x9d: A plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s particular injury.  <i>Cuno</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3916573">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 16\xe2\x80\x931161</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">BEVERLY R.

I do not join Part III, which gives the plaintiffs another chance to prove their standing on remand.  When a plaintiff lacks standing, our ordinary practice is to remand the case with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  <i>E.g.,</i> <i>Lance </i>v. <i>Coffman</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437, 442 (2007) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</i> v. <i>Cuno</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 332, 354 (2006); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hays</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737, 747 (1995).  The Court departs from our usual practice because this is supposedly \xe2\x80\x9cnot the usual case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 21.  But there is nothing unusual about it.  As the Court explains, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lack of standing follows from long-established principles of law.  See <i>ante,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9317.  After a year and a half of litigation in the District Court, including a 4-day trial, the plaintiffs had a more-than-ample opportunity to prove their standing under these principles.  They failed to do so.

See <i>ante,</i> at 14\xe2\x80\x9317.  The Court also holds that none of the plaintiffs here have yet made that required showing.  See <i>ante, </i>at 17.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I agree with both conclusions, and with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to remand this case to allow the plaintiffs to prove that they live in packed or cracked districts, see <i>ante,</i> at 21.  I write to address in more detail what kind of evidence the present plaintiffs (or any additional ones) must offer to support that allegation.  And I write to make some observations about what would happen if they succeed in proving standing\xe2\x80\x94that is, about how their vote dilution case could then proceed on the merits.  The key point is that the case could go forward in much the same way it did below: Given the charges of statewide packing and cracking, affecting a slew of districts and residents, the challengers could make use of statewide evidence and seek a statewide remedy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I also write separately because I think the plaintiffs may have wanted to do more than present a vote dilution theory.  Partisan gerrymandering no doubt burdens individual votes, but it also causes other harms.  And at some points in this litigation, the plaintiffs complained of a different injury\xe2\x80\x94an infringement of their\n \nFirst Amendment right of association.  The Court rightly does not address that alternative argument: The plaintiffs did not advance it with sufficient clarity or concreteness to make it a real part of the case.  But because on remand they may well develop the associational theory, I address the standing requirement that would then apply.  As I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain, a plaintiff presenting such a theory would not need to show that her particular voting district was packed or cracked for standing purposes because that fact would bear no connection to her substantive claim.  Indeed, everything about the litigation of that claim\xe2\x80\x94from standing on down to remedy\xe2\x80\x94would be statewide in nature.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Partisan gerrymandering, as this Court has recognized, is \xe2\x80\x9cincompatible with democratic principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arizona State Legislature</i> v. <i>Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015)<i> </i>(slip op., at 1) (quoting <i>Vieth</i> v. <i>Jubelirer</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 267, 292 (2004) (plurality opinion); alterations omitted).  More effectively every day, that practice enables politicians to entrench themselves in power against the people\xe2\x80\x99s will.  And only the courts can do anything to remedy the problem, because gerrymanders benefit those who control the political branches.  None of those facts gives judges any excuse to disregard Article III\xe2\x80\x99s demands.  The Court is right to say they were not met here.  But partisan gerrymandering injures enough individuals and organizations in enough concrete ways to ensure that standing requirements, properly applied, will not often or long prevent courts from reaching the merits of cases like this one.  Or from insisting, when they do, that partisan officials stop degrading the nation\xe2\x80\x99s democracy.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As the Court explains, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 theory in this case focuses on vote dilution.  See <i>ante,</i> at 15 (\xe2\x80\x9cHere, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 partisan gerrymandering claims turn on allegations that their votes have been diluted\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>ante,</i> at 14, 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  That is, the plaintiffs assert that Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s State Assembly Map has caused their votes \xe2\x80\x9cto carry less weight than [they] would carry in another, hypothetical district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  And the mechanism used to wreak that harm is \xe2\x80\x9cpacking\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccracking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.  In a relatively few districts, the mapmakers packed supermajorities of Democratic voters\xe2\x80\x94well beyond the number needed for a Democratic candidate to prevail.  And in many more districts, dispersed throughout the State, the mapmakers cracked Democratic voters\xe2\x80\x94spreading them sufficiently thin to prevent them from electing their preferred candidates.  The result of both practices is to \xe2\x80\x9cwaste\xe2\x80\x9d Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 votes.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The harm of vote dilution, as this Court has long stated, is \xe2\x80\x9cindividual and personal in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Sims</i>,\n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533, 561 (1964); see <i>ante,</i> at 15.  It arises when an election practice\xe2\x80\x94most commonly, the drawing of district lines\xe2\x80\x94devalues one citizen\xe2\x80\x99s vote as compared to others.  Of course, such practices invariably affect more than one citizen at a time.  For example, our original one-person, one-vote cases considered how malapportioned maps \xe2\x80\x9ccontract[ed] the value\xe2\x80\x9d of urban citizens\xe2\x80\x99 votes while \xe2\x80\x9cexpand[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the value of rural citizens\xe2\x80\x99 votes.  <i>Wesberry</i> v. <i>Sanders</i>,\n\n376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 7 (1964).  But we understood the injury as giving diminished weight to each particular vote, even if millions were so touched.  In such cases, a voter living in an overpopulated district suffered \xe2\x80\x9cdisadvantage to [herself] as [an] individual[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d: Her vote counted for less than the votes of other citizens in her State.  <i>Baker</i> v. <i>Carr</i>,\n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186, 206 (1962); see <i>ante,</i> at 15.  And that kind of disadvantage is what a plaintiff asserting a vote dilution claim\xe2\x80\x94in the one-person, one-vote context or any other\xe2\x80\x94always alleges.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To have standing to bring a partisan gerrymandering claim based on vote dilution, then, a plaintiff must prove that the value of her own vote has been \xe2\x80\x9ccontract[ed].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wesberry</i>, 376 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 7.  And that entails showing, as the Court holds, that she lives in a district that has been either packed or cracked.  See <i>ante,</i> at 17.  For packing and cracking are the ways in which a partisan gerrymander dilutes votes.  Cf. <i>Voinovich</i> v. <i>Quilter</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146, 153\xe2\x80\x93154 (1993) (explaining that packing or cracking can also support racial vote dilution claims).  Consider the perfect form of each variety.  When a voter resides in a packed district, her preferred candidate will win no matter what; when a voter lives in a cracked district, her chosen candidate stands no chance of prevailing.  But either way, such a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s vote carries less weight\xe2\x80\x94has less consequence\xe2\x80\x94than it would under a neutrally drawn map.  See <i>ante,</i> at 14, 16.  So when she shows that her district has been packed or cracked, she proves, as she must to establish standing, that she is \xe2\x80\x9camong the injured.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lujan</i> v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555, 563 (1992) (quoting<i> Sierra Club</i> v. <i>Morton</i>,\n\n405 U.\xc2\xa0S. 727, 735 (1972)); see <i>ante, </i>at 17.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In many partisan gerrymandering cases, that threshold showing will not be hard to make.  Among other ways of proving packing or cracking, a plaintiff could produce an alternative map (or set of alternative maps)\xe2\x80\x94comparably consistent with traditional districting principles\xe2\x80\x94under which her vote would carry more weight.  Cf. <i>Ante,</i> at 20 (suggesting how an alternative map may shed light on vote dilution or its absence); <i>Easley</i> v. <i>Cromartie</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234, 258 (2001) (discussing the use of alternative maps as evidence in a racial gerrymandering case); <i>Cooper</i> v. <i>Harris</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2017) (slip op., at 28\xe2\x80\x9334) (same); Brief for Political Geography Scholars as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12\xe2\x80\x9314 (describing computer simulation techniques for devising alternative maps).  For example, a Democratic plaintiff living in a 75%-Democratic district could prove she was packed by presenting a different map, drawn without a focus on partisan advantage, that would place her in a 60%-Democratic district.  Or conversely, a Democratic plaintiff residing in a 35%-Democratic district could prove she was cracked by offering an alternative, neutrally drawn map putting her in a 50\xe2\x80\x9350 district.  The precise numbers are of no import.  The point is that the plaintiff can show, through drawing alternative district lines, that partisan-based packing or cracking diluted her vote.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, the Court is right that the plaintiffs have so far failed to make such a showing.  See <i>ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9320.  William Whitford was the only plaintiff to testify at trial about the alleged gerrymander\xe2\x80\x99s effects.  He expressly acknowledged that his district would be materially identical under any conceivable map, whether or not drawn to achieve partisan advantage.  See <i>ante,</i> at 18, 20.  That means Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s plan could not have diluted Whitford\xe2\x80\x99s own vote.  So whatever other claims he might have, see <i>infra</i>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, Whitford is not \xe2\x80\x9camong the injured\xe2\x80\x9d in a vote dilution challenge.  <i>Lujan</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 563 (quoting <i>Sierra Club</i>, 405 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 735).  Four other plaintiffs differed from Whitford by alleging in the complaint that they lived in packed or cracked districts.  But for whatever reason, they failed to back up those allegations with evidence as the suit proceeded.  See <i>ante,</i> at 17.  So they too did not show the injury\xe2\x80\x94a less valuable vote\xe2\x80\x94central to their vote dilution theory.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That problem, however, may be readily fixable.  The Court properly remands this case to the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cso that the plaintiffs may have an opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate a burden on their individual votes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 21.  That means the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94both the four who initially made those assertions and any others (current or newly joined)\xe2\x80\x94now can introduce evidence that their individual districts were packed or cracked.  And if the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 more general charges have a basis in fact, that evidence may well be at hand.  Recall that the plaintiffs here alleged\xe2\x80\x94and the District Court found, see 218 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 837, 896 (WD Wis. 2016)\xe2\x80\x94that a unified Republican government set out to ensure that Republicans would control as many State Assembly seats as possible over a decade (five consecutive election cycles).  To that end, the government allegedly packed and cracked Democrats throughout the State, not just in a particular district (see, <i>e.g., Benisek </i>v. <i>Lamone</i>, No. 17\xe2\x80\x93333) or region.  Assuming that is true, the plaintiffs should have a mass of packing and cracking proof, which they can now also present in district-by-district form to support their standing.  In other words, a plaintiff residing in each affected district can show, through an alternative map or other evidence, that packing or cracking indeed occurred there.  And if (or to the extent) that test is met, the court can proceed to decide all distinctive merits issues and award appropriate remedies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the court addresses those merits questions, it can consider statewide (as well as local) evidence.  Of course, the court below and others like it are currently debating, without guidance from this Court, what elements make up a vote dilution claim in the partisan gerrymandering context.  But assume that the plaintiffs must prove illicit partisan intent\xe2\x80\x94a purpose to dilute Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 votes in drawing district lines.  The plaintiffs could then offer evidence about the mapmakers\xe2\x80\x99 goals in formulating the entire statewide map (which would predictably carry down to individual districting decisions).  So, for example, the plaintiffs here introduced proof that the mapmakers looked to partisan voting data when drawing districts throughout the State\xe2\x80\x94and that they graded draft maps according to the amount of advantage those maps conferred on Republicans.  See 218 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 890\xe2\x80\x93896.  This Court has explicitly recognized the relevance of such statewide evidence in addressing racial gerrymandering claims of a district-specific nature.  \xe2\x80\x9cVoters,\xe2\x80\x9d we held, \xe2\x80\x9cof course[\xc2\xa0] can present statewide <i>evidence </i>in order to prove racial gerrymandering in a particular district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 7).  And in particular, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch evidence is perfectly relevant\xe2\x80\x9d to showing that mapmakers had an invidious \xe2\x80\x9cmotive\xe2\x80\x9d in drawing the lines of \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple districts in the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 10).  The same should be true for partisan gerrymandering.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Similarly, cases like this one might warrant a statewide remedy.  Suppose that mapmakers pack or crack a critical mass of State Assembly districts all across the State to elect as many Republican politicians as possible.  And suppose plaintiffs residing in those districts prevail in a suit challenging that gerrymander on a vote dilution theory.  The plaintiffs might then receive exactly the relief sought in this case.  To be sure, remedying each plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s vote dilution injury \xe2\x80\x9crequires revising only such districts as are necessary to reshape [that plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] district\xe2\x80\x94so that the [plaintiff] may be unpacked or uncracked, as the case may be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  But with enough plaintiffs joined together\xe2\x80\x94attacking all the packed and cracked districts in a statewide gerrymander\xe2\x80\x94those obligatory revisions could amount to a wholesale restructuring of the State\xe2\x80\x99s districting plan.  The Court recognizes as much.  It states that a proper remedy in a vote dilution case \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not <i>necessarily </i>require restructuring all of the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).  Not necessarily\xe2\x80\x94but possibly.  It all depends on how much redistricting is needed to cure all the packing and cracking that the mapmakers have done.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Everything said so far relates only to suits alleging that a partisan gerrymander dilutes individual votes.  That is the way the Court sees this litigation.  See <i>ante, </i>at 14\xe2\x80\x9317.  And as I\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss, that is the most reasonable view.  See <i>infra</i>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But partisan gerrymanders inflict other kinds of constitutional harm as well.  Among those injuries, partisan gerrymanders may infringe the\n \nFirst Amendment rights of association held by parties, other political organizations, and their members.  The plaintiffs here have sometimes pointed to that kind of harm.  To the extent they meant to do so, and choose to do so on remand, their associational claim would occasion a different standing inquiry than the one in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Kennedy explained the\n \nFirst Amendment associational injury deriving from a partisan gerrymander in his concurring opinion in <i>Vieth</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 267.  \xe2\x80\x9cRepresentative democracy,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Kennedy pointed out, is today \xe2\x80\x9cunimaginable without the ability of citizens to band together\xe2\x80\x9d to advance their political beliefs.  <i>Id.,</i> at 314 (opinion concurring in judgment) (quoting <i>California Democratic Party</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 567, 574 (2000)).  That means significant \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFirst Amendment concerns arise\xe2\x80\x9d when a State purposely \xe2\x80\x9csubject[s] a group of voters or their party to disfavored treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 314.  Such action \xe2\x80\x9cburden[s] a group of voters\xe2\x80\x99 representational rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>id.,</i> at 315 (similarly describing the \xe2\x80\x9cburden[] on a disfavored party and its voters\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cburden [on] a group\xe2\x80\x99s representational rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it does so because of their \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical association,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cparticipation in the electoral process,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cvoting history,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexpression of political views.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 314\xe2\x80\x93315.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As so formulated, the associational harm of a partisan gerrymander is distinct from vote dilution.  Consider an active member of the Democratic Party in Wisconsin who resides in a district that a partisan gerrymander has left untouched (neither packed nor cracked).  His individual vote carries no less weight than it did before.  But if the gerrymander ravaged the party he works to support, then he indeed suffers harm, as do all other involved members of that party.  This is the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cburden\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ca group of voters\xe2\x80\x99 representational rights\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Kennedy spoke of.  <i>Id.,</i> at 314.  Members of the \xe2\x80\x9cdisfavored party\xe2\x80\x9d in the State, <i>id.,</i> at 315, deprived of their natural political strength by a partisan gerrymander, may face difficulties fundraising, registering voters, attracting volunteers, generating support from independents, and recruiting candidates to run for office (not to mention eventually accomplishing their policy objectives).  See <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Celebrezze</i>,\n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 780, 791\xe2\x80\x93792, and n.\xc2\xa012 (1983) (concluding that similar harms inflicted by a state election law amounted to a \xe2\x80\x9cburden imposed on .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. associational rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  And what is true for party members may be doubly true for party officials and triply true for the party itself (or for related organizations).  Cf. <i>California Democratic Party</i>, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 586 (holding that a state law violated state political parties\xe2\x80\x99\n \nFirst Amendment rights of association).  By placing a state party at an enduring electoral disadvantage, the gerrymander weakens its capacity to perform all its functions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And if that is the essence of the harm alleged, then the standing analysis should differ from the one the Court applies.  Standing, we have long held, \xe2\x80\x9cturns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Warth</i> v. <i>Seldin</i>,\n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 490, 500 (1975).  Indeed, that idea lies at the root of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  It is because the Court views the harm alleged as vote dilution that it (rightly) insists that each plaintiff show packing or cracking in her own district to establish her standing.  See <i>ante,</i> at 14\xe2\x80\x9317; <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  But when the harm alleged is not district specific, the proof needed for standing should not be district specific either.  And the associational injury flowing from a statewide partisan gerrymander, whether alleged by a party member or the party itself, has nothing to do with the packing or cracking of any single district\xe2\x80\x99s lines.  The complaint in such a case is instead that the gerrymander has burdened the ability of like-minded people across the State to affiliate in a political party and carry out that organization\xe2\x80\x99s activities and objects.  See <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Because a plaintiff can have that complaint without living in a packed or cracked district, she need not show what the Court demands today for a vote dilution claim.  Or said otherwise: Because on this alternative theory, the valued association and the injury to it are statewide, so too is the relevant standing requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On occasion, the plaintiffs here have indicated that they have an associational claim in mind.  In addition to repeatedly alleging vote dilution, their complaint asserted in general terms that Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s districting plan infringes their \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFirst Amendment right to freely associate with each other without discrimination by the State based on that association.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 App. 61, Complaint \xc2\xb691.  Similarly, the plaintiffs noted before this Court that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]eyond diluting votes, partisan gerrymandering offends\n \nFirst Amendment values by penalizing citizens because of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. their association with a political party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees 36 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And finally, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 evidence of partisan asymmetry well fits a suit alleging associational injury (although, as noted below, that was not how it was used, see <i>infra</i>, at 11).  As the Court points out, what those statistical metrics best measure is a gerrymander\xe2\x80\x99s effect \xe2\x80\x9con the fortunes of political parties\xe2\x80\x9d and those associated with them.  <i>Ante,</i> at 20.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the end, though, I think the plaintiffs did not sufficiently advance a\n \nFirst Amendment associational theory to avoid the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding on standing.  Despite referring to that theory in their complaint, the plaintiffs tried this case as though it were about vote dilution alone.  Their testimony and other evidence went toward establishing the effects of rampant packing and cracking on the value of individual citizens\xe2\x80\x99 votes.  Even their proof of partisan asymmetry was used for that purpose\xe2\x80\x94although as noted above, it could easily have supported the alternative the- ory of associational harm, see <i>supra,</i> at 10.  The plaintiffs joining in this suit do not include the State Democratic Party (or any related statewide organization).  They did not emphasize their membership in that party, or their activities supporting it.  And they did not speak to any tangible associational burdens\xe2\x80\x94ways the gerrymander had debilitated their party or weakened its ability to carry out its core functions and purposes, see <i>supra</i>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Even in this Court, when disputing the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that they lacked standing, the plaintiffs reiterated their suit\xe2\x80\x99s core theory: that the gerrymander \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally, severely, durably, and unjustifiably dilutes Democratic votes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellees 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  Given that theory, the plaintiffs needed to show that their own votes were indeed diluted in order to establish standing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> But nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion prevents the plaintiffs on remand from pursuing an associational claim, or from satisfying the different standing requirement that theory would entail.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is about a suit challenging a partisan gerrymander on a particular ground\xe2\x80\x94that it dilutes the votes of individual citizens.  That opinion \xe2\x80\x9cleave[s] for another day consideration of other possible theories of harm not presented here and whether those theories might present justiciable claims giving rise to statewide remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  And in particular, it leaves for another day the theory of harm advanced by Justice Kennedy in <i>Vieth</i>: that a partisan gerrymander interferes with the vital \xe2\x80\x9cability of citizens to band together\xe2\x80\x9d to further their political beliefs.  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 314 (quoting <i>California Democratic Party</i>, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 574).  Nothing about that injury is \xe2\x80\x9cgeneralized\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cabstract,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court says is true of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 dissatisfaction with the \xe2\x80\x9coverall composition of the legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  A suit raising an associational theory complains of concrete \xe2\x80\x9cburdens on a disfavored party\xe2\x80\x9d and its members as they pursue their political interests and goals.  <i>Vieth</i>, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 315 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  And when the suit alleges that a gerrymander has imposed those burdens on a statewide basis, then its litigation should be statewide too\xe2\x80\x94as to standing, liability, and remedy alike.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Partisan gerrymandering jeopardizes \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Vieth</i>, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 316 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  It en- ables a party that happens to be in power at the right time to entrench itself there for a decade or more, no matter what the voters would prefer.  At its most extreme, the practice amounts to \xe2\x80\x9crigging elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 317 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It thus violates the most fundamental of all democratic principles\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cthe voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arizona State Legislature</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 35) (quoting Berman, Managing Gerrymandering, 83 Texas L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 781 (2005)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> And the evils of gerrymandering seep into the legislative process itself.  Among the <i>amicus </i>briefs in this case are two from bipartisan groups of congressional members and state legislators.  They know that both parties gerrymander.  And they know the consequences.  The congressional brief describes a \xe2\x80\x9ccascade of negative results\xe2\x80\x9d from excessive partisan gerrymandering: indifference to swing voters and their views; extreme political positioning designed to placate the party\xe2\x80\x99s base and fend off primary challenges; the devaluing of negotiation and compromise; and the impossibility of reaching pragmatic, bipartisan solutions to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s problems.  Brief for Bipartisan Group of Current and Former Members of Congress as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 4; see <i>id.,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9323.  The state legislators tell a similar story.  In their view, partisan gerrymandering has \xe2\x80\x9csounded the death-knell of bipartisanship,\xe2\x80\x9d creating a legislative environment that is \xe2\x80\x9ctoxic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctribal[\xc2\xa0].\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Bipartisan Group of 65 Current and Former State Legislators as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 6, 25.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I doubt James Madison would have been surprised.  What, he asked when championing the Constitution, would make the House of Representatives work?  The House must be structured, he answered, to instill in its members \xe2\x80\x9can habitual recollection of their dependence on the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 57, p. 352 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Legislators must be \xe2\x80\x9ccompelled to anticipate the moment\xe2\x80\x9d when their \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of [power] is to be reviewed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>When that moment does not come\xe2\x80\x94when legislators can entrench themselves in office despite the people\xe2\x80\x99s will\xe2\x80\x94the foundation of effective democratic governance dissolves.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And our history offers little comfort.  Yes, partisan gerrymandering goes back to the Republic\xe2\x80\x99s earliest days; and yes, American democracy has survived.  But technol- ogy makes today\xe2\x80\x99s gerrymandering altogether different from the crude linedrawing of the past.  New redistricting software enables pinpoint precision in designing districts.  With such tools, mapmakers can capture every last bit of partisan advantage, while still meeting traditional districting requirements (compactness, contiguity, and the like).  See Brief for Political Science Professors as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 28.  Gerrymanders have thus become ever more extreme and durable, insulating officeholders against all but the most titanic shifts in the political tides.  The 2010 redistricting cycle produced some of the worst partisan gerrymanders on record.  <i>Id.,</i> at 3.  The technology will only get better, so the 2020 cycle will only get worse.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Courts have a critical role to play in curbing partisan gerrymandering.  Over fifty years ago, we committed to providing judicial review in the redistricting arena, because we understood that \xe2\x80\x9ca denial of constitutionally protected rights demands judicial protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reynolds</i>, 377 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 566.  Indeed, the need for judicial review is at its most urgent in these cases.  For here, politicians\xe2\x80\x99 incentives conflict with voters\xe2\x80\x99 interests, leaving citizens without any political remedy for their constitutional harms.  Of course, their dire need provides no warrant for courts to disregard Article III.  Because of the way this suit was litigated, I agree that the plaintiffs have so far failed to establish their standing to sue, and I fully concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  But of one thing we may unfortunately be sure.  Courts\xe2\x80\x94and in particular this Court\xe2\x80\x94will again be called on to redress extreme partisan gerrymanders.  I am hopeful we will then step up to our responsibility to vindicate the Constitution against a contrary law.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
