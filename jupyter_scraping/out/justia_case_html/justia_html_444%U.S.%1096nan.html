Thus, one need not accept at full face value the contention of petitioner that the Court of Appeals\' decision squarely conflicts with decisions from the Courts of Appeals for the Second, Fourth, and District of Columbia Circuits in order to realize that the question is a recurring one that will ultimately require interpretation of important statutory language by this Court. Accordingly I would grant the petition limited to the question whether 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, required EPA to provide an additional opportunity to comment on the final regulations proposed here.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
