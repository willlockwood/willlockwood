Subsequently, respondent applied to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and received long-term disability benefits on the basis of his HIV status.  Thereafter, he renewed his certificate with the FAA on several occasions, each time intentionally withholding information about his condition.  The Department of Transportation (DOT), the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investigation with the SSA to identify medically unfit individuals who had obtained FAA certifications.  The DOT provided the SSA with the names of licensed pilots, and the SSA, in turn, provided the DOT with a spreadsheet containing information on those pilots who had also received disability benefits.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s name appeared on the spreadsheet, and an investigation led to his admission that he had intentionally withheld information about his HIV status from the FAA.  His pilot certificate was revoked, and he was indicted for making false statements to a Government agency.  He pleaded guilty and was fined and sentenced to probation.  He then filed suit, alleging that the FAA, DOT, and SSA violated the Privacy Act of 1974, which contains a detailed set of requirements for the management of records held by Executive Branch agencies.  The Act allows an aggrieved individual to sue for \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4)(A), if the Government intentionally or willfully violates the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements in such a way as to adversely affect the individual.  Specifically, respondent claimed that the unlawful disclosure to the DOT of his confidential medical information had caused him mental and emotional distress.  The District Court concluded that the Government had violated the Act.  But, finding the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d ambiguous, the court relied on the sovereign immunity canon, which provides that sovereign immunity waivers must be strictly construed in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor, to hold that the Act does not authorize the recovery of nonpecuniary damages.  Reversing the District Court, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act is not ambiguous and includes damages for mental and emotional distress.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize damages for mental or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity from liability for such harms.

Pe\xc3\xb1a, \n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 187\n, and any ambiguities are to be construed in favor of immunity, United States v. Williams, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 527\n.  Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible interpretation of the statute that would not allow money damages against the Government.  United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., \n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30\n.

United States, \n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 301\n.  Even as a legal term, the precise meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d is far from clear.  Although the term is sometimes understood to include nonpecuniary harm, it has also been used or construed more narrowly to cover damages for only pecuniary harm.  Because of the term\xe2\x80\x99s chameleon-like quality, it must be considered in the particular context in which it appears.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0The Privacy Act serves interests similar to those protected by defamation and privacy torts.  Its remedial provision, under which plaintiffs can recover a minimum award of $1,000 if they first prove at least some \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cparallels\xe2\x80\x9d the common-law torts of libel per quod and slander, under which plaintiffs can recover \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral damages\xe2\x80\x9d if they first prove \xe2\x80\x9cspecial damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Doe v. Chao, \n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 614\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial damages\xe2\x80\x9d are limited to actual pecuniary loss, which must be specially pleaded and proved.  \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral damages\xe2\x80\x9d cover nonpecuniary loss and need not be pleaded or proved.  This parallel suggests the possibility that Congress intended the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cspecial damages,\xe2\x80\x9d thus barring Privacy Act victims from any recovery unless they can first show some actual pecuniary harm.  That Congress would choose \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial damages\xe2\x80\x9d is not without precedent, as the terms have occasionally been used interchangeably.  Furthermore, any doubt about the plausibility of construing \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d as special damages in the Privacy Act is put to rest by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 deliberate refusal to allow recovery for \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  In common-law defamation and privacy cases, special damages is the only category of compensatory damages other than general damages.  Because Congress declined to authorize general damages, it is reasonable to infer that Congress intended the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act to mean special dam-ages for proven pecuniary loss.

Because Congress did not speak unequivocally, the Court adopts an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d limited to proven pecuniary harm.  To do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text clearly requires.

In 1985, he was diagnosed with a human im- munodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and began taking antiretroviral medication.  At that time, the FAA did not issue medical certificates to persons with respondent\xe2\x80\x99s condition.  Knowing that he would not qualify for renewal of his medical certificate, respondent initially grounded himself and chose not to apply.  In 1994, however, he ap- plied for and received a medical certificate, but he did so without disclosing his HIV status or his medication.  He renewed his certificate in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004, each time intentionally withholding information about his condition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen respondent\xe2\x80\x99s health deteriorated in 1995, he applied for long-term disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401 et\xc2\xa0seq.

The DOT gave the SSA a list of names and other identifying information of 45,000 licensed pilots in northern California.

To the contrary, we have observed that the sovereign immunity canon \xe2\x80\x9cis a tool for interpreting the law\xe2\x80\x9d and that it does not \xe2\x80\x9cdisplac[e] the other traditional tools of statutory construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 571, \n589 (2008)\n.  What we thus require is that the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 waiver be clearly discernable from the statutory text in light of traditional interpretive tools.  If it is not, then we take the interpretation most favorable to the Government.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act provides that, for any \xe2\x80\x9cintentional or willful\xe2\x80\x9d refusal or failure to comply with the Act, the United States shall be liable for \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4)(A).

But as the Court of Appeals explained, \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d is a legal term of art, 622 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1028, and it is a \xe2\x80\x9ccardinal rule of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x9d that, when Congress employs a term of art, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Molzof v.

The latest edition of Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary available when Congress enacted the Privacy Act defined \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[r]eal, substantial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a complainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or injury, as opposed on the one hand to \xe2\x80\x98nominal\xe2\x80\x99 damages, and on the other to \xe2\x80\x98exemplary\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98punitive\xe2\x80\x99 damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968).

The basic idea is that Privacy Act victims, like victims of libel per quod or slander, are barred from any recovery unless they can first show actual\xe2\x80\x94that is, pecuniary or material\xe2\x80\x94harm.  Upon showing some pecuniary harm, no matter how slight, they can recover the statutory minimum of $1,000, presumably for any unproven harm.  That Congress would choose to use the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial damages\xe2\x80\x9d was not without precedent.

In defamation and privacy cases, \xe2\x80\x9cthe affront to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s dignity and the emotional harm done\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9ccalled general damages, to distinguish them from proof of actual economic harm,\xe2\x80\x9d which is called \xe2\x80\x9cspecial damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., \xc2\xa73.2, at 139; see also supra, at 10, 12\xe2\x80\x9313, and nn.\xc2\xa06, 7, 9.  Therefore, the converse of general damages is special damages, not all proven damages, as respondent would have it.  Because Congress removed \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral damages\xe2\x80\x9d from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s remedial provision, it is reasonable to infer that Congress foreclosed recovery for nonpecuniary harm, even if such harm can be proved, and instead waived the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity only with respect to harm compensable as special damages.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLooking beyond the Privacy Act\xe2\x80\x99s text, respondent points to the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d damages in the remedial provisions of the FHA, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73613(c), and the FCRA, 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71681n, 1681o.  As previously mentioned, courts have held that \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d damages within the meaning of these statutes include compensation for mental and emotional distress.  Supra, at 7.  Citing the rule of construction that Congress intends the same language in similar statutes to have the same meaning, see Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, \n\n412 U.\xc2\xa0S. 427, \n428 (1973)\n (per\xc2\xa0curiam), respondent argues that the Privacy Act should also be interpreted as authorizing damages for mental and emotional distress.

Since the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d can mean different things in different contexts, statutes other than the Privacy Act provide only limited interpretive aid, and that is especially true here.  Neither the FHA nor the FCRA contains text that precisely mirrors the Privacy Act.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In neither of those statutes did Congress specifically decline to authorize recovery for general damages as it did in the Privacy Act.  Supra, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  And most importantly, none of the lower court cases interpreting the statutes, which respondent has cited, see Brief for Respondent 29\xe2\x80\x9331, involves the sovereign immunity canon.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent also points to the FTCA, but the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s general liability provision does not even use the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  It instead provides that the \xe2\x80\x9cUnited States shall be liable\xe2\x80\x9d for certain tort claims \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual\xe2\x80\x9d under relevant state law.  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72674, \xc2\xb61.  For that reason alone, the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s general liability provision is not a reliable source for interpreting the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d in the Privacy Act.  Nor does the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s wrongful- death provision\xe2\x80\x94which authorizes \xe2\x80\x9cactual or compensa- tory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72674, \xc2\xb62\xe2\x80\x94prove that Congress understood the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d in the Privacy Act to include nonpecuniary mental and emotional harm.  To the contrary, it proves that actual damages can be understood to entail only pecuniary harm depending on the context.  Because the FTCA, like the FHA and FCRA, does not share the same text or design as the Privacy Act, it is not a fitting analog for construing the Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, respondent argues that excluding damages for mental and emotional harm would lead to absurd results.  Persons suffering relatively minor pecuniary loss would be entitled to recover $1,000, while others suffering only severe and debilitating mental or emotional distress would get nothing.

See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 445 (9th ed. 2009).  If \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d can mean \xe2\x80\x9ctangible damages,\xe2\x80\x9d then it can be construed not to include intangible harm, like mental and emotional distress.

For example, although the dissent belittles the sovereign immunity canon, the dissent does not call for its abandonment.  See post, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  Nor does the dissent point out any error in our understanding of the canon\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  See ibid.  The dissent acknowledges that statutes and judicial opinions sometimes use the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d to mean pecuniary harm, see post, at 5, and that determining its meaning in a particular statute requires consideration of context, see ibid.  In addition, the dissent concedes\xe2\x80\x94as it must in light of our reasoning in Doe v. Chao, \n\xe2\x80\x94that the common law of defamation has relevance in construing the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d in the Privacy Act.  See post, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.\nThe dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument thus boils down to this: The text and purpose of the Privacy Act make it clear beyond any reasonable dispute that the term \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the Act, means compensatory damages for all proven harm and not just damages for pecuniary harm.  The dissent reasons that, because the Act seeks to prevent pecuniary and nonpecuniary harm, Congress must have intended to authorize the recovery of money damages from the Federal Government for both types of harm.  This inference is plausible, but it surely is not unavoidable.  The Act deters violations of its substantive provisions in other ways\xe2\x80\x94for instance, by permitting recovery for economic injury; by imposing criminal sanctions for some violations, see \n; and possibly by allowing for injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7702, 706; see Doe,  supra, at 619, n.\xc2\xa01 (noting that the absence of equitable relief in suits under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(C) or (D) may be explained by the availability of such relief under the APA).\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970416">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 10\xe2\x80\x931024\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tFEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS v.

The majority claims this is a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnotably circular\xe2\x80\x9d definition, ante, at 7, but it is unclear why.  The definition is plain enough: \xe2\x80\x9cActual damages\xe2\x80\x9d compensate for actual injury, and thus the term is synonymous with compensatory damages.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s 467 (defining \xe2\x80\x9ccompensatory damages\xe2\x80\x9d as damages that \xe2\x80\x9cwill compensate the injured party for the injury sustained, and nothing more; such as will simply make good or replace the loss caused by the wrong or injury\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  There is nothing circular about that definition.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  It is the definition this Court adopted more than a century ago when we recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompensatory damages and actual damages mean the same thing; that is, that the damages shall be the result of the injury alleged and proved, and that the amount awarded shall be precisely commensurate with the injury suffered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Birdsall v. Coolidge, \n\n93 U.\xc2\xa0S. 64 (1876)\n.  It is the definition embraced in current legal dictionaries.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s 445 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n amount awarded to a complainant to compensate for a proven injury or loss; damages that repay actual losses.\xe2\x80\x94Also termed compensatory damages; tangible damages; real damages\xe2\x80\x9d (italics omitted)).  And it is the definition that accords with the plain and ordinary meaning of the term.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 22, 571 (2002) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cexisting in fact or reality\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdamages\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a wrong or injury caused by a violation of a legal right\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, both as a term of art and in its plain meaning, \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d connotes compensation for proven injuries or losses.  Nothing in the use of that phrase indicates proven injuries need be pecuniary in nature.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority discards all this on the asserted ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe precise meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x98changes with the specific statute in which it is found.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7 (quoting 622 F.\xc2\xa03d 1016, 1029 (CA9 2010)).  Context, of course, is relevant to statutory interpretation; it may provide clues that Congress did not employ a word or phrase in its ordinary meaning.  That well-established interpretive rule cannot, however, render irrelevant\xe2\x80\x94as the majority would have it\xe2\x80\x94the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, the authority the majority cites for its claim that \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d has no fixed meaning undermines\xe2\x80\x94rather than supports\xe2\x80\x94its holding.  Each cited authority involves either a statute in which Congress expressly directed that compensation be measured in strictly economic terms, or else a statute (e.g., the Copyright Act of 1909) in which economic loss is the natural and probable consequence of a violation of the defined legal interest.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Neither factor is present here.  Notably absent from the Privacy Act is any provision so much as hinting that \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d should be limited to economic loss.  And while \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x80\x9churt feelings\xe2\x80\x9d over the nature of the [copyright] infringement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d may \xe2\x80\x9chave no place in the actual damages calculus\xe2\x80\x9d under the Copyright Act of 1909, ante, at 8 (quoting in parenthetical Mackie v.

Thus, while context is no doubt relevant, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s cited authority does little to help its cause in the stated context of this statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, the relevant statutory context\xe2\x80\x94the substantive provisions whose breach may trigger suit under the civil-remedies provision\xe2\x80\x94only reinforces the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress established substantive duties in the Act that are expressly designed to prevent agency conduct resulting in intangible harms to the individual.  The Act requires agencies to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure against security breaches that could result in \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a(e)(10).  It also requires agencies to \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain all records\xe2\x80\x9d used in making a determination about an individual in a manner that is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552a(e)(5).  Thus an agency violates the terms of the Act if it fails, e.g., to maintain safeguards protecting against \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassment\xe2\x80\x9d; there is no additional requirement that the pocketbook be implicated.  An agency\xe2\x80\x99s intentional or willful violation of those duties triggers liability for \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4) in the event of an adverse impact.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(C)\xe2\x80\x93(D), (g)(4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAdopting a reading of \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d that permits recovery for pecuniary loss alone creates a disconnect between the Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive and remedial provisions.  It allows a swath of Government violations to go unremedied: A federal agency could intentionally or willfully forgo establishing safeguards to protect against embarrassment and no successful private action could be taken against it for the harm Congress identified.

It then points to our observation in Doe v.

Ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  That assertion is defective on two scores.  First, a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s ability to present proof of injury in a defamation per\xc2\xa0se action (and to recover for such proven injury) does not alter the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral damages,\xe2\x80\x9d which we already explained in Doe means \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 621; see also id., at 623; n.\xc2\xa05, supra.  Second, \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral damages\xe2\x80\x9d is not limited to a \xe2\x80\x9ctype\xe2\x80\x9d of harm.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary assertion that the term permits recovery only for emotional \xe2\x80\x9ctypes\xe2\x80\x9d of harm overlooks the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral damages are partly based on the belief that the plaintiff will suffer unprovable pecuniary losses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dobbs \xc2\xa77.2, at 514 (emphasis added).  It thus was established at common law that in a defamation per\xc2\xa0se action, \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff is usually free to prove whatever actual pecuniary loss he can,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury may be permitted to view the actual pecuniary loss proven as the tip of the iceberg, assume that there is still more un-proven, and award damage accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt its core, the majority opinion relies on the following syllogism: The common law employed two terms of art in defamation actions.  Because Congress excluded recovery for \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral damages,\xe2\x80\x9d it must have meant to retain recovery only for \xe2\x80\x9cspecial damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  That syllogism, of course, ignores that there is another category of damages.  It is the very category Congress used in the text of the Privacy Act: \xe2\x80\x9cActual damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  However much Congress may have drawn \xe2\x80\x9cparallels,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 10, between the Act and the common-law tort of defamation, the fact remains that Congress expressly choose not to use the words \xe2\x80\x9cspecial damages.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI turn finally to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s in all cases of statutory interpretation, our task is to interpret the words of th[e] statut[e] in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, \n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600, \n608 (1979)\n; see also Dolan v. Postal Service, \n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 481, \n486 (2006)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cInterpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\xe2\x80\x9d).  The purposes of the Privacy Act could not be more explicit, and they are consistent with interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d according to its ordinary meaning.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe historical context of the Act is important to an understanding of its remedial purposes.  In 1974, Congress was concerned with curbing the illegal surveillance and investigation of individuals by federal agencies that had been exposed during the Watergate scandal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dept. of Justice, Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, Overview of the Privacy Act\xc2\xa04 (2010).  In particular, Congress recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe increasing use of computers and sophisticated information technology .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has greatly magnified the harm to individual privacy that can occur from any collection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal information.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72(a), \n\n88Stat.\n1896.  Identifying the right to privacy as \xe2\x80\x9ca personal and fundamental right,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress found it \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d to enact the Privacy Act \xe2\x80\x9cin order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in information systems maintained by Federal agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress explained that the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose of this Act is to provide certain safeguards for an individual against an invasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies, except as otherwise provided by law, to,\xe2\x80\x9d inter alia, \xe2\x80\x9cbe subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a result of willful or intentional action which violates any individual\xe2\x80\x99s rights under this Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72(b)(6), ibid. (emphasis added).  That statement is an explicit reference to suits brought under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4); no other provision speaks to a civil suit based on \xe2\x80\x9cwillful or intentional\xe2\x80\x9d agency misconduct.  It signals unmistakably congressional recognition that the civil-remedies provision is integral to realizing the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tReading \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d to permit recovery for any injury established by competent evidence in the record\xe2\x80\x94pecuniary or not\xe2\x80\x94best effectuates the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose.  Although some privacy invasions no doubt result in economic loss, we have recognized time and again that the primary form of injuries is nonpecuniary, and includes mental distress and personal humiliation.  See Time, Inc. v. Hill, \n\n385 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374, \n385, n. \n9 (1967)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the \xe2\x80\x98right of privacy\xe2\x80\x99 cases the primary damage is the mental distress\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Gertz, 418 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 350 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ctual injury\xe2\x80\x9d in defamatory falsehood cases \xe2\x80\x9cis not limited to out-of-pocket loss.  Indeed, the more customary types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accord, 2 Dobbs \xc2\xa77.1.(1), at 259 (2d ed. 1993) (privacy is a dignitary interest, and \xe2\x80\x9cin a great many of the cases\xe2\x80\x9d in which the interest is invaded \xe2\x80\x9cthe only harm is the affront to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s dignity as a human being, the damage to his self-image, and the resulting mental distress\xe2\x80\x9d).  That accords with common sense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn interpreting the civil-remedies provision, we must not forget Congress enacted the Privacy Act to protect pri- vacy.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d renders the remedial provision impotent in the face of concededly unlawful agency action whenever the injury is solely nonpecuniary.  That result is patently at odds with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 stated purpose.  The majority, however, does not grapple with the ramifications of its opinion.  It acknowledges the suggestion that its holding leads to absurd results as it allows individuals suffering relatively minor pecuniary losses to recover $1,000 while others suffering severe mental anguish to recover nothing.  But it concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing absurd about a scheme that limits the Government\xe2\x80\x99s Privacy Act liability to harm that can be substantiated by proof of tangible economic loss.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18.  Perhaps; it is certainly within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 prerogative to enact the statute the majority envisions, namely one that seeks to safeguard against invasions of privacy without remedying the primary harm that results from invasions of privacy.  The problem for the majority is that one looks in vain for any indication in the text of the statute before us that Congress intended such a result.  Nowhere in the Privacy Act does Congress so much as hint that it views a $5 hit to the pocketbook as more worthy of remedy than debilitating mental distress, and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary assumption discounts the gravity of emotional harm caused by an invasion of the personal integrity that privacy protects.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter today, no matter how debilitating and substantial the resulting mental anguish, an individual harmed by a federal agency\xe2\x80\x99s intentional or willful violation of the Privacy Act will be left without a remedy unless he or she is able to prove pecuniary harm.  That is not the result Congress intended when it enacted an Act with the express purpose of safeguarding individual privacy against Government invasion.  And it is not a result remotely suggested by anything in the text, structure, or history of the Act.  For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary also defined \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d as synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 467.
