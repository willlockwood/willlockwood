The prisoner was one of the most active of the insurgents in the Western Counties of Pennsylvania, and had accompanied the armed party, who attacked the house of the Excise Officer, (Reigan\'s) in Westmoreland, with guns, drums, &amp;c. insisted upon his surrendering his official papers, and extorted an oath from him, that he would never act again in the execution of the Excise Law. The same party then proceeded to the house of Wells, the Excise Officer in Fayette county, swearing that the Excise Law should never be carried into effect, and that they would destroy Wells and his house. On their arrival, Wells had fled and concealed himself; whereupon they ransacked the house; burned it, with all its contents, including the public books and papers; and afterwards discovering Wells, seized, imprisoned, and compelled him to swear, that he would no longer act as Excise Officer. Witnesses were, likewise, examined to establish that the general combination and scope of the insurrection, were to prevent the execution of the Excise Law by force; and in the course of the evidence, the duress of the Marshall of the District, the assembling at Couche\'s, the burning of general Neville\'s house, &amp;c. were prominent features.

But in this they have failed; for the whole scene exhibits a disgraceful unanimity; and, with regard to the prisoner, he can only be distinguished for a guilty pre-eminence in zeal and activity. It may not, however, be useless on this occasion, to observe, that the fear, which the law recognizes as an excuse for the perpetration of an offence, must proceed from an immediate and actual danger, threatening the very life of the party. The apprehension of any loss of property, by waste, or fire; or even an apprehension of a slight or remote injury to the person, furnish no excuse. If, indeed, such circumstances could avail, it would be in the power of every crafty leader of tumults and rebellion, to indemnify his followers, by uttering previous menaces; an avenue would be forever open for the escape of unsuccessful guilt; and the whole fabric of society must, inevitably, be laid prostrate. </p><p> A technical objection has, also, been suggested in favor of the prisoner. It is said, that the offence is not proved to have been committed, on the day, nor the number of the Insurgent party to be so great, as the indictment states. But both these exceptions, even, if well founded in fact, are immaterial in point of law. The crime is proved, and laid to have been committed, before the charge was presented; and whether it was committed by one hundred, or five hundred, cannot alter the guilt of the defendant.
