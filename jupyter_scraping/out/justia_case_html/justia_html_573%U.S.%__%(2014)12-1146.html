Massachusetts held that the Act-wide definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d includes greenhouse gases, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 529, but where the term \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d appears in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s operative provisions, including the PSD and Title V permitting provisions, EPA has routinely given it a narrower, context-appropriate meaning.  Massachusetts did not invalidate those longstanding constructions.  The Act-wide definition is not a command to regulate, but a description of the universe of substances EPA may consider regulating under the Act\xe2\x80\x99s operative provisions.  Though Congress\xe2\x80\x99s profligate use of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d is not conducive to clarity, the presumption of consistent usage \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98readily yields\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to context, and a statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cmay take on distinct characters from association with distinct statutory objects calling for different implementation strategies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Environmental Defense v.

EPA has repeatedly acknowledged that applying the PSD and Title V permitting requirements to greenhouse gases would be inconsistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s structure and design.  A review of the relevant statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD program and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot rationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and procedural burdens.

But an EPA guidance document states that BACT analysis should consider options other than energy efficiency, including \xe2\x80\x9ccarbon capture and storage,\xe2\x80\x9d which EPA contends is reasonably comparable to more traditional, end-of-stack BACT technologies.  Moreover, assuming that BACT may be used to force improvements in energy efficiency, important limitations on BACT may work to mitigate concerns about \xe2\x80\x9cunbounded\xe2\x80\x9d regulatory authority.

To date, EPA has issued NAAQS for six pollutants: sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and lead.  Clean Air Act Handbook 125 (J. Domike &amp; A. Zacaroli eds., 3d ed. 2011); see generally 40 CFR pt. 50 (2013).

EPA interprets the PSD provisions to apply to sources located in areas that are designated attainment or unclassifiable for any NAAQS pollutant, regardless of whether the source emits that specific pollutant.  Since the inception of the PSD program, every area of the country has been designated attainment or unclassifiable for at least one NAAQS pollutant; thus, on EPA\xe2\x80\x99s view, all stationary sources are potentially subject to PSD review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It is unlawful to construct or modify a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cany area to which [the PSD program] applies\xe2\x80\x9d without first obtaining a permit.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77475(a)(1), 7479(2)(C).  To qualify for a permit, the facility must not cause or contribute to the violation of any applicable air-quality standard, \xc2\xa77475(a)(3), and it must comply with emissions limitations that reflect the \xe2\x80\x9cbest available control technology\xe2\x80\x9d (or BACT) for \xe2\x80\x9ceach pollutant subject to regulation under\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  \xc2\xa77475(a)(4).

In response to that decision, EPA embarked on a course of regulation resulting in \xe2\x80\x9cthe single largest expansion in the scope of the [Act] in its history.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clean Air Act Handbook, at xxi.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        EPA first asked the public, in a notice of proposed rulemaking, to comment on how the Agency should respond to Massachusetts.  In doing so, it explained that regulating greenhouse-gas emissions from motor vehicles could have far-reaching consequences for stationary sources.  Under EPA\xe2\x80\x99s view, once greenhouse gases became regulated under any part of the Act, the PSD and Title V permitting requirements would apply to all stationary sources with the potential to emit greenhouse gases in excess of the statutory thresholds: 100 tons per year under Title V, and 100 or 250 tons per year under the PSD program depending on the type of source.  73 Fed. Reg. 44420, 44498, 44511 (2008).  Because greenhouse-gas emissions tend to be \xe2\x80\x9corders of magnitude greater\xe2\x80\x9d than emissions of conventional pollutants, EPA projected that numerous small sources not previously regulated under the Act would be swept into the PSD program and Title V, including \xe2\x80\x9csmaller industrial sources,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clarge office and residential build-ings, hotels, large retail establishments, and similar facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 44498\xe2\x80\x9344499.  The Agency warned that this would constitute an \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented expansion of EPA authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land,\xe2\x80\x9d yet still be \xe2\x80\x9crelatively ineffective at reducing greenhouse gas concentrations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 44355.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2009, EPA announced its determination regarding the danger posed by motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions.  EPA found that greenhouse-gas emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to elevated atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which endanger public health and welfare by fostering global \xe2\x80\x9cclimate change.\xe2\x80\x9d  74 Fed. Reg. 66523, 66537 (hereinafter Endangerment Finding).  It denominated a \xe2\x80\x9csingle air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9ccombined mix\xe2\x80\x9d of six greenhouse gases that it identified as \xe2\x80\x9cthe root cause of human-induced climate change\xe2\x80\x9d: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.  Id., at 66516, 66537.  A source\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse-gas emissions would be measured in \xe2\x80\x9ccarbon dioxide equivalent units\xe2\x80\x9d (CO2e), which would be calculated based on each gas\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cglobal warming potential.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 66499, n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Next, EPA issued its \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the prospect that motor-vehicle greenhouse-gas standards would trigger stationary-source permitting requirements.  75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (2010) (hereinafter Triggering Rule).  EPA announced that beginning on the effective date of its greenhouse-gas standards for motor vehicles, stationary sources would be subject to the PSD program and Title V on the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases.  As expected, EPA in short order promulgated greenhouse-gas emission standards for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles to take effect on January 2, 2011.  75 Fed. Reg. 25324 (hereinafter Tailpipe Rule).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        EPA then announced steps it was taking to \xe2\x80\x9ctailor\xe2\x80\x9d the PSD program and Title V to greenhouse gases.  75 Fed. Reg. 31514 (hereinafter Tailoring Rule).  Those steps were necessary, it said, because the PSD program and Title V were designed to regulate \xe2\x80\x9ca relatively small number of large industrial sources,\xe2\x80\x9d and requiring permits for all sources with greenhouse-gas emissions above the statu-tory thresholds would radically expand those programs, making them both unadministrable and \xe2\x80\x9cunrecognizable to the Congress that designed\xe2\x80\x9d them.  Id., at 31555, 31562.  EPA nonetheless rejected calls to exclude greenhouse gases entirely from those programs, asserting that the Act is not \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous with respect to the need to cover [greenhouse-gas] sources under either the PSD or title V program.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 31548, n. 31.  Instead, EPA adopted a \xe2\x80\x9cphase-in approach\xe2\x80\x9d that it said would \xe2\x80\x9cappl[y] PSD and title V at threshold levels that are as close to the statutory levels as possible, and do so as quickly as possible, at least to a certain point.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 31523.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The phase-in, EPA said, would consist of at least three steps.  During Step 1, from January 2 through June 30, 2011, no source would become newly subject to the PSD program or Title V solely on the basis of its greenhouse-gas emissions; however, sources required to obtain permits anyway because of their emission of conventional pollutants (so-called \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d sources) would need to comply with BACT for greenhouse gases if they emitted those gases in significant amounts, defined as at least 75,000 tons per year CO2e.  Ibid.  During Step 2, from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, sources with the potential to emit at least 100,000 tons per year CO2e of greenhouse gases would be subject to PSD and Title V permitting for their construction and operation and to PSD permitting for modifications that would increase their greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 75,000 tons per year CO2e.  Id., at 31523\xe2\x80\x9331524.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  At Step 3, beginning on July 1, 2013, EPA said it might (or might not) further reduce the permitting thresholds (though not below 50,000 tons per year CO2e), and it might (or might not) establish permanent exemptions for some sources.  Id., at 31524.  Beyond Step 3, EPA promised to complete another round of rulemaking by April 30, 2016, in which it would \xe2\x80\x9ctake further action to address small sources,\xe2\x80\x9d which might (or might not) include establishing permanent exemptions.  Id., at 31525.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        EPA codified Steps 1 and 2 at 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa751.166(b)(48) and 52.21(b)(49) for PSD and at \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa770.2 and 71.2 for Title V, and it codified its commitments regarding Step 3 and beyond at \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa752.22, 70.12, and 71.13.  See Tailoring Rule 31606\xe2\x80\x9331608.  After the decision below, EPA issued its final Step 3 rule, in which it decided not to lower the thresholds it had established at Step 2 until at least 2016.  77 Fed. Reg. 41051 (2012).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C. Decision Below</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Numerous parties, including several States, filed petitions for review in the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(b), challenging EPA\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse-gas-related actions.  The Court of Appeals dismissed some of the petitions for lack of jurisdiction and denied the remainder.  Coalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v. EPA, 684 F.\xc2\xa03d 102 (2012) (per curiam).  First, it upheld the Endangerment Finding and Tailpipe Rule.  Id., at 119, 126.  Next, it held that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the PSD permitting requirement as applying to \xe2\x80\x9cany regulated air pollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d including greenhouse gases, was \xe2\x80\x9ccompelled by the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 133\xe2\x80\x93134.  The court also found it \xe2\x80\x9ccrystal clear that PSD permittees must install BACT for greenhouse gases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 137.  Because it deemed petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arguments about the PSD program insufficiently applicable to Title V, it held they had \xe2\x80\x9cforfeited any challenges to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse gas-inclusive interpretation of Title V.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 136.  Finally, it held that petitioners were without Article III standing to challenge EPA\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to limit the reach of the PSD program and Title V through the Triggering and Tailoring Rules.  Id., at 146.  The court denied rehearing en banc, with Judges Brown and Kavanaugh each dissenting.

Analysis</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This litigation presents two distinct challenges to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s stance on greenhouse-gas permitting for stationary sources.  First, we must decide whether EPA permissibly determined that a source may be subject to the PSD and Title V permitting requirements on the sole basis of the source\xe2\x80\x99s potential to emit greenhouse gases.  Second, we must decide whether EPA permissibly determined that a source already subject to the PSD program because of its emission of conventional pollutants (an \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d source) may be required to limit its greenhouse-gas emissions by employing the \xe2\x80\x9cbest available control technology\xe2\x80\x9d for greenhouse gases.  The Solicitor General joins issue on both points but evidently regards the second as more important; he informs us that \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d sources account for roughly 83% of American stationary-source greenhouse-gas emissions, compared to just 3% for the additional, non-\xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d sources EPA sought to regulate at Steps 2 and 3 of the Tailoring Rule.

Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n\xe2\x80\x93843 (1984).  Under Chevron, we presume that when an agency-administered statute is ambiguous with respect to what it prescribes, Congress has empowered the agency to resolve the ambiguity.  The question for a reviewing court is whether in doing so the agency has acted reasonably and thus has \xe2\x80\x9cstayed within the bounds of its statutory authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A. The PSD and Title V Triggers</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We first decide whether EPA permissibly interpreted the statute to provide that a source may be required to obtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of its potential greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        EPA thought its conclusion that a source\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse-gas emissions may necessitate a PSD or Title V permit followed from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s unambiguous language.  The Court of Appeals agreed and held that the statute \xe2\x80\x9ccompelled\xe2\x80\x9d EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  684 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 134.  We disagree.  The statute compelled EPA\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation with respect to neither the PSD program nor Title V.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals reasoned by way of a flawed syllogism: Under Massachusetts, the general, Act-wide definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d includes greenhouse gases; the Act requires permits for major emitters of \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d; therefore, the Act requires permits for major emitters of greenhouse gases.  The conclusion follows from the premises only if the air pollutants referred to in the permit-requiring provisions (the minor premise) are the same air pollutants encompassed by the Act-wide definition as interpreted in Massachusetts (the major premise).  Yet no one\xe2\x80\x94least of all EPA\xe2\x80\x94endorses that proposition, and it is obviously untenable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Act-wide definition says that an air pollutant is \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, biological, [or] radioactive .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77602(g).  In Massachusetts, the Court held that the Act-wide definition includes greenhouse gases because it is all-encompassing; it \xe2\x80\x9cembraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe.\xe2\x80\x9d  549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 529.  But where the term \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d appears in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s operative provisions, EPA has routinely given it a narrower, context-appropriate meaning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That is certainly true of the provisions that require PSD and Title V permitting for major emitters of \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Since 1978, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations have interpreted \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d in the PSD permitting trigger as limited to regulated air pollutants, 43 Fed. Reg. 26403, codified, as amended, 40 CFR \xc2\xa752.21(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2), (50)\xe2\x80\x94a class much narrower than Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9call airborne compounds of whatever stripe,\xe2\x80\x9d 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 529.  And since 1993 EPA has informally taken the same position with regard to the Title V permitting trigger, a position the Agency ultimately incorporated into some of the regulations at issue here.  See Memorandum from Lydia N. Wegman, Deputy Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Air Division Director, Regions I\xe2\x80\x93X, pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935 (Apr. 26, 1993); Tailoring Rule 31607\xe2\x80\x9331608 (amending 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa770.2, 71.2).  Those interpretations were appropriate: It is plain as day that the Act does not envision an elaborate, burdensome permitting process for major emitters of steam, oxygen, or other harmless airborne substances.  It takes some cheek for EPA to insist that it cannot possibly give \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d a reasonable, context-appropriate meaning in the PSD and Title V contexts when it has been doing precisely that for decades.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Nor are those the only places in the Act where EPA has inferred from statutory context that a generic reference to air pollutants does not encompass every substance falling within the Act-wide definition.  Other examples abound:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Act authorizes EPA to enforce new source performance standards (NSPS) against a pre-existing source if, after promulgation of the standards, the source undergoes a physical or operational change that increases its emission of \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77411(a)(2), (4), (b)(1)(B).  EPA interprets that provision as limited to air pollutants for which EPA has promulgated new source performance standards.  36 Fed. Reg. 24877 (1971), codified, as amended, 40 CFR \xc2\xa760.2; 40 Fed. Reg. 58419 (1975), codified, as amended, 40 CFR \xc2\xa760.14(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Act requires a permit for the construction or operation in a nonattainment area of a source with the potential to emit 100 tons per year of \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77502(c)(5), 7602(j).  EPA interprets that provision as limited to pollutants for which the area is designated nonattainment.  45 Fed. Reg. 52745 (1980), promulgating 40 CFR \xc2\xa751.18(j)(2), as amended, \xc2\xa751.165(a)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Act directs EPA to require \xe2\x80\x9cenhanced monitoring and submission of compliance certifications\xe2\x80\x9d for any source with the potential to emit 100 tons per year of \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77414(a)(3), 7602(j).  EPA interprets that provision as limited to regulated pollutants.  62 Fed.

EPA interprets that provision as limited to visibility-impairing air pollutants.  70 Fed. Reg. 39160 (2005), codified at 40 CFR pt. 51, App. Y, \xc2\xa7II.A.3.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although these limitations are nowhere to be found in the Act-wide definition, in each instance EPA has concluded\xe2\x80\x94as it has in the PSD and Title V context\xe2\x80\x94that the statute is not using \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d in Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 broad sense to mean any airborne substance whatsoever.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Massachusetts did not invalidate all these longstanding constructions.  That case did not hold that EPA must always regulate greenhouse gases as an \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d everywhere that term appears in the statute, but only that EPA must \xe2\x80\x9cground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 535 (emphasis added), rather than on \xe2\x80\x9creasoning divorced from the statutory text,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 532.  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s inaction with regard to Title II was not sufficiently grounded in the statute, the Court said, in part because nothing in the Act suggested that regulating greenhouse gases under that Title would conflict with the statutory design.  Title II would not compel EPA to regulate in any way that would be \xe2\x80\x9cextreme,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccounterintuitive,\xe2\x80\x9d or contrary to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98common sense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 531.  At most, it would require EPA to take the modest step of adding greenhouse-gas standards to the roster of new-motor-vehicle emission regulations.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Massachusetts does not strip EPA of authority to exclude greenhouse gases from the class of regulable air pollutants under other parts of the Act where their inclusion would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme.  The Act-wide definition to which the Court gave a \xe2\x80\x9csweeping\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccapacious\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation, id., at 528, 532, is not a command to regulate, but a description of the universe of substances EPA may consider regulating under the Act\xe2\x80\x99s operative provisions.  Massachusetts does not foreclose the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s use of statutory context to infer that certain of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions use \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d to denote not every conceivable airborne substance, but only those that may sensibly be encompassed within the particular regulatory program.  As certain amici felicitously put it, while Massachusetts \xe2\x80\x9crejected EPA\xe2\x80\x99s categorical contention that greenhouse gases could not be \xe2\x80\x98air pollutants\xe2\x80\x99 for any purposes of the Act,\xe2\x80\x9d it did not \xe2\x80\x9cembrace EPA\xe2\x80\x99s current, equally categorical position that greenhouse gases must be air pollutants for all purposes\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of the statutory context.  Brief for Administrative Law Professors et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 17.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        To be sure, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s profligate use of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d where what is meant is obviously narrower than the Act-wide definition is not conducive to clarity.  One ordinarily assumes \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp.,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561,\n574 (2007)\n.  In this respect (as in countless others), the Act is far from a chef d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvre of legislative draftsmanship.

We merely observe that taken together, they belie EPA\xe2\x80\x99s rigid insistence that when interpreting the PSD and Title V permitting requirements it is bound by the Act-wide definition\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of greenhouse gases, no matter how incompatible that inclusion is with those programs\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory structure.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In sum, there is no insuperable textual barrier to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d in the permitting triggers of PSD and Title V to encompass only pollutants emitted in quantities that enable them to be sensibly regulated at the statutory thresholds, and to exclude those atypical pollutants that, like greenhouse gases, are emitted in such vast quantities that their inclusion would radically transform those programs and render them unworkable as written.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Having determined that EPA was mistaken in thinking the Act compelled a greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the PSD and Title V triggers, we next consider the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s alternative position that its interpretation was justified as an exercise of its \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion\xe2\x80\x9d to adopt \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable construction of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tailoring Rule 31517.

Nassar, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13), does not merit deference.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        EPA itself has repeatedly acknowledged that applying the PSD and Title V permitting requirements to greenhouse gases would be inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x94in fact, would overthrow\xe2\x80\x94the Act\xe2\x80\x99s structure and design.  In the Tailoring Rule, EPA described the calamitous consequences of interpreting the Act in that way.  Under the PSD program, annual permit applications would jump from about 800 to nearly 82,000; annual administrative costs would swell from $12 million to over $1.5 billion; and decade-long delays in issuing permits would become common, causing construction projects to grind to a halt nationwide.  Tailoring Rule 31557.  The picture under Title V was equally bleak: The number of sources required to have permits would jump from fewer than 15,000 to about 6.1 million; annual administrative costs would balloon from $62 million to $21 billion; and collectively the newly covered sources would face permitting costs of $147 billion.  Id., at 31562\xe2\x80\x9331563.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cthe great majority of additional sources brought into the PSD and title V programs would be small sources that Congress did not expect would need to undergo permitting.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 31533.  EPA stated that these results would be so \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to congressional intent,\xe2\x80\x9d and would so \xe2\x80\x9cseverely undermine what Congress sought to accomplish,\xe2\x80\x9d that they necessitated as much as a 1,000-fold increase in the permitting thresholds set forth in the statute.  Id., at 31554, 31562.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Like EPA, we think it beyond reasonable debate that requiring permits for sources based solely on their emission of greenhouse gases at the 100- and 250-tons-per-year levels set forth in the statute would be \xe2\x80\x9cincompatible\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cthe substance of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brown &amp; Williamson, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 156.  A brief review of the relevant statutory provisions leaves no doubt that the PSD program and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot rationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and procedural burdens.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Start with the PSD program, which imposes numerous and costly requirements on those sources that are required to apply for permits.  Among other things, the applicant must make available a detailed scientific analysis of the source\xe2\x80\x99s potential pollution-related impacts, demonstrate that the source will not contribute to the violation of any applicable pollution standard, and identify and use the \xe2\x80\x9cbest available control technology\xe2\x80\x9d for each regulated pollutant it emits.  \xc2\xa77475(a)(3), (4), (6), (e).  The permitting authority (the State, usually) also bears its share of the burden: It must grant or deny a permit within a year, during which time it must hold a public hearing on the application.  \xc2\xa77475(a)(2), (c).  Not surprisingly, EPA acknowledges that PSD review is a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplicated, resource-intensive, time-consuming, and sometimes contentious process\xe2\x80\x9d suitable for \xe2\x80\x9chundreds of larger sources,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9ctens of thousands of smaller sources.\xe2\x80\x9d  74 Fed. Reg. 55304, 55321\xe2\x80\x9355322.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Title V contains no comparable substantive requirements but imposes elaborate procedural mandates.  It requires the applicant to submit, within a year of becoming subject to Title V, a permit application and a \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance plan\xe2\x80\x9d describing how it will comply with \xe2\x80\x9call applicable requirements\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act; to certify its compliance annually; and to submit to \xe2\x80\x9cinspection, entry, monitoring, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and reporting requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77661b(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c), 7661c(a)\xe2\x80\x93(c).  The procedural burdens on the permitting authority and EPA are also significant.  The permitting authority must hold a public hearing on the application, \xc2\xa77661a(b)(6), and it must forward the application and any proposed permit to EPA and neighboring States and respond in writing to their comments, \xc2\xa77661d(a), (b)(1).  If it fails to issue or deny the permit within 18 months, any interested party can sue to require a decision \xe2\x80\x9cwithout additional delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77661a(b)(7), 7661b(c).  An interested party also can petition EPA to block issuance of the permit; EPA must grant or deny the petition within 60 days, and its decision may be challenged in federal court.  \xc2\xa77661d(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  As EPA wrote, Title V is \xe2\x80\x9cfinely crafted for thousands,\xe2\x80\x9d not millions, of sources.  Tailoring Rule 31563.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The fact that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the PSD and Title V triggers would place plainly excessive demands on limited governmental resources is alone a good reason for rejecting it; but that is not the only reason.  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is also unreasonable because it would bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in EPA\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.  When an agency claims to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate \xe2\x80\x9ca significant portion of the American economy,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown &amp; Williamson, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 159, we typically greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism.  We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic and political significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 160; see also MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218,\n231 (1994)\n; Industrial Union Dept., AFL\xe2\x80\x93CIO v. American Petroleum Institute,\n\n448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 607\n\xe2\x80\x93646 (1980) (plurality opinion).  The power to require permits for the construction and modification of tens of thousands, and the operation of millions, of small sources nationwide falls comfortably within the class of authorizations that we have been reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text.  Moreover, in EPA\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of that authority, we confront a singular situation: an agency laying claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy while at the same time strenuously asserting that the authority claimed would render the statute \xe2\x80\x9cunrecognizable to the Congress that designed\xe2\x80\x9d it.  Tailoring Rule 31555.  Since, as we hold above, the statute does not compel EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, it would be patently unreason-able\xe2\x80\x94not to say outrageous\xe2\x80\x94for EPA to insist on seizing expansive power that it admits the statute is not designed to grant.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        EPA thought that despite the foregoing problems, it could make its interpretation reasonable by adjusting the levels at which a source\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse-gas emissions would oblige it to undergo PSD and Title V permitting.  Although the Act, in no uncertain terms, requires permits for sources with the potential to emit more than 100 or 250 tons per year of a relevant pollutant, EPA in its Tailoring Rule wrote a new threshold of 100,000 tons per year for greenhouse gases.  Since the Court of Appeals thought the statute unambiguously made greenhouse gases capable of triggering PSD and Title V, it held that petitioners lacked Article III standing to challenge the Tailoring Rule because that rule did not injure petitioners but merely relaxed the pre-existing statutory requirements.  Because we, however, hold that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the triggers was not compelled, and because EPA has essentially admitted that its interpretation would be unreasonable without \xe2\x80\x9ctailoring,\xe2\x80\x9d we consider the validity of the Tailoring Rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We conclude that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s rewriting of the statutory thresholds was impermissible and therefore could not validate the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the triggering provisions.  An agency has no power to \xe2\x80\x9ctailor\xe2\x80\x9d legislation to bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous statutory terms.  Agencies exercise discretion only in the interstices created by statutory silence or ambiguity; they must always \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 644,\n665 (2007)\n (quoting Chevron, 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 843).  It is hard to imagine a statutory term less ambiguous than the precise numerical thresholds at which the Act requires PSD and Title V permitting.  When EPA replaced those numbers with others of its own choosing, it went well beyond the \xe2\x80\x9cbounds of its statutory authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arlington, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Solicitor General does not, and cannot, defend the Tailoring Rule as an exercise of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement discretion.  The Tailoring Rule is not just an announcement of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to enforce the statutory permitting requirements; it purports to alter those requirements and to establish with the force of law that otherwise-prohibited conduct will not violate the Act.  This alteration of the statutory requirements was crucial to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctailoring\xe2\x80\x9d efforts.  Without it, small entities with the potential to emit greenhouse gases in amounts exceeding the statutory thresholds would have remained subject to citizen suits\xe2\x80\x94authorized by the Act\xe2\x80\x94to enjoin their construction, modification, or operation and to impose civil penalties of up to $37,500 per day of violation.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77413(b), 7604(a), (f)(4); 40 CFR \xc2\xa719.4.  EPA itself has recently affirmed that the \xe2\x80\x9cindependent enforcement authority\xe2\x80\x9d furnished by the citizen-suit provision cannot be displaced by a permitting authority\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to pursue enforcement.  78 Fed. Reg. 12477, 12486\xe2\x80\x9312487 (2013).  The Solicitor General is therefore quite right to acknowledge that the availability of citizen suits made it necessary for EPA, in seekingto mitigate the unreasonableness of its greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation, to go beyond merely exercising its enforcement discretion.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 87\xe2\x80\x9388.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For similar reasons, Morton v. Ruiz,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 199 (1974)\n\xe2\x80\x94to which the Solicitor General points as the best case supporting the Tailoring Rule, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 71, 80\xe2\x80\x9381\xe2\x80\x94is irrelevant.  In Ruiz, Congress had appropriated funds for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to spend on providing assistance to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Indians throughout the United States\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and had not \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[d] any geographical limitation on the availability of general assistance benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 206\xe2\x80\x93207, and n.\xc2\xa07.  Although we held the Bureau could not deny benefits to off-reservation Indians because it had not published its eligibility criteria, we stated in dictum that the Bureau could, if it followed proper administrative procedures, \xe2\x80\x9ccreate reasonable classifications and eligibility requirements in order to allocate the limited funds available.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 230\xe2\x80\x93231.  That dictum stands only for the unremarkable proposition that an agency may adopt policies to prioritize its expenditures within the bounds established by Congress.  See also Lincoln v. Vigil,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 182\n\xe2\x80\x93193 (1993).  Nothing in Ruiz remotely authorizes an agency to modify unambiguous requirements imposed by a federal statute.  An agency confronting resource constraints may change its own conduct, but it cannot change the law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Were we to recognize the authority claimed by EPA in the Tailoring Rule, we would deal a severe blow to the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s separation of powers.  Under our system of government, Congress makes laws and the President, acting at times through agencies like EPA, \xe2\x80\x9cfaithfully execute[s]\xe2\x80\x9d them.  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa73; see Medell\xc3\xadn v. Texas,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 491\n\xe2\x80\x93527 (2008).  The power of executing the laws necessarily includes both authority and responsibility to resolve some questions left open by Congress that arise during the law\xe2\x80\x99s administration.  But it does not include a power to revise clear statutory terms that turn out not to work in practice.  See, e.g., Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438,\n462 (2002)\n (agency lacked authority \xe2\x80\x9cto develop new guidelines or to assign liability in a manner inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguous statute\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the Tailoring Rule, EPA asserts newfound authority to regulate millions of small sources\xe2\x80\x94including retail stores, offices, apartment buildings, shopping centers, schools, and churches\xe2\x80\x94and to decide, on an ongoing basis and without regard for the thresholds prescribed by Congress, how many of those sources to regulate.  We are not willing to stand on the dock and wave goodbye as EPA embarks on this multiyear voyage of discovery.  We reaffirm the core administrative-law principle that an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.  EPA therefore lacked authority to \xe2\x80\x9ctailor\xe2\x80\x9d the Act\xe2\x80\x99s unambiguous numerical thresholds to accommodate its greenhouse-gas-inclusive interpretation of the permitting triggers.  Instead, the need to rewrite clear provisions of the statute should have alerted EPA that it had taken a wrong interpretive turn.  Agencies are not free to \xe2\x80\x9cadopt .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unreasonable interpretations of statutory provisions and then edit other statu-tory provisions to mitigate the unreasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 175, 2012 WL 6621785, *16 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Because the Tailoring Rule cannot save EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the triggers, that interpretation was impermissible under Chevron.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B.

But what about \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d sources, those that would need permits based on their emissions of more conventional pollutants (such as particulate matter)?

BACT, they say, has traditionally been about end-of-stack controls \xe2\x80\x9csuch as catalytic converters or particle collectors\xe2\x80\x9d; but applying it to greenhouse gases will make it more about regulating energy use, which will enable regulators to control \xe2\x80\x9cevery aspect of a facility\xe2\x80\x99s operation and design,\xe2\x80\x9d right down to the \xe2\x80\x9clight bulbs in the factory cafeteria.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Regulation et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 12\xe2\x80\x931254, p. 7; see Joint Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 12\xe2\x80\x931248 etc., pp. 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (\xe2\x80\x9cBACT for [greenhouse gases] becomes an unbounded exercise in command-and-control regulation\xe2\x80\x9d of everything from \xe2\x80\x9cefficient light bulbs\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cbasic industrial processes\xe2\x80\x9d).

For one, BACT is based on \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol technology\xe2\x80\x9d for the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproposed facility,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77475(a)(4); therefore, it has long been held that BACT cannot be used to order a fundamental redesign of the facility.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. EPA, 499 F.\xc2\xa03d 653, 654\xe2\x80\x93655 (CA7 2007); In\xc2\xa0re Pennsauken Cty., N.\xc2\xa0J., Resource Recovery Facility, 2 E.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0D. 667, 673 (EAB 1988).  For another, EPA has long interpreted BACT as required only for pollutants that the source itself emits, see 44 Fed. Reg. 51947 (1979); accordingly, EPA acknowledges that BACT may not be used to require \xe2\x80\x9creductions in a facility\xe2\x80\x99s demand for energy from the electric grid.\xe2\x80\x9d  Guidance 24.  Finally, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s guidance suggests that BACT should not require every conceivable change that could result in minor improvements in energy efficiency, such as the aforementioned light bulbs.  Id., at 31.  The guidance explains that permitting authorities should instead consider whether a proposed regulatory burden outweighs any reduction in emissions to be achieved, and should concentrate on the facility\xe2\x80\x99s equipment that uses the largest amounts of energy.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The question before us is whether EPA\xe2\x80\x99s decision to require BACT for greenhouse gases emitted by sources otherwise subject to PSD review is, as a general matter, a permissible interpretation of the statute under Chevron.  We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The text of the BACT provision is far less open-ended than the text of the PSD and Title V permitting triggers.  It states that BACT is required \xe2\x80\x9cfor each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d (i.e., the entire Act), \xc2\xa77475(a)(4), a phrase that\xe2\x80\x94as the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit wrote 35 years ago\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwould not seem readily susceptible [of] misinterpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F.\xc2\xa02d 323, 404 (1979).  Whereas the dubious breadth of \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d in the permitting triggers suggests a role for agency judgment in identifying the subset of pollutants covered by the particular regulatory program at issue, the more specific phrasing of the BACT provision suggests that the necessary judgment has already been made by Congress.  The wider statutory context likewise does not suggest that the BACT provision can bear a narrowing construction: There is no indication that the Act elsewhere uses, or that EPA has interpreted, \xe2\x80\x9ceach pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d to mean anything other than what it says.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Even if the text were not clear, applying BACT to greenhouse gases is not so disastrously unworkable, and need not result in such a dramatic expansion of agency authority, as to convince us that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is unreasonable.  We are not talking about extending EPA jurisdiction over millions of previously unregulated entities, but about moderately increasing the demands EPA (or a state permitting authority) can make of entities already subject to its regulation.  And it is not yet clear that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s demands will be of a significantly different character from those traditionally associated with PSD review.  In short, the record before us does not establish that the BACT provision as written is incapable of being sensibly applied to greenhouse gases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We acknowledge the potential for greenhouse-gas BACT to lead to an unreasonable and unanticipated degree of regulation, and our decision should not be taken as an endorsement of all aspects of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s current approach, nor as a free rein for any future regulatory application of BACT in this distinct context.  Our narrow holding is that nothing in the statute categorically prohibits EPA from interpreting the BACT provision to apply to greenhouse gases emitted by \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d sources.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        However, EPA may require an \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d source to comply with greenhouse-gas BACT only if the source emits more than a de minimis amount of greenhouse gases.  As noted above, the Tailoring Rule applies BACT only if a source emits greenhouse gases in excess of 75,000 tons per year CO2e, but the Rule makes clear that EPA did not arrive at that number by identifying the de minimis level.  See nn. 1, 3, supra.  EPA may establish an appropriate de minimis threshold below which BACT is not required for a source\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse-gas emissions.  We do not hold that 75,000 tons per year CO2e necessarily exceeds a true de minimis level, only that EPA must justify its selection on proper grounds.  Cf. Alabama Power, supra, at 405.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        To sum up: We hold that EPA exceeded its statutory authority when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to require PSD and Title V permitting for stationary sources based on their greenhouse-gas emissions.  Specifically, the Agency may not treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant for pur-poses of defining a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9d (or a \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d thereof) in the PSD context or a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor source\xe2\x80\x9d in the Title V context.  To the extent its regulations purport to do so, they are invalid.  EPA may, however, continue to treat greenhouse gases as a \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant subject to regulation under this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of requiring BACT for \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d sources.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Although the statute sets numerical thresholds (100 or 250 tons per year) for emissions that will make a facility \xe2\x80\x9cmajor,\xe2\x80\x9d it does not specify by how much a physical or operational change must increase emissions to constitute a permit-requiring \xe2\x80\x9cmodification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor does it say how much of a given regulated pollutant a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9d must emit before it is subject to BACT for that pollutant.

Judge Kavanaugh argued below that it would be plausible for EPA to read \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d in the PSD context as limited to the six NAAQS pollutants.  See  v. , No. 09\xe2\x80\x931322 etc. (CADC, Dec. 20, 2012), App. 171\xe2\x80\x93180, 2012 WL 6621785, *15\xe2\x80\x93*18 (opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Some petitioners make a slightly different argument: that because PSD permitting is required only for major emitting facilities \xe2\x80\x9cin any area to which [the PSD program] applies,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77475(a), the relevant pollutants are only those NAAQS pollutants for which the area in question is designated attainment or unclassifiable.  That approach would bring EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the PSD trigger in line with its longstanding interpretation of the permitting requirements for nonattainment areas.  Others maintain that \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d in the PSD provision should be limited to air pollutants with localized effects on air quality.  We do not foreclose EPA or the courts from considering those constructions in the future, but we need not do so today.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0A few additional points bear mentioning.  The Solicitor General conjectures that EPA might eventually alter its longstanding interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cpotential to emit\xe2\x80\x9d in order to reduce the number of sources required to have permits at the statutory thresholds.  But neither he nor the Agency has given us any reason to believe that there exists a plausible reading of \xe2\x80\x9cpotential to emit\xe2\x80\x9d that EPA would willingly adopt and that would eliminate the unreasonableness of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Nor have we been given any information about the ability of other possible \xe2\x80\x9cstreamlining\xe2\x80\x9d techniques alluded to by EPA\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9celectronic\xe2\x80\x9d permitting\xe2\x80\x94to reduce the administrability problems identified above; and in any event, none of those techniques would address the more fundamental problem of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s claiming regulatory authority over millions of small entities that it acknowledges the Act does not seek to regulate.  Finally, the Solicitor General suggests that the incompatibility of greenhouse gases with the PSD program and Title V results chiefly from the inclusion of carbon dioxide in the \xe2\x80\x9caggregate pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d defined by EPA.  We decide these cases on the basis of the pollutant \xe2\x80\x9cgreenhouse gases\xe2\x80\x9d as EPA has defined and regulated it, and we express no view on how our analysis might change were EPA to define it differently.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">8</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0 argues, at 10 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), that when the statutory permitting thresholds of 100 or 250 tons per year do not provide a \xe2\x80\x9csensible regulatory line,\xe2\x80\x9d EPA is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cread an unwritten exception\xe2\x80\x9d into \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular number used by the statute\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94by which he apparently means that the Agency is entitled to substitute a dramatically higher number, such as 100,000.

As is the case with the PSD and Title V thresholds,trying to fit greenhouse gases into the BACT analysis badly distorts the scheme that Congress adopted.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court gives two main reasons for concluding that BACT applies to \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d sources, one based on textand one based on practical considerations.  Neither isconvincing.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        With respect to the text, it is curious that the Court, having departed from a literal interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant\xe2\x80\x9d in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, turns on its heels and adopts a literal interpretation in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B.  The coverage thresholds at issue in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A apply to any \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s general definition of this term is broad, and in Massachusetts v. EPA, supra, the Court held that this definition covers greenhouse gases.  The Court does not disturb that holding, but it nevertheless concludes that, as used in the provision triggering PSD coverage, the term \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant\xe2\x80\x9d actually means \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant, other than a greenhouse gas.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, the relevant statutory provision saysthat BACT must be installed for any \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant subjectto regulation under [the Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77475(a)(4).  If the term \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant, other than a greenhouse gas,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court effectively concludes in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, the term \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant subject to regulation under [the Act]\xe2\x80\x9d in  \xc2\xa77475(a)(4) should mean \xe2\x80\x9cpollutant, other than a greenhouse gas, subject to regulation under [the Act], and that is subject to regulation under [the Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s literalism is selective, and it results in a strange and disjointed regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, a source can emit an unlimited quantity of greenhouse gases without triggering the need for a PSD permit.  Why might Congress have wanted to allow this?  The most likely explanation is that the PSD permitting process is simply not suited for use in regulating this particular pollutant.  And if that is so, it makes little sense to require the installation of BACT for greenhouse gases in those instances in which a source happens to be required to obtain a permit due to the emission of a qualifying quantity of some other pollutant that is regulated under the Act.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s second reason for holding that BACT applies to \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d sources is its belief that this can be done without disastrous consequences.  Only time will tell whether this hope is well founded, but it seems clear that BACT analysis is fundamentally incompatible with the regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions for at least two important reasons.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, BACT looks to the effects of covered pollutants in the area in which a source is located.  The PSD program is implemented through \xe2\x80\x9cemission limitations and such other measures\xe2\x80\x9d as are \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in each region.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77471 (emphasis added).  The Clean Air Act provides that BACT must be identified \xe2\x80\x9con a case-by-case basis,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77479(3), and this necessarily means that local conditions must be taken into account.  For this reason, the Act instructs the EPA to issue regulations requiring an analysis of \xe2\x80\x9cthe ambient air quality .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at the site of the proposed major emitting facil-ity and in the area potentially affected by the emissions from such facility for each pollutant regulated under [the Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77475(e)(3)(B) (emphasis added).  The Act also requires a public hearing on \xe2\x80\x9cthe air quality at the proposed site and in areas which may be affected by emissions from such facility for each pollutant subject to regulation under [the Act] which will be emitted from such facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77475(a)(2), (e)(1) (emphasis added).  Accordingly, if BACT is required for greenhouse gases, the Act demands that the impact of these gases in the area surrounding a site must be monitored, explored at a public hearing, and considered as part of the permitting process.  The effects of greenhouse gases, however, are global, not local.  See PSD and Title V Permitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases 41\xe2\x80\x9342 (Mar. 2011) (hereinafter Guidance).  As a result, the EPA has declared that PSD permit applicants and permitting officials may disregard these provisions of the Act.  75 Fed. Reg. 31520 (2010).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, as part of the case-by-case analysis required by BACT, a permitting authority must balance the environmental benefit expected to result from the installation of an available control measure against adverse consequences that may result, including any negative impact on the environment, energy conservation, and the economy.  And the EPA itself has admitted that this cannot be done on a case-by-case basis with respect to greenhouse gases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Clean Air Act makes it clear that BACT must be determined on a \xe2\x80\x9ccase-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77479(3).  To implement this directive, the EPA adopted a five-step framework for making a BACT determination.  See New Source Review Workshop Manual: Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattainment Area Permitting (Oct. 1990).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Under the fourth step of this analysis, potentially applicable and feasible control technologies that are candidates for selection as BACT for a particular source are eliminated from consideration based on their \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral impacts,\xe2\x80\x9d such as any adverse environmental effects or adverse effects on energy consumption or the economy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        More recently, the EPA provided guidance to permitting authorities regarding the treatment of greenhouse-gas emissions under this framework, and the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s guidance demonstrates the insuperable problem that results when an attempt is made to apply this framework to greenhouse gas emissions.  As noted above, at step 4 of the framework, a permitting authority must balance the positive effect likely to result from requiring a particular source to install a particular technology against a variety of negative effects that are likely to occur if that step is taken.  Butin the case of greenhouse gases, how can a permit-ting authority make this individualized, source-specific determination?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The EPA instructs permitting authorities to take into consideration all the adverse effects that the EPA has found to result from the overall increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  These include an increased risk of dangerous heat waves, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and drought, as well as risks to agriculture, forestry, and water resources.  Guidance 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  But the EPA admits that it is simply not possible for a permitting authority to calculate in any meaningful way the degree to which any potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from any individual source might reduce these risks.  And without making such a calculation in even a very rough way, a permitting authority cannot do what the Clean Air Act and the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s framework demand\xe2\x80\x94compare the benefits of some specified reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases from a particular source with any adverse environmental or economic effects that might result from mandating such a reduction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Suppose, for example, that a permitting authority must decide whether to mandate a change that both decreases a source\xe2\x80\x99s emission of greenhouse gases and increases its emission of a conventional pollutant that has a negative effect on public health.  How should a permitting authority decide whether to require this change?  Here is the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s advice:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen considering the trade-offs between the environmental impacts of a particular level of GHG [greenhouse gas] reduction and a collateral increase in another regulated NSR pollutant,[[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]] rather than attempting to determine or characterize specific environmental impacts from GHGs emitted at particular locations, EPA recommends that permitting authorities focus on the amount of GHG emission reductions that may be gained or lost by employing a particular control strategy and how that compares to the environmental or other impacts resulting from the collateral emissions increase of other regulated NSR pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d  Guidance 42.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As best I can make out, what this means is that permitting authorities should not even try to assess the net impact on public health.  Instead of comparing the positive and negative public health effects of a particular option, permitting authorities are instructed to compare the adverse public health effects of increasing the emissions of the conventional pollutants with the amount of the reduction of the source\xe2\x80\x99s emissions of greenhouse gases.  But without knowing the positive effects of the latter, this is a meaningless comparison.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The EPA tries to ameliorate this problem by noting that permitting authorities are entitled to \xe2\x80\x9ca great deal of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d Guidance 41, but without a comprehensible standard, what this will mean is arbitrary and inconsistent decisionmaking.  That is not what the Clean Air Act contemplates.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        BACT analysis, like the rest of the Clean Air Act, was developed for use in regulating the emission of conventional pollutants and is simply not suited for use with respect to greenhouse gases.

EPA,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497 (2007)\n, we held that greenhouse gases fall within the Clean Air Act\xe2\x80\x99s general definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77602(g).  549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 528\xe2\x80\x93529.  We also held, consequently, that the Environmental Protection Agency is empowered and required by Title II of the Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources (such as cars and trucks) if it decides that greenhouse gases \xe2\x80\x9ccontribute to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77521(a)(1).  549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 532\xe2\x80\x93533.  The EPA determined that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, 74 Fed. Reg. 66496 (2009) (Endangerment Finding), and so it issued regulations for mobile emissions, 75 Fed. Reg. 25324 (2010) (Tailpipe Rule).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        These cases take as a given our decision in Massachusetts that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s general definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d includes greenhouse gases.  One of the questions posed by these cases is whether those gases fall within the scope of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d as that phrase is used in the more specific provisions of the Act here at issue.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer is \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x9324.  I disagree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Clean Air Act provisions at issue here are Title I\xe2\x80\x99s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, \xc2\xa77470 et seq., and Title V\xe2\x80\x99s permitting regime, \xc2\xa77661 et seq.  By contrast to Title II, Titles I and V apply to stationary sources, such as power plants and factories.  Under the PSD program, \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facilities\xe2\x80\x9d constructed in the United States must meet certain requirements, including obtaining a permit that imposes emissions limitations, \xc2\xa77475(a)(1), and using \xe2\x80\x9cthe best available control technology for each pollutant subject to regulation under [the Act] emitted from\xe2\x80\x9d the facility, \xc2\xa77475(a)(4).

As the Court explains, tens of thousands of stationary sources emit large quantities of one greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.  See ante, at 17\xe2\x80\x9320, and n.\xc2\xa07.  To apply the programs at issue here to all those sources would be extremely expensive and burdensome, counterproductive, and perhaps impossible; it would also contravene Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent that the programs\xe2\x80\x99 coverage be limited to those large sources whose emissions are substantial enough to justify the regulatory burdens.  Ibid.  The EPA recognized as much, and it addressed the problem by issuing a regulation\xe2\x80\x94the Tailoring Rule\xe2\x80\x94that purports to raise the coverage threshold for greenhouse gases from the statutory figure of 250 tpy to 100,000 tpyin order to keep the programs\xe2\x80\x99 coverage limited to \xe2\x80\x9ca rela-tively small number of large industrial sources.\xe2\x80\x9d  75 Fed.

But what are we to do about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language?  The statute specifies a definite number\xe2\x80\x94250, not 100,000\xe2\x80\x94and it says that facilities that are covered by that number must meet the program\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  The statute says nothing about agency discretion to change that number.  What is to be done?  How, given the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, can the EPA exempt from regulation sources that emit more than 250 but less than 100,000 tpy of greenhouse gases (and that also do not emit other regulated pollutants at threshold levels)?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court answers by (1) pointing out that regulation at the 250 tpy threshold would produce absurd results, (2) refusing to read the statute as compelling such results, and (3) consequently interpreting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d as containing an implicit exception for greenhouse gases.

Put differently, the Court reads the statute as defining \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9dto mean \xe2\x80\x9cstationary sources that have the potential to emit two hundred fifty tons per year or more of any air pollutant except for those air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, with respect to which regulation at that threshold would be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller sources that Congress did not mean to cover.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no insuperable textual barrier to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpreting \xe2\x80\x98any air pollutant\xe2\x80\x99 in the permitting triggers of PSD and Title V to encompass only pollutants emitted in quantities that enable them to be sensibly regulated at the statutory thresholds, and to exclude those atypical pollutants that, like greenhouse gases, are emitted in such vast quantities that their inclusion would radically transform those programs and render them unworkable as written\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I agree with the Court that the word \xe2\x80\x9cany,\xe2\x80\x9d when used in a statute, does not normally mean \xe2\x80\x9cany in the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. FCC v. NextWave Personal Communications Inc.,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 293,\n311 (2003)\n (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Tell all customers that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99 does not refer to every customer of every business in the world\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9c[g]eneral terms as used on particular occasions often carry with them implied restrictions as to scope,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., and so courts must interpret the word \xe2\x80\x9cany,\xe2\x80\x9d like all other words, in context.  As Judge Learned Hand pointed out when interpreting another statute many years ago, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e can best reach the meaning here, as always, by recourse to the underlying purpose, and, with that as a guide, by trying to project upon the specific occasion how we think persons, actuated by such a purpose, would have dealt with it, if it had been presented to them at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Borella v. Borden Co., 145 F.\xc2\xa02d 63, 64 (CA2 1944).  The pursuit of that underlying purpose may sometimes require us to \xe2\x80\x9cabandon\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cliteral interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of a word like \xe2\x80\x9cany.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 64\xe2\x80\x9365.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The law has long recognized that terms such as \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d admit of unwritten limitations and exceptions.  Legal philosophers like to point out that a statute providing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]hoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be punished by death\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d need not encompass a man who kills in self-defense; nor must an ordinance imposing fines upon those who occupy a public parking spot for more than two hours penalize a driver who is unable to move because of a parade.  See Fuller, The Case of the Speluncean Explorers, 62 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 616, 619, 624 (1949); see also United States v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482, 485\xe2\x80\x93487 (1869) (holding that a statute forbidding knowing and willful obstruction of the mail contains an implicit exception permitting a local sheriff to arrest a mail carrier).  The maxim cessante ratione legis cessat ipse lex\xe2\x80\x94where a law\xe2\x80\x99s rationale ceases to apply, so does the law itself\xe2\x80\x94is not of recent origin.  See, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 678,\n699 (2001)\n (citing 1 E. Coke, Institutes *70b); Green v. Liter, 8 Cranch 229, 249 (1814) (Story, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9ccessante ratione, cessat ipsa lex\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I also agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s point that \xe2\x80\x9ca generic reference to air pollutants\xe2\x80\x9d in the Clean Air Act need not \xe2\x80\x9cencompass every substance falling within the Act-wide definition\xe2\x80\x9d that we construed in Massachusetts, \xc2\xa77602(g).  See ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  As the Court notes, the EPA has interpreted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d which is used several times in the Act, as limited to \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutants for which EPA has promulgated [new source performance standards]\xe2\x80\x9d in the portion of the Act dealing with those standards, as limited to \xe2\x80\x9cvisibility-impairing air pollutants\xe2\x80\x9d in the part of the Act concerned with deleterious effects on visibility, and as limited to \xe2\x80\x9cpollutants for which the area is designated nonattainment\xe2\x80\x9d in the part of the Act aimed at regions that fail to attain air quality standards.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But I do not agree with the Court that the only way to avoid an absurd or otherwise impermissible result in these cases is to create an atextual greenhouse gas exception to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  After all, the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d makes an earlier appearance in the definitional provision, which defines \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. source with the potential to emit two hundred and fifty tons per year or more of any air pollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77479(1) (emphasis added).  As a linguistic matter, one can just as easily read an implicit exception for small-scale greenhouse gas emissions into the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany source\xe2\x80\x9d as into the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  And given the purposes of the PSD program and the Act as a whole, as well as the specific roles of the different parts of the statutory definition, finding flexibility in \xe2\x80\x9cany source\xe2\x80\x9d is far more sensible than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s route of finding it in \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The implicit exception I propose reads almost word for word the same as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s, except that the location of the exception has shifted.  To repeat, the Court reads the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9d as if it referred to \xe2\x80\x9cany source with the potential to emit two hundred fifty tons per year or more of any air pollutant except for those air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, with respect to which regulation at that threshold would be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller sources that Congress did not mean to cover.\xe2\x80\x9d  I would simply move the implicit exception, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve italicized, so that it applies to \xe2\x80\x9csource\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cany source with the potential to emit two hundred fifty tons per year or more of any air pollutant except for those sources, such as those emitting unmanageably small amounts of greenhouse gases, with respect to which regulation at that threshold would be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller sources that Congress did not mean to cover.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        From a legal, administrative, and functional perspective\xe2\x80\x94that is, from a perspective that assumes that Congress was not merely trying to arrange words on paper but was seeking to achieve a real-world purpose\xe2\x80\x94my way of reading the statute is the more sensible one.  For one thing, my reading is consistent with the specific purpose underlying the 250 tpy threshold specified by the statute.  The purpose of that number was not to prevent the regulation of dangerous air pollutants that cannot be sensibly regulated at that particular threshold, though that is the effect that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading gives the threshold.  Rather, the purpose was to limit the PSD program\xe2\x80\x99s obligations to larger sources while exempting the many small sources whose emissions are low enough that imposing burdensome regulatory requirements on them would be senseless.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Thus, the accompanying Senate Report explains that the PSD program \xe2\x80\x9cis reasonable and necessary for very large sources, such as new electrical generating plants or new steel mills.  But the procedure would prove costly and potentially unreasonable if imposed on construction of storage facilities for a small gasoline jobber or on the construction of a new heating plant at a junior college.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93127, p. 96 (1977).  And the principal sponsor of the Clean Air Act amendments at issue here, Senator Edmund Muskie, told the Senate that the program would not cover \xe2\x80\x9chouses, dairies, farms, highways, hospitals, schools, grocery stores, and other such sources.\xe2\x80\x9d  123 Cong. Rec. 18013, 18021 (1977).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The EPA, exercising the legal authority to which it is entitled under Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837 (1984)\n, understood the threshold\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in the same light.  It explained that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s objective was</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cto limit the PSD program to large industrial sources because it was those sources that were the primary cause of the pollution problems in question and because those sources would have the resources to comply with the PSD requirements.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s mechanism for limiting PSD was the 100/250 tpy threshold limitations.  Focused as it was primarily on NAAQS pollutants [that is, those air pollutants for which the EPA has issued a national ambient air quality standard under Title I of the Act, see EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.\xc2\xa0P., 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4)], Congress considered sources that emit NAAQS pollutants in those quantities generally to be the large industrial sources to which it intended PSD to be limited.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. 31555.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court similarly acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cthe PSD program and Title V are designed to apply to, and cannot rationally be extended beyond, a relative handful of large sources capable of shouldering heavy substantive and procedural burdens.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18; see also Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F.\xc2\xa02d 323, 353 (CADC 1979) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99s intention was to identify facilities which, due to their size, are financially able to bear the substantial regulatory costs imposed by the PSD provisions and which, as a group, are primarily responsible for emission of the deleterious pollutants that befoul our nation\xe2\x80\x99s air\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        An implicit source-related exception would serve this statutory purpose while going no further.  The implicit exception that the Court reads into the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d by contrast, goes well beyond the limited congressional objective.  Nothing in the statutory text, the legislative history, or common sense suggests that Congress, when it imposed the 250 tpy threshold, was trying to undermine its own deliberate decision to use the broad language \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d by removing some substances (rather than some facilities) from the PSD program\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For another thing, a source-related exception serves the flexible nature of the Clean Air Act.  We observed in Massachusetts that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile the Congresses that drafted\xe2\x80\x9d the Act \xe2\x80\x9cmight not have appreciated the possibility that burning fossil fuels could lead to global warming, they did understand that without regulatory flexibility, changing circumstances and scientific developments would soon render the Clean Air Act obsolete.\xe2\x80\x9d  549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 532.  We recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he broad language of\xe2\x80\x9d the Act-wide definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creflects an intentional effort to confer the flexibility necessary to forestall such obsolescence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to read greenhouse gases out of the PSD program drains the Act of its flexibility and chips away at our decision in Massachusetts.  What sense does it make to read the Act as generally granting the EPA the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and then to read it as denying that power with respect to the programs for large stationary sources at issue here?  It is anomalous to read the Act to require the EPA to regulate air pollutants that pose previously unforeseen threats to human health and welfare where \xe2\x80\x9c250 tons per year\xe2\x80\x9d is a sensible regulatory line but not where, by chemical or regulatory happenstance, a higher line must be drawn.  And it is anomalous to read an unwritten exception into the more important phrase of the statutory definition (\xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d) when a similar unwritten exception to less important language (the particular number used by the statute) will do just as well.  The implicit exception preferred by the Court produces all of these anomalies, while the source-related exception I propose creates none of them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In addition, the interpretation I propose leaves the EPA with the sort of discretion as to interstitial matters that Congress likely intended it to retain.  My interpretation gives the EPA nothing more than the authority to exempt sources from regulation insofar as the Agency reasonably determines that applying the PSD program to them would expand the program so much as to contravene Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  That sort of decision, which involves the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s technical expertise and administrative experience, is the kind of decision that Congress typically leaves to the agencies to make.  Cf. Barnhart v. Walton,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 212,\n222 (2002)\n (enumerating factors that we take to indicate that Congress intends the agency to exercise the discre-tion provided by Chevron).  To read the Act to grant that discretion here is to read it as furthering Congress\xe2\x80\x99s (and the public\xe2\x80\x99s) interest in more effective, less wastefulregulation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Last, but by no means least, a source-related exception advances the Act\xe2\x80\x99s overall purpose.  That broad purpose, as set forth at the beginning of the statute, is \xe2\x80\x9cto protect and enhance the quality of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77401(b)(1); see also \xc2\xa77470(1) (A purpose of the PSD program in particularis \xe2\x80\x9cto protect public health and welfare from any actualor potential adverse effect which in the Administra-tor\xe2\x80\x99s judgment may reasonably be anticipate[d] to occur from air pollution\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa77602(h) (\xe2\x80\x9cAll language [in the Act] referring to effects on welfare includes .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. effects on .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. weather .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and climate\xe2\x80\x9d).  The expert agency charged with administering the Act has determined in its En-dangerment Finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, and so sensible regulation of industrial emissions of those pollutants is at the core of the purpose behind the Act.  The broad \xe2\x80\x9cno greenhouse gases\xe2\x80\x9d exception that the Court reads into the statute unnecessarily undercuts that purpose, while my narrow source-related exception would leave the Agency with the tools it needs to further it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that stationary sources that are subject to the PSD program because they emit other (non-greenhouse-gas) pollutants in quantities above the statutory threshold\xe2\x80\x94those facilities that the Court refers to as \xe2\x80\x9canyway\xe2\x80\x9d sources\xe2\x80\x94must meet the \xe2\x80\x9cbest available control technology\xe2\x80\x9d requirement of \xc2\xa77475(a)(4) with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.  I therefore join Part II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932 of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  But as for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the EPA cannot interpret the language at issue here to cover facilities that emit more than 100,000 tpy of greenhouse gases by virtue of those emissions, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
