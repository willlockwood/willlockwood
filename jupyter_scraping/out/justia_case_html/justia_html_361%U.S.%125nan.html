Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals; the order of the District Court, issued May 29, 1959, directing the petitioner to appear before the grand jury; the order to show cause issued by the District Court on May 19, 1959; and the order of the District Court, entered April 3, 1959, denying the petitioner\'s motion to quash the writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, and directing him to appear before the grand jury on April 9, 1959, are vacated.
