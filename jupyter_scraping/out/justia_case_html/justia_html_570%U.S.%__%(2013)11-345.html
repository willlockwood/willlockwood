She sued the University and school officials, alleging that the University\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race in admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the University.  Affirming, the Fifth Circuit held that Grutter required courts to give substantial deference to the University, both in the definition of the compelling interest in diversity\xe2\x80\x99s benefits and in deciding whether its specific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal.  Applying that standard, the court upheld the University\xe2\x80\x99s admissions plan.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the University to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.

In Bakke\xe2\x80\x99s principal opinion, Justice Powell recognized that state university \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions based on race or ethnic origin .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are reviewable under the \n \nFourteenth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 287, using a strict scrutiny standard, id., at 299.  He identified as a compelling interest that could justify the consideration of race the interest in the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body, but noted that this interest is complex, encompassing a broad array \xe2\x80\x9cof qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 315\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Gratz and Grutter, the Court endorsed these precepts, observing that an admissions process with such an interest is subject to judicial review and must withstand strict scrutiny, Gratz, supra, at 275, i.e., a university must clearly demonstrate that its \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the accomplishment\xe2\x80\x9d of its purpose,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Bakke, supra, at 305.  Additional guidance may be found in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s broader equal protection jurisprudence.  See, e.g., Rice v. Cayetano, \n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 495\n; Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 469\n.  Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and the government bears the burden to prove \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that the reasons for any [racial] classification [are] clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied to any admissions program using racial categories or classifications.  A court may give some deference to a university\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission,\xe2\x80\x9d 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 328, provided that diversity is not defined as mere racial balancing and there is a reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision.  On this point, the courts below were correct in finding that Grutter calls for deference to the University\xe2\x80\x99s experience and expertise about its educational mission.  However, once the University has established that its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, the University must prove that the means it chose to attain that diversity are narrowly tailored to its goal.  On this point, the University receives no deference.  Id., at 333.  It is at all times the University\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to demonstrate, and the Judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to determine, that admissions processes \xe2\x80\x9censure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 337.  Narrow tailoring also requires a reviewing court to verify that it is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d for the university to use race to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.  Bakke, supra, at 305.  The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRather than perform this searching examination, the Fifth Circuit held petitioner could challenge only whether the University\xe2\x80\x99s decision to use race as an admissions factor \xe2\x80\x9cwas made in good faith.\xe2\x80\x9d  It presumed that the school had acted in good faith and gave petitioner the burden of rebutting that presumption.  It thus undertook the narrow-tailoring requirement with a \xe2\x80\x9cdegree of deference\xe2\x80\x9d to the school.  These expressions of the controlling standard are at odds with Grutter\xe2\x80\x99s command that \xe2\x80\x9call racial classifications imposed by government \xe2\x80\x98must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 326.  Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a school\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here.  The Court vacates the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis.  In determining whether summary judgment in the University\xe2\x80\x99s favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.

Race is not itself assigned a numerical value for each ap-plicant, but the University has committed itself to increasing racial minority enrollment on campus.  It refers to this goal as a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical mass.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner, who is Caucasian, sued the University after her application was re-jected.

Bakke, \n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 265, \n305 (1978)\n (opinion of Powell, J.).  Because the Court of Appeals did not apply the correct standard of strict scrutiny, its decision affirming the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment to the University was incorrect.  That decision is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLocated in Austin, Texas, on the most renowned campus of the Texas state university system, the University is one of the leading institutions of higher education in the Nation.  Admission is prized and competitive.  In 2008, when petitioner sought admission to the University\xe2\x80\x99s entering class, she was 1 of 29,501 applicants.  From this group 12,843 were admitted, and 6,715 accepted and enrolled.  Petitioner was denied admission.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn recent years the University has used three different programs to evaluate candidates for admission.  The first is the program it used for some years before 1997, when the University considered two factors: a numerical score reflecting an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s test scores and academic perform-ance in high school (Academic Index or AI), and the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s race.  In 1996, this system was held unconstitutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  It ruled the University\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did not further any compelling government interest.  Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.\xc2\xa03d 932, 955 (1996).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second program was adopted to comply with the Hopwood decision.  The University stopped considering race in admissions and substituted instead a new holistic metric of a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s potential contribution to the University, to be used in conjunction with the Academic Index.  This \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal Achievement Index\xe2\x80\x9d (PAI) measures a student\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and work experience, awards, extracurricular activities, community service, and other special circumstances that give insight into a student\xe2\x80\x99s background.  These included growing up in a single-parent home, speaking a language other than English at home, significant family responsibilities assumed by the applicant, and the general socioeconomic condition of the student\xe2\x80\x99s family.  Seeking to address the decline in minority enrollment after Hopwood, the University also expanded its outreach programs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Texas State Legislature also responded to the Hop-wood decision.  It enacted a measure known as the Top Ten Percent Law, codified at Tex. Educ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa751.803 (West 2009).  Also referred to as H.\xc2\xa0B. 588, the Top Ten Percent Law grants automatic admission to any public state college, including the University, to all students in the top 10% of their class at high schools in Texas that comply with certain standards.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe University\xe2\x80\x99s revised admissions process, coupled with the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in a more racially diverse environment at the University.  Before the admissions program at issue in this case, in the last year under the post-Hopwood AI/PAI system that did not consider race, the entering class was 4.5% African-American and 16.9% Hispanic.  This is in contrast with the 1996 pre-Hopwood and Top Ten Percent regime, when race was explicitly considered, and the University\xe2\x80\x99s entering freshman class was 4.1% African-American and 14.5% Hispanic.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFollowing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in Grutter v. Bollinger, supra, and Gratz v. Bollinger, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244 (2003)\n, the University adopted a third admissions program, the 2004 program in which the University reverted to explicit consideration of race.  This is the program here at issue.  In Grutter, the Court upheld the use of race as one of many \xe2\x80\x9cplus factors\xe2\x80\x9d in an admissions program that considered the overall individual contribution of each candidate.  In Gratz, by contrast, the Court held unconstitutional Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s undergraduate admissions program, which automatically awarded points to applicants from certain racial minorities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe University\xe2\x80\x99s plan to resume race-conscious admissions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an in-ternal document entitled Proposal to Consider Race and Ethnicity in Admissions (Proposal).  Supp. App. 1a.  The Proposal relied in substantial part on a study of a subset of undergraduate classes containing between 5 and 24 students.  It showed that few of these classes had significant enrollment by members of racial minorities.  In addition the Proposal relied on what it called \xe2\x80\x9canecdotal\xe2\x80\x9d reports from students regarding their \xe2\x80\x9cinteraction in the classroom.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Proposal concluded that the University lacked a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical mass\xe2\x80\x9d of minority students and that to remedy the deficiency it was necessary to give explicit consideration to race in the undergraduate admissions program.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo implement the Proposal the University included a student\xe2\x80\x99s race as a component of the PAI score, begin- ning with applicants in the fall of 2004.  The University asks students to classify themselves from among five predefined racial categories on the application.  Race is not assigned an explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed that race is a meaningful factor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOnce applications have been scored, they are plotted on a grid with the Academic Index on the x-axis and the Personal Achievement Index on the y-axis.  On that grid students are assigned to so-called cells based on their individual scores.  All students in the cells falling above a certain line are admitted.  All students below the line are not.  Each college\xe2\x80\x94such as Liberal Arts or Engineering\xe2\x80\x94admits students separately.  So a student is considered initially for her first-choice college, then for her second choice, and finally for general admission as an undeclared major.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner applied for admission to the University\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 entering class and was rejected.  She sued the University and various University officials in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.  She alleged that the University\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of race in admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The parties cross-moved for summary judgment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the University.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  It held that Grutter required courts to give substantial deference to the University, both in the definition of the compelling interest in diversity\xe2\x80\x99s benefits and in deciding whether its specific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal.  Applying that standard, the court upheld the University\xe2\x80\x99s admissions plan.  631 F.\xc2\xa03d 213, 217\xe2\x80\x93218 (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOver the dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request for rehearing en banc.  See 644 F.\xc2\xa03d 301, 303 (CA5 2011) (per\xc2\xa0curiam).  Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari.

We take those cases as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe begin with the principal opinion authored by Justice Powell in Bakke, supra.  In Bakke, the Court considered a system used by the medical school of the University of California at Davis.  From an entering class of 100 students the school had set aside 16 seats for minority applicants.  In holding this program impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s opinion stated certain basic premises.  First, \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions based on race or ethnic origin by faculties and administrations of state universities are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amend-ment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 287 (separate opinion).

It is therefore irrelevant that a system of racial preferences in admissions may seem benign.  Any racial classification must meet strict scrutiny, for when government decisions \xe2\x80\x9ctouch upon an individual\xe2\x80\x99s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 299.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNext, Justice Powell identified one compelling interest that could justify the consideration of race: the interest in the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.

The diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bakke, 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 315 (separate opinion).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Gratz, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244\n, and Grutter, supra, the Court endorsed the precepts stated by Justice Powell.  In Grutter, the Court reaffirmed his conclusion that obtaining the educational benefits of \xe2\x80\x9cstudent body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 325.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs Gratz and Grutter observed, however, this follows only if a clear precondition is met: The particular admissions process used for this objective is subject to judicial review.  Race may not be considered unless the admissions process can withstand strict scrutiny.  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in Bakke signaled that a university may employ whatever means it desires to achieve the stated goal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by our strict scrutiny analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gratz, supra, at 275.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot use a quota system,\xe2\x80\x9d Grutter, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 334, but instead must \xe2\x80\x9cremain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 337.  Strict scru-tiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that its \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the accomplishment of its purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bakke, 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 305 (opinion of Powell, J.)

Grutter concluded that the decision to pursue \xe2\x80\x9cthe educational benefits that flow from student body diversity,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 330, that the University deems integral to its mission is, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper under Grutter.  A court, of course, should ensure that there is a reasoned, principled explanation for the academic decision.  On this point, the District Court and Court of Appeals were correct in finding that Grutter calls for de-ference to the University\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98based on its experience and expertise,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 631 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 230 (quoting 645 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 587, 603 (WD Tex. 2009)), that a diverse student body would serve its educational goals.  There is disagreement about whether Grutter was consistent with the principles of equal protection in approving this compelling interest in diversity.  See post, at 1 (Scalia, J., concurring); post, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (Thomas, J., concurring); post, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).

The University must prove that the means chosen by the University to attain diversity are narrowly tailored to that goal.  On this point, the University receives no deference.  Grutter made clear that it is for the courts, not for university administrators, to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he means chosen to accomplish the [government\xe2\x80\x99s] asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 333 (internal quotation marks omitted).  True, a court can take account of a university\xe2\x80\x99s experience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain admissions processes.  But, as the Court said in Grutter, it remains at all times the University\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to demonstrate, and the Judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to determine, that admissions processes \xe2\x80\x9censure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 337.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNarrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court verify that it is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d for a university to use race to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.  Bakke, supra, at 305.  This involves a careful judicial inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications.  Although \xe2\x80\x9c[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative,\xe2\x80\x9d strict scrutiny does require a court to examine with care, and not defer to, a university\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Grutter, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 339\xe2\x80\x93340 (emphasis added).  Consideration by the university is of course necessary, but it is not sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny: The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the edu-cational benefits of diversity.  If \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a nonracial approach  .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could promote the substantial interest about as well and at tolerable administrative expense,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Wygant v.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 559, 578\xe2\x80\x93579 (1975)), then the university may not consider race.  A plaintiff, of course, bears the burden of placing the validity of a university\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of an affirmative action plan in issue.  But strict scrutiny imposes on the univer-sity the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRather than perform this searching examination, however, the Court of Appeals held petitioner could challenge only \xe2\x80\x9cwhether [the University\xe2\x80\x99s] decision to reintroduce race as a factor in admissions was made in good faith.\xe2\x80\x9d  631 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 236.  And in considering such a challenge, the court would \xe2\x80\x9cpresume the University acted in good faith\xe2\x80\x9d and place on petitioner the burden of rebutting that presumption.  Id., at 231\xe2\x80\x93232.  The Court of Appeals held that to \xe2\x80\x9csecond-guess the merits\xe2\x80\x9d of this aspect of the University\xe2\x80\x99s decision was a task it was \xe2\x80\x9cill-equipped to perform\xe2\x80\x9d and that it would attempt only to \xe2\x80\x9censure that [the University\xe2\x80\x99s] decision to adopt a race-conscious admissions policy followed from [a process of] good faith consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 231.  The Court of Appeals thus concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe narrow-tailoring inquiry\xe2\x80\x94like the compelling-interest inquiry\xe2\x80\x94is undertaken with a degree of deference to the Universit[y].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 232.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cthe efforts of the University have been studied, serious, and of high purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals held that the use of race in the admissions program fell within \xe2\x80\x9ca constitutionally protected zone of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 231.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese expressions of the controlling standard are at odds with Grutter\xe2\x80\x99s command that \xe2\x80\x9call racial classifications imposed by government \xe2\x80\x98must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 326 (quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

See Adarand, supra, at 237.  Unlike Grutter, which was decided after trial, this case arises from cross-motions for summary judgment.  In this case, as in similar cases, in determining whether summary judgment in favor of the University would be appropriate, the Court of Appeals must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence that would prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.

There, we held that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of [racial discrimination]; racial antagonism never can.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 216.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Aside from Grutter, the Court has recognized only two instances in which a \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ressing public necessity\xe2\x80\x9d may justify racial discrimination by the government.  First, in Korematsu, the Court recognized that protecting national security may satisfy this exacting standard.  In that case, the Court upheld an evacuation order directed at \xe2\x80\x9call persons of Japanese ancestry\xe2\x80\x9d on the grounds that the Nation was at war with Japan and that the order had \xe2\x80\x9ca definite and close relationship to the prevention of espionage and sabotage.\xe2\x80\x9d  323 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 217\xe2\x80\x93218.  Second, the Court has recognized that the government has a compelling interest in remedying past discrimination for which it is responsible, but we have stressed that a government wishing to use race must provide \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action [is] necessary.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Richmond v.

For example, in Palmore v. Sidoti, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 429 (1984)\n, the Court flatly rejected a claim that the best interests of a child justified the government\xe2\x80\x99s racial discrimination.  In that case, a state court awarded custody to a child\xe2\x80\x99s father because the mother was in a mixed-race marriage.  The state court believed the child might be stigmatized by living in a mixed-race household and sought to avoid this perceived problem in its custody determination.  We acknowledged the possibility of stigma but nevertheless concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe reality of private biases and the possible injury they might inflict\xe2\x80\x9d do not justify racial discrimination.  Id., at 433.  As we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them.  Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo years later, in Wygant, supra, the Court held that even asserted interests in remedying societal discrimination and in providing role models for minority students could not justify governmentally imposed racial discrimination.  In that case, a collective-bargaining agreement between a school board and a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s union favored teachers who were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Black, American Indian, Oriental, or of Spanish descendancy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 270\xe2\x80\x93271, and n.\xc2\xa02 (plurality opinion).  We rejected the interest in remedying societal discrimination because it had no logical stopping point.  Id., at 276.  We similarly rebuffed as inadequate the interest in providing role models to minority students and added that the notion that \xe2\x80\x9cblack students are better off with black teachers could lead to the very system the Court rejected in Brown v. Board of Education, \n\n347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483 (1954)\n.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGrutter was a radical departure from our strict-scrutiny precedents.  In Grutter, the University of Michigan Law School (Law School) claimed that it had a compelling reason to discriminate based on race.  The reason it advanced did not concern protecting national security or remedying its own past discrimination.  Instead, the Law School argued that it needed to discriminate in admissions decisions in order to obtain the \xe2\x80\x9ceducational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U. S., at 317.  Contrary to the very meaning of strict scrutiny, the Court deferred to the Law School\xe2\x80\x99s determination that this interest was sufficiently compelling to justify racial discrimination.  Id., at 325.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI dissented from that part of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  I explained that \xe2\x80\x9conly those measures the State must take to provide a bulwark against anarchy, or to prevent violence, will constitute a \xe2\x80\x98pressing public necessity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny.  Id., at 353.  Cf. Lee v. Washington, \n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 333, \n334 (1968)\n (Black, J., concurring) (protecting prisoners from violence might justify narrowly tailored discrimination); J. A.

I adhere to that view today.  As should be obvious, there is nothing \xe2\x80\x9cpressing\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d about obtaining whatever educational benefits may flow from racial diversity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe University claims that the District Court found that it has a compelling interest in attaining \xe2\x80\x9ca diverse stu- dent body and the educational benefits flowing from such diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 18.  The use of the conjunction, \xe2\x80\x9cand,\xe2\x80\x9d implies that the University believes its discrimination furthers two distinct interests.  The first is an interest in attaining diversity for its own sake.  The sec- ond is an interest in attaining educational benefits that allegedly flow from diversity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAttaining diversity for its own sake is a nonstarter.  As even Grutter recognized, the pursuit of diversity as an end is nothing more than impermissible \xe2\x80\x9cracial balancing.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U. S., at 329\xe2\x80\x93330 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Law School\xe2\x80\x99s interest is not simply \xe2\x80\x98to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.\xe2\x80\x99 That would amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, \n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 265, \n307 (1978)\n; citation omitted)); see also id., at 307 (\xe2\x80\x9cPreferring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake.  This the Constitution forbids\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather, diversity can only be the means by which the University obtains educational benefits; it cannot be an end pursued for its own sake.  Therefore, the educational benefits allegedly produced by diversity must rise to the level of a compelling state interest in order for the program to survive strict scrutiny.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnfortunately for the University, the educational benefits flowing from student body diversity\xe2\x80\x94assuming they exist\xe2\x80\x94hardly qualify as a compelling state interest.  Indeed, the argument that educational benefits justify racial discrimination was advanced in support of racial segregation in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s, but emphatically rejected by this Court.  And just as the alleged educational benefits of segregation were insufficient to justify racial discrimination then, see Brown v. Board of Education, \n\n347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483 (1954)\n, the alleged educational benefits of diversity cannot justify racial discrimination today.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur desegregation cases establish that the Constitution prohibits public schools from discriminating based on race, even if discrimination is necessary to the schools\xe2\x80\x99 survival.  In Davis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., decided with Brown, supra, the school board argued that if the Court found segregation unconstitutional, white students would migrate to private schools, funding for public schools would decrease, and public schools would either decline in quality or cease to exist altogether.  Brief for Appellees in Davis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., O.\xc2\xa0T. 1952, No. 191, p.\xc2\xa030 (hereinafter Brief for Appellees in Davis) (\xe2\x80\x9cVirginians .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would no longer permit sizeable appropriations for schools on either the State or local level; private segregated schools would be greatly increased in number and the masses of our people, both white and Negro, would suffer terribly.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [M]any white parents would withdraw their children from the public schools and, as a result, the program of providing better schools would be abandoned\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).

See id., at 31 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]ith the demise of segregation, education in Virginia would receive a serious setback.

See Brown, supra, at 495 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the field of public education the doctrine of \xe2\x80\x98separate but equal\xe2\x80\x99 has no place.

School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., 249 F.\xc2\xa02d 462, 465 (CA4 1957) (per curiam) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that the schools might be closed if the order were enforced is no reason for not enforcing it.  A person may not be denied enforcement of rights to which he is entitled under the Constitution of the United States because of action taken or threatened in defiance of such rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  Within a matter of years, the warning became reality: After being ordered to desegregate, Prince Edward County closed its public schools from the summer of 1959 until the fall of 1964.  See R. Sarratt, The Ordeal of Desegregation 237 (1966).  Despite this fact, the Court never backed down from its rigid enforcement of the Equal Protection Clause\xe2\x80\x99s antidiscrimination principle.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, of course, Texas has not alleged that the University will close if it is prohibited from discriminating based on race.  But even if it had, the foregoing cases make clear that even that consequence would not justify its use of racial discrimination.  It follows, a\xc2\xa0fortiori, that the putative educational benefits of student body diversity cannot justify racial discrimination: If a State does not have a compelling interest in the existence of a university, it certainly cannot have a compelling interest in the supposed benefits that might accrue to that university from racial discrimination.  See Grutter, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 361 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] marginal improvement in legal education cannot justify racial discrimination where the Law School has no compelling interest either in its exis- tence or in its current educational and admissions policies\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the Court were actually applying strict scrutiny, it would require Texas either to close the University or to stop discriminating against applicants based on their race.  The Court has put other schools to that choice, and there is no reason to treat the University differently.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is also noteworthy that, in our desegregation cases, we rejected arguments that are virtually identical to those advanced by the University today.  The University asserts, for instance, that the diversity obtained through its discriminatory admissions program prepares its students to become leaders in a diverse society.  See, e.g., Brief for Respondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity \xe2\x80\x9cprepares students to become the next generation of leaders in an increasingly diverse society\xe2\x80\x9d).  The segregationists likewise defended segregation on the ground that it provided more leadership opportunities for blacks.  See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in Sweatt 96 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] very large group of Northern Negroes [comes] South to attend separate colleges, suggesting that the Negro does not secure as well-rounded a college life at a mixed college, and that the separate college offers him positive advantages; that there is a more normal social life for the Negro in a separate college; that there is a greater opportunity for full participation and for the development of leadership; that the Negro is inwardly more \xe2\x80\x98secure\xe2\x80\x99 at a college of his own people\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Appellees in Davis 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Negro child gets an opportunity to participate in segregated schools that I have never seen accorded to him in non-segregated schools.  He is important, he holds offices, he is accepted by his fellows, he is on athletic teams, he has a full place there\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  This argument was unavailing.  It is irrelevant under the \n \nFourteenth Amendment whether segregated or mixed schools produce better leaders.  Indeed, no court today would accept the suggestion that segregation is permissible because historically black colleges produced Booker T. Washington, Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr., and other prominent leaders.  Likewise, the University\xe2\x80\x99s racial discrimination cannot be justified on the ground that it will produce better leaders.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe University also asserts that student body diversity improves interracial relations.  See, e.g., Brief for Respondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity promotes \xe2\x80\x9ccross-racial understanding\xe2\x80\x9d and breaks down racial and ethnic stereotypes).  In this argument, too, the University repeats arguments once marshaled in support of segregation.  See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Davis 17 (\xe2\x80\x9cVirginia has established segregation in certain fields as a part of her public policy to prevent violence and reduce resentment.  The result, in the view of an overwhelming Virginia majority, has been to improve the relationship between the different races\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 25 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf segregation be stricken down, the general welfare will be definitely harmed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0there would be more friction developed\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Brief for Respondents in Sweatt 93 (\xe2\x80\x9cTexas has had no serious breaches of the peace in recent years in connection with its schools.

We flatly rejected this line of arguments in McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Ed., \n\n339 U.\xc2\xa0S. 637 (1950)\n, where we held that segregation would be unconstitutional even if white students never tolerated blacks.  Id., at 641 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be argued that appellant will be in no better position when these restrictions are removed, for he may still be set apart by his fellow students.

It is, thus, entirely irrelevant whether the University\xe2\x80\x99s racial discrimination increases or decreases tolerance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, while the University admits that racial discrimination in admissions is not ideal, it asserts that it is a temporary necessity because of the enduring race consciousness of our society.  See Brief for Respondents 53\xe2\x80\x9354 (\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly all aspire for a colorblind society in which race does not matter .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

There can be no doubt that the University\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination injures white and Asian applicants who are denied admission because of their race.

Instead, the University\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination has a pervasive shifting effect.  See T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the World 145\xe2\x80\x93146 (2004).  The University admits minorities who otherwise would have attended less selective colleges where they would have been more evenly matched.  But, as a result of the mismatching, many blacks and Hispanics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools are placed in a position where underperformance is all but inevitable because they are less academically prepared than the white and Asian students with whom they must compete.  Setting aside the damage wreaked upon the self-confidence of these overmatched students, there is no evidence that they learn more at the University than they would have learned at other schools for which they were better prepared.  Indeed, they may learn less.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals believed that the University needed to enroll more blacks and Hispanics because they remained \xe2\x80\x9cclustered in certain programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  631 F.\xc2\xa03d 213, 240 (CA5 2011) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]early a quarter of the undergraduate students in [the University\xe2\x80\x99s] College of Social Work are Hispanic, and more than 10% are [black].

And, it taints the accomplishments of all those who are the same race as those admitted as a result of racial discrimination.
