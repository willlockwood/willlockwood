The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter an order remanding the case to the Interstate Commerce Commission for reconsideration by the Commission in light of the District Court\'s determinations (1) that the Commission\'s conclusion that \xc2\xa7 3(1) was violated was not supported by adequate findings and (2) that the Commission\'s conclusion that \xc2\xa7 (5) was violated was based, at least in part, on its prior conclusion that there was a violation of \xc2\xa7 3(1).  <em>See FPC v.
