The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the request for a stay without opinion.  The preliminary injunction prohibits the Secretary from conducting Lease Sale 73, the sale of 137 designated tracts on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing.  As issued, it is effective pending final determination of respondent California\'s claims, the principal of which is its claim that the Secretary did not prepare an adequate "consistency determination" pursuant to \xc2\xa7 307(c)(1) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 1285, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1456(c)(1), as interpreted by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>California v. Watt,</em> 683 F.2d 1253 (1982), <em>cert. granted,</em> 461 U.S. 925 (1983) (argued November 1, 1983).</p>\n<p>Section 307(c)(1) provides:</p>\n<p>"Each Federal agency conducting or supporting activities <em>directly affecting</em> the coastal zone shall conduct or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1305">Page 464 U. S. 1305</a></p><p> support those activities in a manner which is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with approved state management programs."</p>\n<p>16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1456(c)(1) (emphasis added).  In <em>California v. Watt, supra,</em> (now <em>sub nom. Clark v. California</em>), the Court will decide whether the Secretary\'s sale of oil and gas leases is an activity "directly affecting" the coastal zone within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 307(c)(1).  Unless the Court answers that question in the affirmative, there is no statutory requirement at this stage of the project that the Secretary prepare the "consistency determination" which the District Court deemed inadequate and which formed the basis of its decision to issue the injunction in this case.</p>\n<p>Having examined the submissions of the parties, I have decided to stay the preliminary injunction pending this Court\'s resolution of the question presented in <em>Clark v. California,</em> concluding as I do that in the interim the traditional considerations affecting the award of equitable relief favor the applicants.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>* Together with No. A-471, <em>Western Oil &amp; Gas Association et al. v. California et al.,</em> also on application for stay of the same preliminary injunction.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
