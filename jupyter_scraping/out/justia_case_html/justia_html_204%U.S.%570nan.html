C. D. Boynton, defendant in error, hereinafter called the owner, was the owner of certain lots of ground in the Town of Carroll, Carroll County, in the State of Iowa, and was at all times mentioned herein, a citizen of the State of Missouri.  Prior to February 18, 1902, the railroad company, requiring Boynton\'s lots as a right of way for the construction of its railroad, filed an application in the office of the Sheriff of Carroll county, asking </p><p><a class="page-number" name="573">Page 204 U. S. 573</a></p><p> for the appointment of six freeholders to inspect the lots and assess the damages which the owner would sustain by the appropriation of his lots for the use of the railroad company.

In due time, the owner filed in the last-mentioned court a petition for the removal of the cause into the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western Division of the Southern District of Iowa on the ground of diversity in citizenship.  In his petition and bond to secure such removal, the owner referred to and treated himself as the defendant, and referred to and treated the railroad company as the plaintiff, in the case."</p>\n<p>"In due course, the cause came on for hearing in the circuit court, when the parties, by a written stipulation filed with the clerk, waived a jury and agreed to try the case to the court.  Both parties introduced evidence and fully submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the court (if they could do so).  The trial resulted in an assessment of the owner\'s damages at $11,445, and in a judgment against the railroad company for costs, including a fee of $300 for the owner\'s attorneys.  In due time, the railroad company regularly sued out a writ of error to the end that the record and proceedings in the circuit court might be reviewed by this Court.  The assignment of errors which accompanied the petition for the writ of error alleged that the circuit court erred in ascertaining and fixing the amount of damages to be paid by the railroad company for its appropriation of the owner\'s lots, in that there was an entire absence of evidence of support the award and finding.  At no time during the pendency of the proceedings </p><p><a class="page-number" name="574">Page 204 U.

Not until the railroad company filed its brief in this Court was the jurisdiction of the circuit court in any manner challenged.  But in its brief as also in the oral argument made in its behalf, the chief point relied upon by the railroad company to secure a reversal of the finding and judgment of the circuit court is that the owner was the plaintiff in said cause and proceeding, and did not have the right to remove the same into the circuit court, and that therefore that court could not entertain jurisdiction thereof."</p>\n<p>"And the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit further certifies that the following questions of law are presented in this cause, that their decision is indispensable to a decision of the cause, and that to the end that such court may properly decide the issues of law so presented it desires the instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States upon such questions, to-wit:"</p>\n<p>"1.

If the circuit court could not have taken cognizance of the suit through the removal by the landowner, and if the circuit court could have taken cognizance of the suit through its original institution in that court after the assessment by the commissioners, did the parties, by appearing in the circuit court and there litigating to a final conclusion the matter in dispute, without any objection to the jurisdiction of the court or to the manner in which its jurisdiction was invoked, authorize the circuit court to exercise jurisdiction and to proceed to final judgment in like manner and with like effect as if the suit had been originally instituted in that court, the citizenship of the parties and the sum or value of the matter in dispute being such as to make the suit otherwise cognizable in that court?

"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="578">Page 204 U. S. 578</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In <em>Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/196/239/case.html">196 U. S. 239</a></span>, it was decided that proceedings of this character could be removed to the United States circuit court.  The question to be decided now is only whether the removal in this case can be upset on the ground that it was asked by the wrong party.  The railroad company relies upon the words of the Iowa Code, \xc2\xa7 2009, quoted above, and upon a decision of the supreme court of the state in a case like the present, except that the railroad was a foreign company, in which it was held that the railroad had a right to remove.  <em>Myers v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Ry. Co.,</em> 118 Ia. 312, 324.  <em>See</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="579">Page 204 U. S. 579</a></p><p> <em>also Kirby v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Ry. Co.,</em> 106 F. 551.  It is said that this Court is bound by the construction given to the state law by the state court.  Indeed, the above \xc2\xa7 2009 does not need construction; it enacts in terms that the landowner shall be plaintiff.  As the right to remove a suit is given only to the defendants therein, being nonresidents of the state, it is argued that the state decision ends the case.</p>\n<p>But this Court must construe the act of Congress regarding removal.  And it is obvious that the word "defendant" as there used is directed toward more important matters than the burden of proof or the right to open and close.  It is quite conceivable that a state enactment might reverse the names which, for the purposes of removal, this Court might think the proper ones to be applied.  In condemnation proceedings, the words "plaintiff" and "defendant" can be used only in an uncommon and liberal sense.  The plaintiff complains of nothing.  The defendant denies no past or threatened wrong.  Both parties are actors -- one to acquire title, the other to get as large pay as he can.  It is not necessary, in order to decide that the present removal was right, to say that the state decision was wrong.  We leave the latter question where we find it.  But we are of opinion that the removal in this case was right for reasons which it will not take long to state.</p>\n<p>It is said the proceedings only become a case within the meaning of the act of Congress after the preliminary assessment and the appeal, and that then the landowner is in the position of one demanding pay for property which he has lost.  If we take a general view of the Iowa statutes, this conclusion is not correct.  The railroad might have taken the appeal.  If it had, the landowner would have been on the defensive in endeavoring at least to uphold the assessment, but he would have been called the plaintiff nonetheless.  Whichever party appeals, it is not true that the landowner is seeking pay for what he has lost.  By \xc2\xa7 2011, the railroad is free to decline to take the property if it thinks the price too large.  Even if, as in this case, it deposits the amount </p><p><a class="page-number" name="580">Page 204 U. S. 580</a></p><p> first assessed with the sheriff, the latter is not to pay it over until the determination of the appeal.  \xc2\xa7 2010.  We see no reason to suppose that the deposit impairs the railroad\'s right to withdraw, although the Supreme Court of Iowa says, <em>ubi supra,</em> that, by payment and entry, the railroad appropriates the land.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 2013.  Probably, too, the position of the parties under the act of Congress should be determined upon general considerations, without regard to what has happened.  Looked at as a whole, the Iowa statutes provide a process by which railroads and others may acquire land for their purposes which the owner refuses to sell.  The first step is the valuation.  Whether it is part of the case or not, it is a necessary condition to the proceedings in court.  Against the will of the owner, the title to the land is not acquired until the case is decided and the price paid.  The intent of the railroad to get the land is the mainspring of the proceedings from beginning to end, and the persistence of that intent is the condition of their effect.  The state is too considerate of the rights of its citizens to take from them their land in exchange for a mere right of action.  The land is not lost until the owner is paid.  Therefore, in a broad sense, the railroad is the plaintiff, as the institution and continuance of the proceedings depend upon its will.  <em>Hudson River Railroad &amp; Terminal Co. v. Day,</em> 54 F. 545.</p>\n<p>It is not argued that this is any the less a suit because the railroad is free to decline to take the property.  The adjudication fixes the right of the railroad to take the land at the price adjudged, and charges it with costs and attorney\'s fees taxed by the court in case it elects not to take.  The question is not discussed in <em>Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/196/239/case.html">196 U. S. 239</a></span>, where, if there had been anything in it, possibly it might have been raised.  As what we have said is sufficient to dispose of the matter of the certificate, we think it unnecessary to consider other arguments or to answer any question but the first.</p>\n<p><em>The first question is answered "Yes."</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
