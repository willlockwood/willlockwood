The scope of these enactments and the basis on which they were found in conflict with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 364 U. S. 501</a></p><p> the Constitution of the United States are not matters of doubt.  The nub of the decision of the three-judge court is this:</p>\n<p>"The conclusion is clear that interposition is not a <em>constitutional</em> doctrine.  If taken seriously, it is illegal defiance of constitutional authority."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Louisiana,</em> 188 F.Supp. 916, 926.</p>\n<p>The main basis for challenging this ruling is that the State of Louisiana "has interposed itself in the field of public education over which it has exclusive control."  This objection is without substance, as we held, upon full consideration, in <em>Cooper v. Aaron,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/1/case.html">358 U. S. 1</a></span>.  The others are likewise without merit.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the motions for stay are denied.</p>\n<p>* Together with <em>United States v. Louisiana et al.</em> and <em>Williams et al. v. Davis et al.,</em> also on motions for stay.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
