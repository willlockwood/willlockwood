The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit identified the entire smartphone as the only permissible \xe2\x80\x9carticle of manufacture\xe2\x80\x9d for the purpose of calculating \xc2\xa7289 damages because consumers could not separately purchase components of the smartphones.  The question before us is whether that reading is consistent with \xc2\xa7289.  We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The federal patent laws have long permitted those who invent designs for manufactured articles to patent their designs.

The statute in effect at the time allowed a holder of a design patent to recover \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual damages sustained\xe2\x80\x9d from infringement.  Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa74919.  In <i>Dobson</i> v. <i>Hartford Carpet Co.</i>,\n\n114 U.\xc2\xa0S. 439 (1885)\n, the lower courts had awarded the holders of design patents on carpets damages in the amount of \xe2\x80\x9cthe entire profit to the [patent holders], per yard, in the manufacture and sale of carpets of the patented designs, and not merely the value which the designs contributed to the carpets.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 443.  This Court reversed the damages award and construed the statute to require proof that the profits were \xe2\x80\x9cdue to\xe2\x80\x9d the design rather than other aspects of the carpets.  <i>Id.,</i> at 444; see also <i>Dobson</i> v. <i>Dornan</i>,\n\n118 U.\xc2\xa0S. 10,\n17 (1886)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe plaintiff must show what profits or damages are attributable to the use of the infringing design\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1887, in response to the <i>Dobson</i> cases, Congress enacted a specific damages remedy for design patent infringement.

It does so by first prohibiting the unlicensed \xe2\x80\x9cappli[cation]\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cpatented design, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any article of manufacture for the purpose of sale\xe2\x80\x9d or the unlicensed sale or exposure to sale of \xe2\x80\x9cany article of manufacture to which [a patented] design or colorable imitation has been applied.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7289.  It then makes a person who violates that prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cliable to the owner to the extent of his total profit, but not less than $250.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9cTotal,\xe2\x80\x9d of course, means all.  See American Heritage Dictionary 1836 (5th ed. 2011) (\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he whole amount of something; the entirety\xe2\x80\x9d).  The \xe2\x80\x9ctotal profit\xe2\x80\x9d for which \xc2\xa7289 makes an infringer liable is thus all of the profit made from the prohibited conduct, that is, from the manufacture or sale of the \xe2\x80\x9carticle of manufacture to which [the patented] design or colorable imitation has been applied.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Arriving at a damages award under \xc2\xa7289 thus involves two steps.  First, identify the \xe2\x80\x9carticle of manufacture\xe2\x80\x9d to which the infringed design has been applied.  Second, calculate the infringer\xe2\x80\x99s total profit made on that article of manufacture.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case requires us to address a threshold matter: the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9carticle of manufacture.\xe2\x80\x9d  The only question we resolve today is whether, in the case of a multicomponent product, the relevant \xe2\x80\x9carticle of manufacture\xe2\x80\x9d must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product.  Under the former interpretation, a patent holder will always be entitled to the infringer\xe2\x80\x99s total profit from the end product.  Under the latter interpretation, a patent holder will sometimes be entitled to the infringer\xe2\x80\x99s total profit from a component of the end product.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The text resolves this case.

It argued that\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S. C. \xc2\xa7289 contains a causation requirement, which limits a \xc2\xa7289 damages award to the total profit the infringer made <i>because of</i> the infringement.  Samsung abandoned this theory at argument, and so we do not address it.
