The declaration contained an averment in substance that the Comptroller of the Currency having become satisfied, "as specified in the Banking Act," that the bank had refused to pay its notes, did appoint the plaintiff "a receiver as provided by the fiftieth section of the act," and that he had qualified under his appointment and entered upon the performance of his duties.  The defendants demurred to the declaration, and in effect assigned for cause that it was not specifically averred that each and all of the several things had been done which were provided for in sections forty-six and forty-seven, in order to furnish the evidence to satisfy the comptroller that the bank had refused to pay its notes and was in default.  The court below sustained the demurrer and gave judgment for the defendant.  The receiver now brought the case here.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1968225">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Cadle v.

The court below sustained the demurrer and gave judgment for the defendant.  The receiver now brought the case here.</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We think such averments as the defendant alleges to be necessary and the want of which he has assigned for cause of demurrer were not necessary.  The debtors of a bank, when sued by a receiver, cannot inquire into the legality of his appointment.  It is sufficient for the purposes of such a suit that he has been appointed and is receiver in fact.  As to debtors, the action of the Comptroller in making the appointment is conclusive until set aside on the application of the bank.  The bank may move in that behalf, but the debtor cannot.  Section fifty makes express provision for a contest by the bank.</p>\n<p>The court below erred in sustaining the demurrer, and for that reason the judgment is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to overrule the demurrer to the declaration and proceed accordingly.</em></p>\n<p>* Of June 3, 1864, 13 Stat. at Large 113.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
