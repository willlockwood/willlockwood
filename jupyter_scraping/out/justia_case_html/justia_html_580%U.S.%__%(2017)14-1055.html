When petitioners Beverly Ann Hollis-Arrington and her daughter Crystal Lightfoot filed suit in state court alleging deficiencies in the refinancing, foreclosure, and sale of their home, Fannie Mae removed the case to federal court, relying on its sue-and-be-sued clause as the basis for jurisdiction.  The District Court denied a motion to remand the case to state court and later entered judgment against petitioners.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In concluding that the District Court had jurisdiction under Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause, the court relied on <i>American Nat. Red Cross</i> v. <i>S. G.</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247\n, which it read as establishing a rule that when a sue-and-be-sued clause in a federal charter expressly authorizes suit in federal court, it confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause does not grant federal courts jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae.

Describing the earlier decisions as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbest efforts at divining congressional intent retrospectively,\xe2\x80\x9d 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 252, the Court in <i>Red Cross</i> concluded that those decisions \xe2\x80\x9csupport the rule that a congressional charter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98sue and be sued\xe2\x80\x99 provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions the federal courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 255.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">In specifically mentioning the federal courts, Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause resembles the three clauses this Court has held confer jurisdiction.  But unlike those clauses, Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s clause adds the qualification \xe2\x80\x9cany court of competent jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71723a(a).  Thus, the outcome here turns on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adjudicate the case before it, Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 431, and a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction defines its power to hear cases, see <i>Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n.  It follows that a court of competent jurisdiction is a court with a grant of subject-matter jurisdiction covering the case before it.  This Court has understood that phrase as a reference to a court with an existing source of subject-matter jurisdiction.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n118 U.\xc2\xa0S. 610\n.  On this understanding, Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause is most naturally read not to grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae but to permit suit in any state or federal court already endowed with subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"><i>Red Cross</i> does not require a different result.  It did not set out a rule that an express reference to the federal courts suffices to make a sue-and-be-sued clause a grant of federal jurisdiction.  Rather, it restated \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic rule\xe2\x80\x9d of <i>Deveaux</i> and <i>Osborn</i> that a sue-and-be-sued clause conferring only a general right to sue does not grant jurisdiction to the federal courts.  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s arguments against reading its sue-and-be-sued clause as merely capacity conferring are unpersuasive.  Its alternative readings of \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d are premised on the already rejected reading of <i>Red Cross.</i>  The prior construction canon of statutory interpretation does not apply because none of the cases on which Fannie Mae relies suggest that Congress in 1954 would have surveyed the jurisprudential landscape and necessarily concluded that the courts had already settled the question whether a sue-and-be-sued clause containing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.  Finally, Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s appeals to congressional purpose do not call into question the plain text reading of its sue-and-be-sued clause.

We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">During the Great Depression, the Federal Government worked to stabilize and strengthen the residential mortgage market.  Among other things, it took steps to increase liquidity (reasonably available funding) in the mortgage market.  These efforts included the creation of the Federal Home Loan Banks, which provide credit to member institutions to finance affordable housing and economic development projects, and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which insures residential mort-gages.  See Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Back-ground and History of the Federal National Mortgage Association 1\xe2\x80\x937, A4 (1966).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Also as part of these efforts, Title III of the National Housing Act (1934 Act) authorized the Administrator of the newly created FHA to establish \xe2\x80\x9cnational mortgage associations\xe2\x80\x9d that could \xe2\x80\x9cpurchase and sell [certain] first mortgages and such other first liens\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cborrow money for such purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7301(a),\n\n48Stat.\n1252\xe2\x80\x931253.  The associations were endowed with certain powers, including the power to \xe2\x80\x9csue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7301(c), <i>id.</i>, at 1253.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1938, the FHA Administrator exercised that author-ity and chartered the Federal National Mortgage Association.  Avoiding a mouthful of an acronym (FNMA), it went by Fannie Mae.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Washington Post, July 14, 1940, p. P2 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Fanny May\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Mar. 23, 1950, p. 48 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  As originally chartered, Fannie Mae was wholly owned by the Federal Government and had three objectives: to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish a market for [FHA-insured] first mortgages\xe2\x80\x9d covering new housing construction, to \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate the construction and financing of economically sound rental housing projects,\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cmake [the bonds it issued] available to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. investors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Nat. Mortgage Assn. Information Regarding the Activities of the Assn. 1 (Circular No. 1, 1938).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fannie Mae was rechartered in 1954.  Housing Act of 1954 (1954 Act), \xc2\xa7201,\n\n68Stat.\n613.  No longer wholly Government owned, Fannie Mae had mixed ownership: Private shareholders held its common stock and the Department of the Treasury held its preferred stock.  The 1954 Act required the Secretary of the Treasury to allow Fannie Mae to repurchase that stock.  See <i>id.</i>, at 613\xe2\x80\x93615.  It expected that Fannie Mae would repurchase all of its preferred stock and that legislation would then be enacted to turn Fannie Mae over to the private stockholders.  From then on, Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s duties would \xe2\x80\x9cbe carried out by a privately owned and privately financed corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 615.  Along with these structural changes, the 1954 Act replaced Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s initial set of powers with a more detailed list.  In doing so, it revised the sue-and-be-sued clause to give Fannie Mae the power \xe2\x80\x9cto sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 620.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1968, Fannie Mae became fully privately owned and relinquished part of its portfolio to its new spinoff, the Government National Mortgage Association (known as Ginnie Mae).  See Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (1968 Act),\n\n82Stat.\n536.  Fannie Mae \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue[d] to operate the secondary market operations\xe2\x80\x9d but became \xe2\x80\x9ca Government-sponsored private corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71716b.

See \xc2\xa71723(a); see also 1968 Act, \xc2\xa7802(z),\n\n82Stat.\n540 (minor revisions to \xc2\xa71723a(a)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This general structure remains in place.  Fannie Mae continues to participate in the secondary mortgage market.  It purchases mortgages that meet its eligibility criteria, packages them into mortgage-backed securities, and sells those securities to investors, and it invests in mortgage-backed securities itself.  One of those mortgage purchases led to Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s entanglement in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Beverly Ann Hollis-Arrington refinanced her mortgage with Cendant Mortgage Corporation (Cendant) in the summer of 1999.  Fannie Mae then bought the mortgage, while Cendant continued to service it.  Unable to make her payments, Hollis-Arrington pursued a forbearance arrangement with Cendant.  No agreement materialized, and the home entered foreclosure.  Around this time, Cendant repurchased the mortgage from Fannie Mae because it did not meet Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s credit standards.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To stave off the foreclosure, Hollis-Arrington and her daughter, Crystal Lightfoot, pursued bankruptcy and transferred the property between themselves.  These ef-forts failed, and the home was sold at a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s sale in 2001.  The two then took to the courts to try to undo the foreclosure and sale.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After two unsuccessful federal suits, the pair filed this suit in state court.  They alleged that deficiencies in the refinancing, foreclosure, and sale of their home entitled them to relief against Fannie Mae.  Their claims against other defendants are not relevant here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fannie Mae removed the case to federal court under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441(a), which permits a defendant to remove from state to federal court \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action\xe2\x80\x9d over which the federal district courts \xe2\x80\x9chave original jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  It relied on its sue-and-be-sued clause as the basis for jurisdiction.  The District Court denied a motion to remand the case to state court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court then dismissed the claims against Fannie Mae on claim preclusion grounds.  After a series of motions, rulings, and appeals not related to the issue here, the District Court entered final judgment.  Hollis-Arrington and Lightfoot immediately moved to set aside the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), alleging \xe2\x80\x9cfraud upon the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 95\xe2\x80\x93110.  The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the case and the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.  465 Fed. Appx. 668 (2012).  After Hollis-Arrington and Lightfoot sought rehearing, the Ninth Circuit withdrew its opinion and ordered briefing on the question whether the District Court had jurisdiction over the case under Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause.  769 F.\xc2\xa03d 681, 682\xe2\x80\x93683 (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A divided panel affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  The majority relied on <i>American Nat. Red Cross</i> v. <i>S. G.</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247 (1992)\n.  It read that decision to have established a \xe2\x80\x9crule [that] resolves this case\xe2\x80\x9d: When a sue-and-be-sued clause in a federal charter expressly authorizes suit in federal courts, it confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.  769 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 684.  The dissent instead read <i>Red Cross</i> as setting out only a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98default rule\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that provides a \xe2\x80\x9cstarting point for [the] analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  769 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 692 (opinion of Stein, J.).  It read \xe2\x80\x9cany court of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause to overcome that default rule by requiring an independent source for jurisdiction in cases involving Fannie Mae.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two Circuits have likewise concluded that the language in Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause grants jurisdiction to federal courts.  See <i>Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston </i>v. <i>Moody\xe2\x80\x99s Corp.</i>, 821 F.\xc2\xa03d 102 (CA1 2016) (Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s identical sue-and-be-sued clause); <i>Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. Retiree Medical Benefits Trust ex rel. Fed. Nat. Mortgage Assn. </i>v. <i>Raines</i>, 534 F.\xc2\xa03d 779 (CADC 2008) (Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause).  Four Circuits have disagreed, finding that similar language did not grant jurisdiction.  See <i>Western Securities Co.</i> v. <i>Derwinski</i>, 937 F.\xc2\xa02d 1276 (CA7 1991) (Under\n\n38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71820(a)(1) (1988 ed.), Secretary of Veterans Affairs\xe2\x80\x99 authority to \xe2\x80\x9csue and be sued .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>C.

As in other federal corporate charters, this language serves the uncontroversial function of clarifying Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to bring suit and to be sued.  See <i>Bank of United States</i> v. <i>Deveaux</i>, 5 Cranch 61, 85\xe2\x80\x9386 (1809).  The question here is whether Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause goes further and grants federal courts jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In answering this question, \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not face a clean slate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Red Cross</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 252.  This Court has addressed the jurisdictional reach of sue-and-be-sued clauses in five federal charters.  Three clauses were held to grant jurisdiction, while two were found wanting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first discussion of sue-and-be-sued clauses came in a pair of opinions by Chief Justice Marshall.  The charter of the first Bank of the United States allowed it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Deveaux</i>, 5 Cranch, at 85.  Another provision allowed suits in federal court against certain bank officials, suggesting \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to sue does not imply a right to sue in the courts of the union, unless it be expressed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 86.  In light of this language, the Court held that the first Bank of the United States had \xe2\x80\x9cno right .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to sue in the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Court con-cluded that the second Bank of the United States was not similarly disabled.  Its charter allowed it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in all State Courts having competent jurisdiction, and in any Circuit Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Osborn</i> v. <i>Bank of United States,</i> 9 Wheat. 738, 817 (1824).  The Court took from <i>Deveaux</i> \xe2\x80\x9cthat a general capacity in the Bank to sue, without mentioning the Courts of the Union, may not give a right to sue in those Courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 Wheat<i>.,</i> at 818.  By contrast, the second Bank\xe2\x80\x99s charter did grant jurisdiction to the federal circuit courts because it used \xe2\x80\x9cwords expressly conferring a right to sue in those Courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A mortgage dispute between a railroad and its creditor led to the next consideration of this issue.  The Texas and Pacific Railway Company\xe2\x80\x99s federal charter authorized it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, defend and be defended, in all courts of law and equity within the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bankers Trust Co.</i> v. <i>Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co.</i>,\n\n241 U.\xc2\xa0S. 295,\n302 (1916)\n.  This Court held that the clause had \xe2\x80\x9cthe same generality and natural import as\xe2\x80\x9d the clause in <i>Deveaux</i>.  241 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 304.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9call that was intended was to render this corporation capable of suing and being sued by its corporate name in any court .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whose jurisdiction as otherwise competently defined was adequate to the occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 303.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Another lending dispute, involving defaulted bonds, led to the next statement on this issue.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s (FDIC) sue-and-be-sued clause authorized it \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7264(j) (1940 ed.).

See <i>Red Cross</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 254 (expressing no \xe2\x80\x9cdoubt that the Court held federal jurisdiction to rest on the\xe2\x80\x9d sue-and-be-sued clause).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s most recent discussion of a sue-and-be-sued clause came in <i>Red Cross</i>, which involved a state-law tort suit related to a contaminated blood transfusion.  It described the previous quartet of decisions as<i> </i>reflecting this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbest efforts at divining congressional intent retrospectively,\xe2\x80\x9d efforts that had put \xe2\x80\x9cCongress on prospective notice of the language necessary and sufficient to confer jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 252.  Those decisions<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9csupport the rule that a congressional charter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98sue and be sued\xe2\x80\x99 provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 255.  Under that rule, the Court explained, the result was \xe2\x80\x9cclear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 257.  The Red Cross\xe2\x80\x99 sue-and-be-sued clause, which permits it to \xe2\x80\x9csue and be sued in courts of law and equity, State or Federal, within the jurisdiction of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n36 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300105(a)(5), confers jurisdiction.  <i>Red Cross</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 257.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn expressly authorizing [suits] in federal courts, using language .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in all relevant respects identical to [the clause in <i>D\xe2\x80\x99Oench</i>] on which [the Court] based a holding of federal jurisdiction just five years before [its enactment], the provision extends beyond a mere grant of general corporate capacity to sue, and suffices to confer federal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Armed with these earlier cases, as synthesized by <i>Red Cross</i>, we turn to the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause resembles the clauses this Court has held confer jurisdiction in one important respect.  In authorizing Fannie Mae \xe2\x80\x9cto sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71723a(a), it \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically mentions the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Red Cross,</i> 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 255.  This mention of the federal courts means that Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s charter clears a hurdle that the clauses in <i>Deveaux </i>and <i>Bankers Trust</i> did not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s clause differs in a material respect from the three clauses the Court has held sufficient to grant federal jurisdiction.  Those clauses referred to suits in the federal courts without qualification.  In contrast, Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause refers to \xe2\x80\x9cany <i>court of competent jurisdiction</i>, State or Federal.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71723a(a) (emphasis added).  Because this sue-and-be-sued clause is not \xe2\x80\x9cin all relevant respects identical\xe2\x80\x9d to a clause already held to grant federal jurisdiction, <i>Red Cross</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 257, this case cannot be resolved by a simple comparison.  The outcome instead turns on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adjudicate the case before it.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 431 (10th ed. 2014) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a] court that has the power and authority to do a particular act; one recognized by law as possessing the right to adjudicate a contro-versy\xe2\x80\x9d).  And a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction defines its power to hear cases.  See <i>Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83,\n89 (1998)\n (Subject-matter jurisdiction is \xe2\x80\x9cthe courts\xe2\x80\x99 statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)); <i>Wachovia Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>Schmidt</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 303,\n316 (2006)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cSubject-matter jurisdiction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. concerns a court\xe2\x80\x99s competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases\xe2\x80\x9d).  It follows that a court of competent jurisdiction is a court with a grant of subject-matter jurisdiction covering the case before it.  Cf. <i>Pennoyer</i> v. <i>Neff</i>,\n\n95 U.\xc2\xa0S. 714,\n733 (1878)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here must be a tribunal competent by its constitution\xe2\x80\x94that is, by the law of its creation\xe2\x80\x94to pass upon the subject-matter of the suit\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a result, this Court has understood the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d as a reference to a court with an existing source of subject-matter jurisdiction.<i> Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n118 U.\xc2\xa0S. 610 (1886)\n, provides an example.  There, the Court explained that a statute \xe2\x80\x9cproviding for the transfer to a trustee of the interest of the owner in the vessel and freight, provides only that the trustee may \xe2\x80\x98be appointed by any court of competent jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x99 leaving the question of such competency to depend on other provisions of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 617.  See also <i>Shoshone Mining Co.</i> v. <i>Rutter</i>,\n\n177 U.\xc2\xa0S. 505\n\xe2\x80\x93507 (1900) (statute authorizing suit \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in a court of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unquestionably meant that the competency of the court should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Califano</i> v. <i>Sanders</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 99 (1977)\n, provides another.  It held that \xc2\xa710 of the Administrative Procedure Act, codified in 5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7701\xe2\x80\x93704, did not contain \xe2\x80\x9can implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction to review agency actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 105.  In noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual text .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. nowhere contains an explicit grant of jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court pointed to two clauses requiring \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to proceed \xe2\x80\x98in a court specified by statute\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98in a court of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and stated that both \xe2\x80\x9cseem to look to outside sources of jurisdictional authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 105\xe2\x80\x93106, and n.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On this understanding, Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause is most naturally read not to grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae.  In authorizing Fannie Mae to sue and be sued \xe2\x80\x9cin any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal,\xe2\x80\x9d it permits suit in any state or federal court already endowed with subject-matter jurisdiction over the suit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Red Cross</i> does not require a different result.  Some, including the lower courts here, have understood it to set out a rule that an express reference to the federal courts suffices to make a sue-and-be-sued clause a grant of fed-eral jurisdiction.  <i>Red Cross </i>contains no such rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By its own terms, the rule <i>Red Cross</i> restates is \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic rule\xe2\x80\x9d drawn in<i> Deveaux</i> and <i>Osborn</i> that a sue-and-be-sued clause conferring only a general right to sue does not grant jurisdiction to the federal courts.  <i>Red Cross</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253.  Each mention of a \xe2\x80\x9crule\xe2\x80\x9d refers back to this principle.  See <i>id.,</i> at 255 (reading this Court\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause cases to \xe2\x80\x9csupport the rule that a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98sue and be sued\xe2\x80\x99 provision <i>may</i> be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions the federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <i>id.,</i> at 256 (<i>Bankers Trust</i> applied \xe2\x80\x9cthe rule thus established\xe2\x80\x9d to hold that the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause did not confer jurisdiction); 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 257 (finding the result \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d under the \xe2\x80\x9crule established in these cases\xe2\x80\x9d because the charter \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly authoriz[es]\xe2\x80\x9d suits in federal courts in a clause \xe2\x80\x9cin all relevant respects identical\xe2\x80\x9d to one already found to confer jurisdiction).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">True enough, the dissent thought <i>Red Cross</i> established a broad rule.  See 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 271\xe2\x80\x93272 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (describing <i>Red Cross</i> as announcing a \xe2\x80\x9crule .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that any grant of a general capacity to sue with mention of federal courts will suffice to confer jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).  The certainty of the dissent may explain the lower court decisions adopting a broader reading of <i>Red Cross</i>.  But <i>Red Cross</i> itself establishes no such rule.  And such a rule is hard to square with the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s thorough consideration of the contrary arguments based in text, purpose, and legislative history.  See <i>id.,</i> at 258\xe2\x80\x93263.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nothing in <i>Red Cross</i> suggests that courts should ignore \xe2\x80\x9cthe ordinary sense of the language used,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 263, when confronted with a federal charter\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause that expressly references the federal courts, but only those that are courts \xe2\x80\x9cof competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Fannie Mae, preferring to be in federal court, raises several arguments against reading its sue-and-be-sued clause as merely capacity conferring.  None are persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Fannie Mae first offers several alternative readings of \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  It suggests that the phrase might refer to a court with personal jurisdiction over the parties before it, a court of proper venue, or a court of general, rather than specialized, jurisdiction.  Brief for Respondents 41\xe2\x80\x9345.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At bottom, Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s efforts on this front are premised on the reading of <i>Red Cross</i> rejected above.  In its view, an express reference to the federal courts suffices to confer subject-matter jurisdiction on federal courts.  It sees its only remaining task as explaining why that would not render \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  But the fact that a sue-and-be-sued clause references the federal courts does not resolve the jurisdictional question.  Thus, arguments as to why the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d could still have meaning if it does not carry its ordinary meaning are beside the point.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, even if the phrase carries additional meaning, that would not further Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  Take its suggestion that a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d is a court with personal jurisdiction.  A court must have the power to decide the claim before it (subject-matter jurisdiction) and power over the parties before it (personal jurisdiction) before it can resolve a case.  See <i>Ruhrgas AG</i> v. <i>Marathon Oil Co.</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 574\n\xe2\x80\x93585 (1999).  Recognizing as much, this Court has stated that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cusually used to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction, has also been used on occasion to refer to a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s person.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morton</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 822,\n828 (1984)\n (footnote omitted).  See also <i>Blackmar</i> v. <i>Guerre</i>,\n\n342 U.\xc2\xa0S. 512,\n516 (1952)\n.  But nothing in Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause suggests that the reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to a court with personal jurisdiction over the parties before it.  At most then, this point might support reading the phrase to refer to both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction.  That does not help Fannie Mae.  So long as the sue-and-be-sued clause refers to an outside source of subject-matter jurisdiction, it does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Fannie Mae next claims that, by the time its sue-and-be-sued clause was enacted in 1954, courts had interpreted provisions containing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to grant jurisdiction and that Congress was entitled to rely on those interpretations.  This argument invokes the prior construction canon of statutory interpretation.  The canon teaches that if courts have settled the meaning of an existing provision, the enactment of a new provision that mirrors the existing statutory text indicates, as a general matter, that the new provision has that same meaning.  See <i>Bragdon</i> v. <i>Abbott</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624,\n645 (1998)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fannie Mae points to cases discussing three types of statutory provisions that, in its view, show that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d had acquired a settled meaning by 1954.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first pair addresses the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause.  See\n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71702 (\xe2\x80\x9csue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal\xe2\x80\x9d).  Two Court of Appeals decisions in the 1940\xe2\x80\x99s concluded that the FHA sue-and-be-sued clause overrode the general rule, today found in 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71346(a)(2), 1491, that monetary claims against the United States exceeding $10,000 must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims, rather than the federal district courts.  See <i>Ferguson</i> v. <i>Union Nat. Bank of Clarksburg</i>, 126 F.\xc2\xa02d 753, 755\xe2\x80\x93757 (CA4 1942); <i>George H. Evans &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 169 F.\xc2\xa02d 500, 502 (CA3 1948).  These courts did not state that their jurisdiction was founded on the sue-and-be-sued clause, as opposed to statutes governing the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa741(a) (1946 ed.).  Thus, even assuming that two appellate court cases can \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98settle\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d an issue, A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law 325 (2012), these two cases did not because they did not speak to the question here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second set of cases addresses provisions authorizing suit for a violation of a statute.  One arose under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which authorizes employees to sue for violations of the Act in \xe2\x80\x9cany .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. court of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76(d)(1),\n\n88Stat.\n61,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7216(b).  This Court, in its description of the facts, stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[j]urisdiction of the action was conferred by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa741(8), and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7216(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Jacksonville Terminal Co.</i>,\n\n315 U.\xc2\xa0S. 386,\n390 (1942)\n.  This brief, ambiguous statement did not settle the meaning of \xc2\xa7216(b), and thus did not settle the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  The other cases in this set dealt with the Housing and Rent Act of 1947.  As enacted, the statute permitted suit in \xe2\x80\x9cany Federal, State, or Territorial court of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7206(b),\n\n61Stat.\n199.  Some courts read \xc2\xa7206 not to confer jurisdiction and instead assessed their jurisdiction under the federal-question jurisdiction statute.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Schuman</i> v. <i>Greenberg</i>, 100 F. Supp. 187, 189 (NJ 1951) (collecting cases).  At the time, that statute carried an amount-in-controversy requirement,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa741(1) (1946 ed.), and so some cases were dismissed or remanded to state court for lack of federal jurisdiction.  Congress later amended \xc2\xa7206 to permit suit \xe2\x80\x9cin any Federal court of competent jurisdiction regardless of the amount involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  Defense Production Act Amendments of 1951, \xc2\xa7204,\n\n65Stat.\n147.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 elimination of the amount-in-controversy requirement suggests, if anything, it understood that \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d could be read to require an outside source of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The third set of cases interpreted provisions making federal jurisdiction over certain causes of action exclusive.  Brief for Respondents 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  Those cases confirm that the provisions require suit to be brought in federal courts but do not discuss the basis for federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, none of the cases on which Fannie Mae relies suggest that Congress in 1954 would have surveyed the jurisprudential landscape and necessarily concluded that the courts had already settled the question whether a sue-and-be-sued clause containing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Fannie Mae ends with an appeal to congressional purpose, or, more accurately, a lack of congressional purpose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It argues that its original sue-and-be-sued clause, enacted in 1934, granted jurisdiction to federal courts and that there is no indication that Congress wanted to change the status quo in 1954.  The addition in 1954 of \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of competent jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d a phrase that, as discussed, carries a clear meaning, means that the current sue-and-be-sued clause does not confer jurisdiction.  An indication whether that meaning was understood as a change from the 1934 Act is not required.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fannie Mae next points to its sibling rival, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac.  The two share parallel authority to compete in the secondary mortgage market.  Compare 12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71717(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(6) (Fannie Mae) with \xc2\xa71454(a) (Freddie Mac).  Suits involving Freddie Mac may be brought in federal court.  See \xc2\xa71452(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cto sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any State, Federal, or other court\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71452(f) (providing that Freddie Mac is a federal agency under 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71345, 1442, that civil actions to which Freddie Mac is a party arise under federal law, and that Freddie Mac may remove cases to federal district court before trial).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fannie Mae argues there is no good reason to think that Congress gave Freddie Mac fuller access to the federal courts than it has.  Leaving aside the clear textual indications suggesting Congress did just that, a plausible reason does exist.  In 1970, when Freddie Mac\xe2\x80\x99s sue-and-be-sued clause and related jurisdictional provisions were enacted, Freddie Mac was a Government-owned corporation.  See Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970, \xc2\xa7304(a),\n\n84Stat.\n454.  Fannie Mae, on the other hand, had already transitioned into a privately owned corporation.  Fannie Mae\xe2\x80\x99s argument on this front, moreover, contains a deeper flaw.  The doors to federal court remain open to Fannie Mae through diversity and federal-question jurisdiction.  Fannie Mae provides no reason to think that in other cases, involving only state-law claims, access to the federal courts gives Freddie Mac an unintended competitive advantage over Fannie Mae that Congress would have wanted to avoid.  Indeed, the usual assumption is that state courts are up to the task of adjudicating their own laws.
