The NSPS provisions define \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d of such a source as a physical change to it, or a change in the method of its operation, that increases the amount of a pollutant discharged or emits a new one.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77411(a)(4).  The PSD provisions require a permit before a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9d can be \xe2\x80\x9cconstructed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77475(a), and define such \xe2\x80\x9cconstruction\xe2\x80\x9d to include a \xe2\x80\x9cmodification (as defined in [NSPS]),\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77479(2)(C).  Despite this definitional identity, the Environmental Protection Agency\xe2\x80\x99s (EPA) regulations interpret \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d one way for NSPS but differently for PSD.  The NSPS regulations require a source to use the best available pollution-limiting technology, see <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 846, when a modification would increase the discharge of pollutants measured in kilograms per hour, 40 CFR \xc2\xa760.14(a), but the 1980 PSD regulations require a permit for a modification only when it is a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor\xe2\x80\x9d one, \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(i), and only when it would increase the actual annual emission of a pollutant above the actual average for the two prior years, \xc2\xa751.166(b)(21)(ii).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After respondent Duke Energy Corporation replaced or redesigned the workings of some of its coal-fired electric generating units, the United States filed this enforcement action, claiming, among other things<em>,</em> that Duke violated the PSD provisions by doing the work without permits.  Petitioner environmental groups intervened as plaintiffs and filed a complaint charging similar violations.  Duke moved for summary judgment, asserting, <em>inter alia</em>, that none of its projects was a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modification\xe2\x80\x9d requiring a PSD permit because none increased hourly emissions rates.  Agreeing, the District Court entered summary judgment for Duke on all PSD claims.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to create identical statutory definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s NSPS and PSD provisions affirmatively mandated that this term be interpreted identically in the regulations promulgated under those provisions.  When the court <em>sU. S.onte </em>requested supplemental briefing on the relevance of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Rowan Cos.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/247/index.html">452 U. S. 247</a>, 250, that the Government could not adopt different interpretations of the word \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d in different statutory provisions, plaintiffs injected a new issue into the case, arguing that a claim that the 1980 PSD regulation exceeded statutory authority would be an attack on the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s validity that could not be raised in an enforcement proceeding, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(b)(2), since judicial review for validity can be obtained only by a petition to the District of Columbia Circuit, generally within 60 days of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s rulemaking, \xc2\xa77607(b)(1).  The Fourth Circuit rejected this argument, ruling that its interpretation did not invalidate the PSD regulations because they can be interpreted to require an increase in the hourly emissions rate as an element of a major \xe2\x80\x9cmodification.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the PSD regulations in an effort to conform them with their NSPS counterparts on \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d amounted to the invalidation of the PSD regulations, which must comport with the Clean Air Act\xe2\x80\x99s limits on judicial review of EPA regulations for validity.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Principles of statutory interpretation do not rigidly mandate identical regulation here.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost words have different shades of meaning and consequently may be variously construed, [even] when [they are] used more than once in the same statute or \xe2\x80\xa6 section,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning \xe2\x80\xa6 is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/427/index.html">286 U. S. 427</a>, 433<em>.</em>  A given term in the same statute may take on distinct characters from association with distinct statutory objects calling for different ways of implementation.  The point is the same even when the terms share a common statutory definition, if it is general enough.  See <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a>, 343\xe2\x80\x93344.  <em>Robinson </em>is not inconsistent with <em>Rowan, </em>where the Court\xe2\x80\x99s invalidation of the differing interpretations of \xe2\x80\x9cwages,\xe2\x80\x9d 452 U. S., at 252, turned not on the fact that a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially identical\xe2\x80\x9d definition of that word appeared in each of the statutory provisions at issue, but on the failure of the regulations in question to serve Congress\xe2\x80\x99s manifest \xe2\x80\x9cconcern for the interest of simplicity and ease of administration,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 255.  In fact, in a case close to <em>Rowan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s facts, the Court recently declined to follow a categorical rule of resolving ambiguities in identical statutory terms identically regardless of their surroundings, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/200/index.html">532 U. S. 200</a>, 213, but instead accorded \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial judicial deference\xe2\x80\x9d to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clongstanding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d and differing interpretations of the statutory term at issue, <em>id.,</em> at 218\xe2\x80\x93220.  It makes no difference here that the Clean Air Act does not merely repeat the same definition in its NSPS and PSD provisions, but that the PSD provisions refer back to the section defining \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d for NSPS purposes.  Nothing in the text or legislative history of the statutory amendment that added the NSPS cross-reference suggests that Congress meant to eliminate customary agency discretion to resolve questions about a statutory definition by looking to the surroundings in which the defined term appears.  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s construction need do no more than fall within the outer limits of what is reasonable, as set by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s common definition.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the 1980 PSD regulations to conform them to their NSPS counterparts was not a permissible reading of their terms.  The PSD regulations clearly do not define a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modification\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of an increase in the \xe2\x80\x9chourly emissions rate.\xe2\x80\x9d On its face, the definitional section specifies no rate at all, hourly or annual, merely requiring a \xe2\x80\x9cphysical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result in a significant net emissions increase of any\xe2\x80\x9d regulated pollutant.  40 CFR \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(i).  But even when the regulations mention a rate, it is annual, not hourly.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa751.166(b)(23)(i).  Further at odds with the idea that hourly rate is relevant is the mandate that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctual emissions shall be calculated using the unit\xe2\x80\x99s actual operating hours,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa751.166(b)(21)(ii)<em>,</em> since \xe2\x80\x9cactual emissions\xe2\x80\x9d must be measured in a manner looking to the number of hours the unit is or probably will be actually running.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for its different view are no match for these textual differences.  Consequently, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the 1980 PSD regulations must be seen as an implicit invalidation of those regulations, a form of judicial review implicating the provisions of \xc2\xa77607(b), which limit challenges to the validity of a regulation during enforcement proceedings when such review \xe2\x80\x9ccould have been obtained\xe2\x80\x9d in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia within 60 days of EPA rulemaking.  Because the Court of Appeals did not believe that its analysis reached validity, it did not consider the applicability or effect of that limitation here.  The Court has no occasion itself at this point to consider the significance of \xc2\xa77607(b).

The NSPS provisions define the term \xe2\x80\x9cmodification,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77411(a)(4), while the PSD provisions use that word \xe2\x80\x9cas defined in\xe2\x80\x9d NSPS, \xc2\xa77479(2)(C).  The Court of Appeals concluded that the statute requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conform its PSD regulations on \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d to their NSPS counterparts, and that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1980 PSD regulations can be given this conforming construction.  We hold that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the 1980 PSD regulations, intended to align them with NSPS, was inconsistent with their terms and effectively invalidated them; any such result must be shown to comport with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on judicial review of EPA regulations for validity.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1676, broadened federal authority to combat air pollution, see <em>Chevron U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77409, 7410.  The amendments dealing with NSPS authorized EPA to require operators of stationary sources of air pollutants to use the best technology for limiting pollution, <em>Chevron</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 846; see also 1 F. Grad, Environmental Law \xc2\xa72.03, p.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x93356 (2006), both in newly constructed sources and those undergoing \xe2\x80\x9cmodification,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77411(a)(2).  Section 111(a) of the 1970 amendments defined this term within the NSPS scheme as \xe2\x80\x9cany physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77411(a)(4).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1975 regulations implementing NSPS provided generally that \xe2\x80\x9cany physical or operational change to an existing facility which results in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere of any pollutant to which a standard applies shall be considered a modification within the meaning of [S]ection 111.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa760.14(a) (1976).  Especially significant here is the identification of an NSPS \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d as a change that \xe2\x80\x9cincrease[s] \xe2\x80\xa6 the emission rate,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cshall be expressed as kg/hr of any pollutant discharged into the atmosphere.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa760.14(b).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0NSPS, however, did too little to \xe2\x80\x9cachiev[e] the ambitious goals of the 1970 Amendments,\xe2\x80\x9d R. Belden, Clean Air Act 7 (2001) (hereinafter Belden), and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, 91 Stat. 685, included the PSD provisions, which aimed at giving added protection to air quality in certain parts of the country \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding attainment and maintenance of\xe2\x80\x9d the NAAQS.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77470(1).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The 1977 amendments required a PSD permit before a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor emitting facility\xe2\x80\x9d could be \xe2\x80\x9cconstructed\xe2\x80\x9d in an area covered by the scheme.  \xc2\xa77475(a).  As originally enacted, PSD applied only to newly constructed sources, but soon a technical amendment added the following subparagraph: \xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98construction\xe2\x80\x99 when used in connection with any source or facility, includes the modification (as defined in [S]ection 111(a)) of any source or facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714(a)(54), 91 Stat. 1402, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77479(2)(C); see also <em>New York</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 413 F.\xc2\xa03d 3, 13 (CADC 2005).  In other words, the \xe2\x80\x9cconstruction\xe2\x80\x9d requiring a PSD permit under the statute was made to include (though it was not limited to)\na \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in the statutory NSPS\nprovisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1980, EPA issued PSD regulations,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] which \xe2\x80\x9climited the application of [PSD] review\xe2\x80\x9d of modified sources to instances of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98major\xe2\x80\x99 modificatio[n],\xe2\x80\x9d Belden  46, defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(i) (1987).  Further regulations in turn addressed various elements of this definition, three of which are to the point here.  First, the regulations specified that an operational change consisting merely of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate\xe2\x80\x9d would not generally constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cphysical change or change in the method of operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(iii)(<em>f\xc2\xa0</em>).  For purposes of a PSD permit, that is, such an operational change would not amount to a \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d as the Act defines it.  Second, the PSD regulations defined a \xe2\x80\x9cnet emissions increase\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny increase in actual emissions from a particular physical change or change in the method of operation,\xe2\x80\x9d net of other contemporaneous \xe2\x80\x9cincreases and decreases in actual emissions at the source.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa751.166(b)(3).  \xe2\x80\x9cActual emissions\xe2\x80\x9d were defined to \xe2\x80\x9cequal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a two-year period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa751.166(b)(21)(ii).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ctual emissions\xe2\x80\x9d were to be \xe2\x80\x9ccalculated using the unit\xe2\x80\x99s actual operating hours [and] production rates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> Third, the term \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d was defined as \xe2\x80\x9ca rate of emissions that would equal or exceed\xe2\x80\x9d one or another enumerated threshold, each expressed in \xe2\x80\x9ctons per year.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa751.166(b)(23)(i).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be bold to try to synthesize these statutory and regulatory provisions in a concise paragraph, but three points are relatively clear about the regime that covers this case:</p>\n<p align="left">(a)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act defines modification of a stationary source of a pollutant as a physical change to it, or a change in the method of its operation, that increases the amount of a pollutant discharged or emits a new one.</p>\n<p>\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA\xe2\x80\x99s NSPS regulations require a source to use the best available pollution-limiting technology only when a modification would increase the rate of discharge of pollutants measured in kilograms per hour.</p>\n<p>\n\n(c)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1980 PSD regulations require a permit for a modification (with the same statutory definition) only when it is a major one and only when it would increase the actual annual emission of a pollutant above the actual average for the two prior years.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s provision defining a PSD modification by reference to an NSPS modification caught not only the statutory NSPS definition, but also whatever regulatory gloss EPA puts on that definition at any given time (for the purposes of the best technology requirement).  When, therefore, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s PSD regulations specify the \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d that amounts to a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modification\xe2\x80\x9d requiring a PSD permit, they must measure an increase in \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of any air pollutant emitted,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77411(a)(4), in terms of the hourly rate of discharge, just the way NSPS regulations do.  Petitioners and the United States say, on the contrary, that when EPA addresses the object of the PSD scheme it is free to put a different regulatory interpretation on the common statutory core of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification,\xe2\x80\x9d by measuring increased emission not in terms of hourly rate but by the actual, annual discharge of a pollutant that will follow the modification, regardless of rate per hour.  This disagreement is the nub of the case.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Duke Energy Corporation runs 30 coal-fired electric generating units at eight plants in North and South Carolina.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Duke Energy Corp.</em>, 411 F.\xc2\xa03d 539, 544 (CA4 2005).

Consequently, the District Court said, a PSD \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modification\xe2\x80\x9d can occur \xe2\x80\x9conly if the project increases the hourly rate of emissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 641.  The District Court found further support for its construction of the 1980 PSD regulations in one letter and one memorandum written in 1981 by EPA\xe2\x80\x99s Director of the Division of Stationary Source Enforcement, Edward E. Reich.  <em>Id.,</em> at 641\xe2\x80\x93642.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States and intervenor-plaintiffs (collectively, plaintiffs) subsequently stipulated \xe2\x80\x9cthat they do not contend that the projects at issue in this case caused an increase in the maximum hourly rate of emissions at any of Duke Energy\xe2\x80\x99s units.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 504.  Rather, their claim \xe2\x80\x9cis based solely on their contention that the projects would have been projected to result in an increased utilization of the units at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Duke, for its part, stipulated to plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 right to appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that projects resulting in greater operating hours are not \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modifications\xe2\x80\x9d triggering the PSD permit requirement, absent an increase in the hourly rate of emissions.  The District Court then entered summary judgment for Duke on all PSD claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, \xe2\x80\x9calbeit for somewhat different reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  411 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 542.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he language and various interpretations of the PSD regulations \xe2\x80\xa6 are largely irrelevant to the proper analysis of this case,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoned the Court of Appeals, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to create identical statutory definitions of the term \xe2\x80\x98modification\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the NSPS and PSD provisions of the Clean Air Act \xe2\x80\x9chas affirmatively mandated that this term be interpreted identically\xe2\x80\x9d in the regulations promulgated under those provisions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 547, n.\xc2\xa03, 550.  The Court of Appeals relied principally on the authority of <em>Rowan Cos.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/247/index.html">452 U. S. 247</a>, 250 (1981), where we held against the Government\xe2\x80\x99s differing interpretations of the word \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d in different tax provisions.  411 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 550.  As the Court of Appeals saw it, <em>Rowan</em> establishes an \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively irrebuttable\xe2\x80\x9d presumption that PSD regulations must contain the same conditions for a \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d as the NSPS regulations, including an increase in the hourly rate of emissions.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  411 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 550.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court of Appeals said, Duke had not initially relied on <em>Rowan</em>, see 411 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 547, n.\xc2\xa04, and when the Court <em>sU. S.onte </em>requested supplemental briefing on <em>Rowan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s relevance, plaintiffs injected a new issue into the case.  They argued that a claim that the 1980 PSD regulation exceeded statutory authority would be an attack on the validity of the regulation that could not be raised in an enforcement proceeding.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(b)(2).  Under \xc2\xa7307(b) of the Act, they said, judicial review for validity can be obtained only by a petition to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, generally within 60 days of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s rulemaking.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals rejected this argument.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur choice of this interpretation of the PSD regulations \xe2\x80\xa6 is not an invalidation of those regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe PSD regulations can be interpreted\xe2\x80\x9d to require an increase in the hourly emissions rate as an element of a major \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d triggering the permit requirement.  411 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 549, n.\xc2\xa07.  To show that the 1980 PSD regulations are open to this construction, the Court of Appeals cited the conclusions of the District Court and the Reich opinions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted the petition for certiorari brought by intervenor-plaintiffs, 547 U. S. __ (2006), and now vacate.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals understood that it was simply construing EPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1980 PSD regulations in a permissible way that left them in harmony with their NSPS counterpart and, hence, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s single definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification.\xe2\x80\x9d  The plaintiffs say that the Court of Appeals was rewriting the PSD regulations in a way neither required by the Act nor consistent with their own text.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that no precise line runs between a purposeful but permissible reading of the regulation adopted to bring it into harmony with the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s view of the statute, and a determination that the regulation as written is invalid.  But the latter occurred here, for the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to trim the PSD regulations to match their different NSPS counterparts can only be seen as an implicit declaration that the PSD regulations were invalid as written.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In applying the 1980 PSD regulations to Duke\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, the Court of Appeals thought that, by defining the term \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d identically in its NSPS and PSD provisions, the Act required EPA to conform its PSD interpretation of that definition to any such interpretation it reasonably adhered to under NSPS.  But principles of statutory construction are not so rigid.  Although we presume that the same term has the same meaning when it occurs here and there in a single statute, the Court of Appeals mischaracterized that presumption as \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively irrebuttable.\xe2\x80\x9d  411 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 550.  We also understand that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost words have different shades of meaning and consequently may be variously construed, not only when they occur in different statutes, but when used more than once in the same statute or even in the same section.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/427/index.html">286 U. S. 427</a>, 433 (1932).  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning \xe2\x80\xa6 is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  A given term in the same statute may take on distinct characters from association with distinct statutory objects calling for different implementation strategies.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The point is the same even when the terms share a common statutory definition, if it is general enough, as we recognized in <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a> (1997).  There the question was whether the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 covered former employees.  Title VII expressly defined the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e(f), but the definition was \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with either current or past employment,\xe2\x80\x9d 519 U. S., at 342, and we held that \xe2\x80\x9ceach section\xe2\x80\x9d of Title VII \xe2\x80\x9cmust be analyzed to determine whether the context gives the term a further meaning that would resolve the issue in dispute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 343\xe2\x80\x93344.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If <em>Robinson </em>were inconsistent with <em>Rowan</em> (on which the Court of Appeals relied), it would be significant that <em>Robinson </em>is the later case, but we read the two as compatible.  In <em>Rowan</em>, the question was whether the value of meals and lodging given to employees by an employer for its own convenience should be counted in computing \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73101 <em>et seq</em>., and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73301 <em>et seq</em>.  Treasury Regulations made this value \xe2\x80\x9cincludable in \xe2\x80\x98wages\xe2\x80\x99 as defined in FICA and FUTA, even though excludable from \xe2\x80\x98wages\xe2\x80\x99 under the substantially identical\xe2\x80\x9d statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d for income-tax withholding purposes.  452 U. S., at 252.  Although we ultimately held that the income tax treatment was the proper one across the board, we did not see it this way simply because a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially identical\xe2\x80\x9d definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d appeared in each of the different statutory provisions.  Instead, we relied on a manifest \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional concern for the interest of simplicity and ease of administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 255 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The FICA and FUTA regulations fell for failing to \xe2\x80\x9cserve that interest,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 257, not for defying definitional identity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, in a setting much like <em>Rowan</em>, we recently declined to require uniformity when resolving ambiguities in identical statutory terms.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/200/index.html">532 U. S. 200</a> (2001), we rejected the notion that using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwages paid\xe2\x80\x9d in both \xe2\x80\x9cthe discrete taxation and benefits eligibility contexts\xe2\x80\x9d can, standing alone, \xe2\x80\x9ccompel symmetrical construction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 213; we gave \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial judicial deference\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9clongstanding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d and differing interpretations adopted by the Internal Revenue Service in its regulations and Revenue Rulings.  <em>Id.,</em> at 218\xe2\x80\x93220.  There is, then, no \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively irrebuttable\xe2\x80\x9d presumption that the same defined term in different provisions of the same statute must \xe2\x80\x9cbe interpreted identically.\xe2\x80\x9d  411 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 550.  Context counts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that the Clean Air Act did not merely repeat the term \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d or the same definition of that word in its NSPS and PSD sections; the PSD language referred back to the section defining \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d for NSPS purposes.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77479(2)(C).  But that did not matter in <em>Robinson,</em> and we do not see the distinction as making any difference here.  Nothing in the text or the legislative history of the technical amendments that added the cross-reference to NSPS suggests that Congress had details of regulatory implementation in mind when it imposed PSD requirements on modified sources; the cross-reference alone is certainly no unambiguous congressional code for eliminating the customary agency discretion to resolve questions about a statutory definition by looking to the surroundings of the defined term, where it occurs.  See<em> New York,</em> 413 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 19 (\xe2\x80\x9cSo far as appears, \xe2\x80\xa6 [this] incorporatio[n] by reference [is] the equivalent of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s having simply repeated in the [PSD] context the definitional language used before in the NSPS context\xe2\x80\x9d); compare 91 Stat. 745 (expressly incorporating in an unrelated provision of the 1977 amendments \xe2\x80\x9cthe interpretative regulation of the [EPA] Administrator \xe2\x80\xa6 published in 41 Federal Register 55524\xe2\x80\x9330\xe2\x80\x9d with specified exceptions); <em>New York, supra,</em> at 19<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to use such an express incorporation of prior regulations for \xe2\x80\x98modification\xe2\x80\x99 cuts against\xe2\x80\x9d any suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended to incorporate\xe2\x80\x9d into the Act the \xe2\x80\x9cpreexisting regulatory definition\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d).  Absent any iron rule to ignore the reasons for regulating PSD and NSPS \xe2\x80\x9cmodifications\xe2\x80\x9d differently, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s construction need do no more than fall within the limits of what is reasonable, as set by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s common[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] definition.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning that the PSD regulations must conform to their NSPS counterparts led the court to read those PSD regulations in a way that seems to us too far a stretch for the language used.  The 1980 PSD regulations on \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d simply cannot be taken to track the agency\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory definition under the NSPS.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0True, the 1980 PSD regulations may be no seamless narrative, but they clearly do not define a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modification\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of an increase in the \xe2\x80\x9chourly emissions rate.\xe2\x80\x9d  On its face, the definition in the PSD regulations specifies no rate at all, hourly or annual, merely requiring a physical or operational change \xe2\x80\x9cthat would result in a significant net emissions increase of any\xe2\x80\x9d regulated pollutant.  40 CFR \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(i).  But even when a rate is mentioned, as in the regulatory definitions of the two terms, \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnet emissions increase,\xe2\x80\x9d the rate is annual, not hourly.  Each of the thresholds that quantify \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d is described in \xe2\x80\x9ctons per year,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa751.166(b)(23)(i), and a \xe2\x80\x9cnet emissions increase\xe2\x80\x9d is an \xe2\x80\x9cincrease in actual emissions\xe2\x80\x9d measured against an \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d prior emissions rate of so many \xe2\x80\x9ctons per year.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa751.166(b)(3) and (21)(ii).  And what is further at odds with the idea that hourly rate is relevant is the mandate that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctual emissions shall be calculated using the unit\xe2\x80\x99s actual operating hours,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa751.166(b)(21)(ii)<em>,</em> since \xe2\x80\x9cactual emissions\xe2\x80\x9d must be measured in a manner that looks to the number of hours the unit is or probably will be actually running.  What these provisions are getting at is a measure of actual operations averaged over time, and the regulatory language simply cannot be squared with a regime under which \xe2\x80\x9chourly rate of emissions,\xe2\x80\x9d 411 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 550 (emphasis deleted), is dispositive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reasons invoked by the Court of Appeals for its different view are no match for these textual differences.  The appellate court cited two authorities ostensibly demonstrating that the 1980 PSD regulations \xe2\x80\x9ccan be interpreted consistently\xe2\x80\x9d with the hourly emissions test, the first being the analysis of the District Court in this case.  <em>Id</em>.<em>,</em> at 549, n. 7.  The District Court thought that an increase in the hourly emissions rate was necessarily a prerequisite to a PSD \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modification\xe2\x80\x9d because a provision of the 1980 PSD regulations excluded an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d from the scope of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] physical change or change in the method of operation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  278 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 640\xe2\x80\x93641 (quoting 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(iii)(<em>f</em>) and (3)(i)(<em>a</em>) (1987)).  The District Court read this exclusion to require, in effect, that a source\xe2\x80\x99s hours of operation \xe2\x80\x9cbe held constant\xe2\x80\x9d when preproject emissions are being compared with postproject emissions for the purpose of calculating the \xe2\x80\x9cnet emissions increase.\xe2\x80\x9d  278 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 640.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think this understanding of the 1980 PSD regulations makes the mistake of overlooking the difference between the two separate components of the regulatory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modification\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9c[1] any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that [2] would result in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(i); cf. <em>New York,</em> 413 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 11 (\xe2\x80\x9c[The statutory] definition requires <em>both</em> a change\xe2\x80\x94whether physical or operational\xe2\x80\x94<em>and</em> a resulting increase in emissions of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original));<em> Wisconsin Electric Power Co.</em> v. <em>Reilly</em>, 893 F. 2d 901, 907 (CA7 1990) (same).  The exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cincrease in \xe2\x80\xa6 hours \xe2\x80\xa6 or \xe2\x80\xa6 production rate,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(iii)(<em>f</em>), speaks to the first of these components (\xe2\x80\x9cphysical change \xe2\x80\xa6 or change in \xe2\x80\xa6 method,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(i)), but not to the second (\xe2\x80\x9csignificant net emissions increase,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.).  As the preamble to the 1980 PSD regulations explains, forcing companies to obtain a PSD permit before they could simply adjust operating hours \xe2\x80\x9cwould severely and unduly hamper the ability of any company to take advantage of favorable market conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  45 Fed. Reg. 52704.  In other words, a mere increase in the hours of operation, standing alone, is not a \xe2\x80\x9cphysical change or change in the method of operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the District Court took this language a step further.  It assumed that increases in operating hours (resulting in emissions increases at the old rate per hour) must be ignored even if caused or enabled by an independent \xe2\x80\x9cphysical change \xe2\x80\xa6 or change in the method of operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(i).  That reading, however, turns an exception to the first component of the definition into a mandate to ignore the very facts that would count under the second, which defines \xe2\x80\x9cnet emissions increase\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cactual emissions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa751.166(b)(3), during \xe2\x80\x9cthe unit\xe2\x80\x99s actual operating hours,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa751.166(b)(21)(ii); see also 57 Fed.

The Reich letters are not, however, heavy ammunition.  Their persuasiveness is elusive, neither of them containing more than one brief and conclusory statement supporting Duke\xe2\x80\x99s position.

Reg. 32328.  In any event, it answers the citation of the Reich letters to realize that an isolated opinion of an agency official does not authorize a court to read a regulation inconsistently with its language.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the text of the 1980 PSD regulations on \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d doomed the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to equate those regulations with their NSPS counterpart.  As a consequence, we have to see the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the 1980 PSD regulations as an implicit invalidation of those regulations, a form of judicial review implicating the provisions of \xc2\xa7307(b) of the Act, which limit challenges to the validity of a regulation during enforcement proceedings when such review \xe2\x80\x9ccould have been obtained\xe2\x80\x9d in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia within 60 days of EPA rulemaking.

See Brief for Petitioners 2; Brief for United States 7; Brief for Respondent Duke 32.  At another point in the NSPS regulations, a different definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d appeared: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Modification\xe2\x80\x99 means any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, an existing facility which increases the amount of any air pollutant (to which a standard applies) emitted into the atmosphere by that facility,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa760.2(h); see also <em>New York</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 413 F. 3d 3, 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (CADC 2005) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]either the 1975 regulation nor its preamble explained why EPA found it necessary to offer these two separate glosses on \xe2\x80\x98modification\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Statutory PSD superseded a regulatory PSD scheme established by EPA in 1974.

Because the United States acknowledges that the two sets of regulations \xe2\x80\x9cdid not materially differ with respect to the legal question at issue here,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 20, n. 4, we will assume, as did the Court of Appeals and the District Court, that the 1980 PSD regulations control.  411 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 543, n.\xc2\xa01; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Duke Energy Corp</em>., 278 F.

In other words, the Court of Appeals raised no question about the reasonableness of the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d in the 1980 PSD regulations, apart from its deviation from the definition contained in NSPS regulations.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Duke argues that the 1977 amendments intended to incorporate EPA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d under the 1974 regulatory PSD program.  Brief for Respondent Duke 44; see also n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.  We find no support for this argument in the statutory text, which refers to the statutory NSPS definition rather than the regulatory PSD definition.  Although Duke correctly points out that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress instructed that the bulk of the pre-existing rules \xe2\x80\x98shall remain in effect,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent Duke 44 (quoting 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77478(a)), this instruction was a temporary measure \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ntil such time as an applicable implementation plan is in effect,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77478(a).  We therefore do not read this language as a restriction on EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority to interpret the statutory PSD provisions reasonably in a manner that departs from the 1974 regulations.  Duke also invokes <em>Bragdon</em> v. <em>Abbott</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/624/index.html">524 U. S. 624</a>, 631 (1998), for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cuse of the pre-existing term \xe2\x80\x98modification\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98carries the implication that Congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Duke 44.  But this reasoning is unavailing here, given the existence of at least three distinct regulatory definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the 1977 amendments.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, and nn. 1, 2.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Two Courts of Appeals agree.

If, however, a physical change enables the plant to increase its output, then, according to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, the exclusion for merely operating the plant for longer hours is inapplicable\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)); <em>Wisconsin Electric Power Co</em>. v. <em>Reilly</em>, 893 F.\xc2\xa02d 901, 916, n.\xc2\xa011 (CA7 1990) (the regulatory exclusion for increases in the hours of\xc2\xa0operation \xe2\x80\x9cwas provided to allow facilities to take advantage of fluctuating market conditions, not construction or modification activity\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Puerto Rican Cement Co</em>. v. <em>EPA</em>, 889 F.\xc2\xa02d 292, 298 (CA1 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no logical contradiction in rules that, on the one hand, permit firms using <em>existing</em> capacity simply to increase their output and, on the other, use the potential output of <em>new</em> capacity as a basis for calculating an increase in emissions levels\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Duke now offers an alternative argument for applying the hourly emissions test for the PSD program: before a project can become a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modification\xe2\x80\x9d under the PSD regulations, 40 CFR \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(i) (1987), it must meet the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d under the NSPS regulations, \xc2\xa760.14(a).  That sounds right, but the language of the regulations does not support it.  For example, it would be superfluous for PSD regulations to require a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor modification\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9ca physical change in or change in the method of operation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa751.166(b)(2)(i), if they presupposed that the NSPS definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification,\xe2\x80\x9d which contains the same prerequisite, \xc2\xa760.14(a), had already been satisfied.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77479(2)(C).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSection 7411(a) contains the NSPS definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification,\xe2\x80\x9d which the parties agree is the relevant statutory definition of the term for both PSD and NSPS.  Because of the cross-reference, the definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d in PSD and NSPS are one and the same.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d therefore has the same meaning despite contextual variations in the two admittedly different statutory schemes.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 explicit linkage of PSD\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d to NSPS\xe2\x80\x99 prevents the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from adopting differing regulatory definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d for PSD and NSPS.  Cf. <em>IBP, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alvarez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/21/index.html">546 U. S. 21</a>, 34 (2005) (concluding that an \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit reference\xe2\x80\x9d to a previous statutory definition prohibits interpreting the same word differently).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 7479(2)(C)\xe2\x80\x99s cross-reference carries more meaning than the mere repetition of the same word in a different statutory context.  When Congress repeats the same word in a different statutory context, it is possible that Congress might have intended the context to alter the meaning of the word.  See <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/427/index.html">286 U. S. 427</a>, 433 (1932).  No such possibility exists with \xc2\xa77479(2)(C).  By incorporating NSPS\xe2\x80\x99 definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress demonstrated that it did not intend for PSD\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification\xe2\x80\x9d to hinge on contextual factors unique to the PSD statutory scheme.  Thus, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/200/index.html">532 U. S. 200</a> (2001), which analyzes the mere repetition of the same word in a different statutory context, carries little weight in this situation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, this case differs from the circumstance we faced in <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a> (1997).  In <em>Robinson</em>, we considered whether \xe2\x80\x9cemployee,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa7704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, included former employees.  We determined that under the clear language of the statute, certain statutory provisions using the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d made sense only with respect to former employees or current employees, but not both.  <em>Id.</em>, at 342\xe2\x80\x93343.  Accordingly, upon analyzing the context of \xc2\xa7704(a), we were compelled to conclude that the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d included former employees.  This case does not present a similar situation.  The statute here includes a statutory cross-reference, which conveys a clear congressional intent to provide a common definition for the term \xe2\x80\x9cmodification.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the contextual differences between PSD and NSPS do not compel different meanings for the term \xe2\x80\x9cmodification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Robinson</em> is, therefore, inapplicable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the cross-reference were merely the equivalent of repeating the words of the definition, we must still apply our usual presumption that the same words repeated in different parts of the same statute have the same meaning.  See <em>Atlantic Cleaners</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 433; <em>ante</em>, at 9.  That presumption has not been overcome here.  While the broadly stated regulatory goals of PSD and NSPS differ, these contextual differences do not compel different definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is, unlike in <em>Robinson</em>, reading the statutory definition in the separate contexts of PSD and NSPS does not require different interpretations of the term \xe2\x80\x9cmodification.\xe2\x80\x9d  EPA demonstrated as much when it recently proposed regulations that would unify the regulatory definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cmodification.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 70 Fed. Reg. 61083, n. 3 (2005) (terming the proposal \xe2\x80\x9can appropriate exercise of our discretion\xe2\x80\x9d and stating that the unified definition better serves PSD\xe2\x80\x99s goals).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority opinion does little to overcome the presumption that the same words, when repeated, carry the same meaning.  Instead, it explains that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases do not compel identical language to be interpreted identically in all situations.  Granting that point, the majority still has the burden of stating why our general presumption does not control the outcome here.  It has not done so.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
