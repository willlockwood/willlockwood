S.</em>), 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 12 (<em>Avena</em>), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the United States had violated Article 36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention or Convention) by failing to inform 51 named Mexican nationals, including petitioner Medell\xc3\xadn, of their Vienna Convention rights.  The ICJ found that those named individuals were entitled to review and reconsideration of their U. S. state-court convictions and sentences regardless of their failure to comply with generally applicable state rules governing challenges to criminal convictions.  In <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/331/index.html">548 U. S. 331</a>\xe2\x80\x94issued after <em>Avena </em>but involving individuals who were not named in the <em>Avena</em> judgment\xe2\x80\x94this Court held, contrary to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s determination, that the Convention did not preclude the application of state default rules.  The President then issued a memorandum (President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum or Memorandum) stating that the United States would \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge its international obligations\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Avena</em> \xe2\x80\x9cby having State courts give effect to the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on <em>Avena </em>and<em> </em>the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum, Medell\xc3\xadn filed a second Texas state-court habeas application challenging his state capital murder conviction and death sentence on the ground that he had not been informed of his Vienna Convention rights.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s application as an abuse of the writ, concluding that neither <em>Avena</em> nor the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum was binding federal law that could displace the State\xe2\x80\x99s limitations on filing successive habeas applications.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Neither <em>Avena</em> nor the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions.

Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9327. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0While a treaty may constitute an international commitment, it is not binding domestic law unless Congress has enacted statutes implementing it or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be \xe2\x80\x9cself-executing\xe2\x80\x9d and is ratified on that basis.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Foster</em> v. <em>Neilson</em>, 2 Pet. 253, 314.  The <em>Avena</em> judgment creates an international law obligation on the part of the United States, but it is not automatically binding domestic law because none of the relevant treaty sources\xe2\x80\x94the Optional Protocol, the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute\xe2\x80\x94creates binding federal law in the absence of implementing legislation, and no such legislation has been enacted. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most natural reading of the Optional Protocol is that it is a bare grant of jurisdiction.  The Protocol says nothing about the effect of an ICJ decision, does not commit signatories to comply therewith, and is silent as to any enforcement mechanism.  The obligation to comply with ICJ judgments is derived from Article 94 of the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach \xe2\x80\xa6 Member \xe2\x80\xa6 undertakes to comply with the [ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s] decision \xe2\x80\xa6 in any case to which it is a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply\xe2\x80\x9d is simply a commitment by member states to take future action through their political branches.  That language does not indicate that the Senate, in ratifying the Optional Protocol, intended to vest ICJ decisions with immediate legal effect in domestic courts. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading is confirmed by Article 94(2)\xe2\x80\x94the enforcement provision\xe2\x80\x94which provides the sole remedy for noncompliance: referral to the U.\xc2\xa0N. Security Council by an aggrieved state.  The provision of an express diplomatic rather than judicial remedy is itself evidence that ICJ judgments were not meant to be enforceable in domestic courts.  See <em>Sanchez</em>-<em>Llamas, </em>548 U. S., at 347.  Even this \xe2\x80\x9cquintessentially <em>international</em> remed[y],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 355, is not absolute.  It requires a Security Council resolution, and the President and Senate were undoubtedly aware that the United States retained the unqualified right to exercise its veto of any such resolution.  Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s construction would eliminate the option of noncompliance contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining the ability of the political branches to determine whether and how to comply with an ICJ judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ICJ Statute, by limiting disputes to those involving nations, not individuals, and by specifying that ICJ decisions have no binding force except between those nations, provides further evidence that the <em>Avena </em>judgment does not automatically constitute federal law enforceable in U. S. courts.  Medell\xc3\xadn, an individual, cannot be considered a party to the <em>Avena </em>decision.  Finally, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of a treaty \xe2\x80\x9cis entitled to great weight,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Avagliano</em>, 457 U. S., at 184\xe2\x80\x93185, and the Executive Branch has unfailingly adhered to its view that the relevant treaties do not create domestically enforceable federal law.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9317. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The foregoing interpretive approach\xe2\x80\x94parsing a treaty\xe2\x80\x99s text to determine if it is self-executing\xe2\x80\x94is hardly novel.  This Court has long looked to the language of a treaty to determine whether the President who negotiated it and the Senate that ratified it intended for the treaty to automatically create domestically enforceable federal law.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Foster,</em> <em>supra.</em>  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9320. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that <em>Avena </em>does not by itself constitute binding federal law is confirmed by the \xe2\x80\x9cpostratification understanding\xe2\x80\x9d of signatory countries.  See <em>Zicherman</em> v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/217/index.html">516 U. S. 217</a>, 226.  There are currently 47 nations that are parties to the Optional Protocol and 171 nations that are parties to the Vienna Convention.  Yet neither Medell\xc3\xadn nor his <em>amici</em> have identified a single nation that treats ICJ judgments as binding in domestic courts.  The lack of any basis for supposing that any other country would treat ICJ judgments as directly enforceable as a matter of their domestic law strongly suggests that the treaty should not be so viewed in our courts.  See <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>548 U. S., at 343\xe2\x80\x93344, and n.\xc2\xa03.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is further supported by general principles of interpretation.  Given that the forum state\xe2\x80\x99s procedural rules govern a treaty\xe2\x80\x99s implementation absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, see <em>e.g., id.,</em> at 351, one would expect the ratifying parties to the relevant treaties to have clearly stated any intent to give ICJ judgments such effect.  There is no statement in the Optional Protocol, the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute that supports this notion.  Moreover, the consequences of Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s argument give pause: neither Texas nor this Court may look behind an ICJ decision and quarrel with its reasoning or result, despite this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>that<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the [ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s] structure or purpose \xe2\x80\xa6 suggests that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on  our courts.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 354.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding does not call into question the ordinary enforcement of foreign judgments.   An agreement to abide by the result of an international adjudication can be a treaty obligation like any other, so long as the agreement is consistent with the Constitution.  In addition, Congress is up to the task of implementing non-self-executing treaties, even those involving complex commercial disputes.  Medell\xc3\xadn contends that domestic courts generally give effect to foreign judgments, but the judgment Medell\xc3\xadn asks us to enforce is hardly typical: It would enjoin the operation of state law and force the State to take action to \xe2\x80\x9creview and reconside[r]\xe2\x80\x9d his case.  Foreign judgments awarding injunctive relief against private parties, let alone sovereign States, \xe2\x80\x9care not generally entitled to enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa7481, Comment <em>b,</em> p. 595 (1986).

But those interests do not allow the Court to set aside first principles.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to act, as with the exercise of any governmental power, \xe2\x80\x9cmust stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/579/index.html">343 U. S. 579</a>, 585. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s familiar tripartite scheme provides the accepted framework for evaluating executive action in this area.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U. S., at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Second, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 637.  In such a circumstance, Presidential authority can derive support from \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional inertia, indifference or quiescence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Finally, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court can sustain his actions \xe2\x80\x9conly by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 637\xe2\x80\x93638.  Pp.\xc2\xa028\xe2\x80\x9329. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The United States marshals two principal arguments in favor of the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to establish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.  The United States argues that the relevant treaties give the President the authority to implement the <em>Avena</em> judgment and that Congress has acquiesced in the exercise of such authority.  The United States also relies upon an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d international dispute-resolution power.  We find these arguments, as well as Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s additional argument that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is a valid exercise of his \xe2\x80\x9cTake Care\xe2\x80\x9d power, unpersuasive.  Pp.\xc2\xa029\xe2\x80\x9337.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The United States maintains that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is implicitly authorized by the Optional Protocol and the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter.  But the responsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress, not the Executive.  <em>Foster</em>, 2 Pet., at 315.  It is a fundamental constitutional principle that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he power to make the necessary laws is in Congress; the power to execute in the President.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hamdan </em>v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/557/index.html">548 U. S. 557</a>, 591.  A non-self-executing treaty, by definition, is one that was ratified with the understanding that it is not to have domestic effect of its own force.  That understanding precludes the assertion that Congress has implicitly authorized the President\xe2\x80\x94acting on his own\xe2\x80\x94to achieve precisely the same result.  Accordingly, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum does not fall within the first category of the <em>Youngstown</em> framework.  Indeed, because the non-self-executing character of the relevant treaties not only refutes the notion that the ratifying parties vested the President with the authority to unilaterally make treaty obligations binding on domestic courts, but also implicitly prohibits him from doing so, the President\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of authority is within <em>Youngstown</em>\xe2\x80\x99s third category, not the first or even the second.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States maintains that congressional acquiescence requires that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum be given effect as domestic law.  But such acquiescence is pertinent when the President\xe2\x80\x99s action falls within the second <em>Youngstown </em>category, not the third.  In any event, congressional acquiescence does not exist here.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to act following the President\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of prior ICJ controversies does not demonstrate acquiescence because in none of those prior controversies did the President assert the authority to transform an international obligation into domestic law and thereby displace state law.  The United States\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelated\xe2\x80\x9d statutory responsibilities and on his \xe2\x80\x9cestablished role\xe2\x80\x9d in litigating foreign policy concerns is also misplaced.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s statutory authorization to represent the United States before the U.\xc2\xa0N., the ICJ, and the U.\xc2\xa0N. Security Council speaks to his <em>international</em> responsibilities, not to any unilateral authority to create domestic law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The combination of a non-self-executing treaty and the lack of implementing legislation does not preclude the President from acting to comply with an international treaty obligation by other means, so long as those means are consistent with the Constitution.  But the President may not rely upon a non-self-executing treaty to establish binding rules of decision that pre-empt contrary state law.  Pp.\xc2\xa030\xe2\x80\x9335.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0The United States also claims that\xe2\x80\x94independent of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 treaty obligations\xe2\x80\x94the Memorandum is a valid exercise of the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign affairs authority to resolve claims disputes.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>American Ins. Assn.</em> v. <em>Garamendi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/396/index.html">539 U. S. 396</a>, 415.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s claims-settlement cases involve a narrow set of circumstances: the making of executive agreements to settle civil claims between American citizens and foreign governments or foreign nationals.  They are based on the view that \xe2\x80\x9ca systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned,\xe2\x80\x9d can \xe2\x80\x9craise a presumption that the [action] had been [taken] in pursuance of its consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dames &amp; Moore </em>v. <em>Regan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/654/index.html">453 U.

The President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum\xe2\x80\x94a directive issued to state courts that would compel those courts to reopen final criminal judgments and set aside neutrally applicable state laws\xe2\x80\x94is not supported by a \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly longstanding practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Executive\xe2\x80\x99s limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far.

S.</em>), 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (<em>Avena</em>), that tribunal considered a claim brought by Mexico against the United States.  The ICJ held that, based on violations of the Vienna Convention, 51 named Mexican nationals were entitled to review and reconsideration of their state-court convictions and sentences in the United States.  This was so regardless of any forfeiture of the right to raise Vienna Convention claims because of a failure to comply with generally applicable state rules governing challenges to criminal convictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/331/index.html"></a><a href="/us/548/331/index.html">548 U.

After the <em>Avena </em>decision, President George W.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s application as an abuse of the writ under state law, given Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise his Vienna Convention claim in a timely manner under state law.  We granted certiorari to decide two questions.  <em>First</em>, is the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in<em> Avena</em> directly enforceable as domestic law in a state court in the United States?  <em>Second</em>, does the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum independently require the States to provide review and reconsideration of the claims of the 51 Mexican nationals named in <em>Avena</em> without regard to state procedural default rules?  We conclude that neither <em>Avena</em> nor the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions.

The ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction in any particular case, however, is dependent upon the consent of the parties.  See Art. 36, 59 Stat. 1060.  The ICJ Statute delineates two ways in which a nation may consent to ICJ jurisdiction: It may consent generally to jurisdiction on any question arising under a treaty or general international law, Art. 36(2), <em>ibid.</em>, or it may consent specifically to jurisdiction over a particular category of cases or disputes pursuant to a separate treaty, Art. 36(1), <em>ibid</em>.  The United States originally consented to the general jurisdiction of the ICJ when it filed a declaration recognizing compulsory jurisdiction under Art. 36(2) in 1946.  The United States withdrew from general ICJ jurisdiction in 1985.  See U. S. Dept. of State Letter and Statement Concerning Termination of Acceptance of ICJ Compulsory Jurisdiction (Oct. 7, 1985), reprinted in 24 I.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0M. 1742 (1985).  By ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention, the United States consented to the specific jurisdiction of the ICJ with respect to claims arising out of the Vienna Convention.  On March 7, 2005, subsequent to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Avena</em>, the United States gave notice of withdrawal from the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention.

He argues that \xe2\x80\x9cby virtue of the Supremacy Clause, the treaties requiring compliance with the <em>Avena</em> judgment are <em>already</em> the \xe2\x80\x98Law of the Land\xe2\x80\x99 by which all state and federal courts in this country are \xe2\x80\x98bound.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 1.  Accordingly, Medell\xc3\xadn argues, <em>Avena</em> is a binding federal rule of decision that pre-empts contrary state limitations on successive habeas petitions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No one disputes that the <em>Avena </em>decision\xe2\x80\x94a decision that flows from the treaties through which the United States submitted to ICJ jurisdiction with respect to Vienna Convention disputes\xe2\x80\x94constitutes an <em>international</em> law obligation on the part of the United States.  But not all international law obligations automatically constitute binding federal law enforceable in United States courts.  The question we confront here is whether the <em>Avena</em> judgment has automatic <em>domestic</em> legal effect such that the judgment of its own force applies in state and federal courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has long recognized the distinction between treaties that automatically have effect as domestic law, and those that\xe2\x80\x94while they constitute international law commitments\xe2\x80\x94do not by themselves function as binding federal law.  The distinction was well explained by Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Foster</em> v. <em>Neilson</em>, 2 Pet. 253, 315 (1829), overruled on other grounds, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Percheman</em>, 7 Pet. 51 (1833), which held that a treaty is \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent to an act of the legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d and hence self-executing, when it \xe2\x80\x9coperates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 314.  When, in contrast, \xe2\x80\x9c[treaty] stipulations are not self-executing they can only be enforced pursuant to legislation to carry them into effect.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Whitney</em> v. <em>Robertson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/124/190/index.html">124 U. S. 190</a>, 194 (1888).  In sum, while treaties \xe2\x80\x9cmay comprise international commitments . . . they are not domestic law unless Congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be \xe2\x80\x98self-executing\xe2\x80\x99 and is ratified on these terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Igart\xc3\xbaa-De La Rosa</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 417 F.\xc2\xa03d 145, 150 (CA1 2005) (en banc) (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J.).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A treaty is, of course, \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily a compact between independent nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Head Money Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/112/580/index.html">112 U.

Such an agreement would require the party to appear before the arbitral tribunal without obligating the party to treat the tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s decision as binding.

It provides only that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the [Vienna] Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmay accordingly be brought before the [ICJ] . . . by any party to the dispute being a Party to the present Protocol.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, 21 U.

The Protocol is similarly silent as to any enforcement mechanism.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The obligation on the part of signatory nations to comply with ICJ judgments derives not from the Optional Protocol, but rather from Article 94 of the United Nations Charter\xe2\x80\x94the provision that specifically addresses the effect of ICJ decisions.

The Article is not a directive to domestic courts.  It does not provide that the United States \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmust\xe2\x80\x9d comply with an ICJ decision, nor indicate that the Senate that ratified the U.\xc2\xa0N.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, The Charter of the United Nations for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security: Hearings before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 124\xe2\x80\x93125 (1945) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f a state fails to perform its obligations under a judgment of the [ICJ], the other party may have recourse to the Security Council\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 286 (statement of Leo Paslovsky, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for International Organizations and Security Affairs) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the Court has rendered a judgment and one of the parties refuses to accept it, then the dispute becomes political rather than legal.

His construction would eliminate the option of noncompliance contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining the ability of the political branches to determine whether and how to comply with an ICJ judgment.  Those sensitive foreign policy decisions would instead be transferred to state and federal courts charged with applying an ICJ judgment directly as domestic law.  And those courts would not be empowered to decide whether to comply with the judgment\xe2\x80\x94again, always regarded as an option by the political branches\xe2\x80\x94any more than courts may consider whether to comply with any other species of domestic law.  This result would be particularly anomalous in light of the principle that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he conduct of the foreign relations of our Government is committed by the Constitution to the Executive and Legislative\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98the political\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Departments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oetjen</em> v. <em>Central Leather Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/246/297/index.html">246 U.

Charter, provides further evidence that the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Avena</em> does not automatically constitute federal law judicially enforceable in United States courts.  Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062.  To begin with, the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal purpose\xe2\x80\x9d is said to be to \xe2\x80\x9carbitrate particular disputes between national governments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sanchez-Llamas, supra</em>, at 355 (citing 59 Stat. 1055).  Accordingly, the ICJ can hear disputes only between nations, not individuals.  Art. 34(1), 59 Stat. 1059 (\xe2\x80\x9cOnly states [<em>i.e.,</em> countries] may be parties in cases before the [ICJ]\xe2\x80\x9d).  More important, Article 59 of the statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he decision of the [ICJ] has <em>no binding force</em> except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1062 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The dissent does not explain how Medell\xc3\xadn, an individual, can be a party to the ICJ proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn argues that because the <em>Avena</em> case involves him, it is clear that he\xe2\x80\x94and the 50 other Mexican nationals named in the <em>Avena </em>decision\xe2\x80\x94should be regarded as parties to the <em>Avena </em>judgment.  Brief for Petitioner 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  But cases before the ICJ are often precipitated by disputes involving particular persons or entities, disputes that a nation elects to take up as its own.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light &amp; Power Co. </em>(<em>Belg.</em> v. <em>Spain</em>), 1970 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 3 (Judgment of Feb. 5) (claim brought by Belgium on behalf of Belgian nationals and shareholders); <em>Case Concerning the Protection of French Nationals and Protected Persons in Egypt</em> (<em>Fr.</em> v. <em>Egypt</em>), 1950 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 59 (Order of Mar. 29) (claim brought by France on behalf of French nationals and protected persons in Egypt); <em>Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.

That has never been understood to alter the express and established rules that only nation-states may be parties before the ICJ, Art. 34, 59 Stat. 1059, and\xe2\x80\x94contrary to the position of the dissent, <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 23\xe2\x80\x94that ICJ judgments are binding only between those parties, Art. 59, <em>id.,</em> at 1062.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is, moreover, well settled that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of a treaty \xe2\x80\x9cis entitled to great weight.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Avagliano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/176/index.html">457 U.

The Executive Branch has unfailingly adhered to its view that the relevant treaties do not create domestically enforceable federal law.

Given our obligation to interpret treaty provisions to determine whether they are self-executing, we have to confess that we do think it rather important to look to the treaty language to see what it has to say about the issue.  That is after all what the Senate looks to in deciding whether to approve the treaty.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interpretive approach employed by the Court today\xe2\x80\x94resorting to the text\xe2\x80\x94is hardly novel.  In two early cases involving an 1819 land-grant treaty between Spain and the United States, Chief Justice Marshall found the language of the treaty dispositive.  In <em>Foster</em>, after distinguishing between self-executing treaties (those \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent to an act of the legislature\xe2\x80\x9d) and non-self-executing treaties (those \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislature must execute\xe2\x80\x9d), Chief Justice Marshall held that the 1819 treaty was non-self-executing.  2 Pet., at 314.  Four years later, the Supreme Court considered another claim under the same treaty, but concluded that the treaty was self-executing.  See <em>Percheman</em>, 7 Pet., at 87.  The reason was not because the treaty was sometimes self-executing and sometimes not, but because \xe2\x80\x9cthe language of\xe2\x80\x9d the Spanish translation (brought to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attention for the first time) indicated the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent to ratify and confirm the land-grant \xe2\x80\x9cby force of the instrument itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 89.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As against this time-honored textual approach, the dissent proposes a multifactor, judgment-by-judgment analysis that would \xe2\x80\x9cjettiso[n] relative predictability for the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc.</em> v. <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/527/index.html">513 U. S. 527</a>, 547 (1995).  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s novel approach to deciding which (or, more accurately, when) treaties give rise to directly enforceable federal law is arrestingly indeterminate.  Treaty language is barely probative. <em>Post,</em> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he absence or presence of language in a treaty about a provision\xe2\x80\x99s self-execution proves nothing at all\xe2\x80\x9d).  Determining whether treaties themselves create federal law is sometimes committed to the political branches and sometimes to the judiciary.  <em>Post</em>, at 13.  Of those committed to the judiciary, the courts pick and choose which shall be binding United States law\xe2\x80\x94trumping not only state but other federal law as well\xe2\x80\x94and which shall not.  <em>Post,</em> at 13\xe2\x80\x9327.  They do this on the basis of a multifactor, \xe2\x80\x9ccontext-specific\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  <em>Post</em>, at 13.  Even then, the same treaty sometimes gives rise to United States law and sometimes does not, again depending on an ad hoc judicial assessment.  <em>Post,</em> at 13\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our Framers established a careful set of procedures that must be followed before federal law can be created under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94vesting that decision in the political branches, subject to checks and balances.  U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa77.  They also recognized that treaties could create federal law, but again through the political branches, with the President making the treaty and the Senate approving it.  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the treaty route, depending on an ad hoc judgment of the judiciary without looking to the treaty language\xe2\x80\x94the very language negotiated by the President and approved by the Senate\xe2\x80\x94cannot readily be ascribed to those same Framers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach risks the United States\xe2\x80\x99 involvement in international agreements.  It is hard to believe that the United States would enter into treaties that are sometimes enforceable and sometimes not.  Such a treaty would be the equivalent of writing a blank check to the judiciary.  Senators could never be quite sure what the treaties on which they were voting meant.  Only a judge could say for sure and only at some future date.  This uncertainty could hobble the United States\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to negotiate and sign international agreements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the dissent\xe2\x80\x94for a grab bag of no less than seven reasons\xe2\x80\x94would tell us that this <em>particular</em> ICJ judgment is federal law.  <em>Post</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9327.  That is no sort of guidance.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is it any answer to say that the federal courts will diligently police international agreements and enforce the decisions of international tribunals only when they <em>should be</em> enforced.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The point of a non-self-executing treaty is that it \xe2\x80\x9caddresses itself to the political, <em>not</em> the judicial department; and the legislature must execute the contract before it can become a rule for the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 314 (emphasis added); <em>Whitney</em>, 124 U. S., at 195.  See also <em>Foster</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 307 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe judiciary is not that department of the government, to which the assertion of its interests against foreign powers is confided\xe2\x80\x9d).  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s contrary approach would assign to the courts\xe2\x80\x94not the political branches\xe2\x80\x94the primary role in deciding when and how international agreements will be enforced.  To read a treaty so that it sometimes has the effect of domestic law and sometimes does not is tantamount to vesting with the judiciary the power not only to interpret but also to create the law.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion that <em>Avena </em>does not by itself constitute binding federal law is confirmed by the \xe2\x80\x9cpostratification understanding\xe2\x80\x9d of signatory nations.  See <em>Zicherman</em>, 516 U. S., at 226.  There are currently 47 nations that are parties to the Optional Protocol and 171 nations that are parties to the Vienna Convention.  Yet neither Medell\xc3\xadn nor his <em>amici</em> have identified a single nation that treats ICJ judgments as binding in domestic courts.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In determining that the Vienna Convention did not require certain relief in United States courts in <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, we found it pertinent that the requested relief would not be available under the treaty in any other signatory country.  See 548 U. S., at 343\xe2\x80\x93344, and n.\xc2\xa03.  So too here the lack of any basis for supposing that any other country would treat ICJ judgments as directly enforceable as a matter of their domestic law strongly suggests that the treaty should not be so viewed in our courts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion is further supported by general principles of interpretation.  To begin with, we reiterated in <em>Sanchez</em>-<em>Llamas</em> what we held in <em>Breard</em>, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U. S., at 351 (quoting <em>Breard</em>, 523 U. S., at 375).  Given that ICJ judgments may interfere with state procedural rules, one would expect the ratifying parties to the relevant treaties to have clearly stated their intent to give those judgments domestic effect, if they had so intended.  Here there is no statement in the Optional Protocol, the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute that supports the notion that ICJ judgments displace state procedural rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the consequences of Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s argument give pause.  An ICJ judgment, the argument goes, is not only binding domestic law but is also unassailable.  As a result, neither Texas nor this Court may look behind a judgment and quarrel with its reasoning or result.  (We already know, from <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, that this Court disagrees with both the reasoning and result in <em>Avena</em>.)  Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would allow ICJ judgments to override otherwise binding state law; there is nothing in his logic that would exempt contrary federal law from the same fate.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cook </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/288/102/index.html"></a><a href="/us/288/102/index.html">288 U. S. 102</a>, 119 (1933) (later-in-time self-executing treaty supersedes a federal statue if there is a conflict).  And there is nothing to prevent the ICJ from ordering state courts to annul criminal convictions and sentences, for any reason deemed sufficient by the ICJ.  Indeed, that is precisely the relief Mexico requested.  <em>Avena,</em> 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J., at 58\xe2\x80\x9359.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even the dissent flinches at reading the relevant treaties to give rise to self-executing ICJ judgments in all cases.  It admits that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is unlikely to authorize automatic judicial enforceability of <em>all</em> ICJ judgments, for that could include some politically sensitive judgments and others better suited for enforcement by other branches.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 24.  Our point precisely.  But the lesson to draw from that insight is hardly that the judiciary should decide which judgments are politically sensitive and which are not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, and as we observed in <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the structure or purpose of the ICJ suggests that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on our courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U. S., at 354.  Given that holding, it is difficult to see how that same structure and purpose can establish, as Medell\xc3\xadn argues, that <em>judgments</em> of the ICJ nonetheless were intended to be conclusive on our courts.  A judgment is binding only if there is a rule of law that makes it so.  And the question whether ICJ judgments can bind domestic courts depends upon the same analysis undertaken in <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>and set forth above.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our prior decisions identified by the dissent as holding a number of treaties to be self-executing, see <em>post,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939, Appendix A, stand only for the unremarkable proposition that some international agreements are self-executing and others are not.\xc2\xa0 It is well settled that the \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nterpretation of [a treaty] . . . must, of course, begin with the language of the Treaty itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.,</em> 457 U. S., at 180.  As a result, we have held treaties to be self-executing when the textual provisions indicate that the President and Senate intended for the agreement to have domestic effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn and the dissent cite <em>Comegys</em> v. <em>Vasse</em>, 1 Pet. 193 (1828), for the proposition that the judgments of international tribunals are automatically binding on domestic courts.  See <em>post,</em> at 9; Reply Brief for Petitioner 2; Brief for Petitioner 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  That case, of course, involved a different treaty than the ones at issue here; it stands only for the modest principle that the terms of a treaty control the outcome of a case.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  We do not suggest that treaties can never afford binding domestic effect to international tribunal judgments\xe2\x80\x94only that the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, the Optional Protocol, and the ICJ Statute do not do so.  And whether the treaties underlying a judgment are self-executing so that the judgment is directly enforceable as domestic law in our courts is, of course, a matter for this Court to decide.  See <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 353\xe2\x80\x93354.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holding does not call into question the ordinary enforcement of foreign judgments or international arbitral agreements.  Indeed, we agree with Medell\xc3\xadn that, as a general matter, \xe2\x80\x9can agreement to abide by the result\xe2\x80\x9d of an international adjudication\xe2\x80\x94or what he really means, an agreement to give the result of such adjudication domestic legal effect\xe2\x80\x94can be a treaty obligation like any other, so long as the agreement is consistent with the Constitution.  See Brief for Petitioner 20.  The point is that the particular treaty obligations on which Medell\xc3\xadn relies do not of their own force create domestic law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent worries that our decision casts doubt on some 70-odd treaties under which the United States has agreed to submit disputes to the ICJ according to \xe2\x80\x9croughly similar\xe2\x80\x9d provisions.  See <em>post,</em> at 4, 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  Again, under our established precedent, some treaties are self-executing and some are not, depending on the treaty.  That the judgment of an international tribunal might not automatically become domestic law hardly means the underlying treaty is \xe2\x80\x9cuseless.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>post</em>, at 17; cf. <em>post</em>, at 11 (describing the British system in which treaties \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually always requir[e] parliamentary legislation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Such judgments would still constitute international obligations, the proper subject of political and diplomatic negotiations.  See <em>Head Money Cases</em>, 112 U. S., at 598.  And Congress could elect to give them wholesale effect (rather than the judgment-by-judgment approach hypothesized by the dissent, <em>post</em>, at 24) through implementing legislation, as it regularly has.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105\xe2\x80\x93277, div. G, \xc2\xa72242, 112 Stat. 2681\xe2\x80\x93822, note following 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71231 (directing the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate agencies\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the United States under Article 3\xe2\x80\x9d of the Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment); see also <em>infra</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (listing examples of legislation implementing international obligations).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, that an ICJ judgment may not be automatically enforceable in domestic courts does not mean the particular underlying treaty is not.  Indeed, we have held that a number of the \xe2\x80\x9cFriendship, Commerce, and Navigation\xe2\x80\x9d Treaties cited by the dissent, see <em>post, </em>Appendix B, are self-executing\xe2\x80\x94based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe language of the[se] Treat[ies].\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc., supra</em>, at 180, 189\xe2\x80\x93190.  In <em>Kolovrat</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/187/index.html">366 U. S. 187</a>, 191, 196 (1961), for example, the Court found that Yugoslavian claimants denied inheritance under Oregon law were entitled to inherit personal property pursuant to an 1881 Treaty of Friendship, Navigation, and Commerce between the United States and Serbia.  See also <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/503/index.html">331 U. S. 503</a>, 507\xe2\x80\x93511, 517\xe2\x80\x93518 (1947) (finding that the right to inherit real property granted German aliens under the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular Rights with Germany prevailed over California law).  Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <em>post</em>, at 11, neither our approach nor our cases require that a treaty provide for self-execution in so many talismanic words; that is a caricature of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  Our cases simply require courts to decide whether a treaty\xe2\x80\x99s terms reflect a determination by the President who negotiated it and the Senate that confirmed it that the treaty has domestic effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, Congress is up to the task of implementing non-self-executing treaties, even those involving complex commercial disputes.  Cf. <em>post,</em> at 24 (Breyer,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  The judgments of a number of international tribunals enjoy a different status because of implementing legislation enacted by Congress.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 22 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71650a(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the [Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes] shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States.

But Medell\xc3\xadn does not ask us to enforce a foreign-court judgment settling a typical commercial or property dispute.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hilton</em> v. <em>Guyot</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/159/113/index.html">159 U.

Rather, Medell\xc3\xadn argues that the <em>Avena</em> judgment has the effect of enjoining the operation of state law.  What is more, on Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s view, the judgment would force the State to take action to \xe2\x80\x9creview and reconside[r]\xe2\x80\x9d his case.  The general rule, however, is that judgments of foreign courts awarding injunctive relief, even as to private parties, let alone sovereign States, \xe2\x80\x9care not generally entitled to enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 2 Restatement \xc2\xa7481, Comment <em>b,</em> at 595.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, while the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Avena</em> creates an international law obligation on the part of the United States, it does not of its own force constitute binding federal law that pre-empts state restrictions on the filing of successive habeas petitions.  As we noted in <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, a contrary conclusion would be extraordinary, given that basic rights guaranteed by our own Constitution do not have the effect of displacing state procedural rules.  See 548 U. S., at 360.  Nothing in the text, background, negotiating and drafting history, or practice among signatory nations suggests that the President or Senate intended the improbable result of giving the judgments of an international tribunal a higher status than that enjoyed by \xe2\x80\x9cmany of our most fundamental constitutional protections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn next argues that the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in Avena</em> is binding on state courts by virtue of the President\xe2\x80\x99s February 28, 2005 Memorandum.

First, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U. S., at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Second, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 637.  In this circumstance, Presidential authority can derive support from \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional inertia, indifference or quiescence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Finally, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court can sustain his actions \xe2\x80\x9conly by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 637\xe2\x80\x93638.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States marshals two principal arguments in favor of the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority \xe2\x80\x9cto establish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 5.  The Solicitor General first argues that the relevant treaties give the President the authority to implement the <em>Avena</em> judgment and that Congress has acquiesced in the exercise of such authority.  The United States also relies upon an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d international dispute-resolution power wholly apart from the asserted authority based on the pertinent treaties.  Medell\xc3\xadn adds the additional argument that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is a valid exercise of his power to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States maintains that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is authorized by the Optional Protocol and the U.\xc2\xa0N.

That is, because the relevant treaties \xe2\x80\x9ccreate an obligation to comply with <em>Avena</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d they \xe2\x80\x9c<em>implicitly</em> give the President authority to implement that treaty-based obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 11 (emphasis added).  As a result, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is well grounded in the first category of the <em>Youngstown</em> framework.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree.  The President has an array of political and diplomatic means available to enforce international obligations, but unilaterally converting a non-self-executing treaty into a self-executing one is not among them.  The responsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress.  <em>Foster</em>, 2 Pet., at 315; <em>Whitney</em>, 124 U. S., at 194; <em>Igart\xc3\xbaa-De La Rosa</em>, 417 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 150.  As this Court has explained, when treaty stipulations are \xe2\x80\x9cnot self-executing they can only be enforced pursuant to legislation to carry them into effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitney, supra</em>, at 194.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ntil such act shall be passed, the Court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster, supra</em>, at 315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The requirement that Congress, rather than the President, implement a non-self-executing treaty derives from the text of the Constitution, which divides the treaty-making power between the President and the Senate.  The Constitution vests the President with the authority to \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d a treaty.  Art. II, \xc2\xa72.  If the Executive determines that a treaty should have domestic effect of its own force, that determination may be implemented \xe2\x80\x9cin mak[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the treaty, by ensuring that it contains language plainly providing for domestic enforceability.  If the treaty is to be self-executing in this respect, the Senate must consent to the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, <em>ibid.,</em> consistent with all other constitutional restraints.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once a treaty is ratified without provisions clearly according it domestic effect, however, whether the treaty will ever have such effect is governed by the fundamental constitutional principle that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he power to make the necessary laws is in Congress; the power to execute in the President.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hamdan </em>v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/557/index.html">548 U.

I, \xc2\xa71 (\xe2\x80\x9cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  As already noted, the terms of a non-self-executing treaty can become domestic law only in the same way as any other law\xe2\x80\x94through passage of legislation by both Houses of Congress, combined with either the President\xe2\x80\x99s signature or a congressional override of a Presidential veto.  See Art. I, \xc2\xa77.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe President\xe2\x80\x99s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U. S., at 587.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A non-self-executing treaty, by definition, is one that was ratified with the understanding that it is not to have domestic effect of its own force.  That understanding precludes the assertion that Congress has implicitly authorized the President\xe2\x80\x94acting on his own\xe2\x80\x94to achieve precisely the same result.  We therefore conclude, given the absence of congressional legislation, that the non-self-executing treaties at issue here did not \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[ly] or implied[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d vest the President with the unilateral authority to make them self-executing.  See <em>id.,</em> at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Accordingly, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum does not fall within the first category of the <em>Youngstown</em> framework.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the preceding discussion should make clear that the non-self-executing character of the relevant treaties not only refutes the notion that the ratifying parties vested the President with the authority to unilaterally make treaty obligations binding on domestic courts, but also implicitly prohibits him from doing so.  When the President asserts the power to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d a non-self-executing treaty by unilaterally creating domestic law, he acts in conflict with the implicit understanding of the ratifying Senate.  His assertion of authority, insofar as it is based on the pertinent non-self-executing treaties, is therefore within Justice Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s third category, not the first or even the second.  See <em>id.,</em> at 637\xe2\x80\x93638.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each of the two means described above for giving domestic effect to an international treaty obligation under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94for making law\xe2\x80\x94requires joint action by the Executive and Legislative Branches: The Senate can ratify a self-executing treaty \xe2\x80\x9cma[de]\xe2\x80\x9d by the Executive, or, if the ratified treaty is not self-executing, Congress can enact implementing legislation approved by the President.  It should not be surprising that our Constitution does not contemplate vesting such power in the Executive alone.<font b="1">  As Madison explained in The Federalist No. 47, under our constitutional system of checks and balances, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a law.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Cooke ed., p. 326 (1961).

Under the <em>Youngstown </em>tripartite<em> </em>framework, congressional acquiescence is pertinent when the President\xe2\x80\x99s action falls within the second category\xe2\x80\x94that is, when he \xe2\x80\x9cacts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  343 U. S., at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Here, however, as we have explained, the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort to accord domestic effect to the <em>Avena </em>judgment does not meet that prerequisite.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, even if we were persuaded that congressional acquiescence could support the President\xe2\x80\x99s asserted authority to create domestic law pursuant to a non-self-executing treaty, such acquiescence does not exist here.  The United States first locates congressional acquiescence in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act following the President\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of prior ICJ controversies.  A review of the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s actions in those prior cases, however, cannot support the claim that Congress acquiesced in this particular exercise of Presidential authority, for none of them remotely involved transforming an international obligation into domestic law and thereby displacing state law.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States also directs us to the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelated\xe2\x80\x9d statutory responsibilities and to his \xe2\x80\x9cestablished role\xe2\x80\x9d in litigating foreign policy concerns as support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s asserted authority to give the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Avena </em>the force of domestic law.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9319.  Congress has indeed authorized the President to represent the United States before the United Nations, the ICJ, and the Security Council, 22 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7287, but the authority of the President to represent the United States before such bodies speaks to the President\xe2\x80\x99s <em>international</em> responsibilities, not any unilateral authority to create domestic law.  The authority expressly conferred by Congress in the international realm cannot be said to \xe2\x80\x9cinvite\xe2\x80\x9d the Presidential action at issue here.  See <em>Youngstown, supra</em>, at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring).  At bottom, none of the sources of authority identified by the United States supports the President\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Congress has acquiesced in his asserted power to establish on his own federal law or to override state law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of this is to say, however, that the combination of a non-self-executing treaty and the lack of implementing legislation precludes the President from acting to comply with an international treaty obligation.  It is only to say that the Executive cannot unilaterally execute a non-self-executing treaty by giving it domestic effect.  That is, the non-self-executing character of a treaty constrains the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to comply with treaty commitments by unilaterally making the treaty binding on domestic courts.  The President may comply with the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s obligations by some other means, so long as they are consistent with the Constitution.  But he may not rely upon a non-self-executing treaty to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 5.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We thus turn to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 claim that\xe2\x80\x94independent of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 treaty obligations\xe2\x80\x94the Memorandum is a valid exercise of the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign affairs authority to resolve claims disputes with foreign nations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9316.

Rather than relying on the United States\xe2\x80\x99 treaty obligations, the President relies on an independent source of authority in ordering Texas to put aside its procedural bar to successive habeas petitions.  Nevertheless, we find that our claims-settlement cases do not support the authority that the President asserts in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The claims-settlement cases involve a narrow set of circumstances: the making of executive agreements to settle civil claims between American citizens and foreign governments or foreign nationals.

See Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus in <em>Ex parte Medell\xc3\xadn</em>, No. 675430\xe2\x80\x93A (Tex. Crim. App.), pp. 25\xe2\x80\x9331.  In light of our disposition of this case, we need not consider whether Medell\xc3\xadn was prejudiced in any way by the violation of his Vienna Convention rights.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The label \xe2\x80\x9cself-executing\xe2\x80\x9d has on occasion been used to convey different meanings.  What we mean by \xe2\x80\x9cself-executing\xe2\x80\x9d is that the treaty has automatic domestic effect as federal law upon ratification.  Conversely, a \xe2\x80\x9cnon-self-executing\xe2\x80\x9d treaty does not by itself give rise to domestically enforceable federal law.  Whether such a treaty has domestic effect depends upon implementing legislation passed by Congress.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Even when treaties are self-executing in the sense that they create federal law, the background presumption is that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nternational agreements, even those directly benefiting private persons, generally do not create private rights or provide for a private cause of action in domestic courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa7907, Comment <em>a, </em>p. 395 (1986) (hereinafter Restatement).

It is not clear whether that principle would apply when the question is the binding force of ICJ judgments themselves, rather than the substantive scope of a treaty the ICJ must interpret in resolving disputes.

Even the ICJ experts do not cite a case so holding, and Moroccan practice is at best inconsistent, for at least one local Moroccan court has held that ICJ judgments are not binding as a matter of municipal law.

We agree.  The questions here are the far more limited ones of whether he may unilaterally create federal law by giving effect to the judgment of this international tribunal pursuant to this non-self-executing treaty, and, if not, whether he may rely on other authority under the Constitution to support the action taken in this particular case.  Those are the only questions we decide.</p>\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Rather, in the <em>Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua</em> (<em>Nicar.</em> v. <em>U.

In response, the State Department sent letters to the States \xe2\x80\x9cencouraging\xe2\x80\x9d them to consider the Vienna Convention in the clemency process.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Such encouragement did not give the ICJ judgment direct effect as domestic law; thus, it cannot serve as precedent for doing so in which Congress might be said to have acquiesced.  In the <em>Case Concerning the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations </em>(<em>Para.</em> v. <em>U.

I agree that the text and history of the Supremacy Clause, as well as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s treaty-related cases, do not support a presumption against self-execution.  See <em>post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9310. <em> </em>I also endorse the proposition that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 77, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 6820, \xe2\x80\x9cis itself self-executing and judicially enforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 19.  Moreover, I think this case presents a closer question than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion allows.  In the end, however, I am persuaded that the relevant treaties do not authorize this Court to enforce the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in <em>Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals </em>(<em>Mex. </em>v. <em>U. S.</em>), 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (<em>Avena</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The source of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 obligation to comply with judgments of the ICJ is found in Article 94(1) of the United Nations Charter, which was ratified in 1945.  Article 94(1) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach Member of the United Nations <em>undertakes to comply</em> with the decision of the [ICJ] in any case to which it is a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  59 Stat. 1051, T.\xc2\xa0S. No. 993 (emphasis added).  In my view, the words \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94while not the model of either a self-executing or a non-self-executing commitment\xe2\x80\x94are most naturally read as a promise to take additional steps to enforce ICJ judgments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the text of some other treaties, the terms of the United Nations Charter do not necessarily incorporate international judgments into domestic law.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Annex VI, Art. 39, Dec. 10, 1982, S. Treaty Doc. No. 103\xe2\x80\x9339, 1833 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 570 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]ecisions of the [Seabed Disputes] Chamber shall be enforceable in the territories of the States Parties in the same manner as judgments or orders of the highest court of the State Party in whose territory the enforcement is sought\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, Congress has passed implementing legislation to ensure the enforcement of other international judgments, even when the operative treaty provisions use far more mandatory language than \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand Article 94(1) does not contain the kind of unambiguous language foreclosing self-execution that is found in other treaties.  The obligation to undertake to comply with ICJ decisions is more consistent with self-execution than, for example, an obligation to enact legislation.  Cf., <em>e.g.,</em> International Plant Protection Convention, Art. I, Dec. 6, 1951, [1972] 23 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 2770, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 7465 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he contracting Governments undertake to adopt the legislative, technical and administrative measures specified in this Convention\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, whereas the Senate has issued declarations of non-self-execution when ratifying some treaties, it did not do so with respect to the United Nations Charter.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Absent a presumption one way or the other, the best reading of the words \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply\xe2\x80\x9d is, in my judgment, one that contemplates future action by the political branches.  I agree with the dissenters that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is unlikely to authorize automatic judicial enforceability of <em>all </em>ICJ judgments, for that could include some politically sensitive judgments and others better suited for enforcement by other branches.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 24.  But this concern counsels in favor of reading any ambiguity in Article 94(1) as leaving the choice of whether to comply with ICJ judgments, and in what manner, \xe2\x80\x9cto the political, not the judicial department.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster</em> v. <em>Neilson</em>, 2 Pet. 253, 314 (1829).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The additional treaty provisions cited by the dissent do not suggest otherwise.  In an annex to the United Nations Charter, the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute) states that a decision of the ICJ \xe2\x80\x9chas no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062.  Because I read that provision as confining, not expanding, the effect of ICJ judgments, it does not make the undertaking to comply with such judgments any more enforceable than the terms of Article 94(1) itself.  That the judgment is \xe2\x80\x9cbinding\xe2\x80\x9d as a matter of international law says nothing about its domestic legal effect.  Nor in my opinion does the reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes to the Vienna Convention, Art. I, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 325, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 6820, shed any light on the matter.  This provision merely secures the consent of signatory nations to the specific jurisdiction of the ICJ with respect to claims arising out of the Vienna Convention.  See ICJ Statute, Art. 36(1), 59 Stat. 1060 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe jurisdiction of the Court comprises . . . all matters specially provided for . . . in treaties and conventions in force\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even though the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Avena</em> is not \xe2\x80\x9cthe supreme Law of the Land,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl. 2, no one disputes that it constitutes an international law obligation on the part of the United States.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  By issuing a memorandum declaring that state courts should give effect to the judgment in <em>Avena</em>,<em> </em>the President made a commendable attempt to induce the States to discharge the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s obligation.  I agree with the Texas judges and the majority of this Court that the President\xe2\x80\x99s memorandum is not binding law.  Nonetheless, the fact that the President cannot legislate unilaterally does not absolve the United States from its promise to take action necessary to comply with the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the express terms of the Supremacy Clause, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 obligation to \xe2\x80\x9cundertak[e] to comply\xe2\x80\x9d with the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision falls on each of the States as well as the Federal Government.  One consequence of our form of government is that sometimes States must shoulder the primary responsibility for protecting the honor and integrity of the Nation.  Texas\xe2\x80\x99 duty in this respect is all the greater since it was Texas that\xe2\x80\x94by failing to provide consular notice in accordance with the Vienna Convention\xe2\x80\x94ensnared the United States in the current controversy.  Having already put the Nation in breach of one treaty, it is now up to Texas to prevent the breach of another.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decision in <em>Avena</em> merely obligates the United States \xe2\x80\x9cto provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the [affected] Mexican nationals,\xe2\x80\x9d 2004 I.

Under these circumstances, I believe the treaty obligations, and hence the judgment, resting as it does upon the consent of the United States to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, bind the courts no less than would \xe2\x80\x9can act of the [federal] legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 314.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand the issue before us, the reader must keep in mind three separate ratified United States treaties and one ICJ judgment against the United States.  The first treaty, the Vienna Convention, contains two relevant provisions.  The first requires the United States and other signatory nations to inform arrested foreign nationals of their separate Convention-given right to contact their nation\xe2\x80\x99s consul.

No. 6820 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second treaty, the Optional Protocol, concerns the \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory settlement\xe2\x80\x9d of Vienna Convention disputes.  21 U. S. T., at 326.  It provides that for parties that elect to subscribe to the Protocol, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the [Vienna] Convention\xe2\x80\x9d shall be submitted to the \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, <em>ibid.</em>  It authorizes any party that has consented to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction (by signing the Optional Protocol) to bring another such party before that Court.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third treaty, the United Nations Charter, says that every signatory Nation \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice in any case to which it is a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 94(1), 59 Stat. 1051.  In an annex to the Charter, the Statute of the International Court of Justice states that an ICJ judgment has \xe2\x80\x9cbinding force \xe2\x80\xa6 between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 59,<em> id.,</em> at 1062.  See also Art. 60, <em>id.,</em> at 1063 (ICJ \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment is final and without appeal\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment at issue is the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Avena, </em>a case that Mexico brought against the United States on behalf of 52 nationals arrested in different States on different criminal charges. 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J., at 39.  Mexico claimed that state authorities within the United States had failed to notify the arrested persons of their Vienna Convention rights and, by applying state procedural law in a manner which did not give full effect to the Vienna Convention rights, had deprived them of an appropriate remedy.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The ICJ judgment in <em>Avena</em> requires that the United States reexamine \xe2\x80\x9cby means of its own choosing\xe2\x80\x9d certain aspects of the relevant state criminal proceedings of 51 of these individual Mexican nationals.  <em>Id.,</em> at 62.  The President has determined that this should be done.  See President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The critical question here is whether the Supremacy Clause requires Texas to follow, <em>i.e.</em>, to enforce, this ICJ judgment.  The Court says \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it reaches its negative answer by interpreting the labyrinth of treaty provisions as creating a legal obligation that binds the United States internationally, but which, for Supremacy Clause purposes, is not automatically enforceable as domestic law.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Optional Protocol simply sends the dispute to the ICJ; the ICJ statute says that the ICJ will subsequently reach a judgment; and the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter contains no more than a promise to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98undertak[e] to comply\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with that judgment.  <em>Ante,</em> at 3.  Such a promise, the majority says, does not as a domestic law matter (in Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s words) \xe2\x80\x9coperat[e] of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster</em>, 2 Pet., at 314.  Rather, here (and presumably in any other ICJ judgment rendered pursuant to any of the approximately 70 U. S. treaties in force that contain similar provisions for submitting treaty-based disputes to the ICJ for decisions that bind the parties) Congress must enact specific legislation before ICJ judgments entered pursuant to our consent to compulsory ICJ jurisdiction can become domestic law.  See Brief for International Court of Justice Experts as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 18 (\xe2\x80\x9cApproximately 70 U. S. treaties now in force contain obligations comparable to those in the Optional Protocol for submission of treaty-based disputes to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id.,</em> at 18, n. 25.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the President has correctly determined that Congress need not enact additional legislation.  The majority places too much weight upon treaty language that says little about the matter.  The words \xe2\x80\x9cundertak[e] to comply,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, do not tell us whether an ICJ judgment rendered pursuant to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 consent to compulsory ICJ jurisdiction does, or does not, automatically become part of our domestic law.  To answer that question we must look instead to our own domestic law, in particular, to the many treaty-related cases interpreting the Supremacy Clause.  Those cases, including some written by Justices well aware of the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 original intent, lead to the conclusion that the ICJ judgment before us is enforceable as a matter of domestic law without further legislation.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Supreme Court case law stretching back more than 200 years helps explain what, for present purposes, the Founders meant when they wrote that \xe2\x80\x9call Treaties \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl.\xc2\xa02.  In 1796, for example, the Court decided the case of <em>Ware</em> v. <em>Hylton</em>, 3 Dall. 199.  A British creditor sought payment of an American\xe2\x80\x99s Revolutionary War debt.  The debtor argued that he had, under Virginia law, repaid the debt by complying with a state statute enacted during the Revolutionary War that required debtors to repay money owed to British creditors into a Virginia state fund.  <em>Id.,</em> at 220\xe2\x80\x93221 (opinion of Chase, J.).  The creditor, however, claimed that this state-sanctioned repayment did not count because a provision of the 1783 Paris Peace Treaty between Britain and the United States said that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the creditors of either side should meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value \xe2\x80\xa6 of all <em>bona fide </em>debts, theretofore contracted\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; and that provision, the creditor argued, effectively nullified the state law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 203\xe2\x80\x93204.<font b="1">  The Court, with each Justice writing separately, agreed with the British creditor, held the Virginia statute invalid, and found that the American debtor remained liable for the debt.  <em>Id.,</em> at 285.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The key fact relevant here is that Congress had not enacted a specific statute enforcing the treaty provision at issue.  Hence the Court had to decide whether the provision was (to put the matter in present terms) \xe2\x80\x9cself-executing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Justice Iredell, a member of North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Ratifying Convention, addressed the matter specifically, setting forth views on which Justice Story later relied to explain the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 reasons for drafting the Supremacy Clause.  3 J.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1955 (1999).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Iredell pointed out that some Treaty provisions, those, for example, declaring the United States an independent Nation or acknowledging its right to navigate the Mississippi River, were \xe2\x80\x9c<em>executed</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d taking effect automatically upon ratification.  3 Dall.<em>,</em> at 272.  Other provisions were \xe2\x80\x9cexecutory,\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that they were \xe2\x80\x9cto be carried into execution\xe2\x80\x9d by each signatory nation \xe2\x80\x9cin the manner which the Constitution of that nation prescribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> <em>Before</em> adoption of the U. S. Constitution, all such provisions would have taken effect as domestic law <em>only if </em>Congress on the American side, or Parliament on the British side, had written them into domestic law.  <em>Id.,</em> at 274\xe2\x80\x93277.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But, Justice Iredell adds, <em>after </em>the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s adoption, while further parliamentary action remained necessary in Britain (where the \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d of the need for an \xe2\x80\x9cact of parliament\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to \xe2\x80\x9cany thing of a legislative nature\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9cbeen constantly observed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 275\xe2\x80\x93276), further legislative action in respect to the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s debt-collection provision <em>was no longer necessary</em> in the United States.  <em>Id.,</em> at 276\xe2\x80\x93277.  The ratification of the Constitution with its Supremacy Clause means that treaty provisions that bind the United States may (and in this instance did) also enter domestic law without further congressional action and automatically bind the States and courts as well.  <em>Id.,</em> at 277.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cUnder this Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Iredell concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cso far as a treaty constitutionally is binding, upon principles of <em>moral obligation,</em> it is also by the vigour of its own authority to be executed in fact.  It would not otherwise be the <em>Supreme law</em> in the new sense provided for.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ibid.;</em> see also Story, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa71833, at 697 (noting that the Supremacy Clause\xe2\x80\x99s language was crafted to make the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cobligation more strongly felt by the state judges\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cremov[e] every pretense\xe2\x80\x9d by which they could \xe2\x80\x9cescape from [its] controlling power\xe2\x80\x9d); see also The Federalist No. 42, p.\xc2\xa0264 (C.

Justice Iredell gave examples of provisions that would no longer require further legislative action, such as those requiring the release of prisoners, those forbidding war-related \xe2\x80\x9cfuture confiscations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prosecutions,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and, of course, the specific debt-collection provision at issue in the <em>Ware </em>case itself.  3 Dall., at 273, 277.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some 30 years later, the Court returned to the \xe2\x80\x9cself-execution\xe2\x80\x9d problem.  In <em>Foster</em>, 2 Pet. 253, the Court examined a provision in an 1819 treaty with Spain ceding Florida to the United States; the provision said that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98grants of land made\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by Spain before January 24, 1818, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall be ratified and confirmed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the grantee.  <em>Id.,</em> at 310.  Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, noted that, as a general matter, one might expect a signatory nation to execute a treaty through a formal exercise of its domestic sovereign authority (<em>e.g.</em>, through an act of the legislature).  <em>Id.,</em> at 314.  But in the United States <em>\xe2\x80\x9ca different principle\xe2\x80\x9d </em>applies.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  The Supremacy Clause means that, here, a treaty is \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of the land \xe2\x80\xa6 to be regarded in Courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coperates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision\xe2\x80\x9d unless<em> </em>it specifically contemplates execution by the legislature and thereby<em> \xe2\x80\x9caddresses itself to the political, not the judicial department</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).  The Court decided that the treaty provision in question was <em>not </em>self-executing; in its view, the words \xe2\x80\x9cshall be ratified\xe2\x80\x9d demonstrated that the provision foresaw further legislative action.  <em>Id.,</em> at 315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, changed its mind about the result in <em>Foster</em> four years later, after being shown a less legislatively oriented, less tentative, but equally authentic Spanish-language version of the treaty.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Percheman</em>, 7 Pet. 51, 88\xe2\x80\x9389 (1833).  And by 1840, instances in which treaty provisions automatically became part of domestic law were common enough for one Justice to write that \xe2\x80\x9cit would be a bold proposition\xe2\x80\x9d to assert \xe2\x80\x9cthat an act of Congress must be first passed\xe2\x80\x9d in order to give a treaty effect as \xe2\x80\x9ca supreme law of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lessee of Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s Heirs</em> v. <em>Kibbe</em>, 14 Pet. 353, 388 (1840) (Baldwin, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since <em>Foster </em>and <em>Pollard, </em>this Court has frequently held or assumed that particular treaty provisions are self-executing, automatically binding the States without more.  See Appendix A, <em>infra</em> (listing, as examples, 29 such cases, including 12 concluding that the treaty provision invalidates state or territorial law or policy as a consequence).  See also Wu, Treaties\xe2\x80\x99 Domains, 93 Va.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 571, 583\xe2\x80\x93584 (2007) (concluding \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement against States is the primary and historically most significant type of treaty enforcement in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  As far as I can tell, the Court has held to the contrary only in two cases: <em>Foster</em>, <em>supra</em>, which was later reversed, and <em>Cameron Septic Tank Co.</em> v. <em>Knoxville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/227/39/index.html">227 U. S. 39</a> (1913), where specific congressional actions indicated that Congress thought further legislation necessary<em>.  </em>See also V\xc3\xa1zquez 716.  The Court has found \xe2\x80\x9cself-executing\xe2\x80\x9d provisions in multilateral treaties as well as bilateral treaties.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Franklin Mint Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/243/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/243/index.html">466 U.

See <em>Comegys</em> v. <em>Vasse</em>, 1 Pet. 193, 211\xe2\x80\x93212 (1828) (holding that decision of tribunal rendered pursuant to a United States-Spain treaty, which obliged the parties to \xe2\x80\x9cundertake to make satisfaction\xe2\x80\x9d of treaty-based rights, was \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive and final\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot re-examinable\xe2\x80\x9d in American courts); see also <em>Meade</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 9 Wall. 691, 725 (1870) (holding that decision of tribunal adjudicating claims arising under United States-Spain treaty \xe2\x80\x9cwas final and conclusive, and bar[red] a recovery upon the merits\xe2\x80\x9d in American court). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All of these cases make clear that self-executing treaty provisions are not uncommon or peculiar creatures of our domestic law; that they cover a wide range of subjects; that the Supremacy Clause itself answers the self-execution question by applying many, but not all, treaty provisions directly to the States; and that the Clause answers the self-execution question differently than does the law in many other nations.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x939.  The cases also provide criteria that help determine <em>which </em>provisions automatically so apply\xe2\x80\x94a matter to which I now turn.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case law provides no simple magic answer to the question whether a particular treaty provision is self-executing.  But the case law does make clear that, insofar as today\xe2\x80\x99s majority looks for language about \xe2\x80\x9cself-execution\xe2\x80\x9d in the treaty itself and insofar as it erects \xe2\x80\x9cclear statement\xe2\x80\x9d presumptions designed to help find an answer, it is misguided.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 21 (expecting \xe2\x80\x9cclea[r] state[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d of parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent where treaty obligation \xe2\x80\x9cmay interfere with state procedural rules\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante,</em> at 30 (for treaty to be self-executing, Executive should at drafting \xe2\x80\x9censur[e] that it contains language plainly providing for domestic enforceability\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The many treaty provisions that this Court has found self-executing contain no textual language on the point (see Appendix A, <em>infra</em>).  Few, if any, of these provisions are clear.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ware</em>, 3 Dall., at 273 (opinion of Iredell, J.).  Those that displace state law in respect to such quintessential state matters as, say, property, inheritance, or debt repayment, lack the \xe2\x80\x9cclea[r] state[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court today apparently requires.  Compare <em>ante</em>, at\xc2\xa021 (majority expects \xe2\x80\x9cclea[r] state[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d of parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent where treaty obligation \xe2\x80\x9cmay interfere with state procedural rules\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is also true of those cases that deal with state rules roughly comparable to the sort that the majority suggests require special accommodation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hopkirk</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, 3 Cranch 454, 457\xe2\x80\x93458 (1806) (treaty pre-empts Virginia state statute of limitations).  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 21 (setting forth majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on case law that is apparently inapposite).  These many Supreme Court cases finding treaty provisions to be self-executing cannot be reconciled with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s demand for textual clarity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the majority does not point to a single ratified United States treaty that contains the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cclea[r]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cplai[n]\xe2\x80\x9d textual indication for which the majority searches.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21, 30.  Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 reliance upon one ratified and one <em>un-</em>ratified treaty to make the point that a treaty <em>could </em>speak clearly on the matter of self-execution, see <em>ante</em>, at 2 and n. 1, does suggest that there are a few such treaties.  But that simply highlights how few of them actually <em>do </em>speak clearly on the matter.  And that is not because the United States never, or hardly ever, has entered into a treaty with self-executing provisions.  The case law belies any such conclusion.  Rather, it is because the issue whether further legislative action is required before a treaty provision takes domestic effect in a signatory nation is often a matter of how that Nation\xe2\x80\x99s domestic law regards the provision\xe2\x80\x99s legal status.  And that domestic status-determining law differs markedly from one nation to another.  See generally Hollis, Comparative Approach to Treaty Law and Practice, in National Treaty Law and Practice 1, 9\xe2\x80\x9350 (D. Hollis, M. Blakeslee, &amp; L. Ederington eds. 2005) (hereinafter Hollis).  As Justice Iredell pointed out 200 years ago, Britain, for example, taking the view that the British Crown makes treaties but Parliament makes domestic law, virtually always requires parliamentary legislation.  See <em>Ware</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 274\xe2\x80\x93277; Sinclair, Dickson, &amp; Maciver, United Kingdom, in National Treaty Law and Practice, <em>supra,</em> at 727, 733, and n. 9 (citing <em>Queen </em>v.<em> Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Lord Rees-Mogg,</em> [1994] Q.\xc2\xa0B. 552 (1993) (in Britain, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98treaties are not self-executing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d)).  See also Torruella, The <em>Insular Cases</em>: The Establishment of a Regime of Political Apartheid, 29 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 283, 337 (2007).  On the other hand, the United States, with its Supremacy Clause, does not take Britain\xe2\x80\x99s view.  See, <em>e.g., Ware, supra</em>, at 277 (opinion of Iredell, J.).  And the law of other nations, the Netherlands for example, directly incorporates many treaties concluded by the executive into its domestic law even without explicit parliamentary approval of the treaty.  See Brouwer, The Netherlands, in National Treaty Law and Practice, <em>supra,</em> at 483, 483\xe2\x80\x93502.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority correctly notes that the treaties do not explicitly state that the relevant obligations are self-executing.  But given the differences among nations, why would drafters write treaty language stating that a provision about, say, alien property inheritance, is self-executing?  How could those drafters achieve agreement when one signatory nation follows one tradition and a second follows another?  Why would such a difference matter sufficiently for drafters to try to secure language that would prevent, for example, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s following treaty ratification with a further law while (perhaps unnecessarily) insisting that the United States apply a treaty provision without further domestic legislation?  Above all, what does the absence of specific language about \xe2\x80\x9cself-execution\xe2\x80\x9d prove?  It may reflect the drafters\xe2\x80\x99 awareness of national differences.  It may reflect the practical fact that drafters, favoring speedy, effective implementation, conclude they should best leave national legal practices alone.  It may reflect the fact that achieving international agreement on <em>this </em>point is simply a game not worth the candle.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a word, for present purposes, the absence or presence of language in a treaty about a provision\xe2\x80\x99s self-execution proves nothing at all.  At best the Court is hunting the snark.  At worst it erects legalistic hurdles that can threaten the application of provisions in many existing commercial and other treaties and make it more difficult to negotiate new ones.  (For examples, see Appendix B, <em>infra</em>.)</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case law also suggests practical, context-specific criteria that this Court has previously used to help determine whether, for Supremacy Clause purposes, a treaty provision is self-executing.  The provision\xe2\x80\x99s text matters very much. Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9319.  But that is not because it contains language that explicitly refers to self-execution.  For reasons I have already explained, Part I\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x931, <em>supra</em>, one should not expect <em>that </em>kind of textual statement.  Drafting history is also relevant.  But, again, that is not because it will explicitly address the relevant question.  Instead text and history, along with subject matter and related characteristics will help our courts determine whether, as Chief Justice Marshall put it, the treaty provision \xe2\x80\x9caddresses itself to the political\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 department[s]\xe2\x80\x9d for further action or to \xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial department\xe2\x80\x9d for direct enforcement.  <em>Foster</em>, 2 Pet., at 314; see also <em>Ware</em>, 3 Dall., at 244 (opinion of Chase, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo one can doubt that a treaty may stipulate, that certain acts shall be done by the Legislature; that other acts shall be done by the Executive; and others by the Judiciary\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In making this determination, this Court has found the provision\xe2\x80\x99s subject matter of particular importance.  Does the treaty provision declare peace?  Does it promise not to engage in hostilities?  If so, it addresses itself to the political branches.  See <em>id.,</em> at 259\xe2\x80\x93262 (opinion of Iredell, J.).  Alternatively, does it concern the adjudication of traditional private legal rights such as rights to own property, to conduct a business, or to obtain civil tort recovery?  If so, it may well address itself to the Judiciary.  Enforcing such rights and setting their boundaries is the bread-and-butter work of the courts.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/503/index.html"></a><a href="/us/331/503/index.html">331 U. S. 503</a> (1947) (treating provision with such subject matter as self-executing); <em>Asakura</em> v. <em>Seattle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/265/332/index.html"></a><a href="/us/265/332/index.html">265 U. S. 332</a> (1924) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One might also ask whether the treaty provision confers specific, detailed individual legal rights.  Does it set forth definite standards that judges can readily enforce?  Other things being equal, where rights are specific and readily enforceable, the treaty provision more likely \xe2\x80\x9caddresses\xe2\x80\x9d the judiciary.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Olympic Airways</em> v. <em>Husain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/644/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/644/index.html">540 U. S. 644</a> (2004) (specific conditions for air-carrier civil liability); <em>Geofroy</em> v. <em>Riggs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/133/258/index.html"></a><a href="/us/133/258/index.html">133 U. S. 258</a> (1890) (French citizens\xe2\x80\x99 inheritance rights).  Compare <em>Foster, supra</em>,\nat 314\xe2\x80\x93315<em> </em>(treaty provision stating that landholders\xe2\x80\x99 titles \xe2\x80\x9cshall be ratified and confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d foresees legislative\naction).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alternatively, would direct enforcement require the courts to create a new cause of action?  Would such enforcement engender constitutional controversy?  Would it create constitutionally undesirable conflict with the other branches?  In such circumstances, it is not likely that the provision contemplates direct judicial enforcement.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Asakura, supra</em>, at 341 (although \xe2\x80\x9cnot limited by any express provision of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d the treaty-making power of the United States \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not extend \xe2\x80\x98so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such questions, drawn from case law stretching back 200 years, do not create a simple test, let alone a magic formula.  But they do help to constitute a practical, context-specific judicial approach, seeking to separate run-of-the-mill judicial matters from other matters, sometimes more politically charged, sometimes more clearly the responsibility of other branches, sometimes lacking those attributes that would permit courts to act on their own without more ado.  And such an approach is all that we need to find an answer to the legal question now before us.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the approach just described, I would find the relevant treaty provisions self-executing as applied to the ICJ judgment before us (giving that judgment domestic legal effect) for the following reasons, taken together.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First, </em>the language of the relevant treaties strongly supports direct judicial enforceability, at least of judgments of the kind at issue here.  The Optional Protocol bears the title \xe2\x80\x9cCompulsory Settlement of Disputes,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby emphasizing the mandatory and binding nature of the procedures it sets forth.  21 U. S. T., at 326.  The body of the Protocol says specifically that \xe2\x80\x9cany party\xe2\x80\x9d that has consented to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d may bring a \xe2\x80\x9cdispute\xe2\x80\x9d before the court against any other such party.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, <em>ibid.  </em>And the Protocol contrasts proceedings of the compulsory kind with an alternative \xe2\x80\x9cconciliation procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d the recommendations of which a party may decide \xe2\x80\x9cnot\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9caccep[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. III, <em>id.,</em> at 327.  Thus, the Optional Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s basic objective is not just to provide a forum\nfor <em>settlement</em> but to provide a forum for <em>compulsory\n</em>settlement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, in accepting Article 94(1) of the Charter, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach Member \xe2\x80\xa6 undertakes to comply with the decision\xe2\x80\x9d of the ICJ \xe2\x80\x9cin any case to which it is a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  59 Stat. 1051.  And the ICJ Statute (part of the U. N. Charter) makes clear that, a decision of the ICJ between parties that have consented to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s compulsory jurisdiction has \xe2\x80\x9c<em>binding force</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 59, <em>id.,</em> at 1062\n(emphasis added).  Enforcement of a court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment\nthat has \xe2\x80\x9cbinding force\xe2\x80\x9d involves quintessential judicial\nactivity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0True, neither the Protocol nor the Charter explicitly states that the obligation to comply with an ICJ judgment automatically binds a party <em>as a matter of domestic law </em>without further domestic legislation.  <em>But</em> <em>how could the language of those documents do otherwise? </em> The treaties are multilateral.  And, as I have explained, some signatories follow British further-legislation-always-needed principles, others follow United States Supremacy Clause principles, and still others, <em>e.g.</em>, the Netherlands, can directly incorporate treaty provisions into their domestic law in particular circumstances.  See Hollis 9\xe2\x80\x9350.  Why, given national differences, would drafters, seeking as strong a legal obligation as is practically attainable, use treaty language that <em>requires </em>all signatories to adopt uniform domestic-law treatment in this respect?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of that likely unobtainable language can make no difference.  We are considering the language for purposes of applying the Supremacy Clause.  And for that purpose, this Court has found to be self-executing multilateral treaty language that is far less direct or forceful (on the relevant point) than the language set forth in the present treaties.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Trans World Airlines</em>, 466 U. S., at 247, 252; <em>Bacardi</em>, 311 U. S., at 160, and n.\xc2\xa09, 161.  The language here in effect tells signatory nations to make an ICJ compulsory jurisdiction judgment \xe2\x80\x9cas bind-\ning as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, assuming other factors favor\nself-execution, the language<em> adds, </em>rather than <em>subtracts</em>,<em>\n</em>support.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, as I have said, <em>supra</em>, at 4, the United States has ratified approximately 70 treaties with ICJ dispute resolution provisions roughly similar to those contained in the Optional Protocol; many of those treaties contemplate ICJ adjudication of the sort of substantive matters (property, commercial dealings, and the like) that the Court has found self-executing, or otherwise appear addressed to the judicial branch.  See Appendix B, <em>infra.</em>  None of the ICJ provisions in these treaties contains stronger language about self-execution than the language at issue here.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Denmark, Art. XXIV(2), Oct. 1, 1951, [1961] 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 935, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 4797 (\xe2\x80\x9cAny dispute between the Parties as to the interpretation or application of the present Treaty, not satisfactorily adjusted by diplomacy, shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice, unless the Parties agree to settlement by some other pacific means\xe2\x80\x9d).  In signing these treaties (in respect to, say, alien land ownership provisions) was the United States engaging in a near useless act?  Does the majority believe the drafters expected Congress to enact further legislation about, say, an alien\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance rights, decision by decision?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I recognize, as the majority emphasizes, that the U. N. Charter uses the words \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than, say, \xe2\x80\x9cshall comply\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmust comply.\xe2\x80\x9d  But what is inadequate about the word \xe2\x80\x9cundertak[e]\xe2\x80\x9d?  A leading contemporary dictionary defined it in terms of \xe2\x80\x9clay[ing] oneself under obligation \xe2\x80\xa6 to perform or to execute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2770 (2d ed. 1939).  And that definition is just what the equally authoritative Spanish version of the provision (familiar to Mexico) says directly: The words \xe2\x80\x9ccompromete a cumplir\xe2\x80\x9d indicate a present obligation to execute, without any tentativeness of the sort the majority finds in the English word \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Carta de las Naciones Unidas, Articulo 94, 59 Stat. 1175 (1945); Spanish and English Legal and Commercial Dictionary 44 (1945) (defining \xe2\x80\x9ccomprometer\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cbecome liable\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 59 (defining \xe2\x80\x9ccumplir\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto perform, discharge, carry out, execute\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Art. 111, 59 Stat. 1054 (Spanish-language version equally valid); <em>Percheman</em>, 7 Pet., at 88\xe2\x80\x9389 (looking to Spanish version of a treaty to clear up ambiguity in English version).

S. 449</a>, 453 (1930) (treating a treaty provision as self-executing even though it <em>expressly</em> stated what the majority says the word \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes\xe2\x80\x9d <em>implicitly </em>provides: that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he United States \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be at liberty to make respecting this matter, such laws as they think proper\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And even if I agreed with Justice Stevens that the language is perfectly ambiguous (which I do not), I could not agree that \xe2\x80\x9cthe best reading \xe2\x80\xa6 is \xe2\x80\xa6 one that contemplates future action by the political branches.\xe2\x80\x9d   <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  The consequence of such a reading is to place the fate of an international promise made by the United States in the hands of a single State.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936.  And that is precisely the situation that the Framers sought to prevent by enacting the Supremacy Clause.  See 3 Story 696 (purpose of Supremacy Clause \xe2\x80\x9cwas probably to obviate\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficulty\xe2\x80\x9d of system where treaties were \xe2\x80\x9cdependent upon the good will of the states for their execution\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Ware</em>, 3 Dall., at 277\xe2\x80\x93278 (opinion of Iredell, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I also recognize, as the majority emphasizes (<em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314), that the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter says that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f any party to a case fails to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the [ICJ], the other party may have recourse to the Security Council.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 94(2), 59 Stat. 1051.  And when the Senate ratified the charter, it took comfort in the fact that the United States has a veto in the Security Council.  See 92 Cong. Rec. 10694\xe2\x80\x9310695 (1946) (statements of Sens. Pepper and Connally).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what has that to do with the matter?  To begin with, the Senate would have been contemplating politically significant ICJ decisions, not, <em>e.g.</em>, the bread-and-butter commercial and other matters that are the typical subjects of self-executing treaty provisions.  And in any event, both the Senate debate and U. N. Charter provision discuss and describe what happens (or does not happen) when a nation decides <em>not </em>to carry out an ICJ decision.  See Charter of the United Nations for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security: Hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 286 (1945) (statement of Leo Pasvolsky, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for International Organization and Security Affairs) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the Court has rendered a judgment and one of the parties refuses to accept it, then the dispute becomes political rather than legal\xe2\x80\x9d).  The debates refer to remedies for a breach of our promise to carry out an ICJ decision.  The Senate understood, for example, that Congress (unlike legislatures in other nations that do not permit domestic legislation to trump treaty obligations, Hollis 47\xe2\x80\x9349) can block through legislation self-executing, as well as non-self-executing determinations.  The debates nowhere refer to the method we use for affirmatively carrying out an ICJ obligation that no political branch has decided to dishonor, still less to a decision that the President (without congressional dissent) seeks to enforce.  For that reason, these aspects of the ratification debates are here beside the point.  See <em>infra</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that treaty language says that an ICJ decision is legally binding, but it leaves the implementation of that binding legal obligation to the domestic law of each signatory nation.  In this Nation, the Supremacy Clause, as long and consistently interpreted, indicates that ICJ decisions rendered pursuant to provisions for binding adjudication must be domestically legally binding and enforceable in domestic courts <em>at least sometimes.</em>  And for purposes of this argument, that conclusion is all that I need.  The remainder of the discussion will explain why, if ICJ judgments <em>sometimes </em>bind domestic courts<em>, </em>then they have that effect here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second, </em>the Optional Protocol here applies to a dispute about the meaning of a Vienna Convention provision that is itself self-executing and judicially enforceable.  The Convention provision is about an individual\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crights,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, his right upon being arrested to be informed of his separate right to contact his nation\xe2\x80\x99s consul.  See Art. 36(1)(b), 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 101.  The provision language is precise.  The dispute arises at the intersection of an individual right with ordinary rules of criminal procedure; it consequently concerns the kind of matter with which judges are familiar.  The provisions contain judicially enforceable standards.  See Art. 36(2), <em>ibid.</em> (providing for exercise of rights \xe2\x80\x9cin conformity with the laws and regulations\xe2\x80\x9d of the arresting nation provided that the \xe2\x80\x9claws and regulations . . . enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this Article are intended\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the judgment itself requires a further hearing of a sort that is typically judicial.  See <em>infra</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has found similar treaty provisions self-executing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rauscher</em>, 119 U. S., at 410\xe2\x80\x93411, 429\xe2\x80\x93430 (violation of extradition treaty could be raised as defense in criminal trial); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Browne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/205/309/index.html"></a><a href="/us/205/309/index.html">205 U. S. 309</a>, 317\xe2\x80\x93322 (1907) (extradition treaty required grant of writ of habeas corpus); <em>Wildenhus\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 120 U. S., at 11, 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (treaty defined scope of state jurisdiction in a criminal case).  It is consequently not surprising that, when Congress ratified the Convention, the State Department reported that the \xe2\x80\x9cConvention is considered entirely self-executive and does not require any implementing or complementing legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Exec. Rep. No. 91\xe2\x80\x939, p.\xc2\xa05 (1969); see also <em>id.,</em> at 18 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that there are conflicts with Federal legislation or State laws the Vienna Convention, after ratification, would govern\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the Executive Branch has said in this Court that other, indistinguishable Vienna Convention provisions are self-executing. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, O. T. 2005, Nos. 05\xe2\x80\x9351 and 04\xe2\x80\x9310566, p.\xc2\xa014, n.\xc2\xa02; cf. <em>ante, </em>at 10, n.\xc2\xa04 (majority leaves question open).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third, </em>logic suggests that a treaty provision providing for \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbinding\xe2\x80\x9d judgments that \xe2\x80\x9csettl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d treaty-based disputes is self-executing insofar as the judgment in question concerns the meaning of an underlying treaty provision that is itself self-executing.  Imagine that two parties to a contract agree to binding arbitration about whether a contract provision\xe2\x80\x99s word \xe2\x80\x9cgrain\xe2\x80\x9d includes rye. They would expect that, if the arbitrator decides that the word \xe2\x80\x9cgrain\xe2\x80\x9d does include rye, the arbitrator will then simply read the relevant provision as if it said \xe2\x80\x9cgrain including rye.\xe2\x80\x9d  They would also expect the arbitrator to issue a binding award that embodies whatever relief would be appropriate under that circumstance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why treat differently the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to binding ICJ determination about, <em>e.g.</em>, the proper interpretation of the Vienna Convention clauses containing the rights here at issue?  Why not simply read the relevant Vienna Convention provisions as if (between the parties and in respect to the 51 individuals at issue) they contain words that encapsulate the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision?  See Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062 (ICJ decision has \xe2\x80\x9cbinding force \xe2\x80\xa6 between the parties and in respect of [the] particular case\xe2\x80\x9d).  Why would the ICJ judgment not bind in precisely the same way those words would bind if they appeared in the relevant Vienna Convention provisions\xe2\x80\x94just as the ICJ says, for purposes of this case, that they do?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To put the same point  differently: What sense would it make (1) to make a self-executing promise and (2) to promise to accept as final an ICJ judgment interpreting that self-executing promise, yet (3) to insist that the judgment itself is not self-executing (<em>i.e.</em>, that Congress must enact specific legislation to enforce it)?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I am not aware of any satisfactory answer to these questions.  It is no answer to point to the fact that in <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, 548 U. S. 331 (2006), this Court interpreted the relevant Convention provisions differently from the ICJ in <em>Avena</em>.<em> </em> This Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>interpretation binds our courts with respect to individuals whose rights were not espoused by a state party in <em>Avena</em>.  Moreover, as the Court itself recognizes, see <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, and as the President recognizes, see President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum, the question here is the very different question of applying the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Avena </em>judgment to the very parties whose interests Mexico and the United States espoused in the ICJ <em>Avena </em>proceeding.  It is in respect to these individuals that the United States has promised the ICJ decision will have binding force.  Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062.  See 1 Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa798 (1969); 2 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations \xc2\xa7481 (1986); 1 Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa717 (1980) (all calling for recognition of judgment rendered after fair hearing in a contested proceeding before a court with adjudicatory authority over the case).  See also 1 Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa7106 (\xe2\x80\x9cA judgment will be recognized and enforced in other states even though an error of fact or law was made in the proceedings before judgment \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa7106, Comment <em>a</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cTh[is] rule is \xe2\x80\xa6 applicable to judgments rendered in foreign nations \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); Reese, The Status in This Country of Judgments Rendered Abroad, 50 Colum.

Mexico brought the <em>Avena </em>case in part in \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of its right of diplomatic protection of its nationals,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.</em>, 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C. J., at 21, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb613(1), (3), including Medell\xc3\xadn, see <em>id.,</em> at 25, \xc2\xb616.  Such derivative claims are a well-established feature of international law, and the United States has several times asserted them on behalf of its own citizens.  See 2 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa7713, Comments <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, at 217; <em>Case Concerning Elettronic Sicula S. p. A. (U. S.</em> v. <em>Italy)</em>, 1989 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 15, 20 (Judgment of July 20); <em>Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (U. S.</em> v. <em>Iran)</em>, 1979 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 7, 8 (Judgment of Dec. 15); <em>Case Concerning Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco (Fr.</em> v. <em>U. S.)</em>, 1952 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 176, 180\xe2\x80\x93181 (Judgment of Aug. 27).  They are treated in relevant respects as the claims of the represented individuals themselves.  See 2 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa7713, Comments <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>.  In particular, they can give rise to remedies, tailored to the individual, that bind the Nation against whom the claims are brought (here, the United States).  See <em>ibid.;</em> see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Frelinghuysen</em> v. <em>Key</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/110/63/index.html">110 U. S. 63</a>, 71\xe2\x80\x9372 (1884).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does recognition of the ICJ judgment as binding with respect to the individuals whose claims were espoused by Mexico in any way derogate from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, <em>supra</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 16, n.\xc2\xa08.  This case does not implicate the general interpretive question answered in <em>Sanchez-Llamas:</em> whether the Vienna Convention displaces state procedural rules.  We are instead confronted with the discrete question of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 obligation to comply with a binding judgment issued by a tribunal with undisputed jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights of the individuals named therein.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is inherent in international adjudication that an international tribunal may reject one country\xe2\x80\x99s legal position in favor of another\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and the United States explicitly accepted this possibility when it ratified the Optional Protocol.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>22.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fourth, </em>the majority\xe2\x80\x99s very different approach has seriously negative practical implications. The United States has entered into at least 70 treaties that contain provisions for ICJ dispute settlement similar to the Protocol before us.  Many of these treaties contain provisions similar to those this Court has previously found self-executing\xe2\x80\x94provisions that involve, for example, property rights, contract and commercial rights, trademarks, civil liability for personal injury, rights of foreign diplomats, taxation, domestic-court jurisdiction, and so forth.  Compare Appendix A, <em>infra,</em> with Appendix B, <em>infra.</em>  If the Optional Protocol here, taken together with the U. N. Charter and its annexed ICJ Statute, is insufficient to warrant enforcement of the ICJ judgment before us, it is difficult to see how one could reach a different conclusion in any of these other instances.  And the consequence is to undermine longstanding efforts in those treaties to create an effective international system for interpreting and applying many, often commercial, self-executing treaty provisions.  I thus doubt that the majority is right when it says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not suggest that treaties can never afford binding domestic effect to international tribunal judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  In respect to the 70 treaties that currently refer disputes to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s binding adjudicatory authority, some multilateral, some bilateral, that is just what the majority has done.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can the majority look to congressional legislation for a quick fix.  Congress is unlikely to authorize automatic judicial enforceability of <em>all </em>ICJ judgments, for that could include some politically sensitive judgments and others better suited for enforcement by other branches: for example, those touching upon military hostilities, naval activity, handling of nuclear material, and so forth.  Nor is Congress likely to have the time available, let alone the will, to legislate judgment-by-judgment enforcement of, say, the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s (or other international tribunals\xe2\x80\x99) resolution of non-politically-sensitive commercial disputes.  And as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior case law has avoided laying down bright-line rules but instead has adopted a more complex approach, it seems unlikely that  Congress will find it easy to develop legislative bright lines that pick out those provisions (addressed to the Judicial Branch) where self-execution seems warranted.  But, of course, it is not necessary for Congress to do so\xe2\x80\x94at least not if one believes that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Supremacy Clause cases <em>already</em> embody criteria likely to work reasonably well.  It is those criteria that I would apply here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fifth</em>, other factors, related to the particular judgment here at issue, make that judgment well suited to direct judicial enforcement.  The specific issue before the ICJ concerned \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98review and reconsideration\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cpossible prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d caused in each of the 51 affected cases by an arresting State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide the defendant with rights guaranteed by the Vienna Convention.  <em>Avena,</em> 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J., at 65, \xc2\xb6138.  This review will call for an understanding of how criminal procedure works, including whether, and how, a notification failure may work prejudice.  <em>Id.,</em> at 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  As the ICJ itself recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the judicial process that is suited to this task.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 66, \xc2\xb6140.  Courts frequently work with criminal procedure and related prejudice.  Legislatures do not.  Judicial standards are readily available for working in this technical area.  Legislative standards are not readily available.  Judges typically determine such matters, deciding, for example, whether further hearings are necessary, after reviewing a record in an individual case.  Congress does not normally legislate in respect to individual cases.  Indeed, to repeat what I said above, what kind of special legislation does the majority believe Congress ought to consider?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sixth,</em> to find the United States\xe2\x80\x99 treaty obligations self-executing as applied to the ICJ judgment (and consequently to find that judgment enforceable) does not threaten constitutional conflict with other branches; it does not require us to engage in nonjudicial activity; and it does not require us to create a new cause of action.  The only question before us concerns the application of the ICJ judgment as binding law applicable to the parties in a particular criminal proceeding that Texas law creates independently of the treaty.  I repeat that the question before us does not involve the creation of a private right of action (and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on authority regarding such a circumstance is misplaced, see <em>ante</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa03).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seventh, </em>neither the President nor Congress has expressed concern about direct judicial enforcement of the ICJ decision.  To the contrary, the President favors enforcement of this judgment.  Thus, insofar as foreign policy impact, the interrelation of treaty provisions, or any other matter within the President\xe2\x80\x99s special treaty, military, and foreign affairs responsibilities might prove relevant, such factors <em>favor, </em>rather than militate against, enforcement of the judgment before us.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Jama</em> v. <em>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</em>, 543 U. S. 335, 348 (2005) (noting Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccustomary policy of deference to the President in matters of foreign affairs\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these seven reasons, I would find that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 treaty obligation to comply with the ICJ judgment in <em>Avena </em>is enforceable in court in this case without further congressional action beyond Senate ratification of the relevant treaties.  The majority reaches a different conclusion because it looks for the wrong thing (explicit textual expression about self-execution) using the wrong standard (clarity) in the wrong place (the treaty language).  Hunting for what the text cannot contain, it takes a wrong turn.  It threatens to deprive individuals, including businesses, property owners, testamentary beneficiaries, consular officials, and others, of the workable dispute resolution procedures that many treaties, including commercially oriented treaties, provide.  In a world where commerce, trade, and travel have become ever more international, that is a step in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were the Court for a moment to shift the direction of its legal gaze, looking instead to the Supremacy Clause and to the extensive case law interpreting that Clause as applied to treaties, I believe it would reach a better supported, more felicitous conclusion.  That approach, well embedded in Court case law, leads to the conclusion that the ICJ judgment before us is judicially enforceable without further legislative action.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A determination that the ICJ judgment is enforceable does not quite end the matter, for the judgment itself requires us to make one further decision.  It directs the United States to provide further judicial review of the 51 cases of Mexican nationals \xe2\x80\x9cby means of its own choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Avena, </em>2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J., at 72, \xc2\xb6153(9).  As I have explained, I believe the judgment addresses itself to the Judicial Branch.  This Court consequently must \xe2\x80\x9cchoose\xe2\x80\x9d the means.  And rather than, say, conducting the further review in this Court, or requiring Medell\xc3\xadn to seek the review in another federal court, I believe that the proper forum for review would be the Texas-court proceedings that would follow a remand of this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beyond the fact that a remand would be the normal course upon reversing a lower court judgment, there are additional reasons why further state-court review would be particularly appropriate here.  The crime took place in Texas, and the prosecution at issue is a Texas prosecution.  The President has specifically endorsed further Texas court review.  See President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum.  The ICJ judgment requires further hearings as to whether the police failure to inform Medell\xc3\xadn of his Vienna Convention rights prejudiced Medell\xc3\xadn, even if such hearings would not otherwise be available under Texas\xe2\x80\x99 procedural default rules.  While Texas has already considered that matter, it did not consider fully, for example, whether appointed counsel\xe2\x80\x99s coterminous 6-month suspension from the practice of the law \xe2\x80\x9ccaused actual prejudice to the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94prejudice that would not have existed had Medell\xc3\xadn known he could contact his consul and thereby find a different lawyer.  <em>Id., </em>at 60, \xc2\xb6121.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Texas law authorizes a criminal defendant to seek postjudgment review.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.071, \xc2\xa75(a)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2006).  And Texas law provides for further review where American law provides a \xe2\x80\x9clegal basis\xe2\x80\x9d that was previously \xe2\x80\x9cunavailable.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Ex parte Medell\xc3\xadn</em>, 223 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 315, 352 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).  Thus, I would send this case back to the Texas courts, which must then apply the <em>Avena </em>judgment as binding law.  See U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl.\xc2\xa02; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dominguez </em>v. <em>State</em>, 90 Tex. Crim. 92, 99, 234 S.\xc2\xa0W. 79, 83 (1921) (recognizing that treaties are \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the supreme law of the land\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cit is the duty of the courts of the state to take cognizance of, construe and give effect\xe2\x80\x9d to them (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the majority concludes that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s international legal obligation to enforce the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision is not automatically a domestic legal obligation, it must then determine whether the President has the constitutional authority to enforce it.  And the majority finds that he does not.  See Part III, <em>ante</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, that second conclusion has broader implications than the majority suggests.  The President here seeks to implement treaty provisions in which the United States agrees that the ICJ judgment is binding with respect to the <em>Avena </em>parties.  Consequently, his actions draw upon his constitutional authority in the area of foreign affairs.  In this case, his exercise of that power falls within that middle range of Presidential authority where Congress has neither specifically authorized nor specifically forbidden the Presidential action in question.  See <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. </em>v.<em> Sawyer, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/579/index.html">343 U. S. 579</a>, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).  At the same time, if the President were to have the authority he asserts here, it would require setting aside a state procedural law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is difficult to believe that in the exercise of his Article II powers pursuant to a ratified treaty, the President can <em>never</em> take action that would result in setting aside state law.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Pink</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/315/203/index.html">315 U. S. 203</a>, 233 (1942) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo State can rewrite our foreign policy to conform to its own domestic policies\xe2\x80\x9d).  Suppose that the President believes it necessary that he implement a treaty provision requiring a prisoner exchange involving someone in state custody in order to avoid a proven military threat.  Cf. <em>Ware</em>, 3 Dall., at 205.  Or suppose he believes it necessary to secure a foreign consul\xe2\x80\x99s treaty-based rights to move freely or to contact an arrested foreign national.  Cf. Vienna Convention, Art. 34, 21 U. S. T., at 98.  Does the Constitution require the President in each and every such instance to obtain a special statute authorizing his action?  On the other hand, the Constitution must impose significant restrictions upon the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability, by invoking Article II treaty-implementation authority, to circumvent ordinary legislative processes and to pre-empt state law as he does so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Previously this Court has said little about this question.  It has held that the President has a fair amount of authority to make and to implement executive agreements, at least in respect to international claims settlement, and that this authority can require contrary state law to be set aside.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pink</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 223, 230\xe2\x80\x93231, 233\xe2\x80\x93234; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Belmont</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/301/324/index.html">301 U. S. 324</a>, 326\xe2\x80\x93327 (1937).  It has made clear that principles of foreign sovereign immunity trump state law and that the Executive, operating without explicit legislative authority, can assert those principles in state court.  See <em>Ex parte Peru</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/578/index.html">318 U. S. 578</a>, 588 (1943).  It has also made clear that the Executive has inherent power to bring a lawsuit \xe2\x80\x9cto carry out treaty obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sanitary Dist. of Chicago</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/266/405/index.html">266 U. S. 405</a>, 425, 426 (1925).  But it has reserved judgment as to \xe2\x80\x9cthe scope of the President\xe2\x80\x99s power to preempt state law pursuant to authority delegated by . . . a ratified treaty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a fact that helps to explain the majority\xe2\x80\x99s inability to find support in precedent for its own conclusions.  <em>Barclays Bank PLC</em> v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/298/index.html">512 U. S. 298</a>, 329 (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the Court\xe2\x80\x99s comparative lack of expertise in foreign affairs; given the importance of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s foreign relations; given the difficulty of finding the proper constitutional balance among state and federal, executive and legislative, powers in such matters; and given the likely future importance of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to do so, I would very much hesitate before concluding that the Constitution implicitly sets forth broad prohibitions (or permissions) in this area.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328, n.\xc2\xa013 (stating that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is \xe2\x80\x9climited\xe2\x80\x9d by the facts that (1) this treaty is non-self-executing and (2) the judgment of an international tribunal is involved).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would thus be content to leave the matter in the\nconstitutional shade from which it has emerged.  Given\nmy view of this case, I need not answer the question.\n  And I shall not try to do so.  That silence, however, cannot be taken as agreement with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s Part III\nconclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s two holdings taken together produce practical anomalies. They unnecessarily complicate the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign affairs task insofar as, for example, they increase the likelihood of Security Council <em>Avena </em>enforcement proceedings, of worsening relations with our neighbor Mexico, of precipitating actions by other nations putting at risk American citizens who have the misfortune to be arrested while traveling abroad, or of diminishing our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s reputation abroad as a result of our failure to follow the \xe2\x80\x9crule of law\xe2\x80\x9d principles that we preach.  The holdings also encumber Congress with a task (postratification legislation) that, in respect to many decisions of international tribunals, it may not want and which it may find difficult to execute.  See <em>supra</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (discussing the problems with case-by-case legislation).  At the same time, insofar as today\xe2\x80\x99s holdings make it more difficult to enforce the judgments of international tribunals, including technical non-politically-controversial judgments, those holdings weaken that rule of law for which our Constitution stands.  Compare Hughes Defends Foreign Policies in Plea for Lodge, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Oct. 31, 1922, p.\xc2\xa01, col. 1, p.\xc2\xa04, col. 1 (then-Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes stating that \xe2\x80\x9cwe favor, and always have favored, an international court of justice for the determination according to judicial standards of justiciable international disputes\xe2\x80\x9d); Mr. Root Discusses International Problems, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, July 9, 1916, section 6, book review p. 276 (former Secretary of State and U. S. Senator Elihu Root stating that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a court of international justice with a general obligation to submit all justiciable questions to its jurisdiction and to abide by its judgment is a primary requisite to any real restraint of law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); Mills, The Obligation of the United States Toward the World Court, 114 Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 128 (1924) (Congressman Ogden Mills describing the efforts of then-Secretary of State John Hay, and others, to establish a World Court, and the support therefor).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These institutional considerations make it difficult to reconcile the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holdings with the workable Constitution that the Founders envisaged.   They reinforce the importance, in practice and in principle, of asking Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s question: Does a treaty provision address the \xe2\x80\x9cJudicial\xe2\x80\x9d Branch rather than the \xe2\x80\x9cPolitical Branches\xe2\x80\x9d of Government.  See <em>Foster</em>, 2 Pet., at 314.  And they show the wisdom of the well-established precedent that indicates that the answer to the question here is \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Parts I and II, <em>supra</em>. </p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, a strong line of precedent, likely reflecting the views of the Founders, indicates that the treaty provisions before us and the judgment of the International Court of Justice address themselves to the Judicial Branch and consequently are self-executing.  In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court has failed to take proper account of that precedent and, as a result, the Nation may well break its word even though the President seeks to live up to that word and Congress has done nothing to suggest the contrary.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons set forth, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIXES TO OPINION OF BREYER,\xc2\xa0J.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Examples of Supreme Court decisions considering a treaty provision to be self-executing.
