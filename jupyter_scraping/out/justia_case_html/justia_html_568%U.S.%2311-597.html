In 1948, the U.\xc2\xa0S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) constructed the Clearwater Dam (Dam) upstream from the Management Area and adopted a plan known as the Water Control Manual (Manual), which sets seasonally varying rates for the release of water from the Dam.  Periodically from 1993 until 2000, the Corps, at the request of farmers, authorized deviations from the Manual that extended flooding into the Management Area\xe2\x80\x99s peak timber growing season.  The Commission objected to the deviations on the ground that they adversely impacted the Management Area, and opposed the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 proposal to make the temporary deviations part of the Manual\xe2\x80\x99s permanent water-release plan.  After testing the effect of the deviations, the Corps abandoned the proposed Manual revision and ceased its temporary deviations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Commission sued the United States, alleging that the temporary deviations constituted a taking of property that entitled the Commission to compensation.  The Commission maintained that the deviations caused sustained flooding during tree-growing season, and that the cumulative impact of the flooding caused the destruction of timber in the Area and a substantial change in the character of the terrain, necessitating costly reclamation measures.  The Court of Federal Claims\xe2\x80\x99 judgment in favor of the Commission was reversed by the Federal Circuit.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that temporary government action may give rise to a takings claim if permanent action of the same character would constitute a taking.  It held, however, that government-induced flooding can give rise to a taking claim only if the flooding is \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent or inevitably recurring.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federal Circuit understood this conclusion to be dictated by Sanguinetti v. United States, \n\n264 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146\n, and United States v.

This Court has drawn some bright lines, but in the main, takings claims turn on situation-specific factual inquiries.  See Penn Central Transp. Co. v.

Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, and seasonally recurring flooding, Cress, 243 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 328, can constitute takings.  The Court has also ruled that takings temporary in duration can be compensable.  E.g., United States v. Causby, \n\n328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 256\n.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent thus indicates that government-induced flooding of limited duration may be compensable.  None of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions authorizes a blanket temporary-flooding exception to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Takings Clause jurisprudence, and the Court declines to create such an exception in this case.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0In advocating a temporary-flooding exception, the Government relies primarily on Sanguinetti, \n\n264 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146\n, which held that no taking occurred when a government-constructed canal overflowed onto the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s land.  In its opinion, the Court summarized prior flooding cases as standing for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cin order to create an enforceable liability against the Government, it is, at least, necessary that the overflow be the direct result of the structure, and constitute an actual, permanent invasion of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 149.  The Government urges the Court to extract from the quoted words a definitive rule that there can be no temporary taking caused by floods.  But the Court does not read the passing reference to permanence in Sanguinetti as having done so much work.  Sanguinetti was decided in 1924, well before the World War II-era cases and First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, \n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 304\n, in which the Court first homed in on the matter of compensation for temporary takings.  There is no suggestion in Sanguinetti that flooding cases should be set apart from the mine run of takings claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court thus finds no solid grounding in precedent for setting flooding apart from other government intrusions on property.  And the Government has presented no other persuasive reason to do so.  Its primary argument is that reversing the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision risks disrupting public works dedicated to flood control.  While the public interests here are important, they are not categorically different from the interests at stake in myriad other Takings Clause cases in which this Court has rejected similar arguments when deployed to urge blanket exemptions from the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s instruction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government argues in the alternative that damage to downstream property, however foreseeable, is collateral or incidental; it is not aimed at any particular landowner and therefore is not compensable under the Takings Clause.  The Court expresses no opinion on this claim, which was first tendered at oral argument and not aired in the courts below.  For the same reason, the Court declines to address the bearing, if any, of Arkansas water-rights law on this case.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0When regulation or temporary physical invasion by government interferes with private property, time is a factor in determining the existence vel\xc2\xa0non of a compensable taking.  See, e.g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., \n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 419\n, n.\xc2\xa012.  Also relevant to the takings inquiry is the degree to which the invasion is intended or is the foreseeable result of authorized government action.  See, e.g., John Horstmann Co. v. United States, \n\n257 U.\xc2\xa0S. 138\n.  So, too, are the character of the land at issue and the owner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable investment-backed expectations\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the land\xe2\x80\x99s use, Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 606\n, as well as the severity of the interference, see, e.g., Penn Central, 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 130\xe2\x80\x93131.  In concluding that the flooding was foreseeable in this case, the Court of Federal Claims noted the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s repeated complaints to the Corps about the destructive impact of the successive planned deviations and determined that the interference with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s property was severe.  The Government, however, challenged several of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s factfindings, including those relating to causation, foreseeability, substantiality, and the amount of damages.  Because the Federal Circuit rested its decision entirely on the temporary duration of the flooding, it did not address those challenges, which remain open for consideration on remand.

Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) authorized flooding that extended into the peak growing season for timber on forest land owned and managed by petitioner, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (Commission).  Cumulative in effect, the repeated flooding damaged or destroyed more than 18 million board feet of timber and disrupted the ordinary use and enjoyment of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s property.  The Commission sought compensation from the United States pursuant to the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s instruction: \xe2\x80\x9c[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The question presented is whether a taking may occur, within the meaning of the Takings Clause, when government-induced flood invasions, al- though repetitive, are temporary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOrdinarily, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions confirm, if government action would qualify as a taking when permanently continued, temporary actions of the same character may also qualify as a taking.  In the instant case, the parties and the courts below divided on the appropriate classification of temporary flooding.  Reversing the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims, which awarded compensation to the Commission, the Federal Circuit held, 2 to 1, that compensation may be sought only when flooding is \xe2\x80\x9ca per- manent or inevitably recurring condition, rather than an inherently temporary situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  637 F.\xc2\xa03d 1366, 1378 (2011).  We disagree and conclude that recurrent floodings, even if of finite duration, are not categorically exempt from Takings Clause liability.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Commission owns the Dave Donaldson Black River Wildlife Management Area (Management Area or Area), which comprises 23,000 acres along both banks of the Black River in northeast Arkansas.  The Management Area is forested with multiple hardwood timber species that support a variety of wildlife habitats.  The Commission operates the Management Area as a wildlife and hunting preserve, and also uses it as a timber resource, conducting regular harvests of timber as part of its forest-management efforts.  Three types of hardwood oak species\xe2\x80\x94nuttall, overcup, and willow\xe2\x80\x94account for 80 percent of the trees in the Management Area.  The presence of these hardwood oaks is essential to the Area\xe2\x80\x99s character as a habitat for migratory birds and as a venue for recreation and hunting.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Clearwater Dam (Dam) is located 115 miles upstream from the Management Area.  The Corps constructed the Dam in 1948, and shortly thereafter adopted a plan known as the Water Control Manual (Manual) to determine the rates at which water would be released from the Dam.  The Manual sets seasonally varying release rates, but permits planned deviations from the prescribed rates for agricultural, recreational, and other purposes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1993, the Corps approved a planned deviation in response to requests from farmers.  From September to December 1993, the Corps released water from the Dam at a slower rate than usual, providing downstream farmers with a longer harvest time.  As a result, more water than usual accumulated in Clearwater Lake behind the Dam. To reduce the accumulation, the Corps extended the pe- riod in which a high amount of water would be released.  The Commission maintained this extension yielded downstream flooding in the Management Area, above historical norms, during the tree-growing season, which runs from April to October.  If the Corps had released the water more rapidly in the fall of 1993, in accordance with the Manual and with past practice, there would have been short-term waves of flooding which would have receded quickly.  The lower rate of release in the fall, however, extended the period of flooding well into the following spring and summer.  While the deviation benefited farmers, it interfered with the Management Area\xe2\x80\x99s tree-growing season.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Corps adopted similar deviations each year from 1994 through 2000.  The record indicates that the decision to deviate from the Manual was made independently in each year and that the amount of deviation varied over the span of years.  Nevertheless, the result was an unbroken string of annual deviations from the Manual.  Each deviation lowered the rate at which water was released during the fall, which necessitated extension of the release period into the following spring and summer.  During this span of years the Corps proposed Manual revisions that would have made its temporary deviations part of the permanent water-release plan.  On multiple occasions between 1993 and 2000, the Commission objected to the temporary deviations and opposed any permanent revision to the Manual, on the ground that the departures from the traditional water-release plan adversely impacted the Management Area.  Ultimately, the Corps tested the effect of the deviations on the Management Area.  It thereupon abandoned the proposal to permanently revise the Manual and, in 2001, ceased its temporary deviations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2005, the Commission filed the instant lawsuit against the United States, claiming that the temporary deviations from the Manual constituted a taking of property that entitled the Commission to compensation.  The Commission maintained that the deviations caused sustained flooding of its land during the tree-growing season.  The cumulative impact of this flooding over a six-year period between 1993 and 1999, the Commission alleged, resulted in the destruction of timber in the Management Area and a substantial change in the character of the terrain, which necessitated costly reclamation measures.  Following a trial, the Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of the Commission and issued an opinion and order containing detailed findings of fact.  87 Fed. Cl. 594 (2009).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Federal Claims found that the forests in the Management Area were healthy and flourishing before the flooding that occurred in the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, and that the forests had been sustainably managed for decades under the water-release plan contained in the Manual.  Id., at 631.  It further found that the Commission repeatedly objected to the deviations from the Manual and alerted the Corps to the detrimental effect the longer period of flooding would have on the hardwood timber in the Management Area.  Id., at 604.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs found by the Court of Federal Claims, the flooding caused by the deviations contrasted markedly with historical flooding patterns.  Between 1949 and 1992, the river level near the Management Area reached six feet an average of 64.7 days per year during the growing season; the number of such days had been even lower on average before the Clearwater Dam was built.  Between 1993 and 1999, however, the river reached the same level an average of 91.14 days per year, an increase of more than 40 percent over the historic average.  Although the Management Area lies in a floodplain, in no previously recorded time span did comparable flooding patterns occur.  Id., at 607\xe2\x80\x93608.  Evidence at trial indicated that half of the nuttall oaks in the Management Area were saturated with water when the river level was at six feet, id., at 608; the evidence further indicated that the saturation of the soil around the trees\xe2\x80\x99 root systems could persist for weeks even after the flooding had receded.  Id., at 627. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe court concluded that the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 deviations caused six consecutive years of substantially increased flooding, which constituted an appropriation of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s property, albeit a temporary rather than a permanent one.  Important to this conclusion, the court emphasized the deviations\xe2\x80\x99 cumulative effect.  The trees were subject to prolonged periods of flooding year after year, which reduced the oxygen level in the soil and considerably weak- ened the trees\xe2\x80\x99 root systems.  The repeated annual flooding for six years altered the character of the property to a much greater extent than would have been shown if the harm caused by one year of flooding were simply multi- plied by six.  When a moderate drought occurred in 1999 and 2000, the trees did not have the root systems necessary to sustain themselves; the result, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s words, was \xe2\x80\x9ccatastrophic mortality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 632.  More than 18 million board feet of timber were destroyed or degraded.  Id., at 638\xe2\x80\x93640.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis damage altered the character of the Management Area.  The destruction of the trees led to the invasion of undesirable plant species, making natural regeneration of the forests improbable in the absence of reclamation efforts.  Id., at 643.  To determine the measure of just compensation, the Court of Federal Claims calculated the value of the lost timber and the projected cost of the reclamation and awarded the Commission $5.7 million.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Federal Circuit reversed.  It acknowledged that in general, temporary government action may give rise to a takings claim if permanent action of the same character would constitute a taking.  But it held that \xe2\x80\x9ccases involving flooding and [flowage] easements are different.\xe2\x80\x9d  637 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1374.  Government-induced flooding can give rise to a taking claim, the Federal Circuit concluded, only if the flooding is \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent or inevitably recurring.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1378.  The Court of Appeals understood this conclusion to be dictated by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in Sanguinetti v. United States, \n\n264 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146, \n150 (1924)\n, and United States v.

These guides are fundamental in our Takings Clause jurisprudence.  We have recognized, however, that no magic formula enables a court to judge, in every case, whether a given government interference with property is a taking.  In view of the nearly infinite variety of ways in which government actions or regulations can affect property interests, the Court has recognized few invariable rules in this area. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTrue, we have drawn some bright lines, notably, the rule that a permanent physical occupation of property authorized by government is a taking.  Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., \n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 419, \n426 (1982)\n.  So, too, is a regulation that permanently requires a property owner to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses of his or her land.  Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1003, \n1019 (1992)\n.  But aside from the cases attended by rules of this order, most takings claims turn on situation-specific factual inquiries.  See Penn Central, 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 124.  With this in mind, we turn to the question presented here\xe2\x80\x94whether temporary flooding can ever give rise to a takings claim. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court first ruled that government-induced flooding can constitute a taking in Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166 (1872).  The Wisconsin Legislature had authorized the defendant to build a dam which led to the creation of a lake, permanently submerging the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s land.  The defendant argued that the land had not been taken because the government did not exercise the right of eminent domain to acquire title to the affected property.  Moreover, the defendant urged, the damage was merely \xe2\x80\x9ca consequential result\xe2\x80\x9d of the dam\xe2\x80\x99s construction near the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s property.  Id., at 177.  Rejecting that crabbed reading of the Takings Clause, the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere real estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions of water, earth, sand, or other material .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. so as to effectually destroy or impair its usefulness, it is a taking, within the meaning of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 181.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFollowing Pumpelly, the Court recognized that season- ally recurring flooding could constitute a taking.  United States v. Cress, \n\n243 U.\xc2\xa0S. 316 (1917)\n, involved the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a lock and dam, which subjected the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s land to \xe2\x80\x9cintermittent but inevitably recurring overflows.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 328.  The Court held that the regularly recurring flooding gave rise to a takings claim no less valid than the claim of an owner whose land was continuously kept under water.  Id., at 328\xe2\x80\x93329. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurthermore, our decisions confirm that takings tem- porary in duration can be compensable.  This principle was solidly established in the World War II era, when \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ondemnation for indefinite periods of occupancy [took hold as] a practical response to the uncertainties of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s needs in wartime.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Westinghouse Elec. &amp; Mfg. Co., \n\n339 U.\xc2\xa0S. 261, \n267 (1950)\n.  In support of the war effort, the Government took temporary possession of many properties.  These exercises of government authority, the Court recognized, qualified as compensable temporary takings.  See Pewee Coal Co., \n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 114\n; Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, \n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1949)\n; United States v. General Motors Corp., \n\n323 U.\xc2\xa0S. 373 (1945)\n.  Notably in relation to the question before us, the takings claims approved in these cases were not confined to instances in which the Government took outright physical possession of the property involved.  A temporary takings claim could be maintained as well when government action occurring outside the property gave rise to \xe2\x80\x9ca direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Causby, \n\n328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 256, \n266 (1946)\n (frequent overflights from a nearby airport resulted in a taking, for the flights deprived the property owner of the customary use of his property as a chicken farm); cf. United States v. Dickinson, \n\n331 U.\xc2\xa0S. 745, \n751 (1947)\n (flooding of claimant\xe2\x80\x99s land was a taking even though claimant successfully \xe2\x80\x9creclaimed most of his land which the Government originally took by flooding\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEver since, we have rejected the argument that government action must be permanent to qualify as a taking.  Once the government\xe2\x80\x99s actions have worked a taking of property, \xe2\x80\x9cno subsequent action by the government can re- lieve it of the duty to provide compensation for the pe- riod during which the taking was effective.\xe2\x80\x9d  First English, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 321.  See also Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 337 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e do not hold that the temporary nature of a land-use restriction precludes finding that it effects a taking; we simply recognize that it should not be given exclusive significance one way or the other.\xe2\x80\x9d). \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause government-induced flooding can constitute a taking of property, and because a taking need not be permanent to be compensable, our precedent indicates that government-induced flooding of limited duration may be compensable.  No decision of this Court authorizes a blanket temporary-flooding exception to our Takings Clause jurisprudence, and we decline to create such an exception in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn advocating a temporary-flooding exception, the Government relies primarily on Sanguinetti, \n\n264 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146\n.  That case involved a canal constructed by the Government connecting a slough and a river.  The claimant\xe2\x80\x99s land was positioned between the slough and the river above the canal.  The year after the canal\xe2\x80\x99s construction, a \xe2\x80\x9cflood of unprecedented severity\xe2\x80\x9d caused the canal to overflow onto the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s land; less severe flooding and overflow occurred in later years.  Id., at 147. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court held there was no taking on these facts.  This outcome rested on settled principles of foreseeability and causation.  The Court emphasized that the Government did not intend to flood the land or have \xe2\x80\x9cany reason to expect that such [a] result would follow\xe2\x80\x9d from construction of the canal.  Id., at 148.  Moreover, the property was subject to seasonal flooding prior to the construction of the canal, and the landowner failed to show a causal connection between the canal and the increased flooding, which may well have been occasioned by changes in weather patterns.  See id., at 149 (characterizing the causal relationship asserted by the landowner as \xe2\x80\x9cpurely conjec- tural\xe2\x80\x9d).  These case-specific features were more than sufficient to dispose of the property owner\xe2\x80\x99s claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the course of the Sanguinetti decision, however, the Court summarized prior flooding cases as standing for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cin order to create an enforceable liability against the Government, it is, at least, necessary that the overflow be the direct result of the structure, and constitute an actual, permanent invasion of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Government would have us extract from this statement a definitive rule that there can be no temporary taking caused by floods. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not read so much into the word \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears in a nondispositive sentence in Sanguinetti.  That case, we note, was decided in 1924, well before the World War II-era cases and First English, in which the Court first homed in on the matter of compensation for temporary takings.  That time factor, we think, renders understandable the Court\xe2\x80\x99s passing reference to permanence.  If the Court indeed meant to express a general limitation on the Takings Clause, that limitation has been superseded by subsequent developments in our jurisprudence. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is certainly no suggestion in Sanguinetti that flooding cases should be set apart from the mine run of takings claims.  The sentence in question was composed to summarize the flooding cases the Court had encountered up to that point, which had unexceptionally involved permanent, rather than temporary, government-induced flooding.  264 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 149.  See Cress, 243 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 328; United States v. Lynah, \n\n188 U.\xc2\xa0S. 445, \n469 (1903)\n.  But as just explained, no distinction between permanent and temporary flooding was material to the result in Sanguinetti.  We resist reading a single sentence unnecessary to the decision as having done so much work.  In this re- gard, we recall Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s sage observation that \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.  If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is presented for decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399 (1821). \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government also asserts that the Court in Loretto interpreted Sanguinetti the same way the Federal Circuit did in this case.  That assertion bears careful inspection.  A section of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in Loretto discussing permanent physical occupations parenthetically quotes Sanguinetti\xe2\x80\x99s statement that flooding is a taking if it constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cactual, permanent invasion of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 428.  But the first rule of case law as well as statutory interpretation is:  Read on.  Later in the Loretto opinion, the Court clarified that it scarcely intended to adopt a \xe2\x80\x9cflooding-is-different\xe2\x80\x9d rule by the obscure means of quoting parenthetically a fragment from a 1924 opinion.  The Court distinguished permanent physical occupations from temporary invasions of property, expressly including flooding cases, and said that \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary limitations are subject to a more complex balancing process to determine whether they are a taking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 435, n.\xc2\xa012. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is thus no solid grounding in precedent for set- ting flooding apart from all other government intrusions on property.  And the Government has presented no other persuasive reason to do so.  Its primary argument is of the in for a penny, in for a pound genre: reversing the decision below, the Government worries, risks disruption of pub- lic works dedicated to flood control.  \xe2\x80\x9c[E]very passing flood attributable to the government\xe2\x80\x99s operation of a flood-control project, no matter how brief,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government hypothesizes, might qualify as a compensable taking.  Brief for United States 29.  To reject a categorical bar to temporary-flooding takings claims, however, is scarcely to credit all, or even many, such claims.  It is of course in- cumbent on courts to weigh carefully the relevant factors and circumstances in each case, as instructed by our decisions.  See infra, at 14. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe slippery slope argument, we note, is hardly novel or unique to flooding cases.  Time and again in Takings Clause cases, the Court has heard the prophecy that recognizing a just compensation claim would unduly impede the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to act in the public interest.  Causby, 328 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 275 (Black, J., dissenting); Loretto, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 455 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  We have rejected this argument when deployed to urge blanket exemptions from the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s instruction.  While we recognize the importance of the public interests the Government advances in this case, we do not see them as categorically different from the interests at stake in myriad other Takings Clause cases.  The sky did not fall after Causby, and today\xe2\x80\x99s modest decision augurs no deluge of takings liability.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTellingly, the Government qualifies its defense of the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of flood invasions from temporary takings analysis.  It sensibly acknowledges that a taking might be found where there is a \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently prolonged series of nominally temporary but substantively identical deviations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 21.  This concession is in some tension with the categorical rule adopted by the Court of Appeals.  Indeed, once it is recognized that at least some repeated nonpermanent flooding can amount to a taking of property, the question presented to us has been essentially answered.  Flooding cases, like other takings cases, should be assessed with reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular circumstances of each case,\xe2\x80\x9d and not by resorting to blanket exclusionary rules.

But Arkansas law was not examined by the Federal Circuit, and therefore is not properly pursued in this Court.
