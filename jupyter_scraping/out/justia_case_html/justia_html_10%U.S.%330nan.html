S. 331</a></p><p> "erecting Louisiana into two territories and providing for the temporary government thereof," Laws U.S. vol. 7, p. 116, it is enacted that the above act of 28 February, 1803, "shall extent to and have full force and effect in the above mentioned territories."</p>\n<p>And the tenth section of the same act, vol. 7, p. 119, prohibits the importation of slaves into the Territory of Orleans from any place without the United States under the penalty of $300, and also prohibits, under the like penalty, the importation from the United States of any slave imported into the United States since the 1 May, 1798, and of all other slaves except by a citizen of the United States removing into the territory for actual settlement, and being the <em>bona fide</em> owner of such slaves at the time of such removal.</p>\n<p>By the fourth section of the Act of March 2, 1805, vol. 7, p. 281, entitled "An act further providing for the government of the Territory of Orleans," it is enacted</p>\n<p>"That the laws in force in the said territory at the commencement of this act and not inconsistent with the provisions thereof shall continue in force until altered, modified, or repealed by the legislature"</p>\n<p>by that act established.  And the eighth section enacts</p>\n<p>"That so much of an act entitled \'An act erecting Louisiana into two territories,\' and providing for the temporary government thereof, as is repugnant with this act, shall, from and after the first Monday of November next, be repealed, and the residue of the said act shall continue in full force until repealed, anything in the 16th section of the act to the contrary notwithstanding."</p>\n<p>This act (March 2, 1805) establishes a government for the Territory of Orleans similar to that before exercised in the Mississippi Territory, vol. 5, p. 164, with a few exceptions.  The fifth section declares that the article of the ordinance of the old Congress for the government of the territory northwest of the Ohio, which prohibits slavery, is excluded from all operation within the Territory of Orleans.</p>\n<p>It was admitted that the territorial legislature had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 10 U. S. 332</a></p><p> never passed any law prohibiting the importation of slaves.</p>\n<p>It was contended by Rodney, Attorney General, that as Congress, by the Act of 26 March, 1804, prohibited the importation of slaves from foreign countries into the Territory of Orleans, and as the same act expressly extends to the territory the Act of 28 February, 1803, which forfeits the ship which imports a slave into a state where such importation is prohibited, the evident meaning and intention of Congress was to declare that the vessel should be forfeited which should import a slave into the Territory of Orleans.</p>\n<p>E. Livingston, <em>contra,</em> contended that inasmuch as the Territorial Legislature of Orleans had never prohibited such importation, the Act of 28 February, 1803, did not apply.  If the territory is to be assimilated to a state, so as to bring the case within the spirit of the law, yet, there must have been a prohibition by the territorial legislature, to make it a parallel case.</p>\n<p>And of that opinion was this Court, the case having been submitted without argument.</p>\n<p><em>Sentence reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
