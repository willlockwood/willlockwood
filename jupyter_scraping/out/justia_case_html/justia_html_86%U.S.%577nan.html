S. 580</a></p><p></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The circuit court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the plea of the plaintiff in error.  The object of the eighth section of the Act of Congress was to protect the government, not the sureties upon the bond.  By that section, the assessor was not permitted to approve a distiller\'s bond unless the distillery property was unencumbered as against the United States.  If he did, he made himself liable to the government for his default, but he violated no duty he owed the sureties.  He was under no obligation to protect the signers of the bond.  If the sureties insisted upon a release of the encumbrances as a condition to their becoming bound, they should have taken care to see that the bond was not approved until all the requirements of the statute in favor of the government had been complied with.  The assessor was in no respect called upon to act for them.  If they failed to secure all the indemnity they might have had it was their fault, and not that of the United States.  As to them certainly, this section of the act is directory to the assessor, and not mandatory.</p>\n<p>But it is directory also as to the United States. The assessor is a ministerial officer. He is directed not to approve a distiller\'s bond until the distillery property is made free from encumbrances as against the claims of the government.  He ought to insist upon this.  If he fails to perform this duty, the government will lose a part of the security it was entitled to have, but this will not prevent it from availing itself of so much as it has obtained.</p>\n<p>It is not averred in the plea that the bond was delivered to the assessor as an escrow, to be approved and made binding upon the obligors only when the encumbrances were released.  It is not even averred that the assessor, when he </p><p><a class="page-number" name="581">Page 86 U. S. 581</a></p><p> approved the bond, had actual knowledge of the existence of the alleged encumbrances.  But the theory of the plea is that the Act of Congress made the United States a guarantor to the surety that the distillery property was free from encumbrances at the time of the approval of the bond.  In our opinion, such is not the law.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>* 15 Stat. at Large 127.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
