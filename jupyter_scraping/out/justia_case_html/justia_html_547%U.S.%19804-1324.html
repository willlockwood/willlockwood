Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, which is not challenged here, that tolling period does not include the 90 days in which a petitioner might have sought certiorari review in this Court challenging state-court denial of postconviction relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Day\xe2\x80\x99s Florida trial-court sentence was affirmed on December 21, 1999, and his time to seek this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the final state-court decision expired on March 20, 2000.  Day unsuccessfully sought state postconviction relief 353 days later.  The trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was affirmed on appeal, effective December 3, 2002.  Day petitioned for federal habeas relief 36 days later, on January 8, 2003.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s answer asserted that the petition was \xe2\x80\x9ctimely\xe2\x80\x9d because it was filed after 352 days of untolled time.  Inspecting the answer and attachments, however, a Federal Magistrate Judge determined that the State had miscalculated the tolling time: Under the controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent, the untolled time was actually 388 days, rendering the petition untimely.  After affording Day an opportunity to show cause why the petition should not be dismissed for failure to meet AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year deadline, the Magistrate Judge found petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s responses inadequate and recommended dismissal.  The District Court adopted the recommendation, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, concluding that a State\xe2\x80\x99s patently erroneous concession of timeliness does not compromise a district court\xe2\x80\x99s authority <em>sU. S.onte</em> to dismiss a habeas petition as untimely.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>In the circumstances here presented, the District Court had discretion to correct the State\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous computation and, accordingly, to dismiss the habeas petition as untimely under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year limitation.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0A statute of limitations defense is not jurisdictional, therefore courts are under no obligation to raise the matter <em>sU. S.onte</em>.  Cf. <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/443/index.html">540 U. S. 443</a>, 458.  As a general matter, a defendant forfeits a statute of limitations defense not asserted in its answer or in an amendment thereto.  See Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a) (made applicable to federal habeas proceedings by Rule 11 of the Rules governing such proceedings).  And the Court would count it an abuse of discretion to override a State\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate waiver of the limitations defense.  But, in appropriate circumstances, a district court may raise a time bar on its own initiative.  The District Court in this case confronted no intelligent waiver on the State\xe2\x80\x99s part, only an evident miscalculation of time.  In this situation the Court declines to adopt either an inflexible rule requiring dismissal whenever AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year clock has run, or, at the opposite extreme, a rule treating the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure initially to plead the one-year bar as an absolute waiver.  Rather, the Court holds that a district court has discretion to decide whether the administration of justice is better served by dismissing the case on statute of limitations grounds or by reaching the merits of the petition.  This resolution aligns the statute of limitations with other affirmative defenses to habeas petitions, notably exhaustion of state remedies, procedural default, and nonretroactivity.  In <em>Granberry</em> v. <em>Greer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/129/index.html">481 U. S. 129</a>, 133, this Court held that federal appellate courts have discretion to consider a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to exhaust available state remedies before invoking federal habeas jurisdiction despite the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to interpose the exhaustion defense at the district-court level.  Similarly, in <em>Caspari</em> v. <em>Bohlen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/383/index.html">510 U. S. 383</a>, 389, the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca federal court may, but need not, decline to apply [the nonretroactivity rule announced in <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html">489 U. S. 288</a>, 310,] if the State does not argue it.\xe2\x80\x9d  It would make scant sense to distinguish AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time bar from these other threshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners.  While a district court is not required to double-check the State\xe2\x80\x99s math, cf. <em>Pliler</em> v. <em>Ford,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/225/index.html">542 U. S. 225</a>, 231, no Rule, statute, or constitutional provision commands a judge who detects a clear computation error to suppress that knowledge.  Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a).  The Court notes particularly that the Magistrate Judge, instead of acting <em>sU. S.onte</em>, might have informed the State of its obvious computation error and entertained an amendment to the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a).  There is no dispositive difference between that route, and the one taken here.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9310.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Before acting <em>sU. S.onte</em>, a court must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions.  It must also assure itself that the petitioner is not significantly prejudiced by the delayed focus on the limitation issue, and \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine whether the interests of justice would be better served\xe2\x80\x9d by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred.  See <em>Granberry,</em> 481 U. S., at 136.<em> </em>Here, the Magistrate Judge gave Day due notice and a fair opportunity to show why the limitation period should not yield dismissal.  The notice issued some nine months after the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer.  No court proceedings or action occurred in the interim, and nothing suggests that the State \xe2\x80\x9cstrategically\xe2\x80\x9d withheld the defense or chose to relinquish it.  From all that appears in the record, there was merely an inadvertent error, a miscalculation that was plain under Circuit precedent, and no abuse of discretion in following <em>Granberry</em> and <em>Caspari.  </em>P.\xc2\xa011.</p>\n<p align="left">391 F.\xc2\xa03d 1192, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Kennedy, Souter, and Alito, JJ., joined.

S. District Court, on its own initiative, to dismiss as untimely a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, sets a one-year limitation period for filing such petitions, running from \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  The one-year clock is stopped, however, during the time the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d application for state postconviction relief \xe2\x80\x9cis pending.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, that tolling period does not include the 90 days in which a petitioner might have sought certiorari review in this Court challenging state-court denial of postconviction relief.  <em>Coates</em> v. <em>Byrd</em>, 211 F.\xc2\xa03d 1225, 1227 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us, the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the federal habeas petition \xe2\x80\x9cagree[d] the petition [was] timely\xe2\x80\x9d because it was \xe2\x80\x9cfiled after 352 days of untolled time.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 24.  Inspecting the pleadings and attachments, a Federal Magistrate Judge determined that the State had miscalculated the tolling time.  Under Circuit precedent, the untolled time was 388 days, rendering the petition untimely by some three weeks.  After affording the petitioner an opportunity to show cause why the petition should not be dismissed for failure to meet the statutory deadline, and finding petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s responses inadequate, the Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the petition.  The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] concession of timeliness by the state that is patently erroneous does not compromise the authority of a district court <em>sU. S.onte</em> to dismiss a habeas petition as untimely, under AEDPA.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Day</em> v. <em>Crosby</em>, 391 F.\xc2\xa03d 1192, 1195 (CA11 2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented is whether a federal court lacks authority, on its own initiative, to dismiss a habeas petition as untimely, once the State has answered the petition without contesting its timeliness.  Ordinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation is forfeited if not raised in a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s answer or in an amendment thereto.  Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a).  And we would count it an abuse of discretion to override a State\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate waiver of a limitations defense.  In this case, however, the federal court confronted no intelligent waiver on the State\xe2\x80\x99s part, only an evident miscalculation of the elapsed time under a statute designed to impose a tight time constraint on federal habeas petitioners.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In the circumstances here presented, we hold, the federal court had discretion to correct the State\xe2\x80\x99s error and, accordingly, to dismiss the petition as untimely under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year limitation.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Patrick A. Day was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 55 years in prison by a Florida trial court.  Day unsuccessfully appealed the sentence, which was affirmed on December 21, 1999.  Day did not seek this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the final state-court decision; his time to do so expired on March 20, 2000.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three hundred and fifty-three (353) days later, Day unsuccessfully sought state postconviction relief.  The Florida trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment denying relief was affirmed on appeal, and the appellate court issued its mandate on December 3, 2002.  See <em>Nyland</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, 216 F.\xc2\xa03d 1264, 1267 (CA11 2000) (under Florida law, appellate order \xe2\x80\x9cis pending\xe2\x80\x9d until the mandate issues).  Thirty-six (36) days thereafter, on January 8, 2003, Day petitioned for federal habeas relief asserting several claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  A Magistrate Judge, finding the petition \xe2\x80\x9cin proper form,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 21, ordered the State to file an answer, <em>id., </em>at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  In its responsive pleading, the State failed to raise AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year limitation as a defense.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2.  Overlooking controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent, see <em>Coates</em>, 211 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1227, the State calculated that the petition had been \xe2\x80\x9cfiled after 352 days of untolled time,\xe2\x80\x9d and was therefore \xe2\x80\x9ctimely.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 24.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s answer and attachments, however, revealed that, had the State followed the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s instruction on computation of elapsed time, the timeliness concession would not have been made:  Under the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, more than one year, specifically, 388 days of untolled time, had passed between the finality of Day\xe2\x80\x99s state-court conviction and the filing of his federal habeas petition.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A newly assigned Magistrate Judge noticed the State\xe2\x80\x99s computation error and ordered Day to show cause why his federal habeas petition should not be dismissed as untimely.  <em>Id., </em>at 26\xe2\x80\x9330.  Determining that Day\xe2\x80\x99s responses did not overcome the time bar, the Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the petition, App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a\xe2\x80\x9315a, and the District Court adopted that recommendation, <em>id.,</em> at 7a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit granted Day a certificate of appealability on the question \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether the district court erred in addressing the timeliness of [Day\xe2\x80\x99s] habeas corpus petition \xe2\x80\xa6 after the [State] had conceded that [the] petition was timely.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 37.  In a decision rendered two years earlier, <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Secretary for Dept. of Corrections</em>, 292 F.\xc2\xa03d 1347 (2002), the Eleventh Circuit had ruled that, \xe2\x80\x9ceven though the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, the district court may review <em>sU. S.onte</em> the timeliness of [a federal habeas] petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1349.  Adhering to <em>Jackson</em>, and satisfied that the State\xe2\x80\x99s concession of timeliness \xe2\x80\x9cwas patently erroneous,\xe2\x80\x9d the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Day\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  391 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1192\xe2\x80\x931195.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari <em>sub\xc2\xa0nom.</em> <em>Day</em> v. <em>Crosby</em>, 545 U.

Indeed, the statute of limitations is explicitly aligned with those other defenses under the current version of Habeas Rule 5(b), which provides that the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer to a habeas petition \xe2\x80\x9cmust state whether any claim in the petition is barred by a failure to exhaust state remedies, a procedural bar, non-retroactivity, or a statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  The considerations of comity, finality, and the expeditious handling of habeas proceedings that motivated AEDPA,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] the State maintains, counsel against an excessively rigid or formal approach to the affirmative defenses now listed in Habeas Rule 5.  Citing <em>Granberry</em>, 481 U.

In lieu of an inflexible rule requiring dismissal whenever AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year clock has run, or, at the opposite extreme, a rule treating the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure initially to plead the one-year bar as an absolute waiver, the State reads the statutes, Rules, and decisions in point to permit the \xe2\x80\x9cexercise [of] discretion in each case to decide whether the administration of justice is better served by dismissing the case on statute of limitations grounds or by reaching the merits of the petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 14.  Employing that \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate approach\xe2\x80\x9d in this particular case, the State argues, the petition should not be deemed timely simply because a government attorney calculated the days in between petitions incorrectly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree, noting particularly that the Magistrate Judge, instead of acting <em>sU. S.onte</em>, might have informed the State of its obvious computation error and entertained an amendment to the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a) (leave to amend \xe2\x80\x9cshall be freely given when justice so requires\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72243 (State\xe2\x80\x99s response to habeas petition may be amended by leave of court); cf. <em>Long</em>, 393 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 402\xe2\x80\x93404 (District Court raised the statute of limitations <em>sU. S.onte</em>, the State agreed with that disposition, and the Court of Appeals treated that agreement as a constructive amendment to the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer).  Recognizing that an amendment to the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer might have obviated this controversy,[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] we see no dispositive difference between that route, and the one taken here.  See Brief for Respondent 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cHere, the State did not respond to the show cause order because its concession of timeliness was based on an erroneous calculation and it agreed the petition should be dismissed as untimely.\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U.

We so hold, noting that it would make scant sense to distinguish in this regard AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time bar from other threshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937; Habeas Rule 5(b) (placing \xe2\x80\x9ca statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d defense on a par with \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to exhaust state remedies, a procedural bar, [and] non-retroactivity\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Long</em>, 393 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 404 (\xe2\x80\x9cAEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations advances the same concerns as those advanced by the doctrines of exhaustion and procedural default, and must be treated the same.\xe2\x80\x9d).  We stress that a district court is not required to double-check the State\xe2\x80\x99s math.  If, as this Court has held, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]istrict judges have no obligation to act as counsel or paralegal to <em>pro se </em>litigants,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pliler</em> v. <em>Ford,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/225/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/225/index.html">542 U.

Nevertheless, if a judge does detect a clear computation error, no Rule, statute, or constitutional provision commands the judge to suppress that knowledge.  Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a) (clerical errors in the record \xe2\x80\x9carising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, before acting on its own initiative, a court must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Acosta</em>, 221 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 124\xe2\x80\x93125; <em>McMillan</em> v. <em>Jarvis</em>, 332 F.\xc2\xa03d 244, 250 (CA4 2003).  Further, the court must assure itself that the petitioner is not significantly prejudiced by the delayed focus on the limitation issue, and \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine whether the interests of justice would be better served\xe2\x80\x9d by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred.  See <em>Granberry,</em> 481 U. S., at 136.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Here, the Magistrate Judge gave Day due notice and a fair opportunity to show why the limitation period should not yield dismissal of the petition.  The notice issued some nine months after the State answered the petition.  No court proceedings or action occurred in the interim, and nothing in the record suggests that the State \xe2\x80\x9cstrategically\xe2\x80\x9d withheld the defense or chose to relinquish it.  From all that appears in the record, there was merely an inadvertent error, a miscalculation that was plain under Circuit precedent, and no abuse of discretion in following this Court\xe2\x80\x99s lead in <em>Granberry</em> and <em>Caspari</em>, described <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p align="left">Affirmed.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Until AEDPA took effect in 1996, no statute of limitations applied to habeas petitions.

Even if that were true, which it is not, I could not join this novel presumption <em>against</em> applying the Civil Rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Civil Rules \xe2\x80\x9cgovern the procedure in the United States district courts in all suits of a civil nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 1.  This includes \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings for \xe2\x80\xa6 habeas corpus,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 81(a)(2), but only \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States [or] the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases [Habeas Rules],\xe2\x80\x9d Civil Rule 81(a)(2); see also Habeas Rule 11.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in the context of habeas suits to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Garceau</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/202/index.html">538 U. S. 202</a>, 208 (2003), and do not contradict or undermine the provisions of the habeas corpus statute, <em>Gonzalez</em> v. <em>Crosby</em>, 545 U.

See <em>ante</em>, at 8 (citing Rules 8(c), 12(b), 15(a)).  The Court does not identify any \xe2\x80\x9cinconsisten[cy]\xe2\x80\x9d between this forfeiture rule and the statute, Rules, or historical practice of habeas proceedings\xe2\x80\x94because there is none.  Forfeiture of the limitations defense is demonstrably not inconsistent with traditional habeas practice, because, as the Court acknowledges, habeas practice included no statute of limitations until 1996.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01; see also <em>infra, </em>at 3\xe2\x80\x935.  Forfeiture is perfectly consistent with Habeas Rule 5(b), which now provides that the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9canswer \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>must</em> state whether any claim in the petition is barred by \xe2\x80\xa6 statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  And forfeiture is also consistent with (and indeed, arguably suggested by) Habeas Rule 4, because Rule 4 provides for <em>sU. S.onte</em> screening and dismissal of habeas petitions only <em>prior</em> to the filing of the State\xe2\x80\x99s responsive pleading.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most importantly, applying the forfeiture rule to the limitations period of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d) does not contradict or undermine any provision of the habeas statute.  Quite the contrary, on its most natural reading, the statute calls for the forfeiture rule.  AEDPA expressly enacted, without further qualification, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] 1-year <em>period of limitation</em>\xe2\x80\x9d for habeas applications by persons in custody pursuant to the judgments of state courts.  \xc2\xa72244(d)(1) (emphasis added).  We have repeatedly stated that the enactment of time-limitation periods such as that in \xc2\xa72244(d), without further elaboration, produces defenses that are nonjurisdictional and thus subject to waiver and forfeiture.  See <em>Zipes</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/index.html">455 U. S. 385</a>, 393 (1982); see also <em>Eberhart</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 546 U.

Absent some affirmative incompatibility with habeas practice, there is no reason why a habeas limitations period should be any different.  By imposing an unqualified \xe2\x80\x9cperiod of limitation\xe2\x80\x9d against the background understanding that a defense of \xe2\x80\x9climita-\ntions\xe2\x80\x9d must be raised in the answer, see Civil Rules 8(c),\n12(b), the statute implies that the usual forfeiture rule is\napplicable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of identifying an inconsistency between habeas corpus practice and the usual civil forfeiture rule, the Court urges that \xe2\x80\x9cit would make scant sense to distinguish in this regard AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time bar from other threshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners\xe2\x80\x9d that may be raised <em>sU.

But unlike AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, these defenses were all created by the habeas courts themselves, in the exercise of their traditional equitable discretion, see <em>Withrow</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/680/index.html">507 U.

AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period is entirely a recent creature of statute.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01.  If comity and finality did not compel any time limitation at all, it follows <em>a fortiori</em> that they do not compel making a legislatively created, forfeitable time limitation <em>nonforfeitable</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, prior to the enactment of AEDPA, we affirmatively rejected the notion that habeas courts\xe2\x80\x99 traditionally broad discretionary powers would support their imposition of a time bar.  Historically, \xe2\x80\x9cthere [wa]s no statute of limitations governing federal habeas, and the only laches recognized [wa]s that which affects the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to defend against the claims raised on habeas\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which was imposed by Rule, and not until 1977.  <em>Brecht</em> v. <em>Abrahamson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/619/index.html">507 U. S. 619</a>, 637 (1993); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/469/index.html">331 U. S. 469</a>, 475 (1947); 17A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74268.2, p.\xc2\xa0497\xe2\x80\x93498 (2d ed. 1988) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).  We repeatedly asserted that the passage of time alone could not extinguish the habeas corpus rights of a person subject to unconstitutional incarceration.  See <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman</em> v. <em>Claudy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/116/index.html">350 U. S. 116</a>, 123 (1956); <em>Chessman</em> v. <em>Teets</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/156/index.html">354 U. S. 156</a>, 164\xe2\x80\x93165 (1957).  For better or for worse, this doctrine was so well entrenched that the lower courts regularly entertained petitions filed after even extraordinary delays.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hawkins</em> v. <em>Bennett</em>, 423 F.\xc2\xa02d 948, 949 (CA8 1970) (40 years); <em>Hamilton</em> v. <em>Watkins</em>, 436 F.\xc2\xa02d 1323, 1325 (CA5 1970) (at least 36 years); <em>Hannon</em> v. <em>Maschner</em>, 845 F.\xc2\xa02d 1553, 1553\xe2\x80\x931555 (CA10 1988) (at least 24 years).  And in 1977, when enactment of the former Habeas Rule 9(a) \xe2\x80\x9cintroduce[d] for the first time an element of laches into habeas corpus,\xe2\x80\x9d 17A Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74268.2, at 498\xe2\x80\x94by adopting the rule against \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prejudicial delay\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to which the Court refers, <em>ante</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x94even that limited doctrine was treated as subject to the very same pleading requirements and forfeiture rule that the Court rejects today for the stricter limitations period of \xc2\xa72244(d).  See <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Secretary of New Mexico Dept. of Corrections</em>, 50 F.\xc2\xa03d 801, 821\xe2\x80\x93822, n.\xc2\xa030 (CA10 1995); see also <em>McDonnell</em> v. <em>Estelle</em>, 666 F.\xc2\xa02d 246, 249 (CA5 1982).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, therefore, no support for the notion that the traditional equitable discretion that governed habeas proceedings permitted the dismissal of habeas petitions on the sole ground of untimeliness.  Whether or not it should have, see <em>Collins</em> v. <em>Byrd</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/1185/index.html">510 U. S. 1185</a>, 1186\xe2\x80\x931187 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting), it did not.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on pre-existing equitable doctrines like procedural default and nonretroactivity is, therefore, utterly misplaced.  Nothing in our tradition of <em>refusing</em> to dismiss habeas petitions as untimely justifies the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to beef up the presumptively forfeitable \xe2\x80\x9climitations period\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa72244(d) by making it the subject of <em>sU. S.onte</em> dismissal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In what appears to be the chief ground of its decision, the Court also observes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Magistrate Judge, instead of acting <em>sU. S.onte</em>, might have informed the State of its obvious computation error and entertained an amendment to the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer\xe2\x80\x9d under Civil Rule 15(a).  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough an amendment to the State\xe2\x80\x99s answer might have obviated this controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concedes, \xe2\x80\x9cwe see no dispositive difference between that route, and the one taken here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But this consideration cuts in the opposite direction.  If there truly were no \xe2\x80\x9cdispositive difference\xe2\x80\x9d between following and disregarding the rules that Congress has enacted, the natural conclusion would be that there is no compelling reason to <em>disregard</em> the Civil Rules.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Legislatively enacted rules are surely entitled to more respect than this apparent presumption that, when nothing substantial hangs on the point, they do <em>not</em> apply as written.  And, unlike the novel regime that the Court adopts today, which will apparently require the development of new rules from scratch, there already exists a well-developed body of law to govern the district courts\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of discretion under Rule 15(a).  See 6 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71484\xe2\x80\x931488 (2d ed. 1990 and Supp. 2005).  Ockham is offended by today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, even if no one else is.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But, in fact, there are at least two notable differences between the Civil Rules and the <em>sU. S.onte</em> regime of such cases as <em>Granberry</em> and <em>Caspari</em>\xe2\x80\x94both of which involve sufficiently significant departures from ordinary civil practice as to require clear authorization from the statute, the Rules, or historical habeas practice.  First, the <em>Granberry</em> regime allows the forfeited procedural defense to be raised for the first time on appeal, either by the State or by the appellate court <em>sua sponte</em>.  See 481 U. S., at 130, 133; <em>Schiro</em> v. <em>Farley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/222/index.html">510 U. S. 222</a>, 228\xe2\x80\x93229 (1994).  Ordinary civil practice does not allow a forfeited affirmative defense whose underlying facts were not developed below to be raised for the first time on appeal.  See <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Salfi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/749/index.html">422 U. S. 749</a>, 764 (1975); <em>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.</em> v. <em>Arlington Heights</em>, 558 F.\xc2\xa02d 1283, 1287 (CA7 1977).  The ability to raise even constitutional errors in criminal trials for the first time on appeal is narrowly circumscribed.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Olano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/725/index.html">507 U. S. 725</a>, 732 (1993).  Comity and finality justified this departure from ordinary practice for historically rooted equitable defenses such as exhaustion.  See <em>Granberry</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 134.  But limitations was not such a defense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Also, <em>Granberry</em> and the like raise the possibility that the courts can impose a procedural defense over the State\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative decision to waive that defense.  The Court takes care to point out that this is not such a case, <em>ante</em>, at 11, but it invites such cases in future.  After all, the principal justification for allowing such defenses to be raised <em>sU. S.onte</em> is that they \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98implicat[e] values beyond the concerns of the parties,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judicial efficiency and conservation of judicial resources\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe expeditious handling of habeas proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, 8 (quoting <em>Acosta</em> v. <em>Artuz</em>, 221 F.\xc2\xa03d 117, 123 (CA2 2000)).  There are many reasons why the State may wish to disregard the statute of limitations, including the simple belief that it would be unfair to impose the limitations defense on a particular defendant.  On the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, a district court would not abuse its discretion in overriding the State\xe2\x80\x99s conscious waiver of the defense in order to protect such \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98values beyond the concerns of the parties,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 6.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Under the Civil Rules, by contrast, amending a party\xe2\x80\x99s pleading over his objection would constitute a clear abuse of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, applying the ordinary rule of forfeiture to the AEDPA statute of limitations creates no inconsistency with the Habeas Rules.  On the contrary, it is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unwarranted expansion of the timeliness rule enacted by Congress that is inconsistent with the statute, the Habeas Rules, the Civil Rules, and traditional practice.  I would hold that the ordinary forfeiture rule, as codified in the Civil Rules, applies to the limitations period of \xc2\xa72244(d).  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court observes that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ere we to accept Day\xe2\x80\x99s position, courts would never (or, at least, hardly ever) be positioned to raise AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s [Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996] time bar <em>sU. S.onte</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cinformation essential to the time calculation is often absent\xe2\x80\x9d at the Rule 4 prescreening stage, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, n.\xc2\xa06.  But to be distressed at this phenomenon is to beg the question\xe2\x80\x94that is, to assume that courts <em>ought</em> to \xe2\x80\x9cbe positioned to raise AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time bar <em>sU. S.onte</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is precisely the question before us.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will have little impact on the outcome of district court proceedings.  In particular, I agree that \xe2\x80\x9cif a [district] judge does detect a clear computation error, no Rule, statute, or constitutional provision commands the judge to suppress that knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10.  Rather, a judge may call the timeliness issue to the State\xe2\x80\x99s attention and invite a motion to amend the pleadings under Civil Rule 15(a), under which \xe2\x80\x9cleave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  In fact, in providing for leave whenever \xe2\x80\x9cjustice so requires,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 15(a), the Civil Rules fully accommodate the comity and finality interests that the Court thinks require a departure from the Civil Rules, see <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, 10.  Requiring the State to take the affirmative step of amending its own pleading at least observes the formalities of our adversary system, which is a nontrivial value it itself.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Burke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/229/index.html">504 U. S. 229</a>, 246 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In order to avoid this seemingly unavoidable conclusion, the Court asserts, without relevant citation or reasoning, that \xe2\x80\x9cshould a State intelligently choose to waive a statute of limitations defense, a district court would not be at liberty to disregard that choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 11, n.\xc2\xa011.  This assertion is contrary to our statement in <em>Granberry</em> v. <em>Greer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/129/index.html"></a><a href="/us/481/129/index.html">481 U. S. 129</a>, 134 (1987)\xe2\x80\x94a case which, on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, it makes \xe2\x80\x9cscant sense to distinguish,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x94that an appellate court may dismiss an unexhausted petition <em>sU. S.onte</em> in \xe2\x80\x9ccases in which the State fails, <em>whether inadvertently or otherwise</em>, to raise an arguably meritorious nonexhaustion defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  To support its assertion, the Court cites nothing but its own earlier statement: \xe2\x80\x9cOrdinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limit is forfeited if not raised in a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s answer or in an amendment thereto.  Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a).  And we would count it an abuse of discretion to override a State\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate waiver of a limitations defense.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante, </em>at 2.  But as the statement itself shows, the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d inability to override the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cintelligent\xe2\x80\x9d waiver is coupled with an \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d automatic forfeit of the defense if it is not timely raised.  The Court does not say why it makes sense, for the statute of limitation of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), to reject (as it does) the first part of the ordinary practice (automatic forfeiture), while embracing the second (inability to override intelligent waiver).  The <em>reason </em>for rejecting the first part surely applies just as well to the second: Section 2244(d)(1)(A) supposedly \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98implicate[s] values beyond the concerns of the parties,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98judicial efficiency,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98conservation of judicial resources\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpeditious handling of habeas proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, 8.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
