Implementing <i>Atkins</i>\xe2\x80\x99 mandate, see <i>id.,</i> at 317, the Louisiana Supreme Court determined that an evidentiary hearing is required when a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[s] objective factors\xe2\x80\x9d sufficient to raise a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a reasonable ground\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to believe that he has an intellectual disability, which the court defined as \xe2\x80\x9c(1) subaverage intelligence, as measured by objective standardized IQ tests; (2) significant impairment in several areas of adaptive skills; and (3) manifestations of this neuro-psychological disorder in the developmental stage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>State v. Williams, </i>2001\xe2\x80\x931650 (La. 11/1/02), 831 So. 2d 835, 857, 861, 854.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Soon after the <i>Williams</i> decision, Brumfield amended his pending state postconviction petition to raise an <i>Atkins</i> claim.  Seeking an evidentiary hearing, he pointed to evidence introduced at sentencing that he had an IQ of 75, had a fourth-grade reading level, had been prescribed numerous medications and treated at psychiatric hospitals as a child, had been identified as having a learning disability, and had been placed in special education classes.  The trial court dismissed Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s petition without holding a hearing or granting funds to conduct additional investigation.  Brumfield subsequently sought federal habeas relief.  The District Court found that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s claim was both \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by\xe2\x80\x9d this Court and \xe2\x80\x9cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1), (2).  The court went on to determine that Brumfield was intellectually disabled.  The Fifth Circuit found that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s petition failed to satisfy either of \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements and reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Because Brumfield satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, he was entitled to have his <i>Atkins </i>claim considered on the merits in federal court.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The two underlying factual determinations on which the state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was premised\xe2\x80\x94that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s IQ score was inconsistent with a diagnosis of intellectual disability and that he presented no evidence of adaptive impairment\xe2\x80\x94were unreasonable under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  Because that standard is satisfied, the Court need not address \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Expert trial testimony that Brumfield scored a 75 on an IQ test is entirely consistent with intellectual disability.  Every IQ score has a margin of error.  Accounting for that margin of error, the sources on which the <i>Williams</i> court relied in defining subaverage intelligence describe a score of 75 as consistent with an intellectual disability diagnosis.  There was no evidence presented to the trial court of any other IQ test that was sufficiently rigorous to preclude the possibility that Brumfield possessed subaverage intelligence.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The state-court record contains sufficient evidence to suggest that Brumfield would meet the criteria for adaptive impairment.  Under the test most favorable to the State, an individual like Brumfield must show a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial functional limitation\xe2\x80\x9d in three of six \xe2\x80\x9careas of major life activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams</i>, 831 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 854.  Brumfield\xe2\x80\x94who was placed in special education classes at an early age, was suspected of having a learning disability, and can barely read at a fourth-grade level\xe2\x80\x94would seem to be deficient in two of those areas: \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nderstanding and use of language\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[l]earning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  His low birth weight, his commitment to mental health facilities at a young age, and officials\xe2\x80\x99 administration of antipsychotic and sedative drugs to him at that time all indicate that he may well have had significant deficits in at least one of the remaining four areas.  In light of that evidence, the fact that the record contains some contrary evidence cannot be said to foreclose all reasonable doubt as to his intellectual disability.  And given that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s trial occurred before <i>Atkins</i>, the trial court should have taken into account that the evidence before it was sought and introduced at a time when Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual disability was not at issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s two additional arguments are rejected.  Because the State did not press below the theory that \xc2\xa72254(e)(1) supplies the governing standard when evaluating whether a habeas petitioner has satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, that issue is not addressed here.  And because the state trial court made no finding that Brumfield had failed to produce evidence suggesting he could meet the \xe2\x80\x9cmanifestations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the developmental stage\xe2\x80\x9d requirement for intellectual disability, there is no determination on that point to which a federal court must defer in assessing whether Brumfield satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d).  In any event, the state court record contained ample evidence creating a reasonable doubt as to whether Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s disability manifested before adulthood.

After <i>Atkins</i> was decided, petitioner, a Louisiana death-row inmate, requested an opportunity to prove he was intellectually disabled in state court.

The court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca diagnosis of mental retardation has three distinct components: (1) subaverage intelligence, as measured by objective standardized IQ tests; (2) significant impairment in several areas of adaptive skills; and (3) manifestations of this neuro-psychological disorder in the developmental stage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 854 (relying on, <i>inter alia</i>, American Association of Mental Retardation, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (10th ed. 2002) (AAMR), and American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (rev. 4th ed. 2000) (DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV)); see also La.

He sought an evidentiary hearing on the issue, asserting that his case was \xe2\x80\x9caccompanied by a host of objective facts which raise the issue of mental retardation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 203a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In support, Brumfield pointed to mitigation evidence introduced at the sentencing phase of his trial.  He focused on the testimony of three witnesses in particular: his mother; Dr. Cecile Guin, a social worker who had compiled a history of Brumfield by consulting available records and conducting interviews with family members and teachers; and Dr. John Bolter, a clinical neuropsychologist who had performed a number of cognitive tests on Brumfield.  A psychologist, Dr. Brian Jordan, had also examined Brumfield and prepared a report, but did not testify at trial.  Brumfield contended that this evidence showed, among other things, that he had registered an IQ score of 75, had a fourth-grade reading level, had been prescribed numerous medications and treated at psychiatric hospitals as a child, had been identified as having some form of learning disability, and had been placed in special education classes.  See <i>id.</i>, at 203a\xe2\x80\x93204a.  Brumfield further requested \xe2\x80\x9call the resources necessary to the proper presentation of his case,\xe2\x80\x9d asserting that until he was able to \xe2\x80\x9cretain the services of various experts,\xe2\x80\x9d it would be \xe2\x80\x9cpremature for [the court] to address [his] claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 207a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Without holding an evidentiary hearing or granting funds to conduct additional investigation, the state trial court dismissed Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  With respect to the request for an <i>Atkins</i> hearing, the court stated:</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at the application, the response, the record, portions of the transcript on that issue, and the evidence presented, including Dr. Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, Dr. Guinn\xe2\x80\x99s [<i>sic</i>] testimony, which refers to and discusses Dr. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s report, and based on those, since this issue\xe2\x80\x94there was a lot of testimony by all of those in Dr. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s report.</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Bolter in particular found he had an IQ of over\xe2\x80\x94or 75.  Dr. Jordan actually came up with a little bit higher IQ.  I do not think that the defendant has demonstrated impairment based on the record in adaptive skills.  The doctor testified that he did have an anti-social personality or sociopath, and explained it as someone with no conscience, and the defendant hadn\xe2\x80\x99t carried his burden placing the claim of mental retardation at issue.  Therefore, I find he is not entitled to that hearing based on all of those things that I just set out.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a\xe2\x80\x93172a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After the Louisiana Supreme Court summarily denied his application for a supervisory writ to review the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, <i>Brumfield</i> v. <i>State</i>, 2004\xe2\x80\x930081 (La. 10/29/04), 885 So. 2d 580, Brumfield filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court, again pressing his <i>Atkins</i> claim.  Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Brumfield could secure relief only if the state court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of his claim was either \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d or was \xe2\x80\x9cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court found that both of these requirements had been met.  854 F.

First, the District Court held that denying Brumfield an evidentiary hearing without first granting him funding to develop his <i>Atkins</i> claim \xe2\x80\x9crepresented an unreasonable application of then-existing due process law,\xe2\x80\x9d thus satisfying \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  <i>Id.</i>, at 379.  Second, and in the alternative, the District Court found that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision denying Brumfield a hearing \xe2\x80\x9csuffered from an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state habeas proceeding in violation of \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court further determined Brumfield to be intellectually disabled based on the extensive evidence it received during an evidentiary hearing.  <i>Id.</i>, at 406; see <i>Cullen</i> v. <i>Pinholster</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 170\n, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13) (recognizing that federal habeas courts may \xe2\x80\x9ctake new evidence in an evidentiary hearing\xe2\x80\x9d when \xc2\xa72254(d) does not bar relief).  This evidence included the results of various IQ tests\xe2\x80\x94which, when adjusted to account for measurement errors, indicated that Brumfield had an IQ score between 65 and 70, 854 F.

It held that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition failed to satisfy either of \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  With respect to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the state court had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law, the Fifth Circuit rejected the notion that any of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents required a state court to grant an <i>Atkins</i> claimant the funds necessary to make a threshold showing of intellectual disability.  See 744 F. 3d, at 925\xe2\x80\x93926.  As for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rested on an unreasonable determination of the facts, the Fifth Circuit declared that its \xe2\x80\x9creview of the record persuad[ed it] that the state court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Brumfield an evidentiary hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 926.  Having found that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s petition failed to clear \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x99s hurdle, the Fifth Circuit did not review the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Brumfield is, in fact, intellectually disabled.

Here, our examination of the record before the state court compels us to conclude that both of its critical factual determinations were unreasonable.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s request for an <i>Atkins</i> hearing rested, first, on Dr. Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s testi-mony that Brumfield scored 75 on an IQ test and may have scored higher on another test.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a.  These scores, the state court apparently believed, belied the claim that Brumfield was intellectually disabled because they necessarily precluded any possibility that he possessed subaverage intelligence\xe2\x80\x94the first of the three criteria necessary for a finding of intellectual disability.  But in fact, this evidence was entirely consistent with intellectual disability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To qualify as \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly subaverage in general intellectual functioning\xe2\x80\x9d in Louisiana, \xe2\x80\x9cone must be more than two standard deviations below the mean for the test of intellectual functioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams</i>, 831 So. 2d, at 853 (internal quotation marks omitted).  On the Wechsler scale for IQ\xe2\x80\x94the scale employed by Dr. Bolter\xe2\x80\x94that would equate to a score of 70 or less.  See <i>id.</i>, at 853\xe2\x80\x93854, n. 26.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As the Louisiana Supreme Court cautioned in <i>Williams</i>, however, an IQ test result cannot be assessed in a vac-uum.  In accord with sound statistical methods, the court explained: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he assessment of intellectual functioning through the primary reliance on IQ tests must be tempered with attention to possible errors in measurement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Thus, <i>Williams</i> held, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s definition of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning does not specifically use the word \xe2\x80\x98approximately,\xe2\x80\x99 because of the SEM [(standard error of measurement)], any IQ test score has a margin of error and is only a factor in assessing mental retardation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 855, n. 29.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Accounting for this margin of error, Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s reported IQ test result of 75 was squarely in the range of potential intellectual disability.  The sources on which <i>Williams</i> relied in defining subaverage intelligence both describe a score of 75 as being consistent with such a diagnosis.  See AAMR, at 59; DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV, at 41\xe2\x80\x9342; see also <i>State</i> v. <i>Dunn</i>, 2001\xe2\x80\x931635 (La. 5/11/10), 41 So. 3d 454, 470 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe ranges associated with the two scores of 75 brush the threshold score for a mental retardation diagnosis\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Relying on similar authorities, this Court observed in <i>Atkins</i> that \xe2\x80\x9can IQ between 70 and 75 or lower .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U. S., at 309, n. 5.  Indeed, in adopting these definitions, the Louisiana Supreme Court anticipated our holding in <i>Hall </i>v.<i> Florida, </i>572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), that it is unconstitutional to foreclose \xe2\x80\x9call further exploration of intellectual disability\xe2\x80\x9d simply because a capital defendant is deemed to have an IQ above 70.  <i>Id</i>., at ___ (slip op., at 1); see also <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 12) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor professionals to diagnose\xe2\x80\x94and for the law then to determine\xe2\x80\x94whether an intellectual disability exists once the SEM applies and the individual\xe2\x80\x99s IQ score is 75 or below the inquiry would consider factors indicating whether the person had deficits in adaptive functioning\xe2\x80\x9d).  To conclude, as the state trial court did, that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s reported IQ score of 75 somehow demonstrated that he could not possess subaverage intelligence therefore reflected an unreasonable determination of the facts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor was there evidence of any higher IQ test score that could render the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination reasonable.  The state court claimed that Dr. Jordan, who examined Brumfield but never testified at trial, \xe2\x80\x9ccame up with a little bit higher IQ.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a.  At trial, the existence of such a test score was mentioned only during the cross-examination of Dr. Bolter, who had sim-ply acknowledged the following: \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Jordan rated his intelligence just a little higher than I did.  But Dr. Jordan also only did a screening test and I gave a standardized measure of intellectual functioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 133a.  And in fact, Dr. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s written report provides no IQ score.  See <i>id.</i>, at 429a.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  The state court therefore could not reason-ably infer from this evidence that any examination Dr. Jordan had performed was sufficiently rigorous to preclude definitively the possibility that Brumfield possessed subaverage intelligence.  See <i>State</i> v. <i>Dunn</i>, 2001\xe2\x80\x931635 (La. 11/1/02), 831 So. 2d 862, 886, n. 9 (ordering <i>Atkins</i> evidentiary hearing even though \xe2\x80\x9cprison records indicate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant had an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98estimated IQ of 76,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d emphasizing testimony that prison officials \xe2\x80\x9cdid not do the formal IQ testing\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The state court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to grant Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s request for an <i>Atkins</i> evidentiary hearing rested, next, on its con-clusion that the record failed to raise any question as to Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cimpairment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in adaptive skills.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a.  That determination was also unreasonable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The adaptive impairment prong of an intellectual dis-ability diagnosis requires an evaluation of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s ability to function across a variety of dimensions.  The Louisiana Supreme Court in <i>Williams</i> described three separate sets of criteria that may be utilized in making this assessment.  See 831 So. 2d, at 852\xe2\x80\x93854.  Although Louisiana courts appear to utilize all three of these tests in evaluating adaptive impairment, see <i>Dunn</i>, 41 So. 3d, at 458\xe2\x80\x93459, 463, for the sake of simplicity we will assume that the third of these tests, derived from Louisiana statutory law, governed here, as it appears to be the most favorable to the State.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  Under that standard, an individual may be intellectually disabled if he has \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activity: (i) Self-care. (ii) Understanding and use of language. (iii) Learning. (iv) Mobility. (v) Self-direction. (vi) Capacity for independent living.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams</i>, 831 So. 2d, at 854 (quoting then La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa728:381(12) (repealed 2005)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The record before the state court contained sufficient evidence to raise a question as to whether Brumfield met these criteria.  During the sentencing hearing, Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s mother testified that Brumfield had been born prematurely at a very low birth weight.  App. 28a.  She also recounted that he had been taken out of school in the fifth grade and hospitalized due to his behavior, and recalled an incident in which he suffered a seizure.  <i>Id.</i>, at 34a\xe2\x80\x9338a, 41a, 47a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Social worker Dr. Guin elaborated on this testimony, explaining that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s low birth weight indicated \xe2\x80\x9cthat something ha[d] gone wrong during the pregnancy,\xe2\x80\x9d that medical records suggested Brumfield had \xe2\x80\x9cslower responses than normal babies,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthey knew that something was wrong at that point.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 75a\xe2\x80\x9376a.  Dr. Guin also confirmed that, beginning in fifth grade, Brumfield had been placed in special classes in school and in multiple mental health facilities, and had been prescribed antipsychotics and sedatives.  <i>Id.</i>, at 89a, 93a\xe2\x80\x9394a.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Moreover, one report Dr. Guin reviewed from a facility that treated Brumfield as a child \xe2\x80\x9cquestioned his intellectual functions,\xe2\x80\x9d and opined that \xe2\x80\x9che probably had a learning disability related to some type of slowness in motor development, some type of physiological [problem].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 89a.  Dr. Guin herself reached a similar conclusion, stating that Brumfield \xe2\x80\x9cobviously did have a physiologically linked learning disability that he was born with,\xe2\x80\x9d and that his \xe2\x80\x9cbasic problem was that he .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could not process information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 90a, 98a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, Dr. Bolter, who had performed \xe2\x80\x9ca comprehensive battery of tests,\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed that Brumfield had a \xe2\x80\x9cborderline general level of intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 127a\xe2\x80\x93128a.  His low intellect manifested itself in a fourth-grade reading level\xe2\x80\x94and he reached that level, Dr. Bolter elaborated, only with respect to \xe2\x80\x9csimple word recognition,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot even comprehension.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 128a; see also <i>id.</i>, at 134a.  In a written report submitted to the state court, Dr. Bolter further noted that Brumfield had deficiencies \xe2\x80\x9cfrequently seen in individuals with a history of learning disabilities,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cclearly\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9clearning characteristics that make it more difficult for him to acquire new information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 418a, 420a.  Dr. Bolter also testified that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s low birth weight had \xe2\x80\x9cplace[d] him [at] a risk of some form of potential neurological trauma,\xe2\x80\x9d and affirmed that the medications administered to Brumfield as a child were generally reserved for \xe2\x80\x9csevere cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 130a, 132a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All told, then, the evidence in the state-court record provided substantial grounds to question Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive functioning.  An individual, like Brumfield, who was placed in special education classes at an early age, was suspected of having a learning disability, and can barely read at a fourth-grade level, certainly would seem to be deficient in both \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nderstanding and use of language\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[l]earning\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94two of the six \xe2\x80\x9careas of major life activity\xe2\x80\x9d identified in <i>Williams</i>.  831 So. 2d, at 854.  And the evidence of his low birth weight, of his commitment to mental health facilities at a young age, and of officials\xe2\x80\x99 administration of antipsychotic and sedative drugs to him at that time, all indicate that Brumfield may well have had significant deficits in at least one of the remaining four areas.  See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In advancing its contrary view of the record, the state court noted that Dr. Bolter had described Brumfield as someone with \xe2\x80\x9can antisocial personality.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 127a; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a.  The relevance of this diagnosis is, however, unclear, as an antisocial personality is not inconsistent with any of the above-mentioned areas of adaptive impairment, or with intellectual disability more generally.  The DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV\xe2\x80\x94one of the sources on which the <i>Williams</i> court relied in defining intellectual disability\xe2\x80\x94provides: \xe2\x80\x9cThe diagnostic criteria for Mental Retardation do not include an exclusion criterion; therefore, the diagnosis should be made .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. regardless of and in addition to the presence of another disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d  DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV, at 47; see also AAMR, at 172 (noting that individuals with intellectual disability also tend to have a number of other mental health disorders, including personality disorders).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, as the dissent emphasizes,<i> post</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, 18, other evidence in the record before the state court may have cut against Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s claim of intellectual disability.  Perhaps most significant, in his written report Dr. Bolter stated that Brumfield \xe2\x80\x9cappears to be normal from a neurocognitive perspective,\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cnormal capacity to learn and acquire information when given the opportunity for repetition,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproblem solving and reasoning skills\xe2\x80\x9d that were \xe2\x80\x9cadequate.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 421a.  Likewise, the underlying facts of Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s crime might arguably provide reason to think that Brumfield possessed certain adaptive skills, as the murder for which he was convicted required a degree of advanced planning and involved the acquisition of a car and guns.  But cf. AAMR, at 8 (intellectually disabled persons may have \xe2\x80\x9cstrengths in social or physical capabilities, strengths in some adaptive skill areas, or strengths in one aspect of an adaptive skill in which they otherwise show an overall limitation\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is critical to remember, however, that in seeking an evidentiary hearing, Brumfield was not obligated to show that he was intellectually disabled, or even that he would likely be able to prove as much.  Rather, Brumfield needed only to raise a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d as to his intellectual disability to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing.  See <i>Williams</i>, 831 So. 2d, at 858, n. 33.  The Louisiana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Williams</i> illustrated how low the threshold for an evidentiary hearing was intended to be: There, the court held that the defendant was entitled to a hearing on his <i>Atkins</i> claim notwithstanding the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defense\xe2\x80\x99s own expert testified unequivocally, at both the guilt and penalty phases of trial, that [the] defendant is not mentally retarded,\xe2\x80\x9d an assessment \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the fact that [the] defendant [was] not deficient in adaptive functioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  831 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 855; see also <i>Dunn</i>, 831 So. 2d, at 885, 887 (ordering hearing despite expert testimony that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9chad never been identified as a child who was a slow learner,\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9creceived college credit for courses completed during his incarceration\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similarly, in light of the evidence of Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s deficiencies, none of the countervailing evidence could be said to foreclose all reasonable doubt.  An individual who points to evidence that he was at risk of \xe2\x80\x9cneurological trauma\xe2\x80\x9d at birth, was diagnosed with a learning disability and placed in special education classes, was committed to mental health facilities and given powerful medication, reads at a fourth-grade level, and simply cannot \xe2\x80\x9cprocess information,\xe2\x80\x9d has raised substantial reason to believe that he suffers from adaptive impairments.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That these facts were alone sufficient to raise a doubt as to Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive impairments is all the more apparent given that Brumfield had not yet had the opportunity to develop the record for the purpose of proving an intellectual disability claim.  At his pre-<i>Atkins </i>trial, Brumfield had little reason to investigate or present evidence relating to intellectual disability.  In fact, had he done so at the penalty phase, he ran the risk that it would \xe2\x80\x9cenhance the likelihood .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. future dangerousness [would] be found by the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Atkins</i>, 536 U. S., at 321.  Thus, given that the evidence from trial provided good reason to think Brumfield suffered from an intellectual disability, there was even greater cause to believe he might prove such a claim in a full evidentiary hearing.  Indeed, the Louisiana Supreme Court had made clear that a capital defendant in Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s position should be accorded this additional benefit of the doubt when it defined the standard for assessing whether a hearing is required.  Echoing <i>Atkins</i>\xe2\x80\x99 observation that penalty-phase evidence of intellectual disability can be a \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-edged sword,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, <i>Williams</i> noted that where a trial \xe2\x80\x9cwas conducted prior to <i>Atkins</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d the defense\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctrial strategy may have been to shift the focus away from any diagnosis of mental retardation.\xe2\x80\x9d  831 So. 2d, at 856, n. 31.  For that reason, the <i>Williams</i> court considered the fact that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not had the issue of mental retardation put before the fact finder in light of the <i>Atkins</i> restriction on the death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d as a factor supporting the requisite threshold showing that \xe2\x80\x9centitled [him] to an evidentiary hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 857; accord, <i>Dunn</i>, 831 So. 2d, at 886.  Here, the state trial court should have taken into account that the evidence before it was sought and introduced at a time when Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual disability was not at issue.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to do so resulted in an unreasonable determination of the facts.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Urging affirmance of the decision below, the State advances two additional arguments that we need discuss only briefly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the State suggests that rather than being evaluated pursuant to \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable determination of the facts\xe2\x80\x9d standard, Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s attack on the state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision should instead be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reviewed under the arguably more deferential standard set out in \xc2\xa72254(e)(1).\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 30 (quoting <i>Wood</i>, 558 U.

The State did not press below the theory that \xc2\xa72254(e)(1) supplies the governing standard when a court evaluates whether a habeas petitioner has satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, the Fifth Circuit did not address that possibility, and the State in its brief in opposition to certiorari failed to advance any specific argument that the decision below could be supported by invocation of that statutory provision.  See Brief in Opposition 60\xe2\x80\x9364.  The argument is therefore \xe2\x80\x9cproperly \xe2\x80\x98deemed waived.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Granite Rock Co.</i> v. <i>Teamsters</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287,\n306 (2010)\n (quoting this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the State contends that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s request for an <i>Atkins</i> hearing was properly rejected because the record evidence failed to show that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual deficiencies manifested while he was in the \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopmental stage\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, before he reached adulthood.  <i>Williams</i>, 831 So. 2d, at 854.  But the state trial court never made any finding that Brumfield had failed to produce evidence suggesting he could meet this age-of-onset requirement.  There is thus no determination on that point to which a federal court must defer in assessing whether Brumfield satisfied \xc2\xa72254(d).  See <i>Panetti</i> v. <i>Quarterman</i>,\n\n551 U.

In any event, the state-court record contained ample evidence creating a reasonable doubt as to whether Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s disability manifested before adulthood: Both Dr. Guin and Dr. Bolter testified at length about Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual shortcomings as a child and their possible connection to his low birth weight.

The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) addresses that interference by constraining the ability of federal courts to grant relief to state prisoners.  Today, the Court oversteps those limits in a decision that fails to respect the Louisiana state courts and our precedents.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case is a study in contrasts.  On the one hand, we have Kevan Brumfield, a man who murdered Louisiana police officer Betty Smothers and who has spent the last 20 years claiming that his actions were the product of circumstances beyond his control.  On the other hand, we have Warrick Dunn, the eldest son of Corporal Smothers, who responded to circumstances beyond his control by caring for his family, building a professional football career, and turning his success on the field into charitable work off the field.  </p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given that the majority devotes a single sentence to a description of the crime for which a Louisiana jury sentenced Brumfield to death, I begin there.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Corporal Smothers, a 14-year veteran of the Baton Rouge Police Department, was working a second job to support her family when she was murdered just after midnight on January 7, 1993.  Following a 10-hour shift at the department on January 6, Corporal Smothers reported to a local grocery store, where she served as a uniformed security officer with the official authorization of the department.  She monitored the security of the grocery store and waited to escort the assistant manager, Kimen Lee, to a local bank to make the store\xe2\x80\x99s nightly deposit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Corporal Smothers followed her usual practice of driving Lee to the bank in her police cruiser.  Shortly after midnight, they arrived at the bank\xe2\x80\x99s night depository.  As Lee leaned out of the passenger side door to make the deposit, she heard the racking of the slide on a handgun.  Brumfield and his accomplice, Henri Broadway, then opened fire on the two women.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Brumfield fired seven rounds from a .380-caliber handgun at close range from the left side of the cruiser, while Broadway fired five rounds from a .25-caliber handgun from the right rear of the cruiser.  Brumfield hit Corporal Smothers five times in the forearm, chest, and head.  Lee was hit multiple times as well, causing 11 entrance and exit wounds, but she somehow managed to slide over on the bench seat and take control of the police car.  She drove to a nearby convenience store, where she was able to call for help and to describe Broadway to police.  Emergency responders transported both women to the hospital.  Corporal Smothers was pronounced dead on arrival.  Lee survived.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On January 11, 1993, Baton Rouge police arrested Brumfield for Corporal Smothers\xe2\x80\x99 murder.  After several hours of police interrogation, during which he denied involvement in the murder, Brumfield eventually gave a videotaped confession.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  He admitted that, after riding around at night looking for a \xe2\x80\x9chustle,\xe2\x80\x9d he had come up with the idea to steal the grocery store\xe2\x80\x99s deposit.  He described how he and Broadway hid in the bushes waiting for the car to arrive, and how, when Lee looked back while trying to make the deposit, he started shooting.  He admitted that he had fired seven rounds from his .380-caliber handgun, that Broadway had fired five shots with the .25-caliber handgun, and that a third man had served as the getaway driver.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A Louisiana jury convicted Brumfield of first-degree murder.  In addition to his videotaped confession, the State introduced evidence that Brumfield had spoken about committing a robbery to several people in the weeks leading up to the murder.  He was facing sentencing on unrelated charges and had promised his pregnant girlfriend that he would obtain money to support her, their baby, and her child from a previous relationship while he was in jail.  The State also introduced evidence that Brumfield had told an acquaintance right after the murder that he had just killed \xe2\x80\x9ca son of a bitch.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 3566.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">At the penalty phase, the State sought a death sentence.  It reintroduced the evidence from the guilt phase, along with evidence of Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s other criminal acts.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The felony convictions for which Brumfield was awaiting sentencing when he murdered Corporal Smothers were for attempted possession of cocaine and felony theft of a gun.  Brumfield had worked only three months in his adult life because, as he had admitted to his psychologist, he found drug dealing a far more effective way to make money.  In fact, he had been involved a few years earlier in the fatal shooting of a fellow drug dealer in a deal gone bad.  And 10 months after he murdered Corporal Smothers, Brumfield battered another police officer while in prison.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State also explained that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s murder of Corporal Smothers was the culmination of a 2-week crime spree.  On Christmas Day 1992, Brumfield robbed Anthony Miller at gunpoint after giving him a ride.  He forced Miller out of the car, put a gun to Miller\xe2\x80\x99s head, and pulled the trigger.  Fortunately for Miller, the gun misfired, and he survived.  One week later, Brumfield robbed Edna Marie Perry and her daughter Trina Perkins at gunpoint as they were walking along the side of the road.  Brumfield pulled alongside them, pointed a sawed-off shotgun at Perry, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHand it over, bitch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3790.  Perry turned over her purse, but pleaded with Brumfield to give back the pictures from her deceased son\xe2\x80\x99s funeral that she carried in the purse.  He responded none too courteously, \xe2\x80\x9cBitch, you dead,\xe2\x80\x9d and drove away.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State also introduced evidence about the murder\xe2\x80\x99s broader impact.  In addition to serving as a police officer, Corporal Smothers was a single mother to six children and a volunteer coach at a local track club.  Her children, who ranged from 10 to 18 years old, went to live with their grandmother after the murder.  The loss of their mother weighed heavily on all of them.  It was particularly hard on Corporal Smothers\xe2\x80\x99 eldest son, Warrick, who had been especially close to his mother, and on her second eldest son, Derrick Green, who had been hoping to spend more time with her after Warrick went off to college.  Derrick was deprived of that chance, and he and Warrick had to take on extra responsibilities to care for their younger siblings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>For his part, Brumfield introduced evidence that his crimes were \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond his control,\xe2\x80\x9d a product of his disadvantaged background.  <i>Id.</i>, at 3927.  He was born at a low birth weight, and his mother testified that he spent sev-eral months in the hospital shortly after his birth.  His father left the family, and his stepfather would make him sit in the corner on hot rice, whip him, and hit him over the head with a telephone book.  His brother eventually decided to go live with their biological father.  Brumfield opted to stay with his mother and stepfather.  </b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When he was around seven or eight years old, Brumfield began to have behavioral problems.  He had trouble staying in his seat at school, was disruptive, easily distracted, and prone to fighting.  He was eventually taken to a psychiatric hospital to address his hyperactivity.  Although he was a straight-A student until the third grade, his time in four or five group homes educated him in the criminal lifestyle, and his grades began to suffer.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Dr. Cecile Guin, a social worker, testified that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s hyperactivity and acting out could be traced largely to his low birth weight, lack of a supportive home environment, and abusive stepfather.  Although she was not a medical doctor, she concluded that Brumfield had a \xe2\x80\x9cneurologically based hyperactive or learning disability problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3886.  She acknowledged, however, that his school records described him as having a behavior disorder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca pattern situation or inappropriate behavior extended over a long period of time which cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, neurological or other general factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3882.  She also admitted on cross-examination that a psychologist, Brian T. Jordan, had not diagnosed Brumfield as suffering from any neurological disorder, but instead from \xe2\x80\x9ca sociopathic personality disorder, antisocial type, poor impulse control, especially in the area of aggression.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3897\xe2\x80\x933898.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Dr. John Bolter, a clinical neuropsychologist, testified on behalf of the defense that Brumfield suffered from an antisocial personality disorder.  Based on a battery of tests employed to determine whether Brumfield suffered from \xe2\x80\x9cany kind of neurological deficits in cognitive functions,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Bolter concluded that Brumfield early on in life \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest[ed] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a conduct disorder with extreme levels of aggressivity and a disregard for the basic rights of others,\xe2\x80\x9d along with \xe2\x80\x9can attention deficit disorder of some type.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3904.  Over time, he \xe2\x80\x9cemerged into what looks more like an antisocial personality,\xe2\x80\x9d and he continued to have \xe2\x80\x9cattention difficulty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cborderline general level of intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s IQ score was a 75, placing him at about the seventh percentile of the general population or \xe2\x80\x9con the low end of intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  His reading skills were at about a fourth-grade level, while his math and spelling skills were at about a sixth-grade level.  On the other hand, Dr. Bolter concluded that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproblem solving, judgment and reasoning skills [we]re sufficient to meet the demands of everyday adulthood and he [wa]s not showing any decrement in the types of problems one would assume to see if they were suffering from an underlying organic basis or mental illness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 275.  Dr. Bolter had also reviewed Dr. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s report, and he testified that the only inconsistency in their conclusions was that Dr. Jordan rated Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence \xe2\x80\x9cjust a little higher than\xe2\x80\x9d he did.  <i>Id.</i>, at 3907.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury unanimously recommended that Brumfield be sentenced to death.  It found three statutory aggravators that made him eligible for that penalty: He was engaged in the attempted perpetration of an armed robbery; he knowingly created a risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person; and the victim was a peace officer engaged in her lawful duties.  The jury found no statutory mitigators.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s argument that his actions were the product of his disadvantaged background is striking in light of the conduct of Corporal Smothers\xe2\x80\x99 children following her murder.  Most widely known is that of Warrick.  Though he had turned 18 just two days before Brumfield murdered his mother, he quickly stepped into the role of father figure to his younger siblings.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  In his view, it \xe2\x80\x9cwas up to [him] to make sure that everybody grew up to be somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d  W. Dunn &amp; D. Yaegar, Running for my Life: My Journey in the Game of Football and Beyond 37 (2008).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To that end, Warrick led by example, becoming a star running back at Florida State University and then in the National Football League (NFL).  During his time at Florida State, he set records on the field while coping with the loss of his mother.  <i>Id.,</i> at 71, 111, 117.  Though separated from his family in Louisiana, he called his brothers and sisters regularly,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] sought parenting advice from his coach, and returned home when he could.  <i>Id.,</i> at 111\xe2\x80\x93113.  He kept his mother\xe2\x80\x99s pearl earrings, stained with her blood from the night she was murdered, in a box on his dresser.  <i>Id.,</i> at 71.  After four years at Florida State, Dunn was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  Concerned that some of his siblings were struggling in Baton Rouge, he moved the three youngest into his home in Tampa Bay.  <i>Id.,</i> at 139.  Although the strain of playing for the Buccaneers and raising his family weighed on him, he \xe2\x80\x9caccepted it as [his] responsibility .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to make sure they stayed on the right path.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While balancing football and family, Dunn still found time for others.  He started Homes for the Holidays,a charitable organization that decorates and fully fur-nishes\xe2\x80\x94down to the toothbrush\xe2\x80\x94homes obtained by single mothers through first-time homeowner assistance programs.  Dunn was inspired by his own mother, who spent years working toward the purchase of a home for her family, but, thanks to Brumfield, did not live to reach her goal.  <i>Id.,</i> at 152.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Dunn\xe2\x80\x99s contributions did not end there.  After joining the Atlanta Falcons in 2002, he expanded the reach of Homes for the Holidays, <i>id.,</i> at 157; traveled overseas to visit our Armed Forces, <i>id.,</i> at 200\xe2\x80\x93201; led an effort to raise money from the NFL to help respond to the tragic effects of Hurricane Katrina, <i>id.,</i> at 202\xe2\x80\x93205; and became a founding member of Athletes for Hope, an organization dedicated to helping athletes find and pursue charitable opportunities, <i>id.,</i> at 207\xe2\x80\x93208.  Following his retirement from professional football in 2008, Dunn launched two more charitable organizations in honor of his mother: Betty\xe2\x80\x99s Hope, a mobile bereavement program that offers no-cost grief counseling services to children in the Baton Rouge area, and Homes for Service, a program dedicated to helping service members, police officers, and firefighters achieve home ownership.  As Dunn once remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that was what my mother would have been most proud of: not my records, not my awards, but the way I used my worldly success to give something back.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 157.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Brumfield, meanwhile, has spent the last 20 years engaged in a ceaseless campaign of review proceedings.  He raised numerous challenges on direct appeal to the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s discovery orders, admission of evidence, jury instructions, and preservation of the record; the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s references during the penalty phase; and the alleged deficiencies of his trial counsel.  The Louisiana Supreme Court rejected each of these claims, <i>State </i>v. <i>Brumfield</i>,<i> </i>96\xe2\x80\x932667 (La. 10/20/98), 737 So.\xc2\xa02d 660, and this Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari, <i>Brumfield </i>v. <i>Louisiana</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1025 (1999)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2000, Brumfield filed his first petition for state post-conviction relief.  In that petition, among other things, he alleged 9 instances of prosecutorial misconduct, over 18 instances of ineffective assistance of counsel, and at least 17 constitutional errors in the jury instructions at the guilt phase of his trial.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Brumfield sought and received multiple extensions of time before finally filing his amended petition for state postconviction relief in 2003.  He raised many of the same claims as he had in his initial petition, but also asserted for the first time that he was mentally retarded and therefore ineligible for the death penalty under <i>Atkins </i>v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 304 (2002)\n.  In support of that claim, he alleged that his IQ score was 75, that his reading level was that of a fourth grader, that he was born prematurely with a low birth weight and indications of slower responses than normal babies, that he had suffered seizures and been prescribed a variety of medications since childhood, that he was twice treated in psychiatric hospitals during childhood and adolescence, and that he had been diagnosed with a learning disability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The state court denied Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  In a ruling from the bench, the court explained that not every defendant who requests an evidentiary<i> </i>hearing on an <i>Atkins </i>claim is entitled to one.  Based on its review of \xe2\x80\x9cthe application, the response, the record, portions of the transcript on that issue, and the evidence presented, including Dr. Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, Dr. Guin\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, which refers to and discusses Dr. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s report,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a, it concluded that Brumfield had not met his burden to make a threshold showing of mental retardation.  In particular, the court noted that Brumfield had an IQ score of 75 or higher and had demonstrated no impairment in adaptive skills.  Although Brumfield had requested fees to develop his <i>Atkins </i>claim, the trial court did not explicitly rule on the motion, and Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s counsel did not prompt him to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Brumfield then sought federal collateral review.  In his first habeas application, he repeated many of his claims, including the claim that he is ineligible to be executed under <i>Atkins</i>.  He requested funds to develop that claim in an evidentiary hearing.  The District Court dismissed all of his claims except for the <i>Atkins</i> one and ordered an evidentiary hearing.  As the majority describes, the District Court eventually granted a writ of habeas corpus.  It concluded that the state court had based its denial of Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Atkins</i> claim on an unreasonable determination of the facts and had unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedent in denying him funds to develop the<i> </i>claim.  The U.\xc2\xa0S.

See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Titlow</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  Here, the state court rejected Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Atkins </i>claim in an oral ruling as follows: </p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Bolter in particular found [Brumfield] had an IQ of over\xe2\x80\x94or 75.  Dr. Jordan actually came up with a little bit higher IQ.  I do not think that the defendant has demonstrated impairment based on the record in adaptive skills.  The doctor testified that he did have an anti-social personality or sociopath, and explained it as someone with no conscience, and the defendant hadn\xe2\x80\x99t carried his burden [of] placing the claim of mental retardation at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a\xe2\x80\x93172a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That statement contains three factual determinations: (1) Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s IQ was at least 75; (2) Brumfield had not demonstrated impairment in adaptive skills; and (3) Brumfield has an antisocial personality disorder.  Each of these facts is amply supported by the state-court record.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To begin, the record justifies a finding that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s IQ is 75, if not a bit higher.  Dr. Bolter testified, without contradiction, that Brumfield scored a 75 on the IQ test he administered and that \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Jordan rated [Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s] intelligence just a little higher than I did.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 3907.  Dr. Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s report similarly shows that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s test results were \xe2\x80\x9clower than estimated by Dr. Jordan in January of this year,\xe2\x80\x9d but it notes that \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Jordan was using a screening measure which proves to be less reliable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 272.  The parties dispute whether Dr. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s report was made part of the record, but to the extent it was, it confirms Dr. Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  Although it does not specify an IQ score, Dr. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s report states that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cintellectual function is slightly limited but gener-ally close to the Average Range\xe2\x80\x9d and that a psychological test showed him \xe2\x80\x9cto be intellectually functioning generally in the low Average Range.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 428a\xe2\x80\x93429a.  Because two thirds of all IQs are expected to lie between 85 and 115, a fair reading of Dr. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s statements would suggest an IQ score closer to 85.  See American Association on Mental Retardation, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 37 (9th ed. 1992).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The record likewise supports the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that Brumfield is not impaired in adaptive skills.  Under <i>Atkins</i>, the relevant adaptive skill areas are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308, n.\xc2\xa03.  Dr. Bolter reported that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s speech was \xe2\x80\x9cintelligible and prosodic\xe2\x80\x9d without \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of thought derailment,\xe2\x80\x9d Record 271, and that his writing appeared \xe2\x80\x9cnormal,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 273.  Brumfield lived independently before his arrest, often staying with his pregnant girlfriend and had been able to maintain a job for approximately three months before quitting \xe2\x80\x9cbecause his earnings were better through distributing drugs and selling firearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 271.  Although Brumfield reads at a fourth-grade level and spells and performs arithmetic at a sixth-grade level, Dr. Bolter concluded that he \xe2\x80\x9chas a normal capacity to learn and acquire information when given the opportunity for repetition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 276.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the record supports a finding that Brumfield has an antisocial personality disorder.  Dr. Bolter testified, without contradiction, that what manifested in childhood as a conduct disorder had developed in adulthood into an antisocial personality disorder.  He described that disorder as \xe2\x80\x9can absence of a conscience\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability to disregard the rights and feelings of others in favor of what you want\xe2\x80\x9d without any \xe2\x80\x9csense of compunction or remorse.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3909.  Dr. Guin acknowledged that Dr. Jordan had reached a similar diagnosis.  Brumfield presented no medical evidence disputing it.  That the majority disputes \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he relevance of this diagnosis,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 14, does not make it any less supported by the record.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Brumfield thus not only has failed to rebut the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings by clear and convincing evidence, \xc2\xa72254(e)(1), he has failed to show that they were anything other than eminently reasonable.  Under any fairminded application of \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), he would not be entitled to relief.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority reaches the opposite result with a bit of legerdemain, recasting <i>legal</i> determinations as <i>factual </i>ones.  It contends that the state court erred in denying Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s claim because the evidence Brumfield presented \xe2\x80\x9cwas entirely consistent with intellectual disability\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in Louisiana and thus sufficient to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing.  <i>Ante, </i>at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  That argument betrays the legal nature of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s dispute with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision: The majority does not\xe2\x80\x94because it cannot\xe2\x80\x94disagree that each of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings was supported by the record.  See<i> ante</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (not disputing Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s IQ score); <i>ante,</i> at 14 (not disputing Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosed antisocial personality disorder); <i>ibid. </i>(acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cevidence in the record before the state court may have cut against Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s claim of intellectual disability\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ante,</i> at 15 (acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cthe underlying facts of Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s crime might arguably provide reason to think that Brumfield possessed certain adaptive skills\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, the majority disagrees with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s <i>conclusion</i> that Brumfield had not made a sufficient threshold showing of mental retardation to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim.  <i>Ante, </i>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>That</i> conclusion, however, is properly characterized as one based on the application of law to fact, not on the determination of the facts themselves.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  As we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9cThe question whether a state court errs in determining the facts is a different question from whether it errs in applying the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rice </i>v. <i>Collins</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 333,\n342 (2006)\n.  No one can dispute that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s IQ score, adaptive skills, and antisocial personality disorder are facts.  By contrast, the question whether Brumfield has met the legal standard for relief on, or at least an evidentiary hearing with regard to, his <i>Atkins </i>claim requires the application of law to those facts.  See<i> Panetti </i>v. <i>Quarterman</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 930\n\xe2\x80\x93952 (2007) (applying \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) to conclude that a state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law when it failed to provide a prisoner with a competency hearing after he made \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a substantial threshold showing of insanity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Indeed, in discussing each of these \xe2\x80\x9cfactual determinations,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority turns first to state law to determine what showing a prisoner must make to qualify as mentally retarded.  <i>Ante, </i>at 9, 11 (citing <i>State </i>v. <i>Williams</i>, 2001\xe2\x80\x93165 (La. 11/1/02), 831 So.\xc2\xa02d 835).  If the majority\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision were truly based on \xe2\x80\x9cfactual determinations,\xe2\x80\x9d it is hard to understand what relevance state law would have.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even on its own terms, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s so-called \xe2\x80\x9cfactual\xe2\x80\x9d analysis fails.  The majority holds that the record sup-ported a finding that Brumfield qualified for a hearing on mental retardation under <i>state </i>law.  To reiterate, even if true, this state-law-based <i>legal </i>analysis cannot overcome AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s bar to relief under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  To make matters worse, the majority gets the state law wrong.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Louisiana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Williams </i>instructed state courts to use the statutory standard for determining when a pretrial competency hearing is necessary\xe2\x80\x94when there is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable ground to doubt the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental capacity to proceed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  831 So. 2d<i>,</i> at 858, n.\xc2\xa033 (quoting La.

As <i>Williams </i>explained, Louisiana statutes defined \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98more than two standard deviations below the mean for the test of intellectual functioning,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and a person with intellectual functioning two standard deviations below the mean \xe2\x80\x9cwould have an IQ of 70 using the Wechsler scale.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 853, and n. 26.  Accounting for the standard error of measurement, <i>Williams </i>explained that the requisite IQ could range \xe2\x80\x9cfrom 66 to 74.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 854, n.\xc2\xa026.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  The majority prefers to avoid this language, focusing instead on \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he sources on which <i>Williams </i>relied in defining subaverage intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  But the way to apply a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is to apply what the state court said, and, at 75 and higher, Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s IQ scores exceeded the cutoff for significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning under that decision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of alleged deficits in adaptive skills similarly failed to meet the requisite standards under Louisiana law.  <i>Williams</i> defined deficits in adaptive skills as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activity:\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (1) self-care, (2) understanding and use of language, (3) learning, (4) mobility, (5) self-direction, and (6) capacity for independent living.  831 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 853 (quoting then La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 28:381(12) (repealed 2005)).  The only evidence Brumfield presented that is even potentially relevant to these factors was evidence of his poor reading skills and behavioral problems in school.  But, once again, Dr. Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s report confirmed that he had \xe2\x80\x9ca normal capacity to learn and acquire information when given the opportunity for repetition\xe2\x80\x9d and that Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s behavioral problems were attributable to \xe2\x80\x9ca conduct disorder that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. progressed into an antisocial personality disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 276.  The majority places special weight on Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s placement in \xe2\x80\x9cspecial education\xe2\x80\x9d classes, <i>ante,</i> at 4, 13, n.\xc2\xa07, 14, 15, but the record explains that he was placed in <i>behavioral disorder</i> classes not because he had a low capacity to learn, but because he had a high capacity to make trouble, Record 3846\xe2\x80\x933847.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  The state court could reasonably have found that Brumfield had not provided evidence of \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial functional limitations\xe2\x80\x9d in any of these categories, let alone the <i>three</i> required by state law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Absent objective evidence of either significantly subaverage intellectual functioning or deficits in adaptive behavior, Brumfield was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing under <i>Williams</i>.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is erroneous: It takes a meritless state-law claim, recasts it as two factual determinations, and then awards relief, despite ample evidence in the record to support each of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s <i>actual </i>factual determinations.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority engages in such maneuvering because Brumfield argued <i>only </i>that the state court based its decision to deny his <i>Atkins </i>claim on an unreasonable determination of the facts, \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court, \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Brumfield, for his part, presented his claim in this way to avoid AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s additional restrictions on relief for alleged legal errors.  As explained below, overcoming \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s bar based on an alleged legal error is particularly demanding.

There being no mention of a hearing, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny Brumfield such a hearing could not be \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even if <i>Atkins did </i>establish a right to an evidentiary hearing upon a threshold showing of mental retardation, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny Brumfield a hearing would not be contrary to that rule.  After all, the state court took the position that Brumfield would have been entitled to an evidentiary hearing if he had made a threshold showing of mental retardation; it simply concluded that he had not made that showing.  This Court has never confronted a set of materially indistinguishable facts and found the threshold showing satisfied.  Thus, as with its rejection of the <i>Atkins </i>claim itself, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny Brumfield an <i>Atkins</i> hearing was not contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by this Court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision here likewise was not an unreasonable application of <i>Atkins</i>.  The <i>Atkins </i>Court did not clearly define the category \xe2\x80\x9cof mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 317.  It offered guidance in the form of several clinical definitions of mental retardation as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98subaverage intellectual functioning\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d accompanied by \xe2\x80\x9csignificant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 318.  It gave conflicting indications of the IQ score necessary for \xe2\x80\x9csubaverage intellectual functioning,\xe2\x80\x9d defining mild mental retardation as the term used to de-scribe \xe2\x80\x9cpeople with an IQ level of 50\xe2\x80\x9355 to approximately 70,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 308, n.\xc2\xa03; and citing one source that reports70 or less as the statistical criterion for mental retardation, <i>id.,</i> at 309, n.\xc2\xa05; see 2 Kaplan &amp; Sadock\xe2\x80\x99s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 2589 (B. Sadock &amp; V. Sadock eds., 7th ed. 2000); but commenting that \xe2\x80\x9can IQ between 70 and 75 or lower .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition,\xe2\x80\x9d 536 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 309, n.\xc2\xa05.  It offered no greater specificity with respect to \xe2\x80\x9csignificant limitations in adaptive skills,\xe2\x80\x9d though it remarked that, \xe2\x80\x9cby definition,\xe2\x80\x9d mentally retarded offenders \xe2\x80\x9chave diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 318.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The state court here reasonably applied the general rule announced in <i>Atkins</i> when it rejected Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Brumfield achieved a 75 on the IQ test administered to him by Dr. Bolter, 5 points above the score identified by <i>Atkins </i>as the upper end of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[m]ild\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d mental retardation, <i>id.</i>, at 308, n.\xc2\xa03, and by clinical definitions as the criterion for mental retardation.  He also scored somewhat higher on the IQ tests administered to him by Dr. Jordan.  In addition, he demonstrated no impairment in adaptive skills.  To the contrary, his test results \xe2\x80\x9cindicate[d] that his problem solving, judgment and reasoning skills are sufficient to meet the demands of everyday adulthood and he is not showing any decrement in the types of problems one would assume to see if they were suffering from an underlying organic basis or mental illness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 275.  Based on this record, the state court reasonably concluded that Brumfield had not come forward with evidence that he fell within the category of mentally retarded offenders about whom a national consensus against execution had developed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For the same reasons, even if one were to mischaracterize <i>Atkins </i>as clearly establishing a right to an evidentiary hearing upon a substantial threshold showing of mental retardation, the state court did not unreasonably apply that rule.  <i>Atkins </i>did not define the showing necessary, and the state court reasonably concluded that, on this record, Brumfield had not met it.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, \xc2\xa72254(d) bars Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Atkins </i>claim.  The facts upon which the state court rejected his claim are amply supported by the record and thus not unreasonable.  In concluding otherwise, the majority conflates questions of fact with questions about the application of law to fact.  That conflation may help it get around the inconveniences of \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law as determined by th[is Court],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), but it does violence to the statute and to our ordinary understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cfacts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, we have summarily reversed lower courts for making that same error.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Lopez </i>v. <i>Smith</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 8) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the Ninth Circuit claimed its disagreement with the state court was factual in nature, in reality its grant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the adequacy of the notice provided\xe2\x80\x9d).  We should hold ourselves to the same standard.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to afford relief on Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s first ground of alleged error in the state court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of his <i>Atkins </i>claim obviates its need to resolve his second, which focuses on the state court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of funding to develop that claim.  Because I would conclude that AEDPA bars relief on the first ground, I must also address the second.  AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s standards make short work of that ground as well.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The state court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of funding to Brumfield was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by this Court.  <i>No</i> precedent of this Court addresses whether and under what circumstances a state prisoner must be af-forded funds to develop an <i>Atkins </i>claim.  <i>Atkins</i> left \xe2\x80\x9cto the States the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 317 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  None of our decisions since <i>Atkins </i>have even purported to address constitutional requirements for funding of these claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Brumfield believes that the decision was contrary to, and involved an unreasonable application of <i>Ake </i>v. <i>Oklahoma</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 68 (1985)\n, and <i>Ford </i>v. <i>Wainwright</i>,\n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399\n, but neither of those decisions even involved protections for mentally retarded offenders.  Instead, both decisions addressed protections for prisoners asserting <i>insanity</i>\xe2\x80\x94<i>Ake </i>in the context of insanity as a defense to a crime, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 70, 77, and <i>Ford </i>in the context of insanity as a limitation on the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to execute a prisoner, 477 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 418 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Neither involved the question whether a prisoner is entitled to funds to develop an insanity claim before he has made a substantial threshold showing of that claim.  Only <i>Ake </i>addressed the question of funds at all, and it held that an indigent defendant has a right of \xe2\x80\x9caccess\xe2\x80\x9d to a competent psychiatrist to assist in the preparation of his insanity defense, <i>not</i> that an \xe2\x80\x9cindigent defendant has a constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 83.</i></p><i>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The state court fully complied with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions when it declined to award Brumfield funds.  Brumfield did not meet his burden to make a substantial threshold showing of mental retardation.  No decision of this Court requires a State to afford a defendant funds to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Over 20 years ago, Brumfield deprived the people of Baton Rouge of one of their police officers and six children of their mother.  A jury of his peers found Brumfield guilty of the crime and sentenced him to death.  The Louisiana courts afforded him full appellate and collateral-review proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today, the majority tosses those proceedings aside, concluding that the state court based its decision to deny Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Atkins </i>claim on an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable determination of the facts,\xe2\x80\x9d even as it concedes that the record includes evidence supporting that court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings.  Under AEDPA, that concession should bar relief for Brumfield.  In concluding otherwise, the majority distorts fed-eral law and intrudes upon Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign right to enforce its criminal laws and its courts\xe2\x80\x99 judgments.  Such willfulness is disheartening.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What is perhaps more disheartening than the majority\xe2\x80\x99s disregard for both AEDPA and our precedents is its disregard for the human cost of its decision.  It spares not a thought for the 20 years of judicial proceedings that its decision so casually extends.  It spares no more than a sentence to describe the crime for which a Louisiana jury sentenced Brumfield to death.  It barely spares the two words necessary to identify Brumfield\xe2\x80\x99s victim, Betty Smothers, by name.  She and her family\xe2\x80\x94not to mention our legal system\xe2\x80\x94deserve better.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>APPENDIX</b></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">W.
