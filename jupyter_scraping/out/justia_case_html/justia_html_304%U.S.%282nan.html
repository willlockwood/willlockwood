JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>National Grocery Company is a New Jersey corporation, which operates chain stores.  Since 1911, it has had $200,000 capital stock, all owned beneficially by Henry Kohl.  In the year ending January 31, 1931, the corporation\'s books showed a net profit of.$682,850.38, after paying $104,000 to Kohl as salary and the regular federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="284">Page 304 U. S. 284</a></p><p> corporation income tax of 12 percent.  Its surplus, as shown by its books, increased during the year from $7,245,824.26 to $7,938,965.54; that is, $693,141.28.  It paid no dividend.</p>\n<p>Section 104 of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 814, provides:</p>\n<p>"(a) If any corporation, however created or organized, is formed or availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its shareholders through the medium of permitting its gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed, there shall be levied, collected, and paid for each taxable year upon the net income of such corporation a tax equal to 50 percentum of the amount thereof, which shall be in addition to the tax imposed by section 13. . . ."</p>\n<p>"(b) The fact . . . that the gains or profits are permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business shall be <em>prima facie</em> evidence of a purpose to escape the surtax."</p>\n<p>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, having found that the corporation had been availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon Kohl by permitting the gains and profits to accumulate, assessed upon it, under \xc2\xa7 104, a deficiency tax of $477,322.81 for the tax year, in addition to the regular corporation income tax, which had been paid.  This amount, together with $37.87 admittedly due, constitutes the total deficiency assessment of $477,360.68.</p>\n<p>The corporation petitioned for a redetermination by the Board of Tax Appeals.  Before the Board, a large volume of evidence was introduced which had not been submitted to the Commissioner.  It detailed, among other things, the financial history of the business from its inception.  There were thirty-five elaborate exhibits, many of them prepared from the books with the cooperation of the counsel for the corporation and for the Commissioner.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="285">Page 304 U. S. 285</a></p><p> Twenty-four of the exhibits were introduced by the taxpayer; eleven by the Commissioner.  The taxpayer also presented as witnesses Kohl and the treasurer of the corporation, who testified orally to the history of the business, its practices and aims; local bank officials who testified as experts to the wisdom of accumulating the profits, and other experts who testified to the depreciation in 1930 of the market value of the securities held by the corporation and of its real estate.  The Board, by a bare majority, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] sustained the Commissioner\'s determination.  In stating its conclusions, it found as follow s:</p>\n<p>"We find as a fact that the petitioner\'s accumulation of earnings was far in excess of the \'reasonable needs\' of the corporate business."</p>\n<p>"We are also of opinion that the evidence of record does not rebut the <em>prima facie</em> presumption created by the statute that the accumulation of earnings beyond the \'reasonable needs of the business\' was for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its sole stockholder. . . ."</p>\n<p>"Upon the evidence before us, we have made the finding that the petitioner was \'availed of\' during the fiscal year ended January 31, 1931, for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its sole stockholder \'through the medium of permitting its gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\'"</p>\n<p>The corporation then petitioned for a review by the Circuit Court of Appeals.  It reversed the order of the Board, and did so on the ground that there was before the Board "no proof, substantial or otherwise, to support its imposition of" the tax.  Certiorari was sought by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="286">Page 304 U. S. 286</a></p><p> Commissioner, who urged that, in so deciding, the court had departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings.  We granted certiorari because of the importance in the administration of the revenue laws of the matter presented.</p>\n<p>The corporation makes here two contentions in support of the judgment which were not discussed by the Court of Appeals.  It challenges the constitutionality of the statute, and also urges that, in holding that there were "gains and profits," the Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals misconstrued the statute.  These contentions will be considered before examining the alleged lack of evidence to support the findings of the Board.</p>\n<p><em>First.</em>  The National Grocery Company concedes that \xc2\xa7 104 is constitutional as applied to a corporation organized for the purpose of preventing the imposition of surtaxes upon its shareholders, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] but urges five reasons why it should be held void as applied to a legitimate business corporation which is "availed of" for the forbidden purpose.  None of these reasons is sound.</p>\n<p>1. It is said that the statute violates the Tenth Amendment because it interferes with the power to declare or to withhold dividends -- a power which the State conferred upon the corporation.  The statute in no way limits the powers of the corporation.  It merely lays the tax upon corporations which use their powers to prevent imposition upon their stockholders of the federal surtaxes. "Congress in raising revenue has incidental power to defeat </p><p><a class="page-number" name="287">Page 304 U. S. 287</a></p><p> obstructions to that incidence of taxes which it chooses to impose."  <em>United Business Corp. v. Commissioner,</em> 62 F.2d 754, 756.</p>\n<p>Kohl\'s personal income tax for the calendar year 1931 was $32,034.74.  If he had included in his personal return of taxable income the corporation\'s entire net income for the fiscal year 1930-1931, an additional tax upon him of over $115,000 would have been due, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and no tax would have been assessable against the corporation under \xc2\xa7 104.  For the statute expressly provides, in paragraph (d), that the corporation shall not be so taxed if the stockholders make the return required to ensure the surtax:</p>\n<p>"(d) The tax imposed by this section shall not apply  if all the shareholders of the corporation include (at the time of filing their returns) in their gross income their entire distributive shares, whether distributed or not, of the net income of the corporation for such year.  Any amount so included in the gross income of a shareholder shall be treated as a dividend received.  Any subsequent distribution made by the corporation out of the earnings or profits for such taxable year shall, if distributed to any shareholder who has so included in his gross income his distributive share, be exempt from tax in the amount of the share so included. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="288">Page 304 U. S. 288</a></p><p></p>\n<p>2. It is said that the statute is unconstitutional because the liability imposed is not a tax upon income, but a penalty designed to force corporations to distribute earnings in order to create a basis for taxation against the stockholders.  If the business had been carried on by Kohl individually, all the year\'s profits would have been taxable to him.  If, having a partner, the business had been carried on as a partnership, all the year\'s profits would have been taxable to the partners individually, although these had been retained by the partnership undistributed.  <em>See Heiner v. Mellon, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/271/case.html">304 U. S. 271</a></span>.  Kohl, the sole owner of the business, could not, by conducting it as a corporation, prevent Congress, if it chose to do so, from laying on him individually the tax on the year\'s profits. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  If it preferred, Congress could lay the tax upon the corporation, as was done by \xc2\xa7 104.  The penal nature of the imposition does </p><p><a class="page-number" name="289">Page 304 U. S. 289</a></p><p> not prevent its being valid, as the tax was otherwise permissible under the Constitution.  <em>Compare Helvering v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/391/case.html">303 U. S. 391</a></span>.</p>\n<p>3. It is said that \xc2\xa7 104 is unconstitutional because the liability is laid upon the mere purpose to prevent imposition of the surtaxes, not upon the accomplishment of that purpose, and that, thus, it is a direct tax on the state of mind.  But this is not so.  The tax is laid "upon the net income of such corporation."  The existence of the defined purpose is a condition precedent to the imposition of the tax liability, but this does not prevent it from being a true income tax within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment.  The instances are many in which purpose or state of mind determines the incidence of an income tax. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>4. It is said that \xc2\xa7 104, as applied, deprived the corporation of its property without due process of law; that it is unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious in that no standard </p><p><a class="page-number" name="290">Page 304 U. S. 290</a></p><p> or formula is specified to guide the Commissioner in assessing, or the corporate directors in avoiding, the additional tax; that it is assessed retroactively, and that it is unfair to nonassenting minority stockholders.  The prescribed standard is not too vague.  As Judge Learned Hand said in <em>United Business Corp. v. Commissioner,</em> 62 F.2d 754, 756:</p>\n<p>"Standards of conduct, fixed no more definitely, are common in the law; the whole [law] of torts is pervaded by them; much of its commands are that a man must act as the occasion demands, the standard being available to all.  The vice of fixing maximum prices is that it requires recourse to standards beyond ascertainment by sellers, by which therefore they cannot in practice regulate their dealings.  That is not true of the reasonable needs of a business, which is immediately within the ken of the managers, the suppositous standard, though indeed objective, being as accessible as those, for example, of the prudent driving of a motor car, or of the diligence required in making a ship seaworthy, or of the extent of proper inquiry into the solvency of a debtor."</p>\n<p>Clearly, retroactive assessment is no more objectionable here than in the case of penalties for fraud or negligence.  <em>Helvering v. Mitchell, supra.</em>  And since no minority stockholders are here involved, the last objection need not be considered.  <em>Del Castillo v. McConnico,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/168/674/case.html">168 U. S. 674</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/168/674/case.html#680">168 U. S. 680</a></span>; <em>Atlantic Refining Co.  v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/22/case.html">302 U. S. 22</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/22/case.html#27">302 U. S. 27</a></span>.</p>\n<p>5. It is said that \xc2\xa7 104 is void because it delegates to the Commissioner legislative power.  The statute provides that, if the corporation is availed of for the forbidden purpose, the tax "shall be levied, collected, and paid," and certain facts are made <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the existence of this purpose.  No power is delegated to the Commissioner save that of finding facts upon evidence.</p>\n<p><em>Second.</em>  The corporation contends, as a matter of statutory construction, that \xc2\xa7 104 was not applicable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="291">Page 304 U. S. 291</a></p><p> because there were no "gains and profits" within the tax year.  Conceding that net income of $863,787.22 was earned, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] it asserts that there were "no gains and profits" because the depreciation in the securities owned, none of which was sold, exceeded $2,000,000.  The argument is that the word "gains" was not used as synonymous with "profits," but to express contemplated unrealized increases or accession in net worth of the assets, and that assessability under \xc2\xa7 104 depends not upon gains or profits, but upon the aggregate of gains (or losses) and profits, since prudent directors would take these into consideration in determining whether a dividend should be declared.  Depreciation in any of the assets is evidence to be considered by the Commissioner and the Board in determining the issue of fact whether the accumulation of profits was in excess of the reasonable needs of the business.  But obviously depreciation in the market value of securities which the corporation continues to hold does not, as matter of law, preclude a finding that the accumulation of the year\'s profits was in excess of the reasonable needs of the business.</p>\n<p><em>Third.</em>  There was ample evidence to support the findings of the Board of Tax Appeals.  The corporation held on January 31, 1930, bonds and stocks valued at $2,779,718.07; on January 31, 1931 it held $2,989,452.74 -- an increase of $209,734.67.  The list of these bonds and stocks showed that they were in no way related to a grocery business. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  That there was no need of accumulating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="292">Page 304 U. S. 292</a></p><p> any part of the year\'s earnings for the purpose of financing the business was shown by the balance sheet.  Comparing the cash on hand with the outstanding indebtedness, it appears that the $1,332,332.28 cash on hand January 31, 1930 exceeded the $1,161, 121.96 accounts payable, notes and mortgage, by $171,210.32.  On January 31, 1931, the excess of cash over accounts payable was $1,136,820.55.  These were then only $269,140.49, and the cash on hand was $1,405,961.04.  The notes payable and the mortgage had been discharged.</p>\n<p>That the purpose of accumulating this huge surplus was to escape the imposition upon Kohl of surtaxes was indicated by the following facts.  The $4,395,413.78 aggregate of bonds, stocks, and excess cash January 31, 1931, represents about four-fifths of the total accumulation of the surplus profits during the last ten years, which amounted to $5,742,455.35. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  If the surplus profits of the fiscal year 1930-1931 had been distributed as dividends, the additional surtaxes payable thereon by Kohl in the year 1931 would have been at least $90,744.56, and for the preceding nine years would have aggregated $1,240,852.30. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="293">Page 304 U. S. 293</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Further evidence to support the Board\'s findings that, in the tax year, dividends were omitted and the surplus accumulated in order to enable Kohl to escape these surtaxes is furnished by the following facts:  Kohl drew his salary of $104,000 a year, and that sum, as an expense of the business, was deducted before calculating the corporation\'s profit on which it paid taxes under \xc2\xa7 13 of the act.  He needed personally further sums, and took these in the form of loans.  In the tax year, Kohl borrowed from the corporation $140,000.  His aggregate indebtedness on January 31, 1931, for borrowings during seven years, was $610,000.  As was stated in <em>United Business Corp. v. Commissioner, supra,</em> p. 755:</p>\n<p>"These loans are incompatible with a purpose to strengthen the financial position of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="294">Page 304 U. S. 294</a></p><p> petitioner, but entirely accord with a desire to get the equivalent of his dividends under another guise.

A minimum figure, however, may be obtained.  The corporation\'s "net income," as defined in \xc2\xa7 104, was $954,645.62.  There must be deducted from this $103,654.47 for corporation income tax, and $100,000 was distributed as a dividend in 1931 and included in computing the tax paid by Kohl in that year.  Even assuming that the remaining $750,991.15 would have constituted his entire net income for 1931, and that the maximum deduction of 15% of this amount for charitable contributions could have been taken, a surtax of $119,328.50 would have been due.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The first statute which provided for taxation where corporate profits are accumulated for the purpose of preventing the imposition of surtaxes upon stockholders was the Tariff Act of 1913, \xc2\xa7 2A, subd. 1, 38 Stat. 166.

Section 112(k) of the Revenue Act of 1932, and \xc2\xa7 112(i) of the Acts of 1934 and 1936, provide for the disregard of the corporate entity in certain cases where foreign corporations are used for the purpose of avoiding federal taxes.
