If a first offense, a penalty of a fine of from $100 to $500 is provided; if a subsequent offense, the same fine, and imprisonment for not more than six months. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 189.990(10)(a) (1971). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="330">Page 427 U. S. 330</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellant\'s trial was scheduled for July 18, 1974, at 7 p.m., before the Lynch City Police Court.  Appellee C. B. Russell, who is not a lawyer, was the presiding judge.  Appellant\'s request for a jury was denied although, under Kentucky law, he was entitled to a jury trial.  Ky Const. \xc2\xa7 11; Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 25.014, 26.400 (1971).  Appellant pleaded not guilty.  Appellant was found guilty and sentenced to 30 days in jail, a fine of \xc2\xa7 150, and revocation of his driver\'s license.</p>\n<p>Section 156 of the Kentucky Constitution requires cities to be classified according to population size.  There are six classes of cities:  fifth-class cities have a population of between 1,000 and 3,000; sixth-class cities have a population of less than 1,000.  Lynch is a fifth-class city.  Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 81.010(5) (1971).  A police judge in fifth- and sixth-class cities must, by statute, be a voter and resident of the city for at least one year and be bonded, Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 26.200 (1971); the police judge in such cities need not be a lawyer.  Police judges in first-class cities, which have populations of over 100,000, must have the same qualifications as a circuit judge, who must be at least 35 years of age, a citizen of Kentucky, a two-year resident of the district, and a practicing attorney for eight years. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Ky.Const. \xc2\xa7 130; Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 26.140 (1971).  Police court judges have terms of four years.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 427 U. S. 331</a></p><p> In fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-class cities police judges may be either appointed or elected. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Ky.Const. \xc2\xa7 160.</p>\n<p>Police courts have jurisdiction, concurrent with circuit courts, of penal and misdemeanor cases punishable by a fine of not more than \xc2\xa7 500 and/or imprisonment of not more than 12 months.  Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 26.010 (1971).  Kentucky has a two-tier misdemeanor court system.  An appeal of right is provided from the decision of a police judge to the circuit court where all judges are lawyers, and in that court, a jury trial <em>de novo</em> may be had.  Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 23.032 (1971); Ky.Rule Crim.Proc. 12.06.</p>\n<p>Appellant did not appeal to the Kentucky circuit court for a trial <em>de novo</em> to which he was entitled.  After being sentenced by appellee judge, appellant challenged the statutory scheme described above by a writ of habeas corpus in the Harlan County Circuit Court, where he was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 427 U. S. 332</a></p><p> represented by an attorney.  Appellant contended that his federal due process and equal protection rights had been abridged because he had been tried and convicted in a court presided over by a judge without legal training, and thus without legal competence.  The State Circuit Court issued the writ, granted bail, and held an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court noted that appellant was not challenging the adequacy of the proceedings before appellee Russell, and hence rested on the appellant\'s pleadings, which the court found were purposefully limited to the issue whether appellant could be tried before a judge who was not legally trained when persons similarly situated but residing in larger cities would be tried by a judge trained in the law.  The Circuit Court denied relief on the basis of the Kentucky Court of Appeals holding in <em>Ditty v. Hampton,</em> 490 S.W.2d 772 (1972), <em>appeal dismissed,</em> 414 U.S. 885 (1973).  The Kentucky Court of Appeals in turn affirmed the denial of relief on the basis of <em>Ditty v. Hampton, supra,</em> noting that appellant could apply for bail in the event of an appeal from the Lynch Police Court judgment. 516 S.W.2d 103 (1974).</p>\n<p>When this case first came here on appeal we vacated the judgment and remanded it "for further consideration in light of the position presently asserted by the Commonwealth."  419 U.S. 1085 (1974).  The Attorney General of Kentucky in his motion to dismiss or affirm had requested that this Court remand the case to the Kentucky Court of Appeals for consideration of violations of state law based on the suggestion that appellee judge had</p>\n<p>"mistakenly imposed a sentence of imprisonment upon appellant for a first offense of driving while intoxicated, whereas imprisonment is not an authorized punishment for first offenders. . . ."</p>\n<p>The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="333">Page 427 U. S. 333</a></p><p> Kentucky Attorney General conceded that the writ of habeas corpus should have been granted and requested an opportunity to correct the error.</p>\n<p>On remand, however, the Kentucky Court of Appeals declined to decide the case on the state grounds presented by the Attorney General, noting that the federal constitutional issue "was and is the only issue before us."  That court noted that appellant sought only to "test the constitutional status of lay judges in criminal cases."  No. 74-723 (Mar. 21, 1975).</p>\n<p>On the second appeal to this Court we noted probable jurisdiction.  422 U.S. 1040 (1975).</p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellant\'s first claim is that, when confinement is a possible penalty, a law-trained judge is required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whether or not a trial <em>de novo</em> before a lawyer-judge is available. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 427 U. S. 334</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It must be recognized that there is a wide gap between the functions of a judge of a court of general jurisdiction, dealing with complex litigation, and the functions of a local police court judge trying a typical "drunk" driver case or other traffic violations.  However, once it appears that confinement is an available penalty, the process commands scrutiny.  <em>See Argersinger v. Hamlin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/25/case.html">407 U. S. 25</a></span> (1972).</p>\n<p>Appellant argues that the right to counsel articulated in <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, supra,</em> and <em>Gideon v. Wainwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html">372 U. S. 335</a></span> (1963), is meaningless without a lawyer-judge to understand the arguments of counsel.  Appellant also argues that the increased complexity of substantive and procedural criminal law requires that all judges now be lawyers in order to be able to rule correctly on the intricate issues lurking even in some simple misdemeanor cases.  In the context of the Kentucky procedures, however, it is unnecessary to reach the question whether a defendant could be convicted and imprisoned after a proceeding in which the only trial afforded is conducted by a lay judge.  In all instances, a defendant in Kentucky facing a criminal sentence is afforded an opportunity to be tried <em>de novo</em> in a court presided over by a lawyer-judge, since an appeal automatically vacates the conviction in police court.  Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 23.032 (1971); Ky.Rule Crim.Proc. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="335">Page 427 U. S. 335</a></p><p> 12.06.  The trial <em>de novo</em> is available after either a trial or a plea of guilty in the police court; a defendant is entitled to bail while awaiting the trial <em>de novo.</em>  516 S.W.2d 103 (1974).</p>\n<p>It is obvious that many defendants charged with a traffic violation or other misdemeanor may be uncounseled when they appear before the police court.  They may be unaware of their right to a <em>de novo</em> trial after a judgment is entered, since the decision is likely to be prompt.  We assume that police court judges recognize their obligation under <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, supra,</em> to inform defendants of their right to a lawyer if a sentence of confinement is to be imposed.  The appellee judge testified that informing defendants of a right to counsel was "the standard procedure."  App. 32.  We also assume that police court judges in Kentucky recognize their obligation to inform all convicted defendants, including those who waived counsel or for whom imprisonment was not imposed, of their unconditional right to a trial <em>de novo</em> and of the necessity that an "appeal" be filed within 30 days in order to implement that right.  Ky.Rule Crim.Proc. 12.04.</p>\n<p>In <em>Colten v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/104/case.html">407 U. S. 104</a></span> (1972), we considered Kentucky\'s two-tier system there challenged on other grounds.  We noted:</p>\n<p>"The right to a new trial is absolute.  A defendant need not allege error in the inferior court proceeding.  If he seeks a new trial, the Kentucky statutory scheme contemplates that the slate be wiped clean.  Ky.Rule Crim.Proc. 12.06.  Prosecution and defense begin anew. . . .  The case is to be regarded exactly as if it had been brought there in the first instance."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/104/case.html#113">407 U. S. 113</a></span>.  We went on to note that the justifications urged by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="336">Page 427 U. S. 336</a></p><p> States for continuing such tribunals [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] are the "increasing burdens on state judiciaries" and the "interest of both the defendant and the State, to provide speedier and less costly adjudications" than those provided in courts "where the full range of constitutional guarantees is available. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/104/case.html#114">407 U. S. 114</a></span>.  Moreover, state policy takes into account that it is a convenience to those charged to be tried in or near their own community, rather than travel to a distant court where a law-trained judge is provided, and to have the option, as here, of a trial after regular business hours.  We took note of these practical considerations in <em>Colten:</em></p>\n<p>"We are not persuaded, however, that the Kentucky arrangement for dealing with the less serious offenses disadvantages defendants any more or any less than trials conducted in a court of general jurisdiction in the first instance, as long as the latter are always available.  Proceedings in the inferior courts are simple and speedy, and, if the results in Colten\'s case are any evidence, the penalty is not characteristically severe.  Such proceedings offer a defendant the opportunity to learn about the prosecution\'s case and, if he chooses, he need not reveal his own.  He may also plead guilty without a trial and promptly secure a <em>de novo</em> trial in a court of general criminal jurisdiction."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/104/case.html#118">407 U.

S. 61</a></span>-62 (1972), appellant argues that he is entitled to a lawyer-judge in the first instance.  There the judge was also mayor and the village received a substantial portion of its income from fines imposed by him as judge.  Similarly in <em>Tumey v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/273/510/case.html">273 U. S. 510</a></span> (1927), the challenge was directed not at the training or education of the judge but at his possible bias due to interest in the outcome of the case, because, as in <em>Monroeville,</em> he was both mayor and judge and received a portion of his compensation directly from the fines.  Financial interest in the fines was thought to risk a possible bias in finding guilt and fixing the amount of fines, and the Court found that potential for bias impermissible.</p>\n<p>Under the Kentucky system, as we noted in <em>Colten,</em> a defendant can have an initial trial before a lawyer-judge by pleading guilty in the police court, thus bypassing that court and seeking the <em>de novo</em> trial, "erasing . . . any consequence that would otherwise follow from tendering the [guilty] plea."  407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/104/case.html#119">407 U.

Indeed, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="338">Page 427 U. S. 338</a></p><p> in <em>Shadwick</em> the probable cause evaluation made by the lay magistrate related to a charge of "impaired driving." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p><em>(3)\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellant\'s second claim is that Kentucky\'s constitutional provisions classifying cities by population and its statutory provisions permitting lay judges to preside in some cities while requiring law-trained judges in others denies him the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  However, all people within a given city and within cities of the same size are treated equally.</p>\n<p>The Kentucky Court of Appeals in <em>Ditty v. Hampton, supra,</em> articulated reasons for the differing qualifications of police court judges in cities of different size:</p>\n<p>"1. The greater volume of court business in the larger cities requires that judges be attorneys to enable the courts to operate efficiently and expeditiously (not necessarily with more fairness and impartiality)."</p>\n<p>"2.

On November 4, 1975, the Kentucky voters ratified the judicial amendment to the Kentucky Constitution, effective January 1, 1976.  It provides, in part, that, by January 1, 1978, all the county, quarterly, justice of the peace, and police courts will be combined into one district court in each of the 120 counties.  These counties are to be allocated among 55 districts and each district is to elect at least one district judge who must be an attorney licensed in Kentucky.  A district judge in multi-county districts must appoint a trial commissioner for each county in which no district judge resides.  The commissioner must be an attorney if one is qualified and available.  The commissioner will have the power to perform such duties of the district court as may be prescribed by the Kentucky Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>The case is not mooted by this judicial amendment, since the police courts will continue to function as challenged until January 1, 1978, and since the new amendment still permits nonlawyer judges to sit.

Left without the aid of counsel, he may be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible.  He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one.  He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.

For if the judge himself is ignorant of the law, then he, too, will be incapable of determining whether the charge "is good or bad."  He, too, will be "unfamiliar with the rules of evidence."

First, this argument assumes without any factual support that the defendant will be informed of his right to a trial <em>de novo.</em> [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Second, the procedure would still necessitate multiple court appearances, at the cost of both delay and an increased financial burden for attorneys\' fees and court costs.

In short, I cannot accept the suggestion that, as a prerequisite to a constitutionally fair trial, a defendant must stand up in open court and inform a judge that he is guilty when in fact he believes that he is not.</p>\n<p>At Runnymede in 1215, King John pledged to his barons that he would "not make any Justices, Constables, Sheriffs, or Bailiffs, excepting of such as know the laws of the land. . . ."
