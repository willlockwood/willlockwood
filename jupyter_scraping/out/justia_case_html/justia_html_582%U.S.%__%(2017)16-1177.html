In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that this demanding standard was met by a Virginia court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <i>Graham </i>v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 48 (2010)\n.  The question presented is whether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling involved an unreasonable application of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">On July 6, 1999, respondent Dennis LeBlanc raped a 62-year-old woman.  He was 16 at the time.  In 2003, a state trial court sentenced him to life in prison for his crimes.  In the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, Virginia had, for felony offenders, abolished parole that followed a traditional framework.  See Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa753.1\xe2\x80\x93165.1 (2013).  As a form of replacement, Virginia enacted its so-called \xe2\x80\x9cgeriatric release\xe2\x80\x9d program, which allows older inmates to receive conditional release under some circumstances.  <i>LeBlanc </i>v. <i>Mathena</i>, 841 F.\xc2\xa03d 256, 261 (CA4 2016) (citing Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa753.1\xe2\x80\x9340.01).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Seven years after respondent was sentenced, this Court decided <i>Graham </i>v. <i>Florida</i>.  <i>Graham </i>established that the\n \nEighth Amendment prohibits juvenile offenders convicted of nonhomicide offenses from being sentenced to life without parole.  While a \xe2\x80\x9cState is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held, it must \xe2\x80\x9cgive defendants like Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75.  The Court in <i>Graham </i>left it to the States, \xe2\x80\x9cin the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance\xe2\x80\x9d with the <i>Graham</i> rule.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent later filed a motion in state trial court\xe2\x80\x94the Virginia Beach Circuit Court\xe2\x80\x94seeking to vacate his sentence in light of <i>Graham</i>.  The trial court denied the motion.  In so doing, it relied on the Supreme Court of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Angel </i>v. <i>Commonwealth</i>, 281 Va. 248, 704 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 386 (2011).  The <i>Angel </i>court<i> </i>held that Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s geriatric release program satisfies <i>Graham</i>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of parole for juvenile offenders.  The statute establishing the program provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cAny person serving a sentence imposed upon a conviction for a felony offense .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. (i) who has reached the age of sixty-five or older and who has served at least five years of the sentence imposed or (ii) who has reached the age of sixty or older and who has served at least ten years of the sentence imposed may petition the Parole Board for conditional release.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa753.1\xe2\x80\x9340.01.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Angel </i>court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he regulations for conditional release under this statute provide that if the prisoner meets the qualifications for consideration contained in the statute, the factors used in the normal parole consideration process apply to conditional release decisions under this statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  281 Va., at 275, 704 S. E. 2d, at 402.  The geriatric release program thus complied with <i>Graham</i>, the <i>Angel </i>court held,<i> </i>because it provided \xe2\x80\x9cthe meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation required by the Eighth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  281 Va., at 275, 704 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 402 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Virginia Supreme Court, in reviewing the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in the instant case, summarily denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s requests for appeal and for rehearing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2012, respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the Eastern District of Virginia pursuant to\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.  A Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing the petition, but the District Court disagreed and granted the writ.  The District Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no possibility that fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision conflicts wit[h] the dictates of <i>Graham</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>LeBlanc </i>v. <i>Mathena</i>,<i> </i>2015 WL 4042175, *18 (July 1, 2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling was an unreasonable application of <i>Graham</i>.  841 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 259\xe2\x80\x93260.  In the panel majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s geriatric release program did not provide a meaningful opportunity for juvenile nonhomicide offenders to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Judge Niemeyer dissented.  He criticized the majority for \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ing] to respect, in any meaningful way, the deference Congress requires federal courts to give state court decisions on postconviction review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 275.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Commonwealth of Virginia petitioned for certiorari.

This is \xe2\x80\x9cmeant to be\xe2\x80\x9d a difficult standard to meet.  <i>Harrington </i>v. <i>Richter</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86,\n102 (2011)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred by failing to accord the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision the deference owed under AEDPA.  <i>Graham </i>did not decide that a geriatric release program like Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s failed to satisfy the\n \nEighth Amendment because that question was not presented.  And it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that, because the geriatric release program employed normal parole factors, it satisfied <i>Graham</i>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that juveniles convicted of a nonhomicide crime have a meaningful opportunity to receive parole.  The geriatric release program instructs Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Parole Board to consider factors like the \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x99s history .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and the individual\xe2\x80\x99s conduct .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. during incarceration,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinter-personal relationships with staff and inmates\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[c]hanges in attitude toward self and others.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 841 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 280\xe2\x80\x93281 (Niemeyer, J., dissenting) (citing Virginia Parole Board Policy Manual 2\xe2\x80\x934 (Oct. 2006)).  Consideration of these factors could allow the Parole Board to order a former juvenile offender\xe2\x80\x99s conditional release in light of his or her \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Graham</i>, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75.<i> </i>The state court thus did not diverge so far from <i>Graham</i>\xe2\x80\x99s dictates<i> </i>as to make it \xe2\x80\x9cso obvious that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. there could be no \xe2\x80\x98fairminded disagreement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d about whether the state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling conflicts with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law.  <i>White</i> v. <i>Woodall</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the logical next step from\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Graham </i>would be to hold that a geriatric release program does not satisfy the\n \nEighth Amendment, but \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps not.\xe2\x80\x9d  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).<i>  \xe2\x80\x9c</i>[T]here are reasonable arguments on both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312).  With respect to petitioners, these include the arguments discussed above.  <i>Supra, </i>at 4.  With regards to respondent, these include the contentions that the Parole Board\xe2\x80\x99s substantial discretion to deny geriatric release deprives juvenile nonhomicide offenders a meaningful opportunity to seek parole and that juveniles cannot seek geriatric release until they have spent at least four decades in prison.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These arguments cannot be resolved on federal habeas review.  Because this case arises \xe2\x80\x9conly in th[at] narrow context,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[es] no view on the merits of the underlying\xe2\x80\x9d\n \nEighth Amendment claim.  <i>Woods</i>, <i>supra, </i>at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor does the Court \xe2\x80\x9csuggest or imply that the underlying issue, if presented on direct review, would be insubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Marshall</i> v. <i>Rodgers</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 7); accord, <i>Woodall</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 5). <i> </i>The Court today holds only that the Virginia trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, resting on the Virginia Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier ruling in <i>Angel</i>, was not objectively unreasonable in light of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s current case law.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">A proper respect for AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s high bar for habeas relief avoids unnecessarily \xe2\x80\x9cdisturb[ing] the State\xe2\x80\x99s significant interest in repose for concluded litigation, den[ying] soci-ety the right to punish some admitted offenders, and in-trud[ing] on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Harrington</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The federalism interest implicated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance in this case, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding created the potential for significant discord in the Virginia sentencing process.  Before today, Virginia courts were permitted to impose\xe2\x80\x94and required to affirm\xe2\x80\x94a sentence like respondent\xe2\x80\x99s, while federal courts presented with the same fact pattern were required to grant ha-beas relief.  Reversing the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision in this case\xe2\x80\x94rather than waiting until a more substantial split of authority develops\xe2\x80\x94spares Virginia courts from having to confront this legal quagmire.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, the petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3746297">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">VIRGINIA, et\xc2\xa0al. <i>v.</i> DENNIS LeBLANC</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">No. 16\xe2\x80\x931177.\xe2\x80\x83Decided June 12, 2017</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Graham</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 48 (2010)\n, as today\xe2\x80\x99s <i>per curiam</i> recognizes, established that a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide offense must have \xe2\x80\x9csome meaningful opportunity to obtain release [from prison] based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 75.
