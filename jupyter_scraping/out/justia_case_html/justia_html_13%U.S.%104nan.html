S. 119</a></p><p></p>\n<p>STORY, J. delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>The United States brought an action of debt against the defendants on a bond given for the payment of duties on goods imported in the brig <em>Dover</em> into the port of Providence.</p>\n<p>Upon the pleadings in the court below, judgment was given in favor of the United States, and the defendants have brought the present writ of error to reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p>The material facts are that the brig arrived within the limits of the United States on 30 June, 1812, and within the Collection District of Providence, on 1 July, 1812.  On 2 July, an entry was duly made at the custom house and the present bond was then executed.</p>\n<p>The principal question which has been argued is whether on these facts the goods are liable to the payment of the double duties imposed by the act of 1 July, 1812, ch. 112.  That act provides</p>\n<p>"That an additional duty of 100 percent upon the permanent duties now imposed by law, &amp;c., shall be levied and collected upon all goods, wares, and merchandises which shall, from and after the passing of this act, be imported into the United States from any foreign port or place."</p>\n<p>It is contended that this statute did not take effect until the second day of July, nor indeed until it was formally promulgated and published.  We cannot yield assent to this construction.  The statute was to take effect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="120">Page 13 U. S. 120</a></p><p> from its passage, and it is a general rule that where the computation is to be made from an act done, the day on which the act is done is to be included.</p>\n<p>It is further contended that the importation was complete by the arrival of the vessel within the jurisdictional limits of the United States on 30 June.  We have no difficulty in overruling this argument.  To constitute an importation so as to attach the right to duties, it is necessary not only that there should be an arrival within the limits of the United States and of a collection district, but also within the limits of some port of entry.  This was expressly decided in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/368/case.html">United States v. Vowell,</a></span></em> 5 Cranch 368.</p>\n<p>Without therefore adverting to the consideration of the regularity or sufficiency of the pleadings, we are all of opinion that on the merits the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed with six percent damages and costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
