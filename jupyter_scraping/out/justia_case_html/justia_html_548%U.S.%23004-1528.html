Soon after Act 64 became law, the petitioners\xe2\x80\x94individuals who have run for state office, citizens who vote in state elections and contribute to campaigns, and political parties and committees participating in state politics\xe2\x80\x94brought this suit against the respondents, state officials charged with enforcing the Act.  The District Court held that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits violate the First Amendment, see <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, and that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limits on political parties\xe2\x80\x99 contributions to candidates were unconstitutional, but found the other contribution limits constitutional.  The Second Circuit held that <em>all </em>of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are constitutional, ruled that the expenditure limits may be constitutional because they are supported by compelling interests in preventing corruption or its appearance and in limiting the time state officials must spend raising campaign funds, and remanded for the District Court to determine whether the expenditure limits were narrowly tailored to those interests.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">382 F.\xc2\xa03d 91, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded in Parts I, II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x933, III, and IV that both of Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s sets of limitations are inconsistent with the First Amendment.

S., at 25, provided sufficient justification for the contribution limitations imposed on campaigns for federal office by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, <em>id.,</em> at 23\xe2\x80\x9338, but that FECA\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment, <em>id.,</em> at 39\xe2\x80\x9359.  The Court explained that the difference between the two kinds of limitations is that expenditure limits \xe2\x80\x9cimpose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association than\xe2\x80\x9d do contribution limits.  <em>Id.</em>, at 23.  Contribution limits, though a \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal restriction,\xe2\x80\x9d nevertheless leave the contributor \xe2\x80\x9cfre[e] to discuss candidates and issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Expenditure limits, by contrast, impose \xe2\x80\x9c[a] restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 19, and thereby necessarily \xe2\x80\x9creduc[e] the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>For over 30 years, in considering the constitutionality of a host of campaign finance statutes, this Court has adhered to <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s constraints, including those on expenditure limits.  See, <em>e.g., McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/93/index.html">540 U. S. 93</a>, 134.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The respondents argue unpersuasively that <em>Buckley </em>should be distinguished from the present cases on a ground they say <em>Buckley </em>did not consider: that expenditure limits help to protect candidates from spending too much time raising money rather than devoting that time to campaigning among ordinary voters.  There is no significant basis for that distinction.  Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits are not substantially different from those at issue in <em>Buckley.  </em>Nor is Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s primary justification for imposing its expenditure limits significantly different from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 rationale for the <em>Buckley</em> limits: preventing corruption and its appearance.  The respondents say unpersuasively that, had the <em>Buckley </em>Court considered the time protection rationale for expenditure limits, the Court would have upheld those limits in the FECA.  The <em>Buckley </em>Court, however, was aware of the connection between expenditure limits and a reduction in fundraising time.  And, in any event, the connection seems perfectly obvious.  Under these circumstances, the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument amounts to no more than an invitation so to limit <em>Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s </em>holding<em> </em>as effectively to overrule it.  That invitation is declined.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits violate the First Amendment because those limits, in their specific details, burden protected interests in a manner disproportionate to the public purposes they were enacted to advance.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In upholding the $1,000 contribution limit before it, the <em>Buckley </em>Court recognized, <em>inter alia,</em> that such limits, unlike expenditure limits, \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] little direct restraint on\xe2\x80\x9d the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s speech, 424 U. S., at 21, and are permissible as long as the government demonstrates that they are \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to match a \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important interest,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 25.  It found that the interest there advanced, \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[ing] corruption\xe2\x80\x9d and its \xe2\x80\x9cappearance,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important\xe2\x80\x9d to justify the contribution limits, <em>id.</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326, and that those limits were \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although recognizing that, in determining whether a particular contribution limit was \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn,\xe2\x80\x9d the amount, or level, of that limit could make a difference, see <em>id.</em>, at 21, the Court added that such \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctions in degree become significant only when they \xe2\x80\xa6 amount to differences in kind,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 30.  Pointing out that it had \xe2\x80\x9cno scalpel to probe, whether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> the Court found \xe2\x80\x9cno indication\xe2\x80\x9d that FECA\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limitations would have \xe2\x80\x9cany dramatic adverse effect on the funding of campaigns,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 21.  Since <em>Buckley</em>, the Court has consistently upheld contribution limits in other statutes, but has recognized that such limits might <em>sometimes</em> work more harm to protected First Amendment interests than their anticorruption objectives could justify, see, <em>e.g., Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html"></a><a href="/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 395\xe2\x80\x93397.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Although the Court has \xe2\x80\x9cno scalpel to probe,\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U. S., at 30, with exactitude whether particular contribution limits are too low and normally defers to the legislature in that regard, it must nevertheless recognize the existence of some lower bound, as <em>Buckley</em> acknowledges.  While the interests served by contribution limits, preventing corruption and its appearance, \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly implicate the integrity of our electoral process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 136, that does not simply mean the lower the limit, the better.  Contribution limits that are too low also can harm the electoral process by preventing challengers from mounting effective campaigns against incumbent officeholders, thereby reducing democratic accountability.  Where there is strong indication in a particular case, <em>i.e.</em>, danger signs, that such risks exist (both present in kind and likely serious in degree), courts, including appellate courts, must review the record independently and carefully with an eye toward assessing the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctailoring,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> toward assessing the restrictions\xe2\x80\x99 proportionality.  See <em>Bose Corp.</em> v. <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/485/index.html">466 U. S. 485</a>, 499.  Danger signs that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits may fall outside tolerable First Amendment limits are present here.  They are substantially lower than both the limits the Court has previously upheld and the comparable limits in force in other States.  Consequently, the record must be examined to determine whether Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to match the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9319. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The record demonstrates that, from a constitutional perspective, Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are too restrictive.  Five sets of factors, taken together, lead to the conclusion that those limits are not narrowly tailored.  <em>First, </em>the record suggests, though it does not conclusively prove, that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits will significantly restrict the amount of funding available for challengers to run competitive campaigns.  <em>Second,</em> Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that a political party and all of its affiliates together abide by <em>exactly </em>the same low $200 to $400 contribution limits that apply to individual contributors threatens harm to a particularly important political right, the right to associate in a political party.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>California Democratic Party</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/567/index.html">530 U. S. 567</a>, 574.  Although the Court upheld federal limits on political parties\xe2\x80\x99 contributions to candidates in <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/431/index.html">533 U. S. 431</a>, the limits there at issue were far less problematic, for they were significantly higher than Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s limits, see, <em>e.g., id.</em>, at 438\xe2\x80\x93439, and n.\xc2\xa03, and they were much higher than the federal limits on contributions from individuals to candidates, see <em>id.</em>, at 453.  <em>Third, </em>Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of volunteer services aggravates the problem.  Although the Act excludes uncompensated volunteer services from its \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d definition, it does not exclude the expenses volunteers incur, <em>e.g., </em>travel expenses, in the course of campaign activities.  The combination of very low contribution limits and the absence of an exception excluding volunteer expenses may well impede a campaign\xe2\x80\x99s ability effectively to use volunteers, thereby making it more difficult for individuals to associate in this way.  Cf. <em>Buckley, supra,</em> at 22.  <em>Fourth, </em>unlike the contribution limits upheld in <em>Shrink,</em> Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s limits are not adjusted for inflation, but decline in real value each year.  A failure to index limits means that limits already suspiciously low will almost inevitably become too low over time.  <em>Fifth, </em>nowhere in the record is there any special justification for Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s low and restrictive contribution limits.  Rather, the basic justifications the State has advanced in support of such limits are those present in <em>Buckley.  </em>Indeed, other things being equal, one might reasonably believe that a contribution of, say, $250 (or $450) to a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign was less likely to prove a corruptive force than the far larger contributions at issue in the other campaign finance cases the Court has considered.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0It is not possible to sever some of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limit provisions from others that might remain fully operative.  Doing so would require the Court to write words into the statute (inflation indexing), to leave gaping loopholes (no limits on party contributions), or to foresee which of many different possible ways the Vermont Legislature might respond to the constitutional objections to Act 64.  In these circumstances, the legislature likely would not have intended the Court to set aside the statute\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits.  The legislature is free to rewrite those provisions to address the constitutional difficulties here identified.  Pp. 28\xe2\x80\x9329. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer, joined by The Chief Justice in Parts II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x931 and II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932, rejected the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that <em>Buckley</em> should, in effect, be overruled because subsequent experience has shown that contribution limits alone cannot effectively deter corruption or its appearance.  <em>Stare decisis, </em>the basic legal principle commanding judicial respect for a court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier decisions and their rules of law, prevents the overruling of <em>Buckley</em>.  Adherence to precedent is the norm; departure from it is exceptional, requiring \xe2\x80\x9cspecial justification,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Arizona </em>v.<em> Rumsey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/203/index.html">467 U. S. 203</a>, 212, especially where, as here, the principle at issue has become settled through iteration and reiteration over a long period.  There is no special justification here.  Subsequent case law has not made <em>Buckley </em>a legal anomaly or otherwise undermined its basic legal principles.  Cf. <em>Dickerson </em>v.<em> United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 443.  Nor is there any demonstration that circumstances have changed so radically as to undermine <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>critical factual assumptions.  The respondents have not shown, for example, any dramatic increase in corruption or its appearance in Vermont; nor have they shown that expenditure limits are the only way to attack that problem.  Cf. <em>McConnell, supra.  </em>Finally, overruling <em>Buckley</em> now would dramatically undermine the considerable reliance that Congress and state legislatures have placed upon it in drafting campaign finance laws.  And this Court has followed <em>Buckley, </em>upholding and applying its reasoning in later cases.

S. 1</a>, provides insufficient protection to political speech, the core of the First Amendment, is therefore illegitimate and not protected by <em>stare decisis</em>, and should be overruled and replaced with a standard faithful to the Amendment.  This Court erred in <em>Buckley</em> when it distinguished between contribution and expenditure limits, finding the former to be a less severe infringement on First Amendment rights.

Well-established precedent makes clear that the expenditure limits violate the First Amendment.  <em>Buckley </em>v.<em> Valeo, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, 54\xe2\x80\x9358 (1976) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The contribution limits are unconstitutional because in their specific details (involving low maximum levels and other restrictions) they fail to satisfy the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of careful tailoring.  <em>Id.</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9330.  That is to say, they impose burdens upon First Amendment interests that (when viewed in light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate objectives) are disproportionately severe.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to 1997, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s campaign finance law imposed no limit upon the amount a candidate for state office could spend. It did, however, impose limits upon the amounts that individuals, corporations, and political committees could contribute to the campaign of such a candidate.  Individuals and corporations could contribute no more than $1,000 to any candidate for state office.  \xc2\xa72805(a) (1996).  Political committees, excluding political parties, could contribute no more than $3,000.  \xc2\xa72805(b).  The statute imposed no limit on the amount that political parties could contribute to candidates.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1997, Vermont enacted a more stringent campaign finance law, Pub. Act No. 64, codified at Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, \xc2\xa72801 <em>et seq. </em>(2002) (hereinafter Act or Act 64), the statute at issue here.  Act 64, which took effect immediately after the 1998 elections, imposes mandatory expenditure limits on the total amount a candidate for state office can spend during a \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-year general election cycle,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, the primary plus the general election, in approximately the following amounts: governor, $300,000; lieutenant governor, $100,000; other statewide offices, $45,000; state senator, $4,000 (plus an additional $2,500 for each additional seat in the district); state representative (two-member district), $3,000; and state representative (single member district), $2,000.  \xc2\xa72805a(a).  These limits are adjusted for inflation in odd-numbered years based on the Consumer Price Index.  \xc2\xa72805a(e).  Incumbents seeking reelection to statewide office may spend no more than 85% of the above amounts, and incumbents seeking reelection to the State Senate or House may spend no more than 90% of the above amounts.  \xc2\xa72805a(c).  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xpenditure\xe2\x80\x9d broadly to mean the</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cpayment, disbursement, distribution, advance, deposit, loan or gift of money or anything of value, paid or promised to be paid, for the purpose of influencing an election, advocating a position on a public question, or supporting or opposing one or more candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72801(3).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWith certain minor exceptions, expenditures over $50 made on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s behalf by others count against the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limit if those expenditures are \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally facilitated by, solicited by or approved by\xe2\x80\x9d the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72809(b), (c).  These provisions apply so as to count against a campaign\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limit any spending by political parties or committees that is coordinated with the campaign and benefits the candidate.  And any party expenditure that \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily benefits six or fewer candidates who are associated with the political party\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed\xe2\x80\x9d to be coordinated with the campaign and therefore to count against the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limit.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72809(b), (d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Act 64 also imposes strict contribution limits.  The amount any single individual can contribute to the campaign of a candidate for state office during a \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-year general election cycle\xe2\x80\x9d is limited as follows: governor, lieutenant governor, and other statewide offices, $400; state senator, $300; and state representative, $200.  \xc2\xa72805(a).  Unlike its expenditure limits, Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are not indexed for inflation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A political committee is subject to these same limits.  <em>Ibid.</em>  So is a political party, <em>ibid.</em>, defined broadly to include \xe2\x80\x9cany subsidiary, branch or local unit\xe2\x80\x9d of a party, as well as any \xe2\x80\x9cnational or regional affiliates\xe2\x80\x9d of a party (taken separately or together)<em>.</em>  \xc2\xa72801(5).  Thus, for example, the statute treats the local, state, and national affiliates of the Democratic Party as if they were a single entity and limits their total contribution to a single candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for governor (during the primary and the general election together) to $400.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act also imposes a limit of $2,000 upon the amount any individual can give to a political party during a 2-year general election cycle.  \xc2\xa72805(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d broadly in approximately the same way it defines \xe2\x80\x9cexpenditure.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72801(2).  Any expenditure made on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s behalf counts as a contribution to the candidate if it is \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally facilitated by, solicited by or approved by\xe2\x80\x9d the candidate.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72809(a), (c).  And a party expenditure that \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily benefits six or fewer candidates who are associated with the\xe2\x80\x9d party is \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed\xe2\x80\x9d to count against the party\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72809(a), (d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are a few exceptions.  A candidate\xe2\x80\x99s own contributions to the campaign and those of the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s family fall outside the contribution limits.  \xc2\xa72805(f).  Volunteer services do not count as contributions.  \xc2\xa72801(2).  Nor does the cost of a meet-the-candidate function, provided that the total cost for the function amounts to $100 or less.  \xc2\xa72809(d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to these expenditure and contribution limits, the Act sets forth disclosure and reporting requirements and creates a voluntary public financing system for gubernatorial elections.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72803, 2811, 2821\xe2\x80\x932823, 2831, 2832, 2851\xe2\x80\x932856.  None of these is at issue here.  The Act also limits the amount of contributions a candidate, political committee, or political party can receive from out-of-state sources.  \xc2\xa72805(c).  The lower courts held these out-of-state contribution limits unconstitutional, and the parties do not challenge that holding.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petitioners are individuals who have run for state office in Vermont, citizens who vote in Vermont elections and contribute to Vermont campaigns, and political parties and committees that participate in Vermont politics.  Soon after Act 64 became law, they brought this lawsuit in Federal District Court against the respondents, state officials charged with enforcement of the Act.  Several other private groups and individual citizens intervened in the District Court proceedings in support of the Act and are joined here as respondents as well.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court agreed with the petitioners that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits violate the First Amendment.  See <em>Buckley, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a><em>.  </em>The court also held unconstitutional the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limits on the contributions of political parties to candidates.  At the same time, the court found the Act\xe2\x80\x99s other contribution limits constitutional.  <em>Landell </em>v. <em>Sorrell, </em>118 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 470 (Vt. 2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both sides appealed.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that <em>all </em>of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are constitutional.  It also held that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits may be constitutional.  <em>Landell </em>v. <em>Sorrell, </em>382 F.\xc2\xa03d 91 (2004).  It found those limits supported by two compelling interests, namely, an interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption and an interest in limiting the amount of time state officials must spend raising campaign funds.  The Circuit then remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to determine whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits were narrowly tailored to those interests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petitioners and respondents all sought certiorari.  They asked us to consider the constitutionality of Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits, its contribution limits, and a related definitional provision.  We agreed to do so.  545 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn first to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits.  Do those limits violate the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s free speech guarantees?</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Buckley </em>v.<em> Valeo</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Court considered the constitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, as amended, 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7431 <em>et seq., </em>a statute that, much like the Act before us, imposed both expenditure and contribution limitations on campaigns for public office.  The Court, while upholding FECA\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limitations as constitutional, held that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Buckley </em>stated that both kinds of limitations \xe2\x80\x9cimplicate fundamental First Amendment interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 23.  It noted that the Government had sought to justify the statute\xe2\x80\x99s infringement on those interests in terms of the need to prevent \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption and the appearance of corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 25; see also <em>id.</em>, at 55.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, this rationale provided sufficient justification for the statute\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limitations, but it did not provide sufficient justification for the expenditure limitations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court explained that the basic reason for this difference between the two kinds of limitations is that expenditure limitations \xe2\x80\x9cimpose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association than\xe2\x80\x9d do contribution limitations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 23.  Contribution limitations, though a \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal restriction upon the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in free communication,\xe2\x80\x9d nevertheless leave the contributor \xe2\x80\x9cfre[e] to discuss candidates and issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Expenditure limitations, by contrast, impose \xe2\x80\x9c[a] restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 19.  They thereby necessarily \xe2\x80\x9creduc[e] the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Indeed, the freedom \xe2\x80\x9cto engage in unlimited political expression subject to a ceiling on expenditures is like being free to drive an automobile as far and as often as one desires on a single tank of gasoline.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 19, n. 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o governmental interest that has been suggested is sufficient to justify the restriction on the quantity of political expression imposed by\xe2\x80\x9d the statute\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limitations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 55.  It decided that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s primary justification for expenditure limitations, preventing corruption and its appearance, was adequately addressed by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limitations and disclosure requirements.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court also considered other governmental interests advanced in support of expenditure limitations.  It rejected each.  <em>Id.</em>, at 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  Consequently, it held that the expenditure limitations were \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally invalid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 58.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the last 30 years, in considering the constitutionality of a host of different campaign finance statutes, this Court has repeatedly adhered to <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s constraints, including those on expenditure limits<em>.  </em>See <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/93/index.html">540 U.

They seek to overcome that precedent in two ways.  First, they ask us in effect to overrule <em>Buckley.  </em>Post-<em>Buckley </em>experience, they believe, has shown that contribution limits (and disclosure requirements) alone cannot effectively deter corruption or its appearance; hence experience has undermined an assumption underlying that case.  Indeed, the respondents have devoted several pages of their briefs to attacking <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding on expenditure limits.  See Brief for Respondent-Cross-Petitioner Vermont Public Interest Research Group et\xc2\xa0al. 36\xe2\x80\x9339 (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9csound reasons exist to revisit the applicable standard of review\xe2\x80\x9d for expenditure limits); Brief for Respondent-Cross-Petitioner William Sorrell et\xc2\xa0al. 28\xe2\x80\x9331 (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Court should revisit <em>Buckley</em> and consider alternative constitutional approaches to spending limits\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, in the alternative, they ask us to limit the scope of <em>Buckley </em>significantly by distinguishing <em>Buckley </em>from the present case.  They advance as a ground for distinction a justification for expenditure limitations that, they say, <em>Buckley </em>did not consider, namely that such limits help to protect candidates from spending too much time raising money rather than devoting that time to campaigning among ordinary voters.  We find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has often recognized the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental importance\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>stare decisis, </em>the basic legal principle that commands judicial respect for a court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier decisions and the rules of law they embody.  See <em>Harris </em>v.<em> United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/536/545/index.html">536 U. S. 545</a>, 556\xe2\x80\x93557 (2002) (plurality opinion) (citing numerous cases).  The Court has pointed out that <em>stare decisis</em> \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>International Business Machines Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/843/index.html">517 U. S. 843</a>, 856 (1996) (quoting <em>Payne </em>v.<em> Tennessee, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/808/index.html">501 U. S. 808</a>, 827 (1991)).  <em>Stare decisis</em> thereby avoids the instability and unfairness that accompany disruption of settled legal expectations.  For this reason, the rule of law demands that adhering to our prior case law be the norm.  Departure from precedent is exceptional, and requires \xe2\x80\x9cspecial justification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Arizona </em>v<em>. Rumsey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/203/index.html">467 U. S. 203</a>, 212 (1984).   This is especially true where, as here, the principle has become settled through iteration and reiteration over a long period of time.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can find here no such special justification that would require us to overrule <em>Buckley</em>.  Subsequent case law has not made <em>Buckley </em>a legal anomaly or otherwise undermined its basic legal principles.  Cf. <em>Dickerson </em>v.<em> United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 443 (2000).  We cannot find in the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims any demonstration that circumstances have changed so radically as to undermine <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>critical factual assumptions.  The respondents have not shown, for example, any dramatic increase in corruption or its appearance in Vermont; nor have they shown that expenditure limits are the only way to attack that problem.  Cf. <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>FEC, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/93/index.html">540 U. S. 93</a>.<em> </em>At the same time, <em>Buckley</em> has promoted considerable reliance.  Congress and state legislatures have used <em>Buckley</em> when drafting campaign finance laws.  And, as we have said, this Court has followed <em>Buckley, </em>upholding and applying its reasoning in later cases.  Overruling <em>Buckley</em> now would dramatically undermine this reliance on our settled precedent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, we find this a case that fits the <em>stare decisis </em>norm.  And we do not perceive the strong justification that would be necessary to warrant overruling so well established a precedent.  We consequently decline the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to reconsider <em>Buckley.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The respondents also ask us to distinguish these cases from Buckley.  </em>But we can find no significant basis for that distinction.  Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits are not substantially different from those at issue in <em>Buckley.  </em>In both instances the limits consist of a dollar cap imposed upon a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures.  Nor is Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s primary justification for imposing its expenditure limits significantly different from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 rationale for the <em>Buckley</em> limits: preventing corruption and its appearance.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sole basis on which the respondents seek to distinguish <em>Buckley</em> concerns a further supporting justification.  They argue that expenditure limits are necessary in order to reduce the amount of time candidates must spend raising money.  Brief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner Vermont Public Interest Research Group et\xc2\xa0al<em>.</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9320; Brief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner William H. Sorrell et\xc2\xa0al. 22\xe2\x80\x9325.  Increased campaign costs, together with the fear of a better-funded opponent, mean that, without expenditure limits, a candidate must spend too much time raising money instead of meeting the voters and engaging in public debate.  <em>Buckley, </em>the respondents add, did not fully consider this justification.  Had it done so, they say, the Court would have upheld, not struck down, FECA\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, it is highly unlikely that fuller consideration of this time protection rationale would have changed <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s result.  The <em>Buckley</em> Court was aware of the connection between expenditure limits and a reduction in fundraising time.  In a section of the opinion dealing with FECA\xe2\x80\x99s public financing provisions, it wrote that Congress was trying to \xe2\x80\x9cfree candidates from the rigors of fundraising.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 91; see also <em>id., </em>at 96 (\xe2\x80\x9c[L]imits on contributions necessarily increase the burden of fundraising,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic financing\xe2\x80\x9d was designed in part to relieve Presidential candidates \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the rigors of soliciting private contributions\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id., </em>at 258\xe2\x80\x93259 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (same).  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion and the briefs filed in this Court pointed out that a natural consequence of higher campaign expenditures was that \xe2\x80\x9ccandidates were compelled to allow to fund raising increasing and extreme amounts of money and energy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 519 F.\xc2\xa02d 821, 838 (CADC 1975); see also Brief for United States et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici</em> <em>Curiae </em>in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1975, Nos. 75\xe2\x80\x93436 and 75\xe2\x80\x93437, p. 36 (\xe2\x80\x9cFund raising consumes candidate time that otherwise would be devoted to campaigning\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, in any event, the connection between high campaign expenditures and increased fundraising demands seems perfectly obvious.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under these circumstances, the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument amounts to no more than an invitation so to limit <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>holding<em> </em>as effectively to overrule it.  For the reasons set forth above, we decline that invitation as well.  And, given <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>continued authority, we must conclude that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn now to a more complex question, namely the constitutionality of Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits.  The parties, while accepting <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s approach, dispute whether, despite <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s general approval of statutes that limit campaign contributions, Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are so severe that in the circumstances its particular limits violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits, we begin with <em>Buckley.  </em>In that case, the Court upheld the $1,000 contribution limit before it.  <em>Buckley </em>recognized that contribution limits, like expenditure limits, \xe2\x80\x9cimplicate fundamental First Amendment interests,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, the freedoms of \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical expression\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical association.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 15, 23.  But, unlike expenditure limits (which \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily reduc[e] the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 19), contribution limits \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] little direct restraint on\xe2\x80\x9d the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s speech, <em>id.</em>, at 21.  They do restrict \xe2\x80\x9cone aspect of the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of political association,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to support a favored candidate, but they nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9cpermi[t] the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution,\xe2\x80\x9d and they do \xe2\x80\x9cnot in any way infringe the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to discuss candidates and issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 21, 24.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently, the Court wrote, contribution limitations are permissible as long as the Government demonstrates that the limits are \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to match a \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 25.  It found that the interest advanced in the case, \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[ing] corruption\xe2\x80\x9d and its \xe2\x80\x9cappearance,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important\xe2\x80\x9d to justify the statute\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits.  <em>Id.</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also found that the contribution limits before it were \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  It<em> </em>recognized that, in determining whether a particular contribution limit was \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn,\xe2\x80\x9d the amount, or level, of that limit could make a difference.  Indeed, it wrote that \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution restrictions could have a severe impact on political dialogue if the limitations prevented candidates and political committees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 21.  But the Court added that such \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctions in degree become significant only when they can be said to amount to differences in kind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 30.  Pointing out that it had \xe2\x80\x9cno scalpel to probe, whether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> the Court found \xe2\x80\x9cno indication\xe2\x80\x9d that the $1,000 contribution limitations imposed by the Act would have \xe2\x80\x9cany dramatic adverse effect on the funding of campaigns,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 21.  It therefore found the limitations constitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since <em>Buckley</em>, the Court has consistently upheld contribution limits in other statutes.  <em>Shrink, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html"></a><a href="/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a> ($1075 limit on contributions to candidates for Missouri state auditor); <em>California Medical Assn.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/182/index.html"></a><a href="/us/453/182/index.html">453 U. S. 182</a> ($5,000 limit on contributions to multicandidate political committees).  The Court has recognized, however, that contribution limits might <em>sometimes</em> work more harm to protected First Amendment interests than their anticorruption objectives could justify.  See <em>Shrink</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 395\xe2\x80\x93397; <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 21.  And individual Members of the Court have expressed concern lest too low a limit magnify the \xe2\x80\x9creputation-related or media-related advantages of incumbency and thereby insulat[e] legislators from effective electoral challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shrink</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 403\xe2\x80\x93404 (Breyer, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., concurring).  In the cases before us, the petitioners challenge Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits on that basis.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following <em>Buckley</em>, we must determine whether Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits prevent candidates from \xe2\x80\x9camassing the resources necessary for effective [campaign] advocacy,\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U. S., at 21; whether they magnify the advantages of incumbency to the point where they put challengers to a significant disadvantage; in a word, whether they are too low and too strict to survive First Amendment scrutiny.  In answering these questions, we recognize, as <em>Buckley </em>stated<em>,</em> that we have \xe2\x80\x9cno scalpel to probe\xe2\x80\x9d each possible contribution level.  <em>Id.</em>, at 30.  We cannot determine with any degree of exactitude the precise restriction necessary to carry out the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate objectives.  In practice, the legislature is better equipped to make such empirical judgments, as legislators have \xe2\x80\x9cparticular expertise\xe2\x80\x9d in matters related to the costs and nature of running for office.  <em>McConnell, </em>540 U. S., at 137.  Thus ordinarily we have deferred to the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s determination of such matters.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, as <em>Buckley</em> acknowledged, we must recognize the existence of some lower bound.  At some point the constitutional risks to the democratic electoral process become too great.  After all, the interests underlying contribution limits, preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption, \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly implicate the integrity of our electoral process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell, supra, </em>at 136 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Yet that rationale does not simply mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe lower the limit, the better.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is because contribution limits that are too low can also harm the electoral process by preventing challengers from mounting effective campaigns against incumbent officeholders, thereby reducing democratic accountability.  Were we to ignore that fact, a statute that seeks to regulate campaign contributions could itself prove an obstacle to the very electoral fairness it seeks to promote.  Thus, we see no alternative to the exercise of independent judicial judgment as a statute reaches those outer limits.  And, where there is strong indication in a particular case, <em>i.e.</em>, danger signs, that such risks exist (both present in kind and likely serious in degree), courts, including appellate courts, must review the record independently and carefully with an eye toward assessing the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctailoring,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, toward assessing the proportionality of the restrictions.  See <em>Bose</em> <em>Corp</em>. v.<em> Consumers Union of United States, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/485/index.html">466 U. S. 485</a>, 499 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n appellate court has an obligation to \xe2\x80\x98make an independent examination of the whole record\xe2\x80\x99 in order to make sure that \xe2\x80\x98the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>New York Times Co. </em>v.<em> Sullivan, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html">376 U. S. 254</a>, 284\xe2\x80\x93286 (1964))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find those danger signs present here.  As compared with the contribution limits upheld by the Court in the past, and with those in force in other States, Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s limits are sufficiently low as to generate suspicion that they are not closely drawn.  The Act sets its limits per election cycle, which includes both a primary and a general election.  Thus, in a gubernatorial race with both primary and final election contests, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limit amounts to $200 per election per candidate (with significantly lower limits for contributions to candidates for State Senate and House of Representatives, see <em>supra</em>, at 3)<em>.</em>  These limits apply both to contributions from individuals and to contributions from political parties, whether made in cash or in expenditures coordinated (or presumed to be coordinated) with the candidate.<em> </em>See <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These limits are well below the limits this Court upheld in <em>Buckley.  </em>Indeed, in terms of real dollars <em>(i.e.</em>, adjusting for inflation), the Act\xe2\x80\x99s $200 per election limit on individual contributions to a campaign for governor is slightly more than one-twentieth of the limit on contributions to campaigns for federal office before the Court in <em>Buckley</em>.<em> </em>Adjusted to reflect its value in 1976 (the year <em>Buckley</em> was decided), Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limit on campaigns for statewide office (including governor) amounts to $113.91 per 2-year election cycle, or roughly $57 per election, as compared to the $1,000 per election limit on individual contributions at issue in <em>Buckley</em>.  (The adjusted value of Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s limit on contributions from political parties to candidates for statewide office, again $200 per candidate per election, is just over one one-hundredth of the comparable limit before the Court in <em>Buckley</em>, $5,000 per election<em>.</em>)<em> </em>Yet Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s gubernatorial district\xe2\x80\x94the entire State\xe2\x80\x94is no smaller than the House districts to which <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s limits applied.  In 1976, the average congressional district contained a population of about 465,000.  Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 459 (1976) (Statistical Abstract) (describing results of 1970 census).  Indeed, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s population is 621,000\xe2\x80\x94about one-third <em>larger</em>.  Statistical Abstract 21 (2006) (describing Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s population in 2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, considered as a whole, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are the lowest in the Nation.  Act 64 limits contributions to candidates for statewide office (including governor) to $200 per candidate per election.  We have found no State that imposes a lower per election limit.  Indeed, we have found only seven States that impose limits on contributions to candidates for statewide office at or below $500 per election, more than twice Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s limit.  Cf. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93905 (West Cum. Supp. 2005) ($760 per election cycle, or $380 per election, adjusted for inflation); Colo. Const., Art. XXVIII, \xc2\xa73 ($500 per election, adjusted for inflation); Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7106.08(1)(a) (2003) ($500 per election); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21A, \xc2\xa71015(1) (1993) ($500 for governor, $250 for other statewide office, per election); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 55, \xc2\xa77A (West Supp. 2006) ($500 per year, or $250 per election); Mont. Code Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x93216(1)(a) (2005) ($500 for governor, $250 for other statewide office, per election); S.\xc2\xa0D. Codified Laws \xc2\xa712\xe2\x80\x9325\xe2\x80\x931.1 (2004) ($1,000 per year, or $500 per election).  We are aware of no State that imposes a limit on contributions from political parties to candidates for statewide office lower than Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s $200 per candidate per election limit.  Cf. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21A, \xc2\xa71015(1) (1993) (next lowest: $500 for contribution from party to candidate for governor, $250 for contribution from party to candidate for other statewide office, both per election).  Similarly, we have found only three States that have limits on contributions to candidates for state legislature below Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s $150 and $100 per election limits.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93905 (West Cum. Supp. 2005) ($296 per election cycle, or $148 per election); Mont. Code Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x93216(1)(a) (2005) ($130 per election); S.\xc2\xa0D. Codified Laws \xc2\xa712\xe2\x80\x9325\xe2\x80\x931.1 (2004) ($250 per year, or $125 per election).  And we are aware of no State that has a lower limit on contributions from political parties to state legislative candidates.  Cf. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21A, \xc2\xa71015(1) (1993) (next lowest: $250 per election).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s limit is well below the lowest limit this Court has previously upheld, the limit of $1,075 per election (adjusted for inflation every two years, see Mo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7130.032.2 (1998 Cum. Supp.)) for candidates for Missouri state auditor.  <em>Shrink, </em>528 U. S.em&gt;. 377.<em> </em>The comparable Vermont limit of roughly $200 per election, not adjusted for inflation, is less than one-sixth of Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s current inflation-adjusted limit ($1,275).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s population is much smaller than Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s.  Indeed, Vermont is about one-ninth of the size of Missouri.  Statistical Abstract 21 (2006).  Thus, <em>per citizen</em>, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s limit is slightly more generous.  As of 2006, the ratio of the contribution limit to the size of the constituency in Vermont is .00064, while Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s ratio is .00044, 31% lower.  Cf. App. 55 (doing same calculation in 2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this does not necessarily mean that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s limits are less objectionable than the limit upheld in <em>Shrink</em>.  A campaign for state auditor is likely to be less costly than a campaign for governor; campaign costs do not automatically increase or decrease in precise proportion to the size of an electoral district.  See App. 66 (1998 winning candidate for Vermont state auditor spent about $60,000; winning candidate for governor spent about $340,000); Opensecrets.org, The Big Picture, 2004 Cycle: Hot Races, available at<em> </em>http://www.opensecrets.org/\nbigpicture/hotraces.asp?cycle=2004 (as visited June 22, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (U. S. Senate campaigns identified as competitive spend less per voter than U. S. House campaigns identified as competitive).  Moreover, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s limits, unlike Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s limits, apply in the same amounts to contributions made by political parties.  Mo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7130.032.4 (2000) (enacting limits on contributions from political parties to candidates 10 times higher than limits on contributions from individuals).  And, as we have said, Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s (current) $1,275 per election limit, unlike Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s $200 per election limit, is indexed for inflation.  See <em>supra</em>, at 17; see also Mo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7130.032.2 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The factors we have mentioned offset any neutralizing force of population differences.  At the very least, they make it difficult to treat <em>Shrink</em>\xe2\x80\x99s (then) $1,075 limit as providing affirmative support for the lawfulness of Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s far lower levels.  Cf. 528 U. S., at 404 (Breyer, J., concurring) (The <em>Shrink </em>\xe2\x80\x9climit . . . is low enough to raise \xe2\x80\xa6 a [significant constitutional] question\xe2\x80\x9d).  And even were that not so, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s failure to index for inflation means that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s levels would soon be far lower than Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s regardless of the method of comparison.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are substantially lower than both the limits we have previously upheld and comparable limits in other States.  These are danger signs that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits may fall outside tolerable First Amendment limits.  We consequently must examine the record independently and carefully to determine whether Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to match the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our examination of the record convinces us that, from a constitutional perspective, Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are too restrictive.  We reach this conclusion based not merely on the low dollar amounts of the limits themselves, but also on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effect on political parties and on volunteer activity in Vermont elections.  <em>Taken together</em>, Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s substantial restrictions on the ability of candidates to raise the funds necessary to run a competitive election, on the ability of political parties to help their candidates get elected, and on the ability of individual citizens to volunteer their time to campaigns show that the Act is not closely drawn to meet its objectives.  In particular, five factors together lead us to this decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First, </em>the record suggests, though it does not conclusively prove, that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits will significantly restrict the amount of funding available for challengers to run competitive campaigns.  For one thing, the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 expert, Clark Bensen, conducted a race-by-race analysis of the 1998 legislative elections (the last to take place before Act 64 took effect) and concluded that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits would have reduced the funds available in 1998 to Republican challengers in competitive races in amounts ranging from 18% to 53% of their total campaign income.  See 3 Tr. 52\xe2\x80\x9357 (estimating loss of 47% of funds for candidate Tully, 50% for Harvey, 53% for Welch, 19% for Bahre, 29% for Delaney, 36% for LaRocque, 18% for Smith, and 31% for Brown).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 expert witnesses produced evidence and analysis showing that Vermont political parties (particularly the Republican Party) \xe2\x80\x9ctarget\xe2\x80\x9d their contributions to candidates in competitive races, that those contributions represent a significant amount of total candidate funding in such races, and that the contribution limits will cut the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contributions to competitive races dramatically.  See 1 <em>id., </em>at 189\xe2\x80\x93190; 3 <em>id., </em>at 50\xe2\x80\x9351; 8 <em>id., </em>at 139; 10 <em>id., </em>at 150; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, Gierzynski &amp; Breaux, The Role of Parties in Legislative Campaign Financing, 15 Am. Rev. Politics 171 (1994); Thompson, Cassie, &amp; Jewell, A Sacred Cow<em> </em>or<em> </em>Just a Lot of Bull?<em> </em>Party and PAC Money in State Legislative Elections, 47 Pol. Sci. Q. 223 (1994).  Their statistics showed that the party contributions accounted for a significant percentage of the total campaign income in those races.  And their studies showed that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits would cut the party contributions by between 85% (for the legislature on average) and 99% (for governor).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More specifically, Bensen pointed out that in 1998, the Republican Party made contributions to 19 Senate campaigns in amounts that averaged $2,001, which on average represented 16% of the recipient campaign\xe2\x80\x99s total income.  3 Tr. 84.  Act 64 would reduce these contributions to $300 per campaign, an average reduction of about 85%.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The party contributed to 50 House campaigns in amounts averaging $787, which on average represented 28% of the recipient campaign\xe2\x80\x99s total income.  <em>Id.</em>, at 85.  Act 64 would reduce these contributions to $200 per campaign, an average reduction of 74.5%.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And the party contributed $40,600 to its gubernatorial candidate, an amount that accounted for about 16% of the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s funding.  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.  The Act would have reduced that contribution by 99%, to $400.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bensen added that 57% of all 1998 Senate campaigns and 30% of all House campaigns exceeded Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits, which were enacted along with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits.  7 Trial Exhs. in No. 00\xe2\x80\x939159(L) etc. (CA2), Exh. 8, p.\xc2\xa02351.  Moreover, 27% of all Senate campaigns and 10% of all House campaigns spent more than double those limits.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The respondents did not contest these figures.  Rather, they presented evidence that focused, not upon <em>strongly contested</em> campaigns, but upon the funding amounts available for the <em>average </em>campaign.  The respondents\xe2\x80\x99 expert, Anthony Gierzynski, concluded, for example, that Act 64 would have a \xe2\x80\x9cminimal effect on \xe2\x80\xa6 candidates\xe2\x80\x99 ability to raise funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 46.  But he rested this conclusion upon his finding that \xe2\x80\x9conly a small proportion of\xe2\x80\x9d <em>all</em> contributions to <em>all</em> campaigns for state office \xe2\x80\x9cmade during the last three elections would have been affected by the new limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 47; see also <em>id.</em>, at 51 (discussing \xe2\x80\x9c<em>average</em> amount of revenues lost to the limits\xe2\x80\x9d in legislative races (emphasis added)); <em>id.</em>, at 52\xe2\x80\x9353 (discussing total number of campaigns receiving contributions over Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s limit).  The lower courts similarly relied almost exclusively on averages in assessing Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s effect.  See 118 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 470 (\xe2\x80\x9cApproximately 88% to 96% of the campaign contributions <em>to recent House races</em> were under $200\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>id.</em>, at 478 (\xe2\x80\x9cExpert testimony revealed that over the last three election cycles the percentage <em>of all candidates\xe2\x80\x99 contributions</em> received over the contribution limits was less than 10%\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The respondents\xe2\x80\x99 evidence leaves the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 evidence unrebutted in certain key respects.  That is because the critical question concerns not simply the <em>average </em>effect of contribution limits on fundraising but, more importantly, the ability of a candidate running against an incumbent officeholder to mount an effective <em>challenge</em>.  And information about <em>average </em>races, rather than <em>competitive </em>races, is only distantly related to that question, because competitive races are likely to be far more expensive than the average race.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, N. Ornstein, T. Mann, &amp; M. Malbin, Vital Statistics on Congress 2001\xe2\x80\x932002, pp. 89\xe2\x80\x9398 (2002) (data showing that spending in competitive elections, <em>i.e.</em>, where incumbent wins with less than 60% of vote or where incumbent loses, is far greater than in most elections, where incumbent wins with more than 60% of the vote).  We concede that the record does contain some anecdotal evidence supporting the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position, namely, testimony about a post-Act-64 competitive mayoral campaign in Burlington, which suggests that a challenger can \xe2\x80\x9camas[s] the resources necessary for effective advocacy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 21.  But the facts of that particular election are not described in sufficient detail to offer a convincing refutation of the implication arising from the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 experts\xe2\x80\x99 studies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather, the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 studies, taken together with low <em>average </em>Vermont campaign expenditures and the typically higher costs that a challenger must bear to overcome the name-recognition advantage enjoyed by an incumbent, raise a reasonable inference that the contribution limits are so low that they may pose a significant obstacle to candidates in competitive elections.  Cf. Ornstein, <em>supra</em>, at 87\xe2\x80\x9396 (In 2000 U. S. House and Senate elections, successful challengers spent far more than the average candidate).  Information about average races does not rebut that inference.  Consequently, the inference amounts to one factor (among others) that here counts against the constitutional validity of the contribution limits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second,</em> Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that political parties abide by <em>exactly </em>the same low contribution limits that apply to other contributors threatens harm to a particularly important political right, the right to associate in a political party.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>California Democratic Party</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/567/index.html">530 U. S. 567</a>, 574 (2000) (describing  constitutional importance of  associating in political parties to elect candidates); <em>Timmons</em> v. <em>Twin Cities Area New Party</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/351/index.html">520 U. S. 351</a>, 357 (1997) (same); <em>Colorado I</em>, 518 U. S., at 616 (same); <em>Norman</em> v. <em>Reed</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/279/index.html">502 U. S. 279</a>, 288 (1992) (same).  Cf. <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 20\xe2\x80\x9322 (contribution limits constitute \xe2\x80\x9conly a marginal restriction\xe2\x80\x9d on First Amendment rights <em>because </em>contributor remains free to associate politically, <em>e.g.</em>, in a political party, and \xe2\x80\x9cassist personally\xe2\x80\x9d in the party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cefforts on behalf of candidates\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act applies its $200 to $400 limits\xe2\x80\x94precisely the same limits it applies to an individual\xe2\x80\x94to virtually all affiliates of a political party taken together as if they were a single contributor.  Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, \xc2\xa72805(a) (2002).  That means, for example, that the Vermont Democratic Party, taken together with all its local affiliates, can make one contribution of at most $400 to the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, one contribution of at most $300 to a Democratic candidate for State Senate, and one contribution of at most $200 to a Democratic candidate for the State House of Representatives.  The Act includes within these limits not only direct monetary contributions but also expenditures in kind: stamps, stationery, coffee, doughnuts, gasoline, campaign buttons, and so forth.  See \xc2\xa72801(2).  Indeed, it includes all party expenditures \xe2\x80\x9cintended to promote the election of a specific candidate or group of candidates\xe2\x80\x9d as long as the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csolicit[s],\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9capprove[s]\xe2\x80\x9d them.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72809(a), (c).  And a party expenditure that \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily benefits six or fewer candidates who are associated with the\xe2\x80\x9d party is \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed\xe2\x80\x9d to count against the party\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits.  \xc2\xa72809(d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the negative effect on \xe2\x80\x9camassing funds\xe2\x80\x9d that we have described, see <em>supra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9321, the Act would severely limit the ability of a party to assist its candidates\xe2\x80\x99 campaigns by engaging in coordinated spending on advertising, candidate events, voter lists, mass mailings, even yard signs.  And, to an unusual degree, it would discourage those who wish to contribute small amounts of money to a party, amounts that easily comply with individual contribution limits.  Suppose that many individuals do not know Vermont legislative candidates personally, but wish to contribute, say, $20 or $40, to the State Republican Party, with the intent that the party use the money to help elect whichever candidates the party believes would best advance its ideals and interests\xe2\x80\x94the basic object of a political party.  Or, to take a more extreme example, imagine that 6,000 Vermont citizens each want to give $1 to the State Democratic Party because, though unfamiliar with the details of the individual races, they would like to make a small financial contribution to the goal of electing a Democratic state legislature.  And further imagine that the party believes control of the legislature will depend on the outcome of three (and only three) House races.  The Act forbids the party from giving $2,000 (of the $6,000) to each of its candidates in those pivotal races.  Indeed, it permits the party to give no more than $200 to each candidate, thereby thwarting the aims of the 6,000 donors from making a meaningful contribution to state politics by giving a small amount of money to the party they support.  Thus, the Act would severely inhibit collective political activity by preventing a political party from using contributions by small donors to provide meaningful assistance to any individual candidate.  See <em>supra</em>, at 19.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that we have previously upheld limits on contributions from political parties to candidates, in particular the federal limits on coordinated party spending.  <em>Colorado II</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/431/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/431/index.html">533 U. S. 431</a>.  And we also recognize that any such limit will negatively affect <em>to some extent </em>the fund-allocating party function just described.<em> </em>But the contribution limits at issue in <em>Colorado II </em>were far less problematic, for they were significantly higher than Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s limits.  See <em>id.</em>, at 438\xe2\x80\x93439, and n.\xc2\xa03, 442, n.\xc2\xa07 (at least $67,560 in coordinated spending and $5,000 in direct cash contributions for U. S. Senate candidates, at least $33,780 in coordinated spending and $5,000 in direct cash contributions for U. S. House candidates).  And they were much higher than the federal limits on contributions from individuals to candidates, thereby reflecting an effort by Congress to balance (1) the need to allow individuals to participate in the political process by contributing to political parties that help elect candidates with (2) the need to prevent the use of political parties \xe2\x80\x9cto circumvent contribution limits that apply to individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 453.  Act 64, by placing identical limits upon contributions to candidates, whether made by an individual or by a political party, gives to the former consideration <em>no weight at all.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>We consequently agree with the District Court that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits \xe2\x80\x9cwould reduce the voice of political parties\xe2\x80\x9d in Vermont to a \xe2\x80\x9cwhisper.\xe2\x80\x9d  118 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 487.  And we count the special party-related harms that Act 64 threatens as a further factor weighing against the constitutional validity of the contribution limits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third, </em>the Act\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of volunteer services aggravates the problem.  Like its federal statutory counterpart, the Act excludes from its definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d all \xe2\x80\x9cservices provided without compensation by individuals volunteering their time on behalf of a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, \xc2\xa72801(2) (2002).  Cf. 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7431(8)(B)(i) (2000 ed. and Supp. III) (similar exemption in federal campaign finance statute).  But the Act does not exclude the expenses those volunteers incur, such as travel expenses, in the course of campaign activities.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s broad definitions would seem to count those expenses against the volunteer\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limit, at least where the spending was facilitated or approved by campaign officials.  Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, \xc2\xa72801(3) (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]xpenditure\xe2\x80\x9d includes \xe2\x80\x9canything of value, paid \xe2\x80\xa6 for the purpose of influencing an election\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72809(a), (c) (Any \xe2\x80\x9cexpenditure \xe2\x80\xa6 intentionally facilitated by, solicited by or approved by the candidate\xe2\x80\x9d counts as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, unlike the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of comparable requirements, the State has not (insofar as we are aware) created an exception excluding such expenses.  Cf. 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7431(8)(B)(iv), (ix) (2000 ed. and Supp. III) (excluding from the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d volunteer travel expenses up to $1,000 and payment by political party for campaign materials used in connection with volunteer activities).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of some such exception may matter in the present context, where contribution limits are very low.  That combination, low limits and no exceptions, means that a gubernatorial campaign volunteer who makes four or five round trips driving across the State performing volunteer activities coordinated with the campaign can find that he or she is near, or has surpassed, the contribution limit.  So too will a volunteer who offers a campaign the use of her house along with coffee and doughnuts for a few dozen neighbors to meet the candidate, say, two or three times during a campaign.  Cf. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, \xc2\xa72809(d) (2002) (excluding expenditures for such activities only up to $100).  Such supporters will have to keep careful track of all miles driven, postage supplied (500 stamps equals $200), pencils and pads used, and so forth.  And any carelessness in this respect can prove costly, perhaps generating a headline, \xe2\x80\x9cCampaign laws violated,\xe2\x80\x9d that works serious harm to the candidate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These sorts of problems are unlikely to affect the constitutionality of a limit that is reasonably high.  Cf. <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (Coordinated expenditure by a volunteer \xe2\x80\x9cprovides material financial assistance to a candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore \xe2\x80\x9cmay properly be viewed as a contribution\xe2\x80\x9d).  But Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are so low, and its definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d so broad, that the Act may well impede a campaign\xe2\x80\x99s ability effectively to use volunteers, thereby making it more difficult for individuals to associate in this way.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 22 (Federal contribution limits \xe2\x80\x9cleave the contributor free to become a member of any political association and to assist personally in the association\xe2\x80\x99s efforts on behalf of candidates\xe2\x80\x9d).  Again, the very low limits at issue help to transform differences in degree into difference in kind.  And the likelihood of unjustified interference in the present context is sufficiently great that we must consider the lack of tailoring in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d as an added factor counting against the constitutional validity of the contribution limits before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fourth, </em>unlike the contribution limits we upheld in <em>Shrink,</em> see <em>supra</em>, at 16, Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are not adjusted for inflation.  Its limits decline in real value each year.  Indeed, in real dollars the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limits have already declined by about 20% ($200 in 2006 dollars has a real value of $160.66 in 1997 dollars).  A failure to index limits means that limits which are already suspiciously low, see <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9317, will almost inevitably become too low over time.  It means that future legislation will be necessary to stop that almost inevitable decline, and it thereby imposes the burden of preventing the decline upon incumbent legislators who may not diligently police the need for changes in limit levels to assure the adequate financing of electoral challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fifth, </em>we have found nowhere in the record any special justification that might warrant a contribution limit so low or so restrictive as to bring about the serious associational and expressive problems that we have described.  Rather, the basic justifications the State has advanced in support of such limits are those present in <em>Buckley.  </em>The record contains no indication that, for example, corruption (or its appearance) in Vermont is significantly more serious a matter than elsewhere.  Indeed, other things being equal, one might reasonably believe that a contribution of say, $250 (or $450) to a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign was less likely to prove a corruptive force than the far larger contributions at issue in the other campaign finance cases we have considered.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These five sets of considerations, taken together, lead us to conclude that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are not narrowly tailored.  Rather, the Act burdens First Amendment interests by threatening to inhibit effective advocacy by those who seek election, particularly challengers; its contribution limits mute the voice of political parties; they hamper participation in campaigns through volunteer activities; and they are not indexed for inflation.  Vermont does not point to a legitimate statutory objective that might justify these special burdens.  We understand that many, though not all, campaign finance regulations impose certain of these burdens to some degree.  We also understand the legitimate need for constitutional leeway in respect to legislative line-drawing.  But our discussion indicates why we conclude that Act 64 in this respect nonetheless goes too far.  It disproportionately burdens numerous First Amendment interests, and consequently, in our view, violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We add that we do not believe it possible to sever some of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limit provisions from others that might remain fully operative.  See <em>Champlin Refining Co.</em> v. <em>Corporation Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Okla.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/210/index.html">286 U. S. 210</a>, 234 (1932) (\xe2\x80\x9cinvalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Minnesota</em> v. <em>Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/172/index.html">526 U. S. 172</a>, 191 (1999) (severability \xe2\x80\x9cessentially an inquiry into legislative intent\xe2\x80\x9d); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 1, \xc2\xa7215 (2003) (severability principles apply to Vermont statutes).  To sever provisions to avoid constitutional objection here would require us to write words into the statute (inflation indexing), or to leave gaping loopholes (no limits on party contributions), or to foresee which of many different possible ways the legislature might respond to the constitutional objections we have found.  Given these difficulties, we believe the Vermont Legislature would have intended us to set aside the statute\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits, leaving the legislature free to rewrite those provisions in light of the constitutional difficulties we have identified.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits violate the First Amendment as interpreted in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>.  We also conclude that the specific details of Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits require us to hold that those limits violate the First Amendment, for they burden First Amendment interests in a manner that is disproportionate to the public purposes they were enacted to advance.  Given our holding, we need not, and do not, examine the constitutionality of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s presumption that certain party expenditures are coordinated with a candidate.  Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, \xc2\xa72809(d) (2002).  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962121">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nKENNEDY, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nRANDALL V.

The exacting scrutiny the plurality applies to expenditure limitations, however, is appropriate.  For the reasons explained in the plurality opinion, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to distinguish the present limitations from those we have invalidated are unavailing.  The Court has upheld contribution limits that do \xe2\x80\x9cnot come even close to passing any serious scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 410 (2000) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Those concerns aside, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s contributions, as the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s detailed analysis indicates, are even more stifling than the ones that survived <em>Shrink</em>\xe2\x80\x99s unduly lenient review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The universe of campaign finance regulation is one this Court has in part created and in part permitted by its course of decisions.  That new order may cause more problems than it solves.  On a routine, operational level the present system requires us to explain why $200 is too restrictive a limit while $1,500 is not.  Our own experience gives us little basis to make these judgments, and certainly no traditional or well-established body of law exists to offer guidance.  On a broader, systemic level political parties have been denied basic First Amendment rights.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html">540 U.

Entering to fill the void have been new entities such as political action committees, which are as much the creatures of law as of traditional forces of speech and association.  Those entities can manipulate the system and attract their own elite power brokers, who operate in ways obscure to the ordinary citizen.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Viewed within the legal universe we have ratified and helped create, the result the plurality reaches is correct; given my own skepticism regarding that system and its operation, however, it seems to me appropriate to concur only in the judgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962123">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n548 U.

This is fairly incongruous, given that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 defense of Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits rests squarely on <em>Buckley</em> and later decisions that built on <em>Buckley</em>, and yet respondents fail to explain why it would be appropriate to reexamine only one part of the holding in <em>Buckley</em>.  More to the point, respondents fail to discuss the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> or the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases elaborating on the circumstances in which it is appropriate to reconsider a prior constitutional decision.  Indeed, only once in 99 pages of briefing from respondents do the words \xe2\x80\x9c<em>stare decisis</em>\xe2\x80\x9d appear, and that reference is in connection with <em>contribution</em> limits.  See Sorrell Brief 31.  Such an incomplete presentation is reason enough to refuse respondents\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to reexamine <em>Buckley</em>.

Invoking <em>stare decisis</em>, the plurality rejects the invitation to overrule <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976) (per curiam).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  It then applies <em>Buckley</em> to invalidate the expenditure limitations and, less persuasively, the contribution limitations.  I continue to believe that <em>Buckley </em>provides insufficient protection to political speech, the core of the First Amendment.  The illegitimacy of <em>Buckley</em> is further underscored by the continuing inability of the Court (and the plurality here) to apply <em>Buckley </em>in a coherent and principled fashion.  As a result, <em>stare decisis </em>should pose no bar to overruling <em>Buckley </em>and replacing it with a standard faithful to the First Amendment.  Accordingly, I concur only in the judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I adhere to my view that this Court erred in <em>Buckley</em> when it distinguished between contribution and expenditure limits, finding the former to be a less severe infringement on First Amendment rights.  See <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U.

S. 604</a>, 635\xe2\x80\x93644 (1996) (<em>Colorado I</em>) (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part).  \xe2\x80\x9c[U]nlike the <em>Buckley </em>Court, I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 640.  The <em>Buckley </em>Court distinguished contributions from expenditures based on the presence of an intermediary between a contributor and the speech eventually produced.  But that reliance is misguided, given that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven in the case of a direct expenditure, there is usually some go-between that facilitates the dissemination of the spender\xe2\x80\x99s message.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colorado I, supra,</em> at 638\xe2\x80\x93639; <em>Shrink</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 413\xe2\x80\x93418 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Likewise, <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion<em> </em>that contribution caps only marginally restrict speech, because \xe2\x80\x9c[a] contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support,\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U. S., at 21, even if descriptively accurate, does not support restrictions on contributions.  After all, statements of general support are as deserving of constitutional protection as those that communicate specific reasons for that support.  <em>Colorado I</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 639\xe2\x80\x93640 (opinion of Thomas, J.); <em>Shrink</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 414\xe2\x80\x93415, and n.\xc2\xa03 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Accordingly, I would overrule <em>Buckley </em>and subject both the contribution and expenditure restrictions of Act 64 to strict scrutiny, which they would fail.  See <em>Colorado I</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 640\xe2\x80\x93641 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced that under traditional strict scrutiny, broad prophylactic caps on both spending and giving in the political process . . . are unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>Colorado II</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 465\xe2\x80\x93466 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality opinion, far from making the case for <em>Buckley </em>as a rule of law, itself demonstrates that <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s limited scrutiny of contribution limits is \xe2\x80\x9cinsusceptible of principled application,\xe2\x80\x9d and accordingly is not entitled to <em>stare decisis </em>effect.  See <em>BMW of North America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Gore,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/559/index.html">517 U. S. 559</a>, 599 (1996)<em> </em>(Scalia, J., dissenting).  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98when governing decisions are unworkable or are badly reasoned, this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vieth</em> v. <em>Jubelirer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/267/index.html">541 U.

S. 808</a>, 827 (1991); internal quotation marks omitted).   Today\xe2\x80\x99s newly minted, multifactor test, particularly when read in combination with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Shrink</em>, <em>supra</em>, places this Court in the position of addressing the propriety of regulations of political speech based upon little more than its <em>impression</em> of the appropriate limits.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality sets forth what appears to be a two-step process for evaluating the validity of contribution limits: First, determine whether there are \xe2\x80\x9cdanger signs\xe2\x80\x9d in a particular case that the limits are too low; and, second, use \xe2\x80\x9cindependent judicial judgment\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9creview the record independently and carefully with an eye towards assessing the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98tailoring,\xe2\x80\x99 that is, towards assessing the proportionality of the restrictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  Neither step of this test can be reduced to a workable inquiry to be performed by States attempting to comply with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the first step, it is entirely unclear how to determine whether limits are so low as to constitute \xe2\x80\x9cdanger signs\xe2\x80\x9d that require a court to \xe2\x80\x9cexamine the record independently and carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  The plurality points to several aspects of the Act that support its conclusion that such signs are present here: (1) the limits are set per election cycle, rather than divided between primary and general elections; (2) the limits apply to contributions from political parties; (3) the limits are the lowest in the Nation; and (4) the limits are below those we have previously upheld.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first two elements of the Act are indeed constitutionally problematic, but they have no bearing on whether the contribution limits are too low.  The first substantially advantages candidates in a general election who did not face a serious primary challenge.  In practice, this restriction will generally suppress more speech by challengers than by incumbents, without serving the interests the Court has recognized as compelling, <em>i.e.</em>, the prevention of corruption or the appearance thereof.  Cf. B. Smith, Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (2001) (hereinafter Smith) (describing the ability of incumbents to amass money early, discouraging serious challengers from entering a race).  The second element has no relation to these compelling interests either, given that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he very aim of a political party is to influence its candidate\xe2\x80\x99s stance on issues and, if the candidate takes office or is reelected, his votes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Colorado II</em>, 533 U. S., at 476 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Colorado I</em>, 518 U. S., at 646 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part)).  That these provisions are unconstitutional, however, does not make the contribution limits on individuals unconstitutionally low.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are left, then, with two reasons to scrutinize Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s limitations: They are lower than those of other States, and lower than those we have upheld in previous cases, <em>i.e.</em>, <em>Buckley </em>and <em>Shrink</em>.  But the relative limits of other States cannot be the key factor, for such considerations are nothing more than a moving target.  After all, if the Vermont Legislature simply persuaded several other States to lower their contribution limits to parallel Act 64, then the Act, which would still \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly restrict the amount of funding available for challengers to run competitive campaigns,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19, would survive this aspect of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s proposed test.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is the relationship of these limits to those in <em>Buckley </em>and <em>Shrink </em>a critical fact.  In <em>Shrink,</em> the Court specifically determined<em> </em>that <em>Buckley </em>did not \xe2\x80\x9cset a minimum constitutional threshold for contribution limits,\xe2\x80\x9d rejecting such a contention as a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental misunderstanding of what we held.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 U. S., at 396.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s current treatment of the limits in <em>Shrink </em>as a constitutional minimum, or at least as limits below which \xe2\x80\x9cdanger signs\xe2\x80\x9d are present, thus cannot be reconciled with <em>Shrink</em> itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having nevertheless concluded that these \xe2\x80\x9cdanger signs\xe2\x80\x9d require us to scrutinize the record, the plurality embarks on an odd review of the contribution limits, combining unrelated factors to determine that, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>taken together</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19, the restrictions of Act 64 are not closely drawn to meet their objectives.  Two of these factors simply cause the already stringent limitations on individual contributions to be more stringent; <em>i.e.</em>, volunteer services count toward the contribution limit, <em>ante</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9327, and the limits do not change with inflation, so they will become even more stringent in time, <em>ante</em>, at 27.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  While these characteristics confirm the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s impression that these limits are, indeed, quite low, they have nothing whatsoever to do with whether the restrictions are closely drawn to meet their objectives.  The plurality would presumably uphold a limit on contributions of $1 million, even if volunteer services counted toward that limit and the limit did not change with inflation.  Characterizing these facts as shifting Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s limits from \xe2\x80\x9csuspiciously low\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ctoo low,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> provides no insight on how to draw this constitutional line.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality next departs from the general applicability of the contribution limits entirely, and notes the substantial interference of the contribution limits with the activities of parties.  Again, I do not dispute that the limitation on party contributions is unconstitutional; as I have previously noted, such limitations are unconstitutional even under <em>Buckley</em>.  See <em>Colorado II</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 476\xe2\x80\x93477.  But it is entirely unclear why the mere fact that the \xe2\x80\x9csuspiciously low\xe2\x80\x9d contribution limits <em>also apply to parties</em> should mean that those limits are in fact \xe2\x80\x9ctoo low\xe2\x80\x9d when they are applied to individuals.  If the limits impermissibly intrude upon the associational rights of parties, then the limits are unconstitutional as applied to parties.  But limits <em>on individuals </em>cannot be transformed from permissible to too low simply because they also apply to political parties.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are left, then, with two arguably relevant points to transform these contribution limits from the realm of the \xe2\x80\x9csuspicious\xe2\x80\x9d to the realm of the impermissible.  First, the limits affect a substantial portion of the money given to challengers.  But contribution limits always disproportionately burden challengers, who often have smaller bases of support than incumbents.  See Smith, 66\xe2\x80\x9370.  In <em>Shrink</em>, the Court expressly rejected the argument that a negative impact on a challenger could render a contribution limit invalid, relying on the same sort of analysis of the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>average </em>effect of contribution limits on fundraising,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 21,<em> </em>that the plurality today rejects.  See 528 U. S., at 396 (noting that 97.62% of all contributors for state auditor made contributions of less than $2,000, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven if we were to assume that the contribution limits affected respondent[\xe2\x80\x99s] ability to wage a competitive campaign \xe2\x80\xa6 a showing of one affected individual does not point up a system of suppressed political advocacy \xe2\x80\x9cthat would be unconstitutional under <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. <em>id</em>., at 420 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court in <em>Buckley</em> provided no basis for suppressing the speech of an individual candidate simply because other candidates (or candidates in the aggregate) may succeed in reaching the voting public . . . any such reasoning would fly in the face of the premise of our political system\xe2\x80\x94liberty vested in individual hands safeguards the functioning of our democracy\xe2\x80\x9d). <em> </em>An individual\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment right is infringed whether his speech is decreased by 5% or 95%, and whether he suffers alone or shares his violation with his fellow citizens.  Certainly, the First Amendment does not authorize us to judge whether a restriction of political speech imposes a sufficiently severe disadvantage on challengers that a candidate should be able to complain.  See <em>Shrink</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 427 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts have no yardstick by which to judge the proper amount and effectiveness of campaign speech\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s final justification fares no better.  Arguing that Vermont offers no justification for imposing a limit lower than that imposed in any other State is simply another way of saying that the benchmark for whether a contribution limitation is constitutional is what other States have imposed.  As I have noted above, <em>supra</em>, at 6,<em> </em>tying individuals\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment rights to the presence or absence of similar laws in other States is inconsistent with the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality recognizes that the burdens which lead it to invalidate Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits are present under \xe2\x80\x9cmany, though not all, campaign finance regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 28.  As a result, the plurality does not purport to offer any single touchstone for evaluating the constitutionality of such laws.  Indeed, its discussion offers nothing resembling a rule at all.  From all appearances, the plurality simply looked at these limits and said, in its \xe2\x80\x9cindependent judicial judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, that they are too low.  The atmospherics\xe2\x80\x94whether they vary with inflation, whether they are as high as those in other States or those in <em>Shrink </em>and <em>Buckley</em>, whether they apply to volunteer activities and parties\xe2\x80\x94no doubt help contribute to the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s sentiment.  But a feeling does not amount to a workable rule of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to say that the plurality errs in concluding that these limits are too low to satisfy even <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s lenient standard.  Indeed, it is almost impossible to imagine that any legislator would ever find his scruples overcome by a $201 donation.  See <em>Shrink</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 425 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot fathom how a $251 contribution could pose a substantial risk of \xe2\x80\x98secur[ing] a political <em>quid pro quo</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 26)).  And the statistics relied on by the plurality indeed reveal that substantial resources will be lost by candidates running campaigns under these limits.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9322.<em> </em>Given that these contribution limits severely impinge on the ability of candidates to run campaigns and on the ability of citizens to contribute to campaigns, and do so without any demonstrable need to avoid corruption, they cannot possibly satisfy even <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous level of scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s determination that this statute clearly lies on the <em>impermissible </em>side of the constitutional line gives no assistance in drawing this line, and it is clear that no such line can be drawn rationally.  There is simply no way to calculate just how much money a person would need to receive before he would be corrupt or perceived to be corrupt (and such a calculation would undoubtedly vary by person).  Likewise, there is no meaningful way of discerning just how many resources must be lost before speech is \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionately burden[ed].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 28.  <em>Buckley</em>, as the plurality has applied it, gives us license to simply strike down any limits that just <em>seem</em> to be too stringent, and to uphold the rest.  The First Amendment does not grant us this authority.  <em>Buckley </em>provides no consistent protection to the core of the First Amendment, and must be overruled.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I concur only in the judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s <em>stare decisis</em> analysis is limited to <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of expenditure limitations, its reasoning cannot be so confined, and would apply equally to <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard for evaluating contribution limits.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10 (noting, <em>inter alia</em>, that <em>Buckley</em> has engendered \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable reliance\xe2\x80\x9d that would be \xe2\x80\x9cdramatically undermine[d]\xe2\x80\x9d by overruling it now).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Ironically, the plurality is troubled by the fact that the absence of a provision adjusting the limits for inflation means that the real value of the limits will decline, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of preventing the decline [lies] upon incumbent legislators who may not diligently police the need for changes in limit levels to assure the adequate financing of electoral challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 27.

See <em>id.</em>, at 19, 27. <em> </em>But contributors, too, have a right to free speech.

A majority of the Court today decides that the expenditure and contribution limits enacted are irreconcilable with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of free speech.  I would adhere to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s decision to remand for further enquiry bearing on the limitations on candidates\xe2\x80\x99 expenditures, and I think the contribution limits satisfy controlling precedent.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rejecting Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits as directly contravening <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976) <em>(per curiam)</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311 (opinion of Breyer, J.), is at least premature.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We said in <em>Buckley</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cexpenditure limitations impose far greater restraints on the freedom of speech and association than do \xe2\x80\xa6 contribution limitations,\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U. S., at 44, but the <em>Buckley</em> Court did not categorically foreclose the possibility that some spending limit might comport with the First Amendment.  Instead, <em>Buckley</em> held that the constitutionality of an expenditure limitation \xe2\x80\x9cturns on whether the governmental interests advanced in its support satisfy the [applicable] exacting scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In applying that standard in <em>Buckley</em> itself, the Court gave no indication that it had given serious consideration to an aim that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s statute now pursues: to alleviate the drain on candidates\xe2\x80\x99 and officials\xe2\x80\x99 time caused by the endless fundraising necessary to aggregate many small contributions to meet the opportunities for ever more expensive campaigning.  Instead, we dwelt on rejecting the sufficiency of interests in reducing corruption, equalizing the financial resources of candidates, and capping the overall cost of political campaigns, see <em>id.,</em> at 55\xe2\x80\x9357.  Although Justice White went a step further in dissenting from the Court on expenditures, and made something of the interest in getting officials off the \xe2\x80\x9ctreadmill\xe2\x80\x9d driven by the \xe2\x80\x9cobsession with fundraising,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>id.,</em> at 265 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), this lurking issue was not treated as significant on the expenditure question in the <em>per curiam</em> opinion.  Whatever the observations made to the <em>Buckley</em> Court about the effect of fundraising on candidates\xe2\x80\x99 time, the Court did not squarely address a time-protection interest as support for the expenditure limits, much less one buttressed by as thorough a record as we have here.*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s argument therefore does not ask us to overrule <em>Buckley;</em> it asks us to apply <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s framework to determine whether its evidence here on a need to slow the fundraising treadmill suffices to support the enacted limitations.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s claim is serious.  Three decades of experience since <em>Buckley</em> have taught us much, and the findings made by the Vermont Legislature on the pernicious effect of the nonstop pursuit of money are significant.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Act 64, H. 28, Legislative Findings and Intent, at App. 20 (finding that \xe2\x80\x9ccandidates for statewide offices are spending inordinate amounts of time raising campaign funds\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (finding that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]obust debate of issues, candidate interaction with the electorate, and public involvement and confidence in the electoral process have decreased as campaign expenditures have increased\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Landell</em> v. <em>Sorrell</em>, 118 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 459, 467 (Vt. 2000) (noting testimony of Senator Shumlin before the legislature that raising funds \xe2\x80\x9cwas one of the most distasteful things that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do in public service\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Landell</em> v. <em>Sorrell</em>, 382 F.\xc2\xa03d 91, 123 (CA2 2004) (public officials testified at trial that \xe2\x80\x9celected officials spend time with donors rather than on their official duties\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legislature\xe2\x80\x99s findings are surely significant enough to justify the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s remand to the District Court to decide whether Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s spending limits are the least restrictive means of accomplishing what the court unexceptionably found to be worthy objectives.  See <em>id.,</em> at 124\xe2\x80\x93125, 135\xe2\x80\x93137.  The District Court was instructed to examine a variety of outstanding issues, including alternatives considered by Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature and the reasons for rejecting them.  See <em>id.,</em> at 136.  Thus, the constitutionality of the expenditure limits was not conclusively decided by the Second Circuit, and I believe the evidentiary work that remained to be done would have raised the prospect for a sound answer to that question, whatever the answer might have been.  Instead, we are left with an unresolved question of narrow tailoring and with consequent doubt about the justifiability of the spending limits as necessary and appropriate correctives.  This is not the record on which to foreclose the ability of a State to remedy the impact of the money chase on the democratic process.  I would not, therefore, disturb the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s stated intention to remand.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I would defer judgment on the merits of the expenditure limitations, I believe the Court of Appeals correctly rejected the challenge to the contribution limits.  Low though they are, one cannot say that \xe2\x80\x9cthe contribution limitation[s are] so radical in effect as to render political association ineffective, drive the sound of a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s voice below the level of notice, and render contributions pointless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 397 (2000).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The limits set by Vermont are not remarkable departures either from those previously upheld by this Court or from those lately adopted by other States.  The plurality concedes that on a per-citizen measurement Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s limit for statewide elections \xe2\x80\x9cis slightly more generous,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18, than the one set by the Missouri statute approved by this Court in <em>Shrink</em>, <em>supra</em>.  Not only do those dollar amounts get more generous the smaller the district, they are consistent with limits set by the legislatures of many other States, all of them with populations larger than Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s, some significantly so.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Montana Right to Life Assn.</em> v. <em>Eddleman,</em> 343 F.\xc2\xa03d 1085, 1088 (CA9 2003) (approving $400 limit for candidates filed jointly for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, since increased to $500, see Mont. Code Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9337\xe2\x80\x93216(1)(a)(i) (2005)); <em>Daggett</em> v. <em>Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices,</em> 205 F.\xc2\xa03d 445, 452 (CA1 2000) ($500 limit for gubernatorial candidates in Maine); <em>Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc.</em> v. <em>Kelley,</em> 427 F.\xc2\xa03d 1106, 1113 (CA8 2005) ($500 limit on contributions to legislative candidates in election years, $100 in other years); <em>Florida Right to Life, Inc.</em> v. <em>Mortham,</em> No. 6:98\xe2\x80\x93770\xe2\x80\x93CV, 2000 WL 33733256, *3 (MD Fla., Mar. 20, 2000) ($500 limit on contributions to any state candidate).  The point is not that this Court is bound by judicial sanctions of those numbers; it is that the consistency in legislative judgment tells us that Vermont is not an eccentric party of one, and that this is a case for the judicial deference that our own precedents say we owe here.  See <em>Shrink, supra,</em> at 402 (Breyer, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere a legislature has significantly greater institutional expertise, as, for example, in the field of election regulation, the Court in practice defers to empirical legislative judgments\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>ante</em>, at 14 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]rdinarily we have deferred to the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s determination of [matters related to the costs and nature of running for office]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To place Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits beyond the constitutional pale, therefore, is to forget not only the facts of <em>Shrink</em>, but also our self-admonition against second-guessing legislative judgments about the risk of corruption to which contribution limits have to be fitted.  See <em>Shrink,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 391, and n.\xc2\xa05.  And deference here would surely not be overly complaisant.  Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s legislators themselves testified at length about the money that gets their special attention, see Act 64, H. 28, Legislative Findings and Intent, at App. 20 (finding that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ome candidates and elected officials, particularly when time is limited, respond and give access to contributors who make large contributions in preference to those who make small or no contributions\xe2\x80\x9d); 382 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 122 (testimony of Elizabeth Ready: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I have only got an hour at night when I get home to return calls, I am much more likely to return [a donor\xe2\x80\x99s] call than I would [a non-donor\xe2\x80\x99s] . \xe2\x80\xa6  [W]hen you only have a few minutes to talk, there are certain people that get access\xe2\x80\x9d (alterations in original)).  The record revealed the amount of money the public sees as suspiciously large, see 118 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 479\xe2\x80\x93480 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe limits set by the legislature \xe2\x80\xa6 accurately reflect the level of contribution considered suspiciously large by the Vermont public.  Testimony suggested that amounts greater than the contribution limits are considered large by the Vermont public\xe2\x80\x9d).  And testimony identified the amounts high enough to pay for effective campaigning in a State where the cost of running tends to be on the low side, see <em>id.,</em> at 471 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the context of Vermont politics, $200, $300, and $400 donations are clearly large, as the legislature determined.  Small donations are considered to be strong acts of political support in this state.  William Meub testified that a contribution of $1 is meaningful because it represents a commitment by the contributor that is likely to become a vote for the candidate.  Gubernatorial candidate Ruth Dwyer values the small contributions of $5 so much that she personally sends thank you notes to those donors\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id., </em>at 470\xe2\x80\x93471 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn Vermont, many politicians have run effective and winning campaigns with very little money, and some with no money at all\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Several candidates, campaign managers, and past and present government officials testified that they will be able to raise enough money to mount effective campaigns in the system of contribution limits established by Act 64\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 472 (\xe2\x80\x9cSpending in Vermont statewide elections is very low \xe2\x80\xa6 . Vermont ranks 49th out of the 50 states in campaign spending.  The majority of major party candidates for statewide office in the last three election cycles spent less than what the spending limits of Act 64 would allow\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. In Vermont legislative races, low-cost methods such as door-to-door campaigning are standard and even expected by the voters\xe2\x80\x9d).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still, our cases do not say deference should be absolute.  We can all imagine dollar limits that would be laughable, and per capita comparisons that would be meaningless because aggregated donations simply could not sustain effective campaigns.  The plurality thinks that point has been reached in Vermont, and in particular that the low contribution limits threaten the ability of challengers to run effective races against incumbents.  Thus, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s limit of deference is substantially a function of suspicion that political incumbents in the legislature set low contribution limits because their public recognition and easy access to free publicity will effectively augment their own spending power beyond anything a challenger can muster.  The suspicion is, in other words, that incumbents cannot be trusted to set fair limits, because facially neutral limits do not in fact give challengers an even break.  But this received suspicion is itself a proper subject of suspicion.  The petitioners offered, and the plurality invokes, no evidence that the risk of a pro-incumbent advantage has been realized; in fact, the record evidence runs the other way, as the plurality concedes.  See <em>ante</em>, at 22 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe record does contain some anecdotal evidence supporting the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position, namely, testimony about a post-Act-64 competitive mayoral campaign in Burlington, which suggests that a challenger can \xe2\x80\x98amas[s] the resources necessary for effective advocacy,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Buckley,</em> 424 U. S., at 21\xe2\x80\x9d).  I would not discount such evidence that these low limits are fair to challengers, for the experience of the Burlington race is confirmed by recent empirical studies addressing this issue of incumbent\xe2\x80\x99s advantage.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Eom &amp; Gross, Contribution Limits and Disparity in Contributions Between Gubernatorial Candidates, 59 Pol. Research Q. 99, 99 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cAnalyses of both the number of contributors and the dollar amount of contributions [to gubernatorial candidates] suggest no support for an increased bias in favor of incumbents resulting from the presence of campaign contribution limits.  If anything, contribution limits can work to reduce the bias that traditionally works in favor of incumbents.  Also, contribution limits do not seem to increase disparities between gubernatorial candidates in general\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)); Bardwell, Money and Challenger Emergence in Gubernatorial Primaries, 55 Pol. Research Q. 653 (2002) (finding that contribution limits favor neither incumbents nor challengers); Hogan, The Costs of Representation in State Legislatures: Explaining Variations in Campaign Spending, 81 Soc. Sci. Q. 941, 952 (2000) (finding that contribution limits reduce incumbent spending but have no effect on challenger or open-seat candidate spending).  The Legislature of Vermont evidently tried to account for the realities of campaigning in Vermont, and I see no evidence of constitutional miscalculation sufficient to dispense with respect for its judgments.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Four issues of detail call for some attention, the first being the requirement that a volunteer\xe2\x80\x99s expenses count against the person\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limit.  The plurality certainly makes out the case that accounting for these expenses will be a colossal nuisance, but there is no case here that the nuisance will noticeably limit volunteering, or that volunteers whose expenses reach the limit cannot continue with their efforts subject to charging their candidates for the excess.  Granted, if the provisions for contribution limits were teetering on the edge of unconstitutionality, Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of volunteers\xe2\x80\x99 expenses might be the finger-flick that gives the fatal push, but it has no greater significance than that.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the failure of the Vermont law to index its limits for inflation is even less important.  This challenge is to the law as it is, not to a law that may have a different impact after future inflation if the state legislature fails to bring it up to economic date.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, subjecting political parties to the same contribution limits as individuals does not condemn the Vermont scheme.  What we said in <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/431/index.html">533 U. S. 431</a>, 454\xe2\x80\x93455 (2001), dealing with regulation of coordinated expenditures, goes here, too.  The capacity and desire of parties to make large contributions to competitive candidates with uphill fights are shared by rich individuals, and the risk that large party contributions would be channels to evade individual limits cannot be eliminated.  Nor are these reasons to support the party limits undercut by claims that the restrictions render parties impotent, for the parties are not precluded from uncoordinated spending to benefit their candidates.  That said, I acknowledge the suggestions in the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 briefs that such restrictions in synergy with other influences weakening party power would justify a wholesale reexamination of the situation of party organization today.  But whether such a comprehensive reexamination belongs in courts or only in legislatures is not an issue presented by these cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, there is the issue of Act 64\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of coordinated expenditures on the part of political parties, Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, \xc2\xa72809(d) (2002).  The plurality has no occasion to reach it; I do reach it, but find it insignificant.  The Republican Party petitioners complain that the related expenditure provision imposes on both the candidate and the party the burden in some circumstances to prove that coordination of expenditure did not take place, thus threatening to charge against a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s spending limits some party expenditures that are in fact independent, with an ultimate consequence of chilling speech.  See Brief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner Vermont Republican State Committee et\xc2\xa0al. 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  On the contrary, however, we can safely take the presumption on the representation to this Court by the Attorney General of Vermont: the law imposes not a burden of persuasion but merely one of production, leaving the presumption easily rebuttable.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 39\xe2\x80\x9341 (representation that the presumption disappears once credible evidence, such as an affidavit, is offered); see also Brief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner William H. Sorrell et\xc2\xa0al. 48 (the presumption \xe2\x80\x9ccontributes no evidence and disappears when facts appear.  In a case covered by the presumption, a political party need only present some evidence that the presumed fact is not true and the presumption vanishes\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Simple testimony that the expenditure was not coordinated would suffice to defeat the presumption\xe2\x80\x9d (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted)).  As so understood, the rebuttable presumption clearly imposes no onerous burden like the conclusive presumption in <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/604/index.html">518 U. S. 604</a>, 619 (1996) (principal opinion), or the nearly conclusive one in <em>Riley</em> v. <em>National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/781/index.html">487 U. S. 781</a>, 785\xe2\x80\x93786 (1988).  Requiring the party in possession of the pertinent facts to come forward with them, as easily as by executing an affidavit, does not rise to the level of a constitutionally offensive encumbrance here.  Cf. <em>County Court of Ulster Cty.</em> v. <em>Allen,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/140/index.html">442 U. S. 140</a>, 158, n. 16 (1979) (\xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that a presumption imposes an extremely low burden of production\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.,</em> being satisfied by \xe2\x80\x98any\xe2\x80\x99 evidence\xe2\x80\x94it may well be that its impact is no greater than that of a permissive inference\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I would not pass upon the constitutionality of Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure limits prior to further enquiry into their fit with the problem of fundraising demands on candidates, and because I do not see the contribution limits as depressed to the level of political inaudibility, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0In approving the public funding provisions of the subject campaign finance law, Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code, the <em>Buckley</em> Court appreciated that in enacting the provision Congress was legislating in part \xe2\x80\x9cto free candidates from the rigors of fundraising,\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U.

S. 1</a> (1976), forecloses any constitutional limitations on candidate expenditures.  This is plainly an issue on which reasonable minds can disagree.  The <em>Buckley</em> Court never explicitly addressed whether the pernicious effects of endless fundraising can serve as a compelling state interest that justifies expenditure limits, <em>post,</em> at 2 (Souter, J., dissenting), yet its silence, in light of the record before it, suggests that it implicitly treated this proposed interest insufficient, <em>ante,</em> at 11 (plurality opinion of Breyer, J.).  Assuming this to be true, however, I am convinced that <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding on expenditure limits is wrong, and that the time has come to overrule it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have not reached this conclusion lightly.

As the Court of Appeals had recognized in <em>Buckley </em>v.<em> Valeo, </em>519 F.\xc2\xa02d 821, 859 (CADC 1975) (en banc) (<em>per curiam),</em> our earlier jurisprudence provided solid support for treating these limits as permissible regulations of conduct rather than speech.  <em>Ibid.</em> (discussing <em>Burroughs</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/index.html">290 U. S. 534</a> (1934), and <em>United States</em> v. <em>Harriss,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/612/index.html">347 U. S. 612</a> (1954)); see also 519 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 841, and n. 41, 851, and n. 68.  While <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding on contribution limits was consistent with this backdrop, its holding on expenditure limits \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve[d] collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Helvering</em> v. <em>Hallock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/309/106/index.html">309 U. S. 106</a>, 119 (1940).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are further reasons for reexamining <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding on candidate expenditure limits that do not apply to its holding on candidate contribution limits.  Although we have subsequently reiterated the line <em>Buckley</em> drew between these two types of limits, we have done so primarily in cases affirming the validity of contribution limits or their functional equivalents.  See <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 134\xe2\x80\x93138; <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/431/index.html">533 U. S. 431</a>, 440\xe2\x80\x93442 (2001); <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 386\xe2\x80\x93387 (2000); cf. <em>California Medical Assn.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/182/index.html">453 U. S. 182</a>, 194\xe2\x80\x93195 (1981) (plurality opinion).  In contrast, these are our first post-<em>Buckley</em> cases that raise the constitutionality of expenditure limits on the amounts that candidates for office may spend on their own campaigns.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, while we have explicitly recognized the importance of <em>stare decisis</em> in the context of <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding on contribution limits, <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 137\xe2\x80\x93138, we have never before done so with regard to its rejection of expenditure limits.  And <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s recognition rested largely on an interest specific to <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding on contribution limits.  There, we stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsiderations of <em>stare decisis</em>, <em>buttressed by the respect that the Legislative and Judicial Branches owe to one another,</em> provide additional powerful reasons for adhering to the analysis of contribution limits that the Court has consistently followed since <em>Buckley</em> was decided.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 137\xe2\x80\x93138 (emphasis added).  This powerful buttress is absent from <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to defer to the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s judgment as to the importance of expenditure limits.  Relatedly, while Congress and state legislatures have long relied on <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s authorization of contribution limits, <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of expenditure limits \xe2\x80\x9chas not induced [comparable] detrimental reliance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Texas, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/558/index.html">539 U. S. 558</a>, 577 (2003).  See also <em>Vieth</em> v. <em>Jubelirer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/267/index.html">541 U. S. 267</a>, 306 (2004) (plurality opinion) (noting lessened <em>stare decisis</em> concern where \xe2\x80\x9cit is hard to imagine how any action taken in reliance upon [the prior case] could conceivably be frustrated\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps in partial recognition of these points, Justice White refused to abandon his opposition to <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding on expenditure limits.  See <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html">479 U.

S. 480</a>, 507\xe2\x80\x93512 (1985) (dissenting opinion).  He believed <em>Buckley</em> deeply wrong on this issue because it confused \xe2\x80\x9cthe identification of speech with its antecedents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</em> 470 U. S., at 508.  Over the course of his steadfast campaign, he converted at least one other <em>Buckley</em> participant to this position, see <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</em> 470 U. S., at 518\xe2\x80\x93521 (Marshall, J., dissenting), and his reasoning has since persuaded me\xe2\x80\x94the nonparticipating Member of the <em>Buckley</em> Court\xe2\x80\x94as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Justice White recognized, it is quite wrong to equate money and speech.  <em>Buckley,</em> 424 U. S., at 263 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  To the\ncontrary,</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe burden on actual speech imposed by limitations on the spending of money is minimal and indirect.  All rights of direct political expression and advocacy are retained.  Even under the campaign laws as originally enacted, everyone was free to spend as much as they chose to amplify their views on general political issues, just not specific candidates.  The restrictions, to the extent they do affect speech, are viewpoint-neutral and indicate no hostility to the speech itself or its effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</em> 470 U. S., at 508\xe2\x80\x93509 (White, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAccordingly, these limits on expenditures are far more akin to time, place, and manner restrictions than to restrictions on the content of speech.  Like Justice White, I would uphold them \xe2\x80\x9cso long as the purposes they serve are legitimate and sufficiently substantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley,</em> 424 U. S., at 264.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion to the contrary relied on the following oft-quoted metaphor:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing free to engage in unlimited political expression subject to a ceiling on expenditures is like being free to drive an automobile as far and as often as one desires on a single tank of gasoline.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 19, n.\xc2\xa018.</p>\n<p align="left">\nBut, of course, while a car cannot run without fuel, a candidate can speak without spending money.  And while a car can only travel so many miles per gallon, there is no limit on the number of speeches or interviews a candidate may give on a limited budget.  Moreover, provided that this budget is above a certain threshold, a candidate can exercise due care to ensure that her message reaches all voters.  Just as a driver need not use a Hummer to reach her destination, so a candidate need not flood the airways with ceaseless sound-bites of trivial information in order to provide voters with reasons to support her.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the examples of effective speech in the political arena that did not depend on any significant expenditure by the campaigner are legion.  It was the content of William Jennings Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s comments on the \xe2\x80\x9cCross of Gold\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and William McKinley\xe2\x80\x99s responses delivered from his front porch in Canton, Ohio\xe2\x80\x94rather than any expenditure of money that appealed to their cost-free audiences.  Neither Abraham Lincoln nor John F. Kennedy paid for the opportunity to engage in the debates with Stephen Douglas and Richard Nixon that may well have determined the outcomes of Presidential elections.  When the seasoned campaigners who were Members of the Congress that endorsed the expenditure limits in the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 concluded that a modest budget would not preclude them from effectively communicating with the electorate, they necessarily rejected the <em>Buckley </em>metaphor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These campaigners also identified significant government interests favoring the imposition of expenditure limits.  Not only do these limits serve as an important complement to corruption-reducing contribution limits, see <em>id.,</em> at 264 (opinion of White, J.), but they also \xe2\x80\x9cprotect equal access to the political arena, [and] free candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/604/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/604/index.html">518 U. S. 604</a>, 649\xe2\x80\x93650 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  These last two interests are particularly acute.  When campaign costs are so high that only the rich have the reach to throw their hats into the ring, we fail \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the political process from undue influence of large aggregations of capital and to promote individual responsibility for democratic government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Automobile Workers,</em> 352 U. S., at 590.  States have recognized this problem,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] but <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s perceived ban on expenditure limits severely limits their options in dealing with it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interest in freeing candidates from the fundraising straitjacket is even more compelling.  Without expenditure limits, fundraising devours the time and attention of political leaders, leaving them too busy to handle their public responsibilities effectively.  That fact was well recognized by backers of the legislation reviewed in <em>Buckley, </em>by the Court of Appeals judges who voted to uphold the expenditure limitations in that statute,<font super="1"> and by Justice White\xe2\x80\x94who not incidentally had personal experience as an active participant in a Presidential campaign.  Cf. 519 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 838 (and citations to legislative history contained therein); 424 U. S., at 265 (opinion of White, J.).  The validity of their judgment has surely been confirmed by the mountains of evidence that has been accumulated in recent years concerning the time that elected officials spend raising money for future campaigns and the adverse effect of fundraising on the performance of their official duties.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Additionally, there is no convincing evidence that these important interests favoring expenditure limits are fronts for incumbency protection.  <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s cursory suggestion to the contrary, <em>id., </em>at 56\xe2\x80\x9357, failed to take into account the mixed evidence before it on this issue.  See 519 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 861, 862 (detailing how \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he material available to the court looks both ways\xe2\x80\x9d).  And only by \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[ting] States nationwide to experiment with these critically needed reforms,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as 18 States urge us to do\xe2\x80\x94will we enable further research on how expenditure limits relate to our incumbent reelection rates.  See Brief for State of Connecticut et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In the meantime, a legislative judgment that \xe2\x80\x9cenough is enough\xe2\x80\x9d should command the greatest possible deference from judges interpreting a constitutional provision that, at best, has an indirect relationship to activity that affects the quantity\xe2\x80\x94rather than the quality or the content\xe2\x80\x94of repetitive speech in the marketplace of ideas.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One final point bears mention.  Neither the opinions in <em>Buckley</em> nor those that form today\xe2\x80\x99s cacophony pay heed to how the Framers would have viewed candidate expenditure limits.  This is not an unprincipled approach, as the historical context is \xe2\x80\x9cusually relevant but not necessarily dispositive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Randolph,</em> 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 1) (Stevens, J., concurring).  This is particularly true of contexts that are so different.  At the time of the framing the accepted posture of the leading candidates was one of modesty, acknowledging a willingness to serve rather than a desire to compete.  Speculation about how the Framers would have legislated if they had foreseen the era of televised sound-bites thus cannot provide us with definitive answers.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, I am firmly persuaded that the Framers would have been appalled by the impact of modern fundraising practices on the ability of elected officials to perform their public responsibilities.  I think they would have viewed federal statutes limiting the amount of money that congressional candidates might spend in future elections as well within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  And they surely would not have expected judges to interfere with the enforcement of expenditure limits that merely require candidates to budget their activities without imposing any restrictions whatsoever on what they may say in their speeches, debates, and interviews. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, I agree with Justice Souter that it would be entirely appropriate to allow further proceedings on expenditure limits to go forward in these cases.  For the reasons given in Parts II and III of his dissent, I also agree that Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits and presumption of coordinated expenditures by political parties are constitutional, and so join those portions of his opinion. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We have, of course, invalidated limits on independent expenditures by third persons.  <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/480/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/480/index.html">470 U.
