Tam sought federal registration of the mark \xe2\x80\x9cTHE SLANTS.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) denied the application under a Lanham Act provision prohibiting the registration of trademarks that may \xe2\x80\x9cdisparage .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or bring .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. into contemp[t] or disrepute\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, living or dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71052(a).  Tam contested the denial of registration through the administrative appeals process, to no avail.  He then took the case to federal court, where the en banc Federal Circuit ultimately found the disparagement clause facially unconstitutional under the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Free Speech Clause.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">808 F.\xc2\xa03d 1321, affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III\xe2\x80\x93A, concluding:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0The disparagement clause applies to marks that disparage the members of a racial or ethnic group.  Tam\xe2\x80\x99s view, that the clause applies only to natural or juristic persons, is refuted by the plain terms of the clause, which uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cpersons.\xe2\x80\x9d  A mark that disparages a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d percentage of the members of a racial or ethnic group necessarily disparages many \xe2\x80\x9cpersons,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, members of that group.  Tam\xe2\x80\x99s narrow reading also clashes with the breadth of the disparagement clause, which by its terms applies not just to \xe2\x80\x9cpersons,\xe2\x80\x9d but also to \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbeliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71052(a).  Had Congress wanted to confine the reach of the clause, it could have used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cparticular living individual,\xe2\x80\x9d which it used in neighboring \xc2\xa71052(c).  Tam contends that his interpretation is supported by legislative history and by the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s practice for many years of registering marks that plainly denigrated certain groups.  But an inquiry into the meaning of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text ceases when, as here, \xe2\x80\x9cthe statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barnhart </i>v. <i>Sigmon Coal Co.</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Even if resort to legislative history and early enforcement practice were appropriate, Tam has presented nothing showing a congressional intent to adopt his interpretation, and the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s practice in the years following the disparagement clause\xe2\x80\x99s enactment is unenlightening.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The disparagement clause violates the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Free Speech Clause.  Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech.  Because the \xe2\x80\x9cFree Speech Clause .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. does not regulate government speech,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Pleasant Grove City</i> v. <i>Summum</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460\n, the government is not required to maintain viewpoint neutrality on its own speech.  This Court exercises great caution in extending its government-speech precedents, for if private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Federal Government does not dream up the trademarks registered by the PTO.  Except as required by \xc2\xa71052(a),<b> </b>an examiner may not reject a mark based on the viewpoint that it appears to express.  If the mark meets the Lanham Act\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint-neutral requirements, registration is mandatory.  And once a mark is registered, the PTO is not authorized to remove it from the register unless a party moves for cancellation, the registration expires, or the Federal Trade Commission initiates proceedings based on certain grounds.  It is thus far-fetched to suggest that the content of a registered mark is government speech, especially given the fact that if trademarks become government speech when they are registered, the Federal Government is babbling prodigiously and incoherently.  And none of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s government-speech cases supports the idea that registered trademarks are government speech.  <i>Johanns</i> v. <i>Livestock Marketing Assn.</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 550\n; <i>Pleasant Grove City</i> v. <i>Summum</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460\n; and <i>Walker</i> v. <i>Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc.</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, distinguished.  Holding that the registration of a trademark converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the government-speech doctrine, for other systems of government registration (such as copyright) could easily be characterized in the same way.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts III\xe2\x80\x93B, III\xe2\x80\x93C, and IV:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that this case is governed by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsidized-speech cases is unpersuasive.  Those cases all involved cash subsidies or their equivalent, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>funds to private parties for family planning services in <i>Rust </i>v.<i> Sullivan</i>,<i> </i>\n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 173\n, and cash grants to artists in <i>National Endowment for Arts</i> v.<i> Finley</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 569\n.  The federal registration of a trademark is nothing like these programs.  The PTO does not pay money to parties seeking registration of a mark; it requires the payment of fees to file an application and to maintain the registration once it is granted.  The Government responds that registration provides valuable non-monetary benefits traceable to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s resources devoted to registering the marks, but nearly every government service requires the expenditure of government funds.  This is true of services that benefit everyone, like police and fire protection, as well as services that are utilized by only some, <i>e.g.</i>, the adjudication of private lawsuits and the use of public parks and highways.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Also unpersuasive is the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the disparagement clause is constitutional under a \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment-program\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, an argument which is based on a merger of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s government-speech cases and subsidy cases.  It points to two cases involving a public employer\xe2\x80\x99s collection of union dues from its employees, <i>Davenport</i> v. <i>Washington Ed. Assn.</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 177\n, and <i>Ysursa</i> v. <i>Pocatello Ed. Assn.</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 353\n, but these cases occupy a special area of\n \nFirst Amendment case law that is far removed from the registration of trademarks.  Cases in which government creates a limited public forum for private speech, thus allowing for some content- and speaker-based restrictions, see, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Good News Club</i> v. <i>Milford Central School</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 98\n\xe2\x80\x93107; <i>Rosenberger</i> v. <i>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819\n, are potentially more analogous.  But even in those cases, viewpoint discrimination is forbidden.  The disparagement clause denies registration to any mark that is offensive to a substantial percentage of the members of any group.  That is viewpoint discrimination in the sense relevant here: Giving offense is a viewpoint.  The \xe2\x80\x9cpublic expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Street</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 576\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The dispute between the parties over whether trademarks are commercial speech subject to the relaxed scrutiny outlined in <i>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elect. </i>v. <i>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557\n, need not be resolved here because the disparagement clause cannot withstand even <i>Central Hudson</i> review.  Under <i>Central Hudson</i>, a restriction of speech must serve \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial interest\xe2\x80\x9d and be \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly drawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 564\xe2\x80\x93565 (internal quotation marks omitted).  One purported interest is in preventing speech expressing ideas that offend, but that idea strikes at the heart of the\n \nFirst Amendment.  The second interest asserted is protecting the orderly flow of commerce from disruption caused by trademarks that support invidious discrimination; but the clause, which reaches any trademark that disparages <i>any person, group</i>,<i> or institution</i>, is not narrowly drawn.  Pp. \xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan, agreed that\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71052(a) constitutes viewpoint discrimination, concluding: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0With few narrow exceptions, a fundamental principle of the\n \nFirst Amendment is that the government may not punish or suppress speech based on disapproval of the ideas or perspectives the speech conveys.  See <i>Rosenberger</i> v. <i>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819\n\xe2\x80\x93829.  The test for viewpoint discrimination is whether\xe2\x80\x94within the relevant subject category\xe2\x80\x94the government has singled out a subset of messages for disfavor based on the views expressed.  Here, the disparagement clause identifies the relevant subject as \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71052(a); and within that category, an applicant may register a positive or benign mark but not a derogatory one.  The law thus reflects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive, the essence of viewpoint discrimination.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in defense of the statute are unpersuasive.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Regardless of whether trademarks are commercial speech, the viewpoint based discrimination here necessarily invokes heightened scrutiny.  See <i>Sorrell</i> v. <i>IMS Health Inc.</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552\n.  To the extent trademarks qualify as commercial speech, they are an example of why that category does not serve as a blanket exemption from the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of viewpoint neutrality.  In the realm of trademarks, the metaphorical marketplace of ideas becomes a tangible, powerful reality.  To permit viewpoint discrimination in this context is to permit Government censorship.

For most of the 19th century, trademark protection was the province of the States.  See <i>Two Pesos, Inc. </i>v.<i> Taco Cabana, Inc.</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 763\n\xe2\x80\x93782 (1992) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id</i>., at 785 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Eventually, Congress stepped in to provide a degree of national uniformity, passing the first federal legislation protecting trademarks in 1870.  See Act of July 8, 1870, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777\xe2\x80\x9384,\n\n16Stat.\n210\xe2\x80\x93212.<b> </b> The foundation of current federal trademark law is the Lanham Act, enacted in 1946.  See Act of July 5, 1946, ch. 540,\n\n60Stat.\n427.  By that time, trademark had expanded far beyond phrases that do no more than identify a good or service.  Then, as now, trademarks often consisted of catchy phrases that convey a message.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under the Lanham Act, trademarks that are \xe2\x80\x9cused in commerce\xe2\x80\x9d may be placed on the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal register,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, they may be federally registered.\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71051(a)(1).

This system of federal registration helps to ensure that trademarks are fully protected and supports the free flow of commerce.  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]ational protection of trademarks is desirable,\xe2\x80\x9d we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause trademarks foster competition and the maintenance of quality by securing to the producer the benefits of good reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. </i>v.<i> United States Olympic Comm.</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522,\n531 (1987)\n (internal quotation marks omitted); see also<i> Park \xe2\x80\x99N Fly, Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 198 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lanham Act provides national protection of trademarks in order to secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Without federal registration, a valid trademark may still be used in commerce.

Because racial and ethnic groups are neither natural nor \xe2\x80\x9cjuristic\xe2\x80\x9d persons, Tam asserts, these groups fall outside this definition.  Brief for Respondent 46\xe2\x80\x9348.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Tam\xe2\x80\x99s argument is refuted by the plain terms of the disparagement clause.  The clause applies to marks that disparage \xe2\x80\x9cpersons.\xe2\x80\x9d  A mark that disparages a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d percentage of the members of a racial or ethnic group, Trademark Manual \xc2\xa71203.03(b)(i), at 1200\xe2\x80\x93150, necessar-ily disparages many \xe2\x80\x9cpersons,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, members of that group.  Tam\xe2\x80\x99s argument would fail even if the clause used the singular term \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d but Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the plural \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d makes the point doubly clear.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Tam\xe2\x80\x99s narrow reading of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d also clashes with the breadth of the disparagement clause.  By its terms, the clause applies to marks that disparage, not just \xe2\x80\x9cpersons,\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbeliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71052(a).  It thus applies to the members of any group whose members share particular \xe2\x80\x9cbeliefs,\xe2\x80\x9d such as political, ideological, and religious groups.  It applies to marks that denigrate \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutions,\xe2\x80\x9d and on Tam\xe2\x80\x99s reading, it also reaches \xe2\x80\x9cjuristic\xe2\x80\x9d persons such as corporations, unions, and other unincorporated associations.  See \xc2\xa71127.  Thus, the clause is not limited to marks that disparage a particular natural person.  If Congress had wanted to confine the reach of the disparagement clause in the way that Tam suggests, it would have been easy to do so.  A neighboring provision of the Lanham Act denies registration to any trademark that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a <i>particular living individual</i> except by his written consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71052(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Tam contends that his interpretation of the disparagement clause is supported by its legislative history and by the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s willingness for many years to register marks that plainly denigrated African-Americans and Native Americans.  These arguments are unpersuasive.  As always, our inquiry into the meaning of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text ceases when \xe2\x80\x9cthe statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barnhart </i>v. <i>Sigmon Coal Co.</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438,\n450 (2002)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, it is clear that the prohibition against registering trademarks \xe2\x80\x9cwhich may disparage .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. persons,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71052(a), prohibits registration of terms that disparage persons who share a common race or  ethnicity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even if resort to legislative history and early enforcement practice were appropriate, we would find Tam\xe2\x80\x99s arguments unconvincing.  Tam has not brought to our attention any evidence in the legislative history showing that Congress meant to adopt his interpretation.  And the practice of the PTO in the years following the enactment of the disparagement clause is unenlightening.  The admitted vagueness of the disparagement test[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>] and the huge volume of applications have produced a haphazard record of enforcement.  (Even today, the principal register is replete with marks that many would regard as disparaging to racial and ethnic groups.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>])  Registration of the offensive marks that Tam cites is likely attributable not to the acceptance of his interpretation of the clause but to other factors\xe2\x80\x94most likely the regrettable attitudes and sensibilities of the time in question.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because the disparagement clause applies to marks that disparage the members of a racial or ethnic group, we must decide whether the clause violates the Free Speech Clause of the\n \nFirst Amendment.  And at the outset, we must consider three arguments that would either eliminate any\n \nFirst Amendment protection or result in highly permissive rational-basis review.  Specifically, the Government contends (1) that trademarks are government speech, not private speech, (2) that trademarks are a form of government subsidy, and (3) that the constitutionality of the disparagement clause should be tested under a new \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment-program\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine.  We address each of these arguments below.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The\n \nFirst Amendment prohibits Congress and other government entities and actors from \xe2\x80\x9cabridging the freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d; the\n \nFirst Amendment does not say that Congress and other government entities must abridge their own ability to speak freely.  And our cases recognize that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Free Speech Clause .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. does not regulate government speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pleasant Grove City</i> v. <i>Summum</i>, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460, 467 (2009); see <i>Johanns </i>v. <i>Livestock Marketing Assn</i>.,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 550,\n553 (2005)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Government\xe2\x80\x99s own speech .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is exempt from\n \nFirst Amendment scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.

When a government entity embarks on a courseof action, it necessarily takes a particular viewpointand rejects others.  The Free Speech Clause does not re-quire government to maintain viewpoint neutrality when its officers and employees speak about that venture.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here is a simple example.  During the Second World War, the Federal Government produced and distributed millions of posters to promote the war effort.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  There were posters urging enlistment, the purchase of war bonds, and the conservation of scarce resources.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  These posters expressed a viewpoint, but the\n \nFirst Amendment did not demand that the Government balance the message of these posters by producing and distributing posters encouraging Americans to refrain from engaging in these activities.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But while the government-speech doctrine is important\xe2\x80\x94indeed, essential\xe2\x80\x94it is a doctrine that is susceptible to dangerous misuse.  If private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints.  For this reason, we must exercise great caution before extending our government-speech precedents.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At issue here is the content of trademarks that are registered by the PTO, an arm of the Federal Government.  The Federal Government does not dream up these marks, and it does not edit marks submitted for registration.  Except as required by the statute involved here,\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71052(a),<b> </b>an examiner may not reject a mark based on the viewpoint that it appears to express.  Thus, unless that section is thought to apply, an examiner does not inquire whether any viewpoint conveyed by a mark is consistent with Government policy or whether any such viewpoint is consistent with that expressed by other marks already on the principal register.  Instead, if the mark meets the Lanham Act\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint-neutral requirements, registration is mandatory.  <i>Ibid.</i> (requiring that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o trademark .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless\xe2\x80\x9d it falls within an enumerated statutory exception).  And if an examiner finds that a mark is eligible for placement on the principal register, that decision is not reviewed by any higher official unless the registration is challenged.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71062(a), 1071; 37 CFR \xc2\xa741.31(a) (2016).  Moreover, once a mark is registered, the PTO is not authorized to remove it from the register unless a party moves for cancellation, the registration expires, or the Federal Trade Commission initiates proceedings based on certain grounds.  See 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71058(a), 1059, 1064; 37 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72.111(b), 2.160.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of all this, it is far-fetched to suggest that the content of a registered mark is government speech.  If the federal registration of a trademark makes the mark government speech, the Federal Government is babbling prodigiously and incoherently.  It is saying many unseemly things.  See App. to Brief for Pro-Football, Inc., as <i>Amicus Curiae</i>.

See <i>In re Old Glory Condom Corp</i>., 26 USPQ\xc2\xa02d 1216, 1220, n.\xc2\xa03 (TTAB 1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]ssuance of a trademark registration .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not a government imprimatur\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it is unlikely that more than a tiny fraction of the public has any idea what federal registration of a trademark means.  See <i>Application of National Distillers &amp; Chemical Corp.</i>, 49 C. C. P. A. (Pat.) 854, 863, 297 F.\xc2\xa02d 941, 949 (1962) (Rich, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe purchasing public knows no more about trademark registrations than a man walking down the street in a strange city knows about legal title to the land and buildings he passes\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">None of our government speech cases even remotely supports the idea that registered trademarks are government speech.  In <i>Johanns, </i>we considered advertisements promoting the sale of beef products.  A federal statute called for the creation of a program of paid advertising \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to advance the image and desirability of beef and beef products.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561 (quoting 7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa02902(13)).  Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture provided guidelines for the content of the ads, Department of Agriculture officials attended the meetings at which the content of specific ads was discussed, and the Secretary could edit or reject any proposed ad.  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561.  Noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he message set out in the beef promotions [was] from beginning to end the message established by the Federal Government,\xe2\x80\x9d we held that the ads were government speech.  <i>Id.</i>, at 560.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the creation of these beef ads bears no resemblance to anything that occurs when a trademark is registered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our decision in <i>Summum</i> is similarly far afield.  A small city park contained 15 monuments.  555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 464.  Eleven had been donated by private groups, and one of these displayed the Ten Commandments.  <i>Id.</i>, at 464\xe2\x80\x93465.  A religious group claimed that the city, by accepting donated monuments, had created a limited public forum for private speech and was therefore obligated to place in the park a monument expressing the group\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Holding that the monuments in the park represented government speech, we cited many factors.  Governments have used monuments to speak to the public since ancient times; parks have traditionally been selective in accepting and displaying donated monuments; parks would be overrun if they were obligated to accept all monuments offered by private groups; \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ublic parks are often closely identified in the public mind with the government unit that owns the land\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he monuments that are accepted .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 472.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Trademarks share none of these characteristics.  Trademarks have not traditionally been used to convey a Government message.  With the exception of the enforcement of\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71052(a), the viewpoint expressed by a mark has not played a role in the decision whether to place it on the principal register.  And there is no evidence that the public associates the contents of trademarks with the Federal Government.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This brings us to the case on which the Government relies most heavily, <i>Walker</i>, which likely marks the outer bounds of the government-speech doctrine.  Holding that the messages on Texas specialty license plates are government speech, the <i>Walker</i> Court cited three factors distilled from <i>Summum</i>.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938).  First, license plates have long been used by the States to convey state messages.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310).  Second, license plates \xe2\x80\x9care often closely identified in the public mind\xe2\x80\x9d with the State, since they are manufactured and owned by the State, generally designed by the State, and serve as a form of \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment ID.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Third, Texas \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain[ed] direct control over the mes-sages conveyed on its specialty plates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11).  As explained above, none of these factors are present in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, the federal registration of trademarks is vastly different from the beef ads in <i>Johanns</i>, the monuments in <i>Summum</i>, and even the specialty license plates in <i>Walker</i>.  Holding that the registration of a trademark converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the government-speech doctrine.  For if the registration of trademarks constituted government speech, other systems of government registration could easily be characterized in the same way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Perhaps the most worrisome implication of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument concerns the system of copyright registration.  If federal registration makes a trademark government speech and thus eliminates all\n \nFirst Amendment protection, would the registration of the copyright for a book produce a similar transformation?  See 808 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1346 (explaining that if trademark registration amounts to government speech, \xe2\x80\x9cthen copyright registration\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9chas identical accoutrements\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9clikewise amount to government speech\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government attempts to distinguish copyright on the ground that it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the engine of free expression,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 47 (quoting <i>Eldred</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186,\n219 (2003)\n), but as this case illustrates, trademarks often have an expressive content.  Companies spend huge amounts to create and publicize trademarks that convey a message.  It is true that the necessary brevity of trademarks limits what they can say.  But powerful messages can sometimes be conveyed in just a few words.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Trademarks are private, not government, speech.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We next address the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that this case is governed by cases in which this Court has upheld the constitutionality of government programs that subsidized speech expressing a particular viewpoint.  These cases implicate a notoriously tricky question of constitutional law.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have held that the Government \xe2\x80\x98may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Agency for Int\xe2\x80\x99l Development</i> v.<i> Alliance for Open Society Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc</i>., 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8) (some internal quotation marks omitted).  But at the same time, government is not required to subsidize activities that it does not wish to promote.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Determining which of these principles applies in a particular case \xe2\x80\x9cis not always self-evident,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11), but no difficult question is presented here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the present case, the decisions on which the Government relies all involved cash subsidies or their equivalent.<i> </i> In<i> Rust </i>v.<i> Sullivan</i>,<i> </i>\n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 173 (1991)\n, a federal law provided funds to private parties for family planning services.  In <i>National Endowment for Arts</i> v.<i> Finley</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 569 (1998)\n, cash grants were awarded to artists.  And federal funding for public libraries was at issue in <i>United States</i> v. <i>American Library Assn., Inc.</i>,\n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194 (2003)\n.  In other cases, we have regarded tax benefits as comparable to cash subsidies.  See <i>Regan </i>v.<i> Taxation With Representation of Wash.</i>,<i> </i>\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 540 (1983)\n; <i>Cammarano </i>v.<i> United States</i>, 358 U.\xc2\xa0S 498 (1959).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The federal registration of a trademark is nothing like the programs at issue in these cases.  The PTO does not pay money to parties seeking registration of a mark.  Quite the contrary is true: An applicant for registration must pay the PTO a filing fee of $225\xe2\x80\x93$600.  37 CFR \xc2\xa72.6(a)(1).  (Tam submitted a fee of $275 as part of his application to register THE SLANTS.  App. 18.)  And to maintain federal registration, the holder of a mark must pay a fee of $300\xe2\x80\x93$500 every 10 years.  \xc2\xa72.6(a)(5); see also\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71059(a).  The Federal Circuit concluded that these fees have fully supported the registration system for the past 27 years.  808 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1353.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government responds that registration provides valuable non-monetary benefits that \xe2\x80\x9care directly trace-able to the resources devoted by the federal government to examining, publishing, and issuing certificates of registration for those marks.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 27.  But just about every government service requires the expenditure of government funds.  This is true of services that benefit everyone, like police and fire protection, as well as services that are utilized by only some, <i>e.g</i>., the adjudication of private lawsuits and the use of public parks and highways.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Trademark registration is not the only government registration scheme.  For example, the Federal Government registers copyrights and patents.  State governments and their subdivisions register the title to real property and security interests; they issue driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses, motor vehicle registrations, and hunting, fishing, and boating licenses or permits.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cases like <i>Rust </i>and <i>Finley</i> are not instructive in analyzing the constitutionality of restrictions on speech imposed in connection with such services. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, the Government urges us to sustain the disparagement clause under a new doctrine that would apply to \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment-program\xe2\x80\x9d cases.  For the most part, this argument simply merges our government-speech cases and the previously discussed subsidy cases in an attempt to construct a broader doctrine that can be applied to the registration of trademarks.  The only new element in this construct consists of two cases involving a public employer\xe2\x80\x99s collection of union dues from its employees.  Butthose cases occupy a special area of\n \nFirst Amendment case law, and they are far removed from the registration of trademarks.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Davenport</i> v. <i>Washington Ed. Assn.</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 177\n\xe2\x80\x93182 (2007), a Washington law permitted a public employer automatically to deduct from the wages of employees who chose not to join the union the portion of union dues used for activities related to collective bargaining.  But unless these employees affirmatively consented, the law did not allow the employer to collect the portion of union dues that would be used in election activities.  <i>Id.</i>, at 180\xe2\x80\x93182.  A public employee union argued that this law unconstitutionally restricted its speech based on its con-tent; that is, the law permitted the employer to assist union speech on matters relating to collective bargaining but made it harder for the union to collect money to support its election activities.  <i>Id.</i>, at 188.  Upholding this law, we characterized it as imposing a \xe2\x80\x9cmodest limitation\xe2\x80\x9d on an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, taking money from the wages of non-union members and turning it over to the union free of charge.  <i>Id.</i>, at 184.  Refusing to confer an even greater benefit, we held, did not upset the marketplace of ideas and did not abridge the union\xe2\x80\x99s free speech rights.  <i>Id.</i>, at 189\xe2\x80\x93190.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Ysursa</i> v. <i>Pocatello Ed. Assn.</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 353 (2009)\n, is similar.  There, we considered an Idaho law that allowed public employees to elect to have union dues deducted from their wages but did not allow such a deduction for money remitted to the union\xe2\x80\x99s political action committee.  <i>Id.</i>, at 355.  We reasoned that the \xe2\x80\x9cthe government .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [was] not required to assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 358; see also <i>id.</i>, at 355 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe\n \nFirst Amendment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. does not confer an affirmative right to use government payroll mechanisms for the purpose of obtaining funds for expression\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Davenport</i> and <i>Ysursa</i> are akin to our subsidy cases.  Although the laws at issue in <i>Davenport</i> and <i>Ysursa </i>did not provide cash subsidies to the unions, they conferred a very valuable benefit\xe2\x80\x94the right to negotiate a collective-bargaining agreement under which non-members would be obligated to pay an agency fee that the public employer would collect and turn over to the union free of charge.  As in the cash subsidy cases, the laws conferred this benefit because it was thought that this arrangement served important government interests.  See <i>Abood</i> v. <i>Detroit Bd. of Ed.</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 209\n\xe2\x80\x93226 (1977).  But the challenged laws did not go further and provide convenient collection mechanisms for money to be used in political activities.  In essence, the Washington and Idaho lawmakers chose to confer a substantial non-cash benefit for the purpose of furthering activities that they particularly desired to promote but not to provide a similar benefit for the purpose of furthering other activities.  Thus, <i>Davenport</i> and <i>Ysursa</i> are no more relevant for present purposes than the subsidy cases previously discussed.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">Potentially more analogous are cases in which a unit of government creates a limited public forum for private speech.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Good News Club</i> v. <i>Milford Central School</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 98\n\xe2\x80\x93107 (2001); <i>Rosenberger</i> v.<i> Rec-tor and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819,\n831 (1995)\n; <i>Lamb\xe2\x80\x99s Chapel</i>, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 392\xe2\x80\x93393.  See also <i>Legal Services Corporation</i> v.<i> Velazquez</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533\n\xe2\x80\x93544 (2001).  When government creates such a forum, in either a literal or \xe2\x80\x9cmetaphysical\xe2\x80\x9d sense, see <i>Rosenberger</i>,<i> </i>515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 830, some content- and speaker-based restrictions may be allowed, see <i>id</i>., at 830\xe2\x80\x93831.  However, even in such cases, what we have termed \xe2\x80\x9cviewpoint discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d is forbidden.  <i>Id.</i>, at 831.    </p>\n<p style="p-Normal">Our cases use the term \xe2\x80\x9cviewpoint\xe2\x80\x9d discrimination in a broad sense, see <i>ibid.</i>, and in that sense, the disparagement clause discriminates on the bases of \xe2\x80\x9cviewpoint.\xe2\x80\x9d  To be sure, the clause evenhandedly prohibits disparagement of all groups.  It applies equally to marks that damn Democrats and Republicans, capitalists and socialists, and those arrayed on both sides of every possible issue.  It denies registration to any mark that is offensive to a substantial percentage of the members of any group.  But in the sense relevant here, that is viewpoint discrimination: Giving offense is a viewpoint.  </p>\n<p style="p-Normal">We have said time and again that \xe2\x80\x9cthe public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Street</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 576,\n592 (1969)\n.

Corp.</i> v. <i>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557 (1980)\n.  The Government and <i>amici</i> supporting its position argue that all trademarks are commercial speech.  They note that the central purposes of trademarks are commercial and that federal law regulates trademarks to promote fair and orderly interstate commerce.  Tam and his <i>amici</i>, on the other hand, contend that many, if not all, trademarks have an expressive component.  In other words, these trademarks do not simply identify the source of a product or service but go on to say something more, either about the product or service or some broader issue.  The trademark in this case illustrates this point.  The name \xe2\x80\x9cThe Slants\xe2\x80\x9d not only identifies the band but expresses a view about social issues.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We need not resolve this debate between the parties because the disparagement clause cannot withstand even <i>Central Hudson</i> review.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">17</a>]  Under <i>Central Hudson</i>, a restriction of speech must serve \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial interest,\xe2\x80\x9d and it must be \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly drawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 564\xe2\x80\x93565 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This means, among other things, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he regulatory technique may extend only as far as the interest it serves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 565.  The disparagement clause fails this requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is claimed that the disparagement clause serves two interests.  The first is phrased in a variety of ways in the briefs.  Echoing language in one of the opinions below, the Government asserts an interest in preventing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98underrepresented groups\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d from being \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bombarded with demeaning messages in commercial advertising.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 48 (quoting 808 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1364 (Dyk, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  An <i>amicus</i> supporting the Government refers to \xe2\x80\x9cencouraging racial tolerance and protecting the privacy and welfare of individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Native American Organizations as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 21.  But no matter how the point is phrased, its unmistakable thrust is this: The Government has an interest in preventing speech expressing ideas that offend.  And, as we have explained, that idea strikes at the heart of the\n \nFirst Amendment.\xc2\xa0 Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express \xe2\x80\x9cthe thought that we hate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Schwimmer</i>,\n\n279 U.\xc2\xa0S. 644,\n655 (1929)\n (Holmes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second interest asserted is protecting the orderly flow of commerce.  See 808 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1379\xe2\x80\x931381 (Reyna, J., dissenting); Brief for Petitioner 49; Brief for Native American Organizations as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18\xe2\x80\x9321.  Commerce, we are told, is disrupted by trademarks that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] disparagement of race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and similar demographic classification.\xe2\x80\x9d  808 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1380\xe2\x80\x931381 (opinion of Reyna, J.).  Such trademarks are analogized to discriminatory conduct, which has been recognized to have an adverse effect on commerce.  See <i>ibid.</i>; Brief for Petitioner 49;Brief for Native American Organizations as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 18\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A simple answer to this argument is that the disparagement clause is not \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to drive out trademarks that support invidious discrimination.  The clause reaches any trademark that disparages <i>any person, group, or institution</i>.  It applies to trademarks like the following: \xe2\x80\x9cDown with racists,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDown with sexists,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDown with homophobes.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is not an anti-discrimination clause; it is a happy-talk clause.  In this way, it goes much further than is necessary to serve the interest asserted.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The clause is far too broad in other ways as well.  The clause protects every person living or dead as well as every institution.  Is it conceivable that commerce would be disrupted by a trademark saying: \xe2\x80\x9cJames Buchanan was a disastrous president\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cSlavery is an evil institution\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is also a deeper problem with the argument that commercial speech may be cleansed of any expression likely to cause offense.

See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Stevens</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460,\n468 (2010)\n.  Aside from these and a few other narrow exceptions, it is a fundamental principle of the\n \nFirst Amendment that the government may not punish or suppress speech based on disapproval of the ideas or perspectives the speech conveys.  See <i>Rosenberger</i> v. <i>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819\n\xe2\x80\x93829 (1995).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The\n \nFirst Amendment guards against laws \xe2\x80\x9ctargeted at specific subject matter,\xe2\x80\x9d a form of speech suppression known as content based discrimination.  <i>Reed</i> v. <i>Town of Gilbert, </i>576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 12).  This category includes a subtype of laws that go further, aimed at the suppression of \xe2\x80\x9cparticular views .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on a subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rosenberger</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 829.

See <i>Cornelius</i> v. <i>NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.</i>,\n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 788,\n806 (1985)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he government violates the\n \nFirst Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the instant case, the disparagement clause the Government now seeks to implement and enforce identifies the relevant subject as \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71052(a).  Within that category, an applicant may register a positive or benign mark but not a derogatory one.  The law thus reflects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive.  This is the essence of viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government disputes this conclusion.  It argues, to begin with, that the law is viewpoint neutral because it applies in equal measure to any trademark that demeans or offends.  This misses the point.  A subject that is first defined by content and then regulated or censored by mandating only one sort of comment is not viewpoint neutral.  To prohibit all sides from criticizing their opponents makes a law more viewpoint based, not less so.  Cf. <i>Rosenberger</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 831\xe2\x80\x93832 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple voices are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple ways\xe2\x80\x9d).  The logic of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s rule is that a law would be viewpoint neutral even if it provided that public officials could be praised but not condemned.  The\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint neutrality principle protects more than the right to identify with a particular side.  It protects the right to create and present arguments for particular positions in particular ways, as the speaker chooses.  By mandating positivity, the law here might silence dissent and distort the marketplace of ideas.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government next suggests that the statute is viewpoint neutral because the disparagement clause applies to trademarks regardless of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s personal views or reasons for using the mark.  Instead, registration is denied based on the expected reaction of the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s audience.  In this way, the argument goes, it cannot be said that Government is acting with hostility toward a particular point of view.  For example, the Government does not dispute that respondent seeks to use his mark in a positive way.  Indeed, respondent endeavors to use The Slants to supplant a racial epithet, using new insights, musical talents, and wry humor to make it a badge of pride.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application was denied not because the Government thought his object was to demean or offend but because the Government thought his trademark would have that effect on at least some Asian-Americans.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government may not insulate a law from charges of viewpoint discrimination by tying censorship to the reaction of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s audience.  The Court has suggested that viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government intends to suppress a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs, <i>Reed</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312), but viewpoint discrimination need not take that form in every instance.  The danger of viewpoint discrimination is that the government is attempting to remove certain ideas or perspectives from a broader debate.  That danger is all the greater if the ideas or perspectives are ones a particular audience might think offensive, at least at first hearing.  An initial reaction may prompt further reflection, leading to a more reasoned, more tolerant position.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, a speech burden based on audience reactions is simply government hostility and intervention in a different guise.  The speech is targeted, after all, based on the government\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s choice of message.  And it is the government itself that is attempting in this case to decide whether the relevant audience would find the speech offensive.  For reasons like these, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have long prohibited the government from justifying a\n \nFirst Amendment burden by pointing to the offensiveness of the speech to be suppressed.  See <i>ante</i>, at 23 (collecting examples).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument in defense of the statute assumes that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mark is a negative comment.  In addressing that argument on its own terms, this opinion is not intended to imply that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is accurate.  From respondent\xe2\x80\x99s submissions, it is evident he would disagree that his mark means what the Government says it does.  The trademark will have the effect, respondent urges, of reclaiming an offensive term for the positive purpose of celebrating all that Asian-Americans can and do contribute to our diverse Nation.  Brief for Respondent 1\xe2\x80\x934, 42\xe2\x80\x9343.  While thoughtful persons can agree or disagree with this approach, the dissonance between the trademark\xe2\x80\x99s potential to teach and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on its own, opposite, and negative interpretation confirms the constitutional vice of the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The parties dispute whether trademarks are commercial speech and whether trademark registration should be considered a federal subsidy.  The former issue may turn on whether certain commercial concerns for the protection of trademarks might, as a general matter, be the basis for regulation.  However that issue is resolved, the viewpoint based discrimination at issue here necessarily invokes heightened scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cCommercial speech is no exception,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court has explained, to the principle that the\n \nFirst Amendment \xe2\x80\x9crequires heightened scrutiny whenever the government creates a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sorrell</i> v. <i>IMS Health Inc.</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552,\n566 (2011)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Unlike content based discrimination, discrimination based on viewpoint, including a regulation that targets speech for its offensiveness, remains of serious concern in the commercial context.  See <i>Bolger</i> v. <i>Youngs Drug Products Corp.</i>,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 60\n\xe2\x80\x9372 (1983).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To the extent trademarks qualify as commercial speech, they are an example of why that term or category does not serve as a blanket exemption from the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of viewpoint neutrality.  Justice Holmes\xe2\x80\x99 reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cfree trade in ideas\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cpower of . . . thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Abrams</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n250 U.\xc2\xa0S. 616,\n630 (1919)\n (dissenting opinion), was a metaphor.  In the realm of trademarks, the metaphorical marketplace of ideas becomes a tangible, powerful reality.  Here that real marketplace exists as a matter of state law and our common-law tradition, quite without regard to the Federal Government.  See <i>ante,</i> at 2.  These marks make up part of the expression of everyday life, as with the names of entertainment groups, broadcast networks, designer clothing, newspapers, automobiles, candy bars, toys, and so on.  See Brief for Pro-Football, Inc., as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8 (collecting examples).<i> </i>Nonprofit organizations\xe2\x80\x94ranging from medical-research charities and other humanitarian causes to political advocacy groups\xe2\x80\x94also have trademarks, which they use to compete in a real economic sense for funding and other resources as they seek to persuade others to join their cause.  See <i>id.,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (collecting examples).  To permit viewpoint discrimination in this context is to permit Government censorship.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case does not present the question of how other provisions of the Lanham Act should be analyzed under the\n \nFirst Amendment.  It is well settled, for instance, that to the extent a trademark is confusing or misleading the law can protect consumers and trademark owners.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>FTC</i> v. <i>Winstead Hosiery Co.</i>,\n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483,\n493 (1922)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe labels in question are literally false, and . . . palpably so.  All are, as the Commission found, calculated to deceive and do in fact deceive a substantial portion of the purchasing public\xe2\x80\x9d).  This case also does not involve laws related to product labeling or otherwise designed to protect consumers.  See <i>Sorrell</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 579 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in protecting consumers from commercial harms explains why commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).<i> </i>These considerations, however, do not alter the speech principles that bar the viewpoint discrimination embodied in the statutory provision at issue here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is telling that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have recognized just one narrow situation in which viewpoint discrimination is permissible: where the government itself is speaking or recruiting others to communicate a message on its behalf.  See <i>Legal Services Corporation</i> v. <i>Velazquez</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533\n\xe2\x80\x93542 (2001); <i>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System</i> v. <i>Southworth</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 217,\n229,\n235 (2000)\n; <i>Rosenberger</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 833.  The exception is necessary to allow the government to stake out positions and pursue policies.  See <i>Southworth</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 235; see also <i>ante,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  But it is also narrow, to prevent the government from claiming that every government program is exempt from the\n \nFirst Amendment.  These cases have identified a number of factors that, if present, suggest the government is speaking on its own behalf; but none are present here.  See <i>ante, </i>at 14\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There may be situations where private speakers are selected for a government program to assist the government in advancing a particular message.  That is not this case either.  The central purpose of trademark registration is to facilitate source identification.  To serve that broad purpose, the Government has provided the benefits of federal registration to millions of marks identifying every type of product and cause.  Registered trademarks do so by means of a wide diversity of words, symbols, and mes-sages.  Whether a mark is disparaging bears no plausible relation to that goal.  While defining the purpose and scope of a federal program for these purposes can be complex, see, <i>e.g., Agency for Int\xe2\x80\x99l Development </i>v.<i> Alliance for Open Society Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8), our cases are clear that viewpoint discrimination is not permitted where, as here, the Government \xe2\x80\x9cexpends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Velazquez</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 542 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all.  The\n \nFirst Amendment does not entrust that power to the government\xe2\x80\x99s benevolence.  Instead, our reliance must be on the substantial safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in part and concur in the judgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3749203">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 15\xe2\x80\x931293</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">JOSEPH MATAL, INTERIM DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, PETITIONER <i>v. </i>SIMON SHIAO TAM</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[June 19, 2017]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I join the opinion of Justice Alito, except for Part II.
