Dedeaux injured his back in an accident related to his employment for Entex, Inc. (Entex).  Entex had at this time a long-term disability employee benefit plan established by purchasing a group insurance policy from petitioner, Pilot Life Insurance Co. (Pilot Life).  Entex collected and matched its employees\' contributions to the plan and forwarded those funds to Pilot Life; the employer also provided forms to its employees for processing disability claims, and forwarded completed forms to Pilot Life.  Pilot Life bore the responsibility of determining who would receive disability benefits.  Although Dedeaux sought permanent disability benefits following the 1975 accident, Pilot Life terminated his benefits after two years.  During the following three years, Dedeaux\'s benefits were reinstated and terminated by Pilot Life several times.</p>\n<p>In 1980, Dedeaux instituted a diversity action against Pilot Life in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi.  Dedeaux\'s complaint contained three counts:  "Tortious Breach of Contract"; "Breach of Fiduciary Duties"; and "Fraud in the Inducement."  App. 18-23.  Dedeaux sought "[d]amages for failure to provide benefits under the insurance policy in a sum to be determined at the time of trial," "[g]eneral damages for mental and emotional distress and other incidental damages in the sum of $250,000.00," and "[p]unitive and exemplary damages in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="44">Page 481 U. S. 44</a></p><p> sum of $500,000.00."  <em>Id.</em> at 23-24.  Dedeaux did not assert any of the several causes of action available to him under ERISA, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/case.html#53">481 U. S. 53</a></span>.</p>\n<p>At the close of discovery, Pilot Life moved for summary judgment, arguing that ERISA preempted Dedeaux\'s common law claim for failure to pay benefits on the group insurance policy.  The District Court granted Pilot Life summary judgment, finding all Dedeaux\'s claims preempted.  App. to Pet. Cert. 16a.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, primarily on the basis of this Court\'s decision in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/case.html">471 U. S. 724</a></span> (1985).  <em>See</em> 770 F.2d 1311 (1985).  We granted certiorari, 478 U.S. 1004 (1986), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In ERISA, Congress set out to</p>\n<p>"protect . . . participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto, by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 2, as set forth in 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1001(b).  ERISA comprehensively regulates, among other things, employee welfare benefit plans that, "through the purchase of insurance or otherwise," provide medical, surgical, or hospital care, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, or death.  \xc2\xa7 3(1), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1002(1).</p>\n<p>Congress capped off the massive undertaking of ERISA with three provisions relating to the preemptive effect of the federal legislation:</p>\n<p>"Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section [the saving clause], the provisions of this subchapter and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="45">Page 481 U. S. 45</a></p><p> subchapter III of this chapter shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan. . . ."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 514(a), as set forth in 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(a) (preemption clause).</p>\n<p>"Except as provided in subparagraph (B) [the deemer clause], nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A), as set forth in 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A) (saving clause).</p>\n<p>"Neither an employee benefit plan . . . nor any trust established under such a plan, shall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer, bank, trust company, or investment company or to be engaged in the business of insurance or banking for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies, insurance contracts, banks, trust companies, or investment companies."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(B), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(B) (deemer clause).</p>\n<p>To summarize the pure mechanics of the provisions quoted above:   If a state law "relate[s] to . . . employee benefit plan[s]," it is preempted.  \xc2\xa7 514(a).  The saving clause excepts from the preemption clause laws that "regulat[e] insurance."  \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A).  The deemer clause makes clear that a state law that "purport[s] to regulate insurance" cannot deem an employee benefit plan to be an insurance company.  \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>"[T]he question whether a certain state action is preempted by federal law is one of congressional intent.

Javits).</p>\n<p>In <em>Metropolitan Life,</em> this Court, noting that the preemption and saving clauses "perhaps are not a model of legislative drafting," 471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/case.html#739">471 U. S. 739</a></span>, interpreted these clauses in relation to a Massachusetts statute that required minimum </p><p><a class="page-number" name="47">Page 481 U. S. 47</a></p><p> mental health care benefits to be provided Massachusetts residents covered by general health insurance policies.  The appellants in Metropolitan Life argued that the state statute, as applied to insurance policies purchased by employee health care plans regulated by ERISA, was preempted.</p>\n<p>The Court concluded, first, that the Massachusetts statute did "relate to . . . employee benefit plan[s]," thus placing the state statute within the broad sweep of the preemption clause, \xc2\xa7 514(a).  <em>Metropolitan Life, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/case.html#739">471 U. S. 739</a></span>.  However, the Court held that, because the state statute was one that "regulate[d] insurance," the saving clause prevented the state law from being preempted.  In determining whether the Massachusetts statute regulated insurance, the Court was guided by case law interpreting the phrase "business of insurance" in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 33, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1011 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p>Given the "statutory complexity" of ERISA\'s three preemption provisions, <em>Metropolitan Life, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/case.html#740">471 U. S. 740</a></span>, as well as the wide variety of state statutory and decisional law arguably affected by the federal preemption provisions, it is not surprising that we are again called on to interpret these provisions.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>There is no dispute that the common law causes of action asserted in Dedeaux\'s complaint "relate to" an employee benefit plan, and therefore fall under ERISA\'s express preemption clause, \xc2\xa7 514(a).  In both <em>Metropolitan Life, supra,</em> and <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#96">463 U. S. 96</a></span>-100, we noted the expansive sweep of the preemption clause.  In both cases</p>\n<p>"[t]he phrase \'relate to\' was given its broad common-sense meaning, such that a state law \'relate[s] to\' a benefit plan \'in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Metropolitan Life, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/case.html#739">471 U. S. 739</a></span>, quoting <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#97">463 U. S. 97</a></span>.  In particular, we have emphasized that the preemption clause is not limited to "state laws specifically designed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="48">Page 481 U. S. 48</a></p><p> to affect employee benefit plans."  <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#98">463 U. S. 98</a></span>.  The common law causes of action raised in Dedeaux\'s complaint, each based on alleged improper processing of a claim for benefits under an employee benefit plan, undoubtedly meet the criteria for preemption under \xc2\xa7 514(a).</p>\n<p>Unless these common law causes of action fall under an exception to \xc2\xa7 514(a), therefore, they are expressly preempted.  Although Dedeaux\'s complaint pleaded several state common law causes of action, before this Court Dedeaux has described only one of the three counts -- called "tortious breach of contract" in the complaint, and "the Mississippi law of bad faith" in respondent\'s brief -- as protected from the preemptive effect of \xc2\xa7 514(a).  The Mississippi law of bad faith, Dedeaux argues, is a law "which regulates insurance," and thus is saved from preemption by \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Metropolitan Life,</em> we were guided by several considerations in determining whether a state law falls under the saving clause.  First, we took what guidance was available from a "common-sense view" of the language of the saving clause itself.  471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/case.html#740">471 U. S. 740</a></span>.  Second, we made use of the case law interpreting the phrase "business of insurance" under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1011 <em>et seq.,</em> in interpreting the saving clause. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Three criteria have been used to determine whether a practice falls under the "business of insurance" for purposes of the McCarran-Ferguson Act:</p>\n<p>"<em>[F]irst,</em> whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\'s risk; <em>second,</em> whether"</p>\n<p>the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship </p><p><a class="page-number" name="49">Page 481 U.

S. 129</a></span> (1982) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>In the present case, the considerations weighed in <em>Metropolitan Life</em> argue against the assertion that the Mississippi law of bad faith is a state law that "regulates insurance."</p>\n<p>As early as 1915, the Mississippi Supreme Court had recognized that punitive damages were available in a contract case when "the act or omission constituting the breach of the contract amounts also to the commission of a tort."  <em>See Nood v. Moffett,</em> 109 Miss. 757, 767, 69 So. 664, 666 (1915) (involving a physician\'s breach of a contract to attend to a woman at her approaching "accouchement").  In <em>American Railway Express Co. v. Bailey,</em> 142 Miss. 622, 631, 107 So. 761, 763 (1926), a case involving a failure of a finance company to deliver to the plaintiff the correct amount of money cabled to the plaintiff through the finance company\'s offices, the Mississippi Supreme Court explained that punitive damages could be available when the breach of contract was "attended by some intentional wrong, insult, abuse, or gross negligence, which amounts to an independent tort."  In <em>Standard Life Insurance Co. v. Veal,</em> 354 So.2d 239 (1977), the Mississippi Supreme Court, citing <em>D. L. Fair Lumber Co. v. Weems,</em> 196 Miss. 201, 16 So.2d 770 (1944) (breach of contract was accompanied by "the breaking down and destruction of another\'s fence"), <em>American Railway Express Co. v. Bailey, supra,</em> and <em>Hood v. Moffett, supra,</em> upheld an award of punitive damages against a defendant insurance company for failure to pay on a credit life policy.  Since <em>Veal,</em> the Mississippi Supreme Court has considered a large number of cases in which plaintiffs have sought punitive damages from insurance companies for failure to pay a claim under an insurance contract, and in a great many of these cases the court has used the identical formulation, first stated in <em>Bailey,</em> of what must "attend" the breach of contract in order for punitive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="50">Page 481 U. S. 50</a></p><p> damages to be recoverable.  <em>See, e.g., Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Tompkins,</em> 490 So.2d 897, 902 (1986); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Simpson,</em> 477 So.2d 242, 248 (1985); <em>Consolidated American Life Ins. Co. v. Toche,</em> 410 So.2d 1303, 1304 (1982); <em>Gulf Guaranty Life Ins. Co. v. Kelley,</em> 389 So.2d 920, 922 (1980); <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Roberts,</em> 379 So.2d 321, 322 (1980); <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Smith,</em> 357 So.2d 119, 121 (1978); <em>Lincoln National Life Ins. Co. v. Crews,</em> 341 So.2d 1321, 1322 (1977).  Recently, the Mississippi Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<p>"[w]e have come to term an insurance carrier which refuses to pay a claim when there is no reasonably arguable basis to deny it as acting in \'bad faith,\' and a lawsuit based upon such an arbitrary refusal as a \'bad faith\' cause of action."</p>\n<p><em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mississippi, Inc. v. Campbell,</em> 466 So.2d 833, 842 (1984).</p>\n<p>Certainly a common-sense understanding of the phrase "regulates insurance" does not support the argument that the Mississippi law of bad faith falls under the saving clause.  A common-sense view of the word "regulates" would lead to the conclusion that, in order to regulate insurance, a law must not just have an impact on the insurance industry, but must be specifically directed toward that industry.  Even though the Mississippi Supreme Court has identified its law of bad faith with the insurance industry, the roots of this law are firmly planted in the general principles of Mississippi tort and contract law.  Any breach of contract, and not merely breach of an insurance contract, may lead to liability for punitive damages under Mississippi law.</p>\n<p>Neither do the McCarran-Ferguson Act factors support the assertion that the Mississippi law of bad faith "regulates insurance."  Unlike the mandated-benefits law at issue in <em>Metropolitan Life,</em> the Mississippi common law of bad faith does not effect a spreading of policyholder risk.  The state common law of bad faith may be said to concern "the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured. "  The connection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="51">Page 481 U. S. 51</a></p><p> to the insurer-insured relationship is attenuated, at best, however.  In contrast to the mandated-benefits law in <em>Metropolitan Life,</em> the common law of bad faith does not define the terms of the relationship between the insurer and the insured; it declares only that, whatever terms have been agreed upon in the insurance contract, a breach of that contract may in certain circumstances allow the policyholder to obtain punitive damages.  The state common law of bad faith is therefore no more "integral" to the insurer-insured relationship than any State\'s general contract law is integral to a contract made in that State.  Finally, as we have just noted, Mississippi\'s law of bad faith, even if associated with the insurance industry, has developed from general principles of tort and contract law available in any Mississippi breach of contract case.  <em>Cf. Hart v. Orion Ins. Co.,</em> 453 F.2d 1358 (CA10 1971) (general state arbitration statutes do not regulate the business of insurance under the McCarran-Ferguson Act); <em>Hamilton Life Ins. Co. v. Republic National Life Ins. Co.,</em> 408 F.2d 606 (CA2 1969) (same).  Accordingly, the Mississippi common law of bad faith, at most, meets one of the three criteria used to identify the "business of insurance" under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and used in <em>Metropolitan Life</em> to identify laws that "regulat[e] insurance" under the saving clause.</p>\n<p>In the present case, moreover, we are obliged in interpreting the saving clause to consider not only the factors by which we were guided in <em>Metropolitan Life,</em> but also the role of the saving clause in ERISA as a whole. On numerous occasions we have noted that</p>\n<p>""<em>"[i]n expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy."\'"" </em></p>\n<p><em>Kelly v.

Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 18-19.  We agree.  The conclusion that \xc2\xa7 502(a) was intended to be exclusive is supported, first, by the language and structure of the civil enforcement provisions, and second, by legislative history in which Congress declared that the preemptive force of \xc2\xa7 502(a) was modeled on the exclusive remedy provided by \xc2\xa7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185.</p>\n<p>The civil enforcement scheme of \xc2\xa7 502(a) is one of the essential tools for accomplishing the stated purposes of ERISA. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The civil enforcement scheme is sandwiched between </p><p><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 481 U. S. 53</a></p><p> two other ERISA provisions relevant to enforcement of ERISA and to the processing of a claim for benefits under an employee benefit plan.  Section 501, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1131, authorizes criminal penalties for violations of the reporting and disclosure provisions of ERISA.  Section 503, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1133, requires every employee benefit plan to comply with Department of Labor regulations on giving notice to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits has been denied, and affording a reasonable opportunity for review of the decision denying the claim.  Under the civil enforcement provisions of \xc2\xa7 502(a), a plan participant or beneficiary may sue to recover benefits due under the plan, to enforce the participant\'s rights under the plan, or to clarify rights to future benefits.  Relief may take the form of accrued benefits due, a declaratory judgment on entitlement to benefits, or an injunction against a plan administrator\'s improper refusal to pay benefits.  A participant or beneficiary may also bring a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, and under this cause of action may seek removal of the fiduciary.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 502(a)(2), 409.  In an action under these civil enforcement provisions, the court in its discretion may allow an award of attorney\'s fees to either party.  \xc2\xa7 502(g).  <em>See Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins.

Moreover, we declined to find an implied cause of action for punitive damages in that section, noting that</p>\n<p>"\'[t]he presumption that a remedy was deliberately omitted from a statute is strongest when Congress has enacted a comprehensive legislative scheme including an integrated system of procedures for enforcement.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Russell, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/134/case.html#147">473 U.

The policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA.</p>\n<p>"The six carefully integrated civil enforcement provisions found in \xc2\xa7 502(a) of the statute as finally enacted . . . provide strong evidence that Congress did <em>not</em> intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly."</p>\n<p><em>Russell, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/134/case.html#146">473 U.

This conclusion is fully confirmed by the legislative history of the civil enforcement provision.  The legislative history demonstrates that the preemptive force of \xc2\xa7 502(a) was modeled after \xc2\xa7 301 of the LMRA. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 481 U.

[W]ith respect to suits to enforce benefit rights under the plan or to recover benefits under the plan which do not involve application of the title I provisions, they may be brought not only in U.S. district courts, but also in State courts of competent jurisdiction.  <em>All such actions in Federal or State courts are to be regarded as arising under the laws of the United States in similar fashion to those brought under section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947.</em>"</p>\n<p>H.R.Conf.Rep.

Therefore the Court\'s general observation -- that state laws related to ERISA may also fall under the saving clause -- was not focused on any particular relationship or conflict between a substantive provision of ERISA and a state law.  In particular, the Court had no occasion to consider in <em>Metropolitan Life</em> the question raised in the present case:   whether Congress might clearly express, through the structure and legislative history of a particular substantive provision of ERISA, an intention that the federal remedy provided by that provision displace state causes of action.  Our resolution of this different question does not conflict with the Court\'s earlier general observations in <em>Metropolitan Life</em>.</p>\n<p>Considering the common-sense understanding of the saving clause, the McCarran-Ferguson Act factors defining the business of insurance, and, most importantly, the clear expression of congressional intent that ERISA\'s civil enforcement scheme be exclusive, we conclude that Dedeaux\'s state law suit asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits under an ERISA-regulated plan is not saved by \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A), and therefore is preempted by \xc2\xa7 514(a).
