To these pleas there was a general replication and issues.  After these issues were joined, the plea fully administered was withdrawn, and the cause went before the jury upon the first and second pleas as above stated.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff gave in evidence the deed or lease from General Washington and Martha his wife, to Ezra Lunt, and the conveyances of the executors of General Washington, and Henry Smith Turner.</p>\n<p>The defendant then gave evidence to prove that, upon the settlement of the administration account by the defendant upon the estate of his testator, there was a balance in the hands of the administrator of $149, which he, the defendant, under the order of the orphans\' court, distributed among the next of kin of the deceased in the year 1812, no demand having been made upon him as administrator for said rent previously to this suit.  The defendant then gave in evidence to the jury a deed from the original lessee, Ezra Lunt and his wife, to James Boyd, and a deed from James Boyd to Jonathan Schofield, by which deeds, it was admitted that the premises upon which the said rent was charged had been duly conveyed to him, Jonathan Schofield.</p>\n<p>The defendant then offered Jonathan Schofield as a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="600">Page 32 U. S. 600</a></p><p> witness in the said cause, to prove that the said plaintiff had made a reentry upon the premises in question.  The said Schofield proved that he had held the premises in question from the time he obtained a deed from them -- that is to say, from 4 November, 1817, to the latter end of the year 1820; that towards the close of 1820, the plaintiff pressed him for the rents then due upon the premises, and threatened to reenter upon them if the rent was not paid; that in the year 1819, the said plaintiff and himself had a conversation in relation to the said rent, in which the plaintiff threatened to reenter upon the premises for the nonpayment, and that the said Schofield had, on his part, in the said conversation, declared his total inability to make payment, and that, at the plaintiff\'s request, he agreed, that the plaintiff should take possession of the premises and do what he pleased in consequence of the nonpayment of the said rent; that in the end of the year 1820, he received a letter from the plaintiff, on the same subject, and that the letter produced by the latter was written by him in answer thereto; that after this, he understood, that the said plaintiff had reentered on and taken upon himself the management of the said premises, and he supposed that he meant no longer to look to him for the rents, and in fact that he had reentered upon the premises; that from the year 1819 to the present time, he had had nothing to do with the premises, nor had any claim been made against him for the rent.  It was admitted that during all this time -- that is to say from January, 1821, to the present time -- the said Jonathan Schofield was wholly insolvent.</p>\n<p>The defendant then examined a witness, one Barton Lynch, who gave evidence to prove that about the beginning of the year 1821, the plaintiff engaged him to labor for him at $73 a year, and the plaintiff informed him that he was entitled to a ground rent upon the premises in question of $73; that if he would collect this rent, he might do so, and apply it to his (the plaintiff\'s) credit on account of his labor, and that he might, so far as the plaintiff had any concern in the premises, do whatever he pleased toward renting and making the most of the property; that he did not mean to reenter upon the property; that he immediately turned his attention, and found two families living upon </p><p><a class="page-number" name="601">Page 32 U. S. 601</a></p><p> it; that under an authority from the plaintiff, he entered on and repaired the premises to a pretty considerable extent, and rented the property out, from time to time, for nearly three years, and received for the rents about $140, which was paid over to the plaintiff, or rather accounted for by him to the plaintiff in the settlement of his account for his labor done for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>This evidence being given to the jury with a view of showing that a reentry had been made by the plaintiff upon the premises in question, the counsel for the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury that the said evidence was not competent to prove that the said plaintiff had reentered upon the said premises so as to vest in him a title to the said premises and to bar him from the claim which he has here made, and that it was not even competent for the jury to infer from the said evidence that such reentry had been made, which instruction the court refused to give, being of opinion that the said evidence was competent to be left to the jury for its consideration upon the question whether a reentry had been made by the plaintiff according to the terms of the clause in the aforesaid original deed from General Washington\'s executors to the said Ezra Lunt.</p>\n<p>The court having refused to instruct the jury as aforesaid, the counsel for the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury that the time at which the reentry ought to be made depended upon the lease given in evidence by the plaintiff as aforesaid, and could not be varied by the evidence given as aforesaid by the defendant, and that if it found that a reentry had been made, that it ought to be such as would conform to the deed, and that a mere occupation of the premises by a landlord or his agent, or the receipt of rents of the premises did not in themselves amount to a reentry, which instruction the court refused to give, being of opinion that it was for the said Schofield to waive any of the formalities required by law for his benefit.</p>\n<p>The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury that if the jury should be satisfied by the said evidence that the said Richard M.

The defendant pleaded in the first place that he had broken the covenants in the deed, upon which plea issue was joined.  Afterwards, a general demurrer was put in to the declaration, which being joined by the plaintiff, was, upon the hearing, overruled by the court.  Afterwards the plea of <em>plene administravit</em> was put in, which was withdrawn, and the cause was finally tried upon another plea, which, after oyer of the indenture, stated that</p>\n<p>"before the days in the declaration specified for the payment of the rent to the plaintiff under the said deed, that is to say, on, &amp;c., the plaintiff, under and by virtue of the condition of reentry in the deed contained, did enter into the premises thereby demised for nonpayment of certain rent then in arrear and unpaid, <em>and held and occupied the same as vested in him by the said entry as his absolute estate.</em>"</p>\n<p>upon which plea, issue being joined, the jury found a verdict for the defendant.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="603">Page 32 U.

It purports, on the part of General Washington, to grant to Lunt, his heirs and assigns forever, a parcel of land in Alexandria, he, Lunt, his heirs and assigns, yielding and paying for the same, on 8 August yearly, unto General Washington, his heirs and assigns, the sum of $73.  And Lunt, and his heirs and assigns, covenant with General Washington, his heirs and assigns, that he, his heirs and assigns, will, yearly and every year forever, well and truly pay the aforesaid sum of $73 to General Washington, his heirs and assigns, on the day and at the time appointed for payment, and that it shall be lawful for General Washington, his heirs and assigns, at all times, after the rent shall become due, to enter upon the premises, and distress and sale make of the goods and chattels found thereon, to satisfy the rent in arrear.  And Lunt, his heirs and assigns, further covenant with General Washington, his heirs and assigns that if the yearly rent, or any part thereof, be behind or unpaid for the space of thirty days after the same becomes due and payable, and sufficient goods and chattels of Lunt, his heirs and assigns, shall not be found upon the premises to pay and satisfy the same, it shall be lawful for General Washington, his heirs and assigns, to reenter and hold the same again, as if the indenture had never been made.  And then follows a covenant of general warranty on the part of General Washington, his heirs and assigns.</p>\n<p>The executors of General Washington, by virtue of powers given by his will, on 25 August, 1804, by indenture, after reciting the substance of the indenture, assigned and granted unto Henry S. Turner, his heirs and assigns, the said rent, by the following descriptive terms:  "the aforesaid annual rent of $73, issuing out of, and charged on, the aforesaid piece or parcel of ground, hereinbefore described."  There are no words in this indenture assigning over the rights, powers, and remedies, given by the former indenture, by distress and reentry, or the residuary interest in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="604">Page 32 U. S. 604</a></p><p> premises resulting from such reentry.  Turner, by another indenture, on 25 February, 1808, assigned and granted the same rent unto the plaintiff (Scott), his heirs and assigns, with the powers of distress and reentry, and all the covenants and stipulations in the original indenture.  But it is manifest that he could not convey them unless he had already taken them under the assignment made to him by the executors.  The declaration, too, is founded solely upon the assignment and transfer of the rent, and contains no allegation of any assignment of the collateral rights and remedies and interests in the estate.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, it is contended that whatever might be the fate of the bill of exceptions if the action were otherwise unobjectionable, the plaintiff, upon his own showing, has no title to recover, first because the rent is a mere chose in action, which cannot be transferred by itself to the assignee so as to entitle him to sue therefor in his own name, and secondly because no suit is maintainable against the defendant, as administrator, for the rent in arrear since Lunt\'s decease, as there is neither privity of estate nor of contract between him and the plaintiff.  It is added that Lunt, in fact, in his lifetime, assigned over his estate in the premises, and that his administrator is not responsible for any rent subsequently accruing and in arrear.  But this fact nowhere appears upon the pleadings, and if it did, it would not help the defendant, for it is firmly established that upon a covenant of this sort, the personal representatives of the covenantor are liable for the nonpayment of the rent after assignment, although there may also be a good remedy against the assignee. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The laws of Virginia have not, in this respect, narrowed down the responsibility existing by the common law in England, at the emigration of our ancestors.</p>\n<p>Whether the plaintiff, as assignee of the rent, not being assignee also of the estate in the premises or of the right of reentry, can maintain the present suit is quite a different question.  If he had been the assignee of the estate, or of the right </p><p><a class="page-number" name="605">Page 32 U. S. 605</a></p><p> of reentry, as well as of the rent, he would clearly be entitled to maintain it, for the laws of Virginia are in this respect coextensive with those of England.  The common law of England, and all the statutes of Parliament made in aid of the common law prior to the fourth year of the reign of King James I which are of a general nature and not local to the Kingdom, were expressly adopted by the Virginia statute of 1776, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and the subsequent revisions of its code have confirmed the general doctrine on this particular subject.  The very point was decided in <em>Havergill v. Hare,</em> Cro.Jac. 510.  There, A. being seized of an estate in fee, by indenture, granted to B., his heirs and assigns, a fee farm rent, with a clause of distress, and covenanted to levy a fine to uses, for securing the payment of the rent, so that, if the rent should be in arrear, B., his heirs and assigns, might enter into the land, and enjoy the rents thereof until the rent in arrear should be paid to them, and B. assigned, by a bargain and sale, to C., the rent, "with all the penalties, forfeitures, profits and advantages comprised in the indenture."  The fine was levied, the rent was in arrear, and C. entered, and brought <em>ejectione firmae,</em> and a special verdict having been found stating the above facts, one question was whether this contingent and future use, to arise upon nonpayment of the rent, was transferable over to C. by the bargain and sale.</p>\n<p>It was strongly urged by the defendant\'s counsel that it was a matter in privity and possibility only, which is not transferable before it falls <em>in esse.</em>  But all the justices resolved that it being a matter of inheritance, and being for the security for the payment of the rent, and waiting upon the rents, might well be transferred with the rent, and by the grant of the rent, the penalty and advantage well passed.  But if it had been a mere possibility, not coupled with any other estate, then it had not passed.  This case is full to the purpose, that such a right or security is capable of being transferred, with the rent, by apt words, and when so transferred, gives the assignee a legal title both to the rent and the attendant remedies.  It leaves, however, the point untouched whether the mere transfer of the rent, without any transfer of the right of entry (as in the present case), would give the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="606">Page 32 U. S. 606</a></p><p> assignee a right to maintain an action for the rent, seeing it is not knit by any privity of right or estate to the premises.  Upon full consideration, however, we are of opinion that the assignee of a fee farm rent, being an estate of inheritance, is, upon the principles of the common law, entitled to sue therefor in his own name.  It is an exception from the general rule that chose in action cannot be transferred, and stands upon the ground of being not a mere personal debt, but a perdurable inheritance.  Thus, if an annuity is granted to one in fee, although it be a mere personal charge, yet a writ of annuity lies therefor, by the common law, not only in favor of the party and his heirs, but of their grantee.  So the doctrine is expressly laid down by Lord Coke, Co.Litt. 144b, and he is fully borne out by authority. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  And in like manner, for a rent granted in fee, and charged on land, a writ of annuity also lies in favor of the assignee, at his election. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And since the statute of 32 Hen. VIII, c. 34, covenants of this sort, running with the estate or inheritance, are transferable to the assignee, with a full right of the benefit thereof.  So that there is no difficulty, upon principles of the common law, in giving effect to the present action.  Whether the present plaintiff has any right to reentry is a very different question, upon which, in the present posture of this case, it is unnecessary to give any opinion.  It is clear by the common law that a right of reentry always supposes an estate in the party, and cannot be reserved to a mere stranger.  So the law was laid down by the twelve judges in <em>Smith v. Packhurst,</em> 3 Atk. 135, 140, and Lord Chief Justice Willes on that occasion, in delivering their opinion, said</p>\n<p>"Therefore I have always thought that if an estate is granted to a man reserving rent, and in default of payment, a right of entry was granted to a stranger, it was void."</p>\n<p>What effect the statute of 32 Hen. VIII, c. 34, or the provisions of the revised code of Virginia may have upon this point is a question not now before us.</p>\n<p>We proceed, then, to the consideration of the bill of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="607">Page 32 U. S. 607</a></p><p> exceptions.  Two instructions were prayed by the plaintiff and one by the defendant.  The latter was given by the court, and with reference to the state of the pleadings, we see no objections thereto.  The difficulty is in the refusal of the second instruction prayed by the plaintiff; it is as follows:</p>\n<p>"The plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury that the time at which the reentry ought to be made depended upon the lease given in evidence by the plaintiff as aforesaid, and could not be varied by the evidence given as aforesaid by the defendant, and that if it found that a reentry had been made, it ought to be such as would conform to the deed, and that a mere occupation of the premises by a landlord or his agent, or the receipt of rents of the premises, did not of themselves amount to a reentry."</p>\n<p>The court refused to give the instruction, being of opinion that it was competent for the said Schofield, the actual tenant, to waive any of the formalities required by law for his benefit.</p>\n<p>Now however correct may be the opinion of the court of this right of waiver upon general principles, still the question is whether, with reference to the actual terms of the pleadings and issue before the jury, the instruction prayed for was not such as ought, upon principles of law, to have been given.  It is wholly immaterial whether the pleading might not have been so framed upon the facts as to have presented a complete defense to the action; the instruction prayed has reference to the pleadings in the case.  The averment there is that the plaintiff entered on the premises, under and by virtue of the condition of reentry in the original deed mentioned, for nonpayment of the rent; and upon the issue joined, this was the material inquiry.  It is clear that, upon such an issue, no entry not conforming to that deed and no evidence of an entry varying from it would be admissible to support it.  The sufficiency of the evidence before the jury to support the issue was properly left for its consideration.  But the defendant had a right to the instruction that the proof must conform to the allegations in the pleadings.  For these reasons, we are of opinion that the circuit court erred in refusing the above instruction, and the judgment must, on this account, be reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo</em> be awarded.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Comyn\'s Dig.
