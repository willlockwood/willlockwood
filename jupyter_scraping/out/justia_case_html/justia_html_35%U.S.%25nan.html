Elliott, 35 U.S. 10 Pet. 25 25 (1836)</h3><p><b>Harris v. Elliott</b></p><p><b>35 U.S. (10 Pet.) 25</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Certain streets were laid out by the Town of Charlestown, Massachusetts, and the proceedings relative to the same were afterwards confirmed by an act of the legislature.  The streets passed over the land of John Harris, and he afterwards received a compensation from the town for taking the land occupied by the streets.  In 1800, the United States, under the authority of an act of the Legislature of Massachusetts, purchased of Mr. Harris several parcels of land, now occupied as a navy yard.  And in 1801, by an arrangement between the Town of Charlestown and the United States, the streets, so far as they were within the limits of the navy yard, were closed up and have ever since been discontinued,</p>\n<p>and have been used as apart of the navy yard.  The agent of the United States and Mr. Harris not agreeing as to the value of the land taken for the navy yard, the value was ascertained and determined by a jury proceeding under a law authorizing the same, and the amount of the valuation paid to Mr. Harris by the</p>\n<p>United States.  The jury did not appraise the land on which the streets were</p>\n<p>laid out.  One lot of ground was appraised "with the appurtenances."  This action was instituted by the heirs of Mr. Harris claiming to be paid the value of the land on which the streets had been laid out, but which had been discontinued.  The defendant was the commandant of the navy yard.</p>\n<p>By the Court.</p>\n<p>"The term \'appurtenances,\' in common parlance and in legal acceptation, is used to signify something appertaining to another thing as principal, and which passes as incident to the principal thing.  Land cannot be appurtenant to land.  The soil and freehold of the streets did not pass to the United States, under and by virtue of the term \'appurtenances.\'"</p>\n<p>The right of the plaintiffs to the freehold of the streets is not barred by the first section of the act of the Legislature of Massachusetts of 30 October, 1781.</p>\n<p>The law in Massachusetts is well settled that where a mere easement is taken for a public highway, the soil and freehold remain in the owner of the land encumbered only with the easement, and that upon the discontinuance of the highway, the soil and freehold revert to the owner of the land.</p>\n<p>It has been repeatedly ruled in this Court that the whole case cannot be brought here under the act of 1802 upon such a general question.  The act provides only for bringing up in this manner specific questions upon which the judges in the circuit court may be apposed in opinion.</p>\n<p>This was an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit,</em> instituted in the Circuit Court of the United States at October term, 1833, against the defendant, Jesse D Elliott, the commandant of the United States Navy Yard at Charlestown, Massachusetts, in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 35 U. S. 26</a></p><p> order to determine the title claimed by the plaintiffs as heirs of John Harris, formerly of Charlestown, Massachusetts.  The United States, the real possessors and asserting an ownership of the property, took defense in the suit, being desirous of having the rights asserted by the plaintiffs ascertained and determined.</p>\n<p>The cause was submitted to the Court on a statement of facts agreed upon by the counsel for the plaintiffs, and the district attorney of the United States.  They were as follow:</p>\n<p>"In the year 1780, a committee appointed by the Town of Charlestown, in the County of Middlesex, in the State of Massachusetts, projected certain streets in said town, and laid them down on a map or plan, which was deposited and now remains in the office of the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and on the thirtieth day of October, 1781, the legislature of said commonwealth passed an act confirming the doings of said committee, and barring actions in certain cases therein specified.  The street now called Water Street (being the most southerly street on said plan) was not in fact entirely laid out by said town until the year 1795 or 1796 (a street commonly called Battery Street, which ran in the same direction, being used as a highway until that time), and that the most northerly street on said plan, called Henley or Meetinghouse Street, was not in fact laid out by said town until the year 1798 or 1799."</p>\n<p>"That John Harris, late of said Charlestown, merchant, deceased, purchased several parcels of land in said Charlestown, <em>viz.,</em> one parcel of Andrew Newell, by deed duly executed on 11 January, 1791, described as follows:  a tract of land containing five acres more or less, bounded southwesterly on land of Joseph Barrell; northwesterly on a road leading to the brick kilns; northeasterly on a highway leading from the Battery to Moulton\'s Point; southeasterly on Charles River down to low water mark; saving and reserving a highway through the same from the Battery to Moulton\'s Point.  Another parcel of land of Joseph Barrell, by deed duly executed on 16 June, 1792, <em>viz.,</em> a certain piece of land, bounded and measuring as follows, <em>viz.,</em> front on Battery Street, S.S.E., </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 35 U. S. 27</a></p><p> there measuring one hundred and seventy-seven feet; upon land of Andrew Newell, E.N.E. four hundred and fifty-eight feet; upon Back lane, N.N.W. one hundred and eighty-four feet; upon land of the heirs of Joseph Leman, Esq. W.S.W. four hundred and fifty feet; then turning upon said Leman\'s land, W.S.W. fifty-seven feet, till you come into Battery Street.  Also, a part of a wharf and land upon Battery Street, opposite to where the cellar stands, on said lane, measuring upon Battery Street, N.N.W., one hundred and fourteen feet; on Charles River, S.S.E., and continues the same breadth to low water mark, or however otherwise bounded, or be the same measure more or less, together with all the rights, privileges, and appurtenances to said granted land and premises. Another parcel of land of John Larkin, by deed duly executed 6 July, 1793, <em>viz.,</em> a certain parcel of land containing about one acre and one-half, bounded on land of John Harris W.S.W., on said Harris southerly, on land of Captain Thomas Edes; southerly, on land of Captain Thomas Harris and Amos Sampson, W.S.W. on Back Lane, N.N.W., on John Harris formerly Joseph Barrell, Esq. E.N.E. to Battery Street.  Another parcel of land of David Munroe, by deed duly executed on the third day of April, 1793, <em>viz.,</em> a piece of land containing by estimation about one-eighth of an acre, butted and bounded as follows, <em>viz.,</em> easterly and northerly by land formerly of Edward Wilson, but lately _____ Lemmon; westerly by land formerly of Colonel John Phillips and lately owned by Benjamin Wheeler, deceased, and southerly by the Street or highway called Wapping Street, or however otherwise bounded or reputed to be bounded.  The above described parcels of land comprise the two parcels of land described in the writ and are parts of the land covered by said streets as laid down on said plan and afterwards laid out."</p>\n<p>"The said Town of Charlestown, in the year 1795 and 1796, laid out the easterly part of the southerly highway on said plan (now called Water Street) over a part of the former Battery Street, and a part of the land of said John Harris conveyed to him as above described, and the said John Harris by the award of referees, dated July 25, 1796, received from said town a part of the land forming the old (Battery) Street and the sum of four </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 35 U.

The following is a copy of said award: "</p>\n<p>"The subscribers, referees chosen to determine a difference between the Town of Charlestown on one part, and John Harris of said Charlestown, merchant, on the other part, pursuant to a law for amending the streets of said town, laid waste by fire by the British troops, have met and fully heard the parties, and viewed the premises, and considered the disadvantage to the said John Harris\' lots on the street leading from the swing bridge to the place of the old battery, in said Charlestown (so far as the same has not been heretofore settled), by taking a part of said lots into the street, and also the advantage derived to said lots by discontinuing the old street, where it does not make a part of the present street, and also the advantage of the new street being more wide, commodious, and direct, than the old street was -- do award that the said Town of Charlestown do pay to the said John Harris the sum of four hundred and fifty dollars, and relinquish all claims to that part of the old street which comes within said lots, as they are left by the said new street.  The lots considered extend on the northwest side of the street, from the northeast corner of Thomas Edmands, formerly Henley\'s, to a place marked on the plan by the word \'stump,\' being on the plan a corner of a street proposed to lead to the meeting house, but not yet opened.

The value of the land so taken was ascertained by the verdict of a jury (agreeably to the provisions of said statute).

Elliott, 35 U.S. 10 Pet. 25 25 (1836)</h3><p><b>Harris v. Elliott</b></p><p><b>35 U.S. (10 Pet.) 25</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em>ON CERTIFICATE OF DIVISION BETWEEN THE JUDGES OF THE CIRCUIT\n</em></p>\n<p><em>COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Certain streets were laid out by the Town of Charlestown, Massachusetts, and the proceedings relative to the same were afterwards confirmed by an act of the legislature.  The streets passed over the land of John Harris, and he afterwards received a compensation from the town for taking the land occupied by the streets.  In 1800, the United States, under the authority of an act of the Legislature of Massachusetts, purchased of Mr. Harris several parcels of land, now occupied as a navy yard.  And in 1801, by an arrangement between the Town of Charlestown and the United States, the streets, so far as they were within the limits of the navy yard, were closed up and have ever since been discontinued,</p>\n<p>and have been used as apart of the navy yard.  The agent of the United States and Mr. Harris not agreeing as to the value of the land taken for the navy yard, the value was ascertained and determined by a jury proceeding under a law authorizing the same, and the amount of the valuation paid to Mr. Harris by the</p>\n<p>United States.  The jury did not appraise the land on which the streets were</p>\n<p>laid out.  One lot of ground was appraised "with the appurtenances."  This action was instituted by the heirs of Mr. Harris claiming to be paid the value of the land on which the streets had been laid out, but which had been discontinued.  The defendant was the commandant of the navy yard.</p>\n<p>By the Court.</p>\n<p>"The term \'appurtenances,\' in common parlance and in legal acceptation, is used to signify something appertaining to another thing as principal, and which passes as incident to the principal thing.  Land cannot be appurtenant to land.  The soil and freehold of the streets did not pass to the United States, under and by virtue of the term \'appurtenances.\'"</p>\n<p>The right of the plaintiffs to the freehold of the streets is not barred by the first section of the act of the Legislature of Massachusetts of 30 October, 1781.</p>\n<p>The law in Massachusetts is well settled that where a mere easement is taken for a public highway, the soil and freehold remain in the owner of the land encumbered only with the easement, and that upon the discontinuance of the highway, the soil and freehold revert to the owner of the land.</p>\n<p>It has been repeatedly ruled in this Court that the whole case cannot be brought here under the act of 1802 upon such a general question.  The act provides only for bringing up in this manner specific questions upon which the judges in the circuit court may be apposed in opinion.</p>\n<p>This was an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit,</em> instituted in the Circuit Court of the United States at October term, 1833, against the defendant, Jesse D Elliott, the commandant of the United States Navy Yard at Charlestown, Massachusetts, in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 35 U. S. 26</a></p><p> order to determine the title claimed by the plaintiffs as heirs of John Harris, formerly of Charlestown, Massachusetts.  The United States, the real possessors and asserting an ownership of the property, took defense in the suit, being desirous of having the rights asserted by the plaintiffs ascertained and determined.</p>\n<p>The cause was submitted to the Court on a statement of facts agreed upon by the counsel for the plaintiffs, and the district attorney of the United States.  They were as follow:</p>\n<p>"In the year 1780, a committee appointed by the Town of Charlestown, in the County of Middlesex, in the State of Massachusetts, projected certain streets in said town, and laid them down on a map or plan, which was deposited and now remains in the office of the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and on the thirtieth day of October, 1781, the legislature of said commonwealth passed an act confirming the doings of said committee, and barring actions in certain cases therein specified.  The street now called Water Street (being the most southerly street on said plan) was not in fact entirely laid out by said town until the year 1795 or 1796 (a street commonly called Battery Street, which ran in the same direction, being used as a highway until that time), and that the most northerly street on said plan, called Henley or Meetinghouse Street, was not in fact laid out by said town until the year 1798 or 1799."</p>\n<p>"That John Harris, late of said Charlestown, merchant, deceased, purchased several parcels of land in said Charlestown, <em>viz.,</em> one parcel of Andrew Newell, by deed duly executed on 11 January, 1791, described as follows:  a tract of land containing five acres more or less, bounded southwesterly on land of Joseph Barrell; northwesterly on a road leading to the brick kilns; northeasterly on a highway leading from the Battery to Moulton\'s Point; southeasterly on Charles River down to low water mark; saving and reserving a highway through the same from the Battery to Moulton\'s Point.  Another parcel of land of Joseph Barrell, by deed duly executed on 16 June, 1792, <em>viz.,</em> a certain piece of land, bounded and measuring as follows, <em>viz.,</em> front on Battery Street, S.S.E., </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 35 U.

Also, a part of a wharf and land upon Battery Street, opposite to where the cellar stands, on said lane, measuring upon Battery Street, N.N.W., one hundred and fourteen feet; on Charles River, S.S.E., and continues the same breadth to low water mark, or however otherwise bounded, or be the same measure more or less, together with all the rights, privileges, and appurtenances to said granted land and premises. Another parcel of land of John Larkin, by deed duly executed 6 July, 1793, <em>viz.,</em> a certain parcel of land containing about one acre and one-half, bounded on land of John Harris W.S.W., on said Harris southerly, on land of Captain Thomas Edes; southerly, on land of Captain Thomas Harris and Amos Sampson, W.S.W. on Back Lane, N.N.W., on John Harris formerly Joseph Barrell, Esq. E.N.E. to Battery Street.  Another parcel of land of David Munroe, by deed duly executed on the third day of April, 1793, <em>viz.,</em> a piece of land containing by estimation about one-eighth of an acre, butted and bounded as follows, <em>viz.,</em> easterly and northerly by land formerly of Edward Wilson, but lately _____ Lemmon; westerly by land formerly of Colonel John Phillips and lately owned by Benjamin Wheeler, deceased, and southerly by the Street or highway called Wapping Street, or however otherwise bounded or reputed to be bounded.  The above described parcels of land comprise the two parcels of land described in the writ and are parts of the land covered by said streets as laid down on said plan and afterwards laid out."</p>\n<p>"The said Town of Charlestown, in the year 1795 and 1796, laid out the easterly part of the southerly highway on said plan (now called Water Street) over a part of the former Battery Street, and a part of the land of said John Harris conveyed to him as above described, and the said John Harris by the award of referees, dated July 25, 1796, received from said town a part of the land forming the old (Battery) Street and the sum of four </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 35 U.

The lots considered extend on the northwest side of the street, from the northeast corner of Thomas Edmands, formerly Henley\'s, to a place marked on the plan by the word \'stump,\' being on the plan a corner of a street proposed to lead to the meeting house, but not yet opened.

"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="51">Page 35 U. S. 51</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE THOMPSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is an action of trespass, and the declaration contains two counts.  In the first count the <em>locus in quo</em> is described as a certain close situated in the Town of Charlestown, measuring four hundred feet in length and forty feet in width, formerly called Henley Street, and in the second count, the <em>locus in quo</em> is described as a close in the same town measuring seven hundred and fifty feet in length and forty feet in width, formerly called Battery or Water Street.  And upon the trial of the cause, the following questions occurred, upon which the opinions of the judges were opposed, and the points have been certified to this Court, <em>viz.,</em></p>\n<p>1. Whether the soil and freehold of the street called Henley or Meetinghouse Street, and of the street called Battery or Water Street, did or did not pass to the United States under and by virtue of the term appurtenances, used by the jury in their verdict, in description of lot No. 2, or by the description in said verdict of lots Nos. 1 and 3, or by the proceedings by which the land was taken by the United States.</p>\n<p>2. Whether the limitations contained in the said statute of October 30, 1781, is a bar to the plaintiffs\' right to recover the soil and freehold of said streets.</p>\n<p>3. Whether, upon the discontinuance of a highway in Massachusetts, by the public, the soil and freehold of such highway reverts to the owner of the land taken for such highway.</p>\n<p>4. And upon the facts above stated, whether the plaintiffs have any right or title to the land taken for said streets on which the trespass is supposed to have been committed.</p>\n<p>It appears from the statement of facts in the case that in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="52">Page 35 U. S. 52</a></p><p> year 1780, a committee, appointed by the Town of Charlestown projected certain streets in the town and laid them down on a plan or map, which was deposited and now remains in the office of the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and that on 30 October, 1781, the legislature of that state passed an act confirming the doings of that committee and barring actions in certain cases therein specified.  John Harris, the ancestor of the plaintiffs, about the year 1793, became the purchaser and owner of certain tracts of land, which comprised the two parcels described in the declaration, and which are parts of the land through which said streets are laid down on the said plan or map in the year 1780, although, in point of fact, Battery or Water Street was not laid out and opened until the year 1795 or 1796, and Henley or Meetinghouse Street not until the year 1798 or 1799.  These streets passed over the land of John Harris and he received from the Town of Charlestown a compensation in damages for taking the land belonging to him for the streets.</p>\n<p>In the year 1800, the government of the United States, under the authority of an act of the Legislature of Massachusetts, purchased of John Harris several parcels of land now included within the limits of the navy yard in the Town of Charlestown, and in the year 1801, by an arrangement between the Town of Charlestown and the United States, these streets, so far as they were within the limits of the navy yard, were closed up and have ever since been discontinued and ceased to be used as public highways, and have been used as a part of the navy yard.  The act of the Legislature of Massachusetts consenting to the purchase, and ceding the jurisdiction, provides that if the agent of the United States and the owners of the land so to be purchased cannot agree in the sale and purchase thereof, application may be made to any Court of General Sessions of the Peace of the County of Middlesex, which court is authorized to summon a jury to value the same.  The agent of the United States and John Harris not agreeing as to the value of the land so taken by the United States, the same was ascertained by a jury duly summoned according to the provisions of the act, and by the proceedings of the jury for that purpose and the return made thereupon, five lots of land were appraised, which belonged to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 35 U. S. 53</a></p><p> John Harris which are particularly described by metes and bounds, and some part of the land so appraised is bounded upon and by the said streets, but no part of the <em>locus in quo</em> in either count in the declaration is included within such bounds and description.</p>\n<p>The description of one of the lots so taken and appraised begins as follows:  "One other lot of land, with the appurtenances, containing one-half of an acre, bounded as follows," &amp;c., particularly describing the lot, but not including the highway, and one of the questions arising under the first point is whether, under the term "appurtenances," the soil and freehold of the street passed to the United States.  This term is not used in the description of either of the other lots.  The inquest of the jury, after particularly describing by metes and bounds, each lot, concludes in each case as follows:  "Which same tract of land, on our oaths, we appraise and value at _____," and the act of the Legislature of Massachusetts declares that such parts of the land so valued and paid for by the United States shall be forever vested in the United States, and shall and may be taken possession of and appropriated to the purposes aforesaid.  This inquest therefore shows that the jury appraised the land only included within the description, and the act only vests the title to such land as shall be appraised.  The streets were clearly not appraised, and so did not pass to the United States unless they passed as an incident under the term "appurtenances."</p>\n<p>If, from the use of this term, connected with and explained by the other parts of the inquest, it clearly appeared to have been the intention of the jury to include the streets, it might be considered a part of and explanatory of the description and be carrying into effect the intention of the jury.  But if no such conclusion can be drawn, the term must receive its legal and appropriate interpretation.  There is no ambiguity in the description of the lot, necessary to be explained, and it is difficult to conjecture what could have been the understanding of the draftsman by the use of the term.  It is not introduced in the description of any of the other lots.  It does, to be sure, appear that there was upon this lot several houses, and none upon any of the other lots, and it is not unlikely that it was intended to apply to the buildings upon the lot, but this was unnecessary, as they would pass </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 35 U. S. 54</a></p><p> with the land, although from the facts as disclosed in the case we cannot discover any appropriate application of the term, yet we cannot undertake to say that there was not any right or interest incident to this lot which would pass under the term "appurtenances."  But there is no ground to warrant a construction that it was used in reference to the soil and freehold of the street or anything to take it out of the strict, legal, and technical interpretation of the term.  This term, both in common parlance and in legal acceptation, is used to signify something appertaining to another thing as principal, and which passes as an incident to the principal thing.  Lord Coke says, Coke Lit. 121b, a thing corporeal cannot properly be appurtenant to a thing corporeal, nor a thing incorporeal to a thing incorporeal.  According to this rule, land cannot be appurtenant to land.</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Jackson v. Hathaway,</em> 15 Johns. 454, the court said it is impossible to protect the defendant on the ground that the adjoining road passed by the deed as an incident to the lands professedly granted.  A mere easement may, without express words, pass as an incident to the principal object of the grant, but it would be absurd to allow the fee of one piece of land not mentioned in the deed to pass as appurtenant to another distinct parcel which is expressly granted by precise and definite boundaries.  And in the case of <em>Leonard v. White,</em> 7 Mass. 6, it was decided that by the grant of a grist mill, with the appurtenances, the soil of a way, immemorially used for the purpose of access to the mill, did not pass, although it might be considered as a grant of the easement for the accommodation of the mill.  Cro.Eliz. 704.  Cro Char. 57.  3 Salk. 40.  The answer, therefore, to this branch of the question must be that the soil and freehold of the streets did not pass under and by virtue of the term appurtenances, nor is there anything in the description of lots Nos. 1 and 3 in the verdict of the jury, nor in the proceedings by which the land was taken by the United States, from which it can be inferred that the soil and freehold of the streets passed to the United States.  It has been shown by the notice already taken of the verdict and proceedings that they do not include the streets.  The same answer must therefore be given to this branch of the question.</p>\n<p>2. That part of the act of 30 October, 1781, under which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 35 U. S. 55</a></p><p> the second question arises, is as follows:</p>\n<p>"Section 1. That the said proceedings of the committee be and hereby are confirmed and all actions that shall be brought for recovering possession of any land lying within any of the streets, lanes, squares, &amp;c., laid out as aforesaid, or for damages sustained or occasioned thereby, shall be utterly and forever barred."</p>\n<p>The preamble to this act refers to the destruction of Charlestown by fire, and that a committee had been appointed by the town for regulating the streets, lanes, and squares in that part of the town which had been laid waste by the fire, and that the committee had proceeded to lay out the same, a plan of which had been deposited in the secretary\'s office.  This preamble states that the committee was appointed to regulate the streets, which might not perhaps, in strictness, authorize them to alter the streets, but the act, in several parts of it, evidently looks to and provides for cases where the streets were widened and altered.  This mode of laying out streets was not according to the general law of Massachusetts, and the object of the act was to legalize and confirm the proceedings of the committee, and to bar all actions to recover possession of any land so taken for streets, lanes, squares, &amp;c., or for damages sustained by anyone thereby.  This bar of all actions, was to protect and establish the doings of the committee in laying out the streets, but does not seem to look to any question relating to the soil and freehold of the streets, if the easement should at any time thereafter be discontinued.  This question is not stated with precision, and might perhaps admit of a more general view of the act of 1781, and open the inquiry whether the right of the plaintiffs to the soil and freehold of the streets was not taken away by it, but as the cause must go back for further proceedings, we do not think proper to enter into the more general consideration of this act or touch the question as to its effect upon the plaintiffs\' right to the soil and freehold of the streets.  But only decide that such right, if it exists, is not barred by the first section of the act.</p>\n<p>3. Upon the third point, the law in Massachusetts is well settled that where a mere easement is taken for a public highway, the soil and freehold remains in the owner of the land, encumbered only with the easement, and that upon the discontinuance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="56">Page 35 U. S. 56</a></p><p> of the highway, the soil and freehold revert to the owner of the land.  4 Mass. 427, 6 <em>id.</em> 454, 13 <em>id.</em> 259, 16 <em>id.</em> 33.</p>\n<p>4. The fourth question is too general, embracing the merits of the whole case, and does not present any single point or question, and it has been repeatedly ruled in this Court that the whole case cannot be brought here under the act of 1802 upon such a general question.  This act provides only for bringing up in this manner specific questions, upon which the judges in the circuit court may be opposed in opinion.</p>\n<p>Several questions growing out of the facts in this case have been suggested at the bar deserving consideration, but they are not stated in such specific points as is required by the settled course of the Court, and no opinion will, of course, be expressed upon them.</p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts and on the points and questions on which the judges of the said circuit court were opposed in opinion and which were certified to this Court for its opinion agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof it is the opinion of this Court, on the first question so certified as aforesaid, that the soil and freehold of Henley or Meetinghouse Street, and of Battery or Water Street, did not pass under and by virtue of the term "appurtenances" used by the jury in their verdict, nor was there anything in the description of lots one and three in the verdict of the jury that passed the soil and freehold of the said streets to the United States.</p>\n<p>2. On the second point, it is the opinion of this Court that the right of the plaintiffs to recover the soil and freehold of the said streets is not barred by the limitations contained in the statute of October 30, 1781, as set forth in the record.</p>\n<p>3. On the third point, it is the opinion of this Court that upon the discontinuance of a highway in Massachusetts by the public, the soil and freehold of such highway revert to the owner of the land taken for such highway.</p>\n<p>4. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 35 U. S. 57</a></p><p> On the fourth question, no specific point being stated, this Court can express no opinion, as it has been repeatedly ruled in this Court that the whole case cannot be brought here under the Act of Congress of 1802 upon such a general question.</p>\n<p><em>Whereupon it is ordered and adjudged by this Court, that it be so certified to the said circuit court.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
