See 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1252 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (codifying these procedures). Like the prior statute, the new provision vests the courts of appeals with the authority to consider petitions challenging "final orders" commanding the "removal" of aliens from the United States. \xc2\xa7 1252(a)(1).1 However, unlike the previous provisions, the new statute expressly precludes the courts of appeals from exercising "jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against any alien who is removable by reason of" a conviction for certain criminal offenses, including any aggravated felony. \xc2\xa7 1252(a)(2)(C).2</p><p>1 An additional difference between the old and the new statute with regard to petitions for review is one of nomenclature. In keeping with a statute-wide change in terminology, the new provision refers to orders of "removal" rather than orders of "deportation" or "exclusion." Compare 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1252(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V), with \xc2\xa7 n05a (1994 ed.).</p><p>2 The scope of this preclusion is not entirely clear. Though the text of the provision is quite broad, it is not without its ambiguities. Throughout this litigation, the Government has conceded that the courts of appeals have the power to hear petitions challenging the factual determinations thought to trigger the jurisdiction-stripping provision (such as whether an individual is an alien and whether he or she has been convicted of an "aggravated felony" within the meaning of the statute). See Brief for Respondent 22-23. In addition, the Government has also conceded that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to review "substantial constitutional challenges" raised by aliens who come within the strictures of \xc2\xa7 1252(a)(2)(C). See id., at 23-24. As the petitions in this case do not raise any of these types of issues, we need not address this point further. Nonetheless, it remains instructive that the Government acknowledges that background principles of statutory construction and constitutional concerns must be considered in determining the scope of IIRIRA\'s jurisdiction-stripping provisions.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="351">351</a></p><p>As petitioners in this case were convicted of "aggravated felonies" within the meaning of the relevant statutes,3 the plain language of \xc2\xa7 1252(a)(2)(C) fairly explicitly strips the courts of appeals of jurisdiction to hear their claims on petitions for direct review. Without much discussion, the Court of Appeals so held. 232 F. 3d, at 342-343.</p><p>Before this Court, petitioners primarily argue that constitutional considerations and background principles of statutory interpretation require that they be afforded some forum for the adjudication of the merits of their claims. They devote the bulk of their briefs to arguing that the Court of Appeals-motivated by these concerns-properly interpreted IIRIRA\'s jurisdiction-stripping provision not to preclude aliens such as petitioners from pursuing habeas relief pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2241. Brief for Petitioners 12-42, 44-49. In the alternative, they argue that we might construe the same provisions as stripping jurisdiction from the courts of appeals over only some matters, leaving in place their jurisdiction to directly review petitions raising claims previously cognizable under \xc2\xa7 2241. <i>Id., </i>at 42-44.</p><p>We agree with petitioners that leaving aliens without a forum for adjudicating claims such as those raised in this case would raise serious constitutional questions. We also agree with petitioners-and the Court of Appeals-that these concerns can best be alleviated by construing the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of that statute not to preclude aliens such as petitioners from pursuing habeas relief pursuant to \xc2\xa7 2241. See <i>St. </i>Cyr, ante, at 314.</p><p>Finding no support in the text or history of \xc2\xa7 1252 for concluding that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to hear petitions such as those brought in this case, but concluding</p><p>3 All three petitioners were convicted of controlled substance offenses for which they served between four months and four years in prison. Each concedes that his or her crime is an "aggravated felony" as defined in 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1l01(a)(43), which renders him or her removable pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="352">352</a></p><p>that Congress has not spoken with sufficient clarity to strip the district courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions raising identical claims, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in all particulars.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, dissenting.</p><p>For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in the companion case of <i>INS </i>v. <i>St. </i>Cyr, ante, p. 326, I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA\'S proposed disposition of the instant case.</p><p>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.</p><p>For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in the companion case of <i>INS </i>v. <i>St. </i>Cyr, ante, p. 326, I would vacate the judgment of the court below and remand with instructions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, with prejudice to petitioners Calcano- Martinez\'s and Madrid\'s refiling in the District Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
