At his capital murder trial, the court denied his motion to suppress these statements, and he was convicted and sentenced to death.  After his conviction became final on direct appeal, he filed a petition for federal habeas relief, which was dismissed by the District Court.

After his conviction became final on direct appeal, Butler collaterally attacked his conviction by way of a petition for federal habeas corpus.  Butler relied on our decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/675/case.html">Arizona v. Roberson,</a></span></em> 486 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="409">Page 494 U. S. 409</a></p><p> U.S. 675 (1988), decided after his conviction became final on direct appeal.  We have held, however, that a new decision generally is not applicable in cases on collateral review unless the decision was dictated by precedent existing at the time the petitioner\'s conviction became final.  <em>Penry v. Lynaugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html">492 U. S. 302</a></span>, (1989); <em>Teague v. Lane,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html">489 U. S. 288</a></span>, (1989).  We hold that our ruling in <em>Roberson</em> was not so dictated, and that Butler\'s claim is not within either of two narrow exceptions to the general rule.</p>\n<p>Pamela Lane, a clerk at a convenience store near Charleston, South Carolina, was last seen alive when she left work riding a moped late in the evening of July 17, 1980.  The next day, several fishermen discovered Lane\'s body near a bridge, and the following day, a local minister found Lane\'s moped submerged in a pond behind his church.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Butler was arrested six weeks later on an unrelated assault and battery charge and placed in the Charleston County Jail.  After invoking his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, Butler retained counsel who appeared with him at a bond hearing on August 31, 1980.  He was unable to make bond, however, and was returned to the county jail.  Butler\'s attorney would later contend in state collateral relief proceedings that, after the bond hearing, he had told the police officers not to question Butler further.  The officers testified that they remembered no such instruction.</p>\n<p>Early in the morning of September 1, 1980, Butler was taken from the jail to the Charleston County Police station.  He was then informed for the first time that he was a suspect in Lane\'s murder.  After receiving <em>Miranda</em> warnings, <em>see Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), Butler indicated that he understood his rights and signed two "waiver of rights" forms.  The police then interrogated Butler about the murder.  Butler did not request his attorney\'s presence at any time during the interrogation.</p>\n<p>Butler offered two explanations for Lane\'s death.  First, he claimed that a friend, one White, killed Lane and then sought Butler\'s help in disposing of the moped.  When his interrogators </p><p><a class="page-number" name="410">Page 494 U. S. 410</a></p><p> evidenced skepticism over this statement, Butler tried again.  He said that he had come upon Lane in his car and had motioned her over to the side of the road.  She then voluntarily accompanied him in a drive to a nearby wooded area where the two engaged in consensual sex.  Afterwards Lane threatened to accuse Butler of rape when she realized she would be late getting home.  Butler maintained that he panicked, shot Lane with a handgun, and dumped her body off a bridge.  In this version of the story, Butler asserted that White helped him dispose of the moped.  Butler later took the police to the locations of the various events culminating in Lane\'s death.</p>\n<p>The State indicted Butler and brought him to trial on a charge of first-degree murder.  The trial court denied Butler\'s motion to suppress the statements given to police, and the statements were introduced into evidence.  The jury found Butler guilty and, in a separate proceeding, sentenced him to death concluding that he committed the murder during the commission of a rape.  The Supreme Court of South Carolina upheld Butler\'s conviction on direct appeal, <em>State v. Butler,</em> 277 S.C. 452, 290 S.E.2d 1, and we denied certiorari.  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/932/case.html">459 U. S. 932</a></span> (1982).  Subsequently, Butler unsuccessfully petitioned for collateral relief in the State\'s courts, <em>see Butler v. State,</em> 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d 813 (1985), and we again denied certiorari.  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/1094/case.html">474 U. S. 1094</a></span> (1986).</p>\n<p>In May 1986, Butler filed this petition for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254.  As characterized by the District Court, one question raised in the petition was</p>\n<p>"whether police had the right to initiate questioning about the murder knowing petitioner had retained an attorney for the assault charge."</p>\n<p>App. 119.  The District Court dismissed the petition on respondents\' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, <em>see Butler v. Aiken,</em> 846 F.2d 255 (1988), </p><p><a class="page-number" name="411">Page 494 U. S. 411</a></p><p> Butler argued that <em>Edwards v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html">451 U. S. 477</a></span> (1981), requires the police, during continuous custody, to refrain from all further questioning once an accused invokes his right to counsel on any offense.  In support of his argument, Butler relied principally on <em>United States ex rel. Espinoza v. Fairman,</em> 813 F.2d 117 (CA7 1987).  The Court of Appeals rejected Butler\'s <em>Espinoza</em>-based contention, finding the Seventh Circuit\'s ruling an unpersuasive and "dramatic" extension of <em>Edwards.</em> <em>Butler,</em> 846 F.2d at 258.</p>\n<p>The court concluded that Butler\'s statements were preceded by appropriate warnings and a voluntary waiver of Fifth Amendment protections.  The statements, therefore, were not obtained in violation of his constitutional rights or <em>Edwards</em>\' prophylactic rule.  According to the court, a properly initiated interrogation on an entirely different charge does not intrude into an accused\'s previously invoked rights, but instead offers the accused an opportunity to weigh his rights intelligently in light of changed circumstances.  When, as occurred in this case, the accused then freely waives any constitutional right to counsel and provides voluntary statements of an incriminating nature, there is no justification for undermining the search for the truth by suppressing those statements.  <em>Butler,</em> 846 F.2d at 259.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Butler\'s petition, and approximately one month later, denied Butler\'s request for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p>On the same day the court denied Butler\'s rehearing petitions, we handed down our decision in <em>Roberson.</em>  We held in <em>Roberson</em> that the Fifth Amendment bars police-initiated interrogation following a suspect\'s request for counsel in the context of a separate investigation.  486 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/675/case.html#682">486 U. S. 682</a></span>.  On Butler\'s motion for reconsideration, the original Fourth Circuit panel considered Butler\'s new contention that <em>Roberson</em> requires suppression of his statements taken in the separate investigation of Lane\'s murder.  Although the panel conceded that the substance of its prior conclusion "was cast into </p><p><a class="page-number" name="412">Page 494 U. S. 412</a></p><p> immediate and serious doubt" by our subsequent decision in <em>Roberson, Butler v. Aiken,</em> 864 F.2d 24, 25 (CA4 1988), it nevertheless determined that Butler was not entitled to the retroactive benefit of <em>Roberson.</em>  According to the panel, the <em>Edwards-Roberson</em> limitations on police interrogation are only tangentially related to the truthfinding function.  864 F.2d at 25.  They are viewed most accurately as part of the prophylactic protection of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel created to be "guidelines" for the law enforcement profession.  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing <em>Roberson, supra,</em> 486 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/675/case.html#680">486 U. S. 680</a></span>-682).  The interrogation of Butler, while unquestionably contrary to present "guidelines," was conducted in strict accordance with established law at the time.  The panel, therefore, denied Butler\'s petition for rehearing.  A majority of the circuit judges denied, over a dissent, Butler\'s petition for a rehearing en banc.  We granted certiorari, 490 U.S. 1045, and now affirm.</p>\n<p>Last Term, in <em>Penry v. Lynaugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html">492 U.

In support of his position, Butler pointed out that the majority had said that <em>Roberson\'s</em> case was directly controlled by <em>Edwards</em>.  Brief for Petitioner 10.

Tr. of Oral Arg.  <em>passim.</em></p>\n<p>But the fact that a court says that its decision is within the "logical compass" of an earlier decision, or indeed that it is "controlled" by a prior decision, is not conclusive for purposes of deciding whether the current decision is a "new rule" under <em>Teague.</em>  Courts frequently view their decisions as being "controlled" or "governed" by prior opinions, even when aware of reasonable contrary conclusions reached by other courts.  In <em>Roberson,</em> for instance, the Court found <em>Edwards</em> controlling, but acknowledged a significant difference of opinion on the part of several lower courts that had considered the question previously.  486 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/675/case.html#679">486 U.

Roberson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/675/case.html">486 U. S. 675</a></span> (1988), qualifies as establishing a "new rule."  Long before <em>Roberson,</em> this Court recognized the presumptively coercive nature of custodial interrogations and held that an interrogation must cease if and when a suspect requests an attorney.</p>\n<p>"If the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests upon the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 494 U.

Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html">451 U.

We</p>\n<p>"reconfirm[ed] these views [expressed in <em>Miranda, supra</em>] and, to lend them substance, emphasize[d] that it is inconsistent with <em>Miranda</em> and its progeny for the authorities, at their instance, to reinterrogate an accused in custody if he has clearly asserted his right to counsel."</p>\n<p>451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html#485">451 U.

We carefully considered the circumstances under which a suspect, who has requested counsel during a custodial interrogation, may be deemed to have validly waived his right to counsel prior to the resumption of interrogation.  We concluded that</p>\n<p>"when an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html#484">451 U.

As a result, we established a bright-line rule:  a suspect who has</p>\n<p>"expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html#484">451 U.

S. 677</a></span>.  Noting that <em>Edwards</em> involved two interrogations concerning the same offenses, the State of Arizona sought an exception "for cases in which the police want to interrogate a suspect about an offense that is unrelated to the subject of their initial interrogation."  486 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/661/case.html#677">496 U.

S. 685</a></span>.  We explained </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 494 U. S. 420</a></p><p> that the rule articulated in <em>Edwards</em> reflected our concern that,</p>\n<p>"if a suspect believes that he is not capable of undergoing [custodial] questioning without advice of counsel, then it is presumed that any subsequent waiver that has come at the authorities\' behest, and not at the suspect\'s own instigation, is itself the product of the \'inherently compelling pressures,\' and not the purely voluntary choice of the suspect."</p>\n<p>486 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/675/case.html#681">486 U.

That <em>Roberson\'s</em> second interrogation concerned a different subject than his first in no way assuaged our concern that <em>Roberson\'s</em> initial request for counsel reflected an inability to deal with police questioning without legal advice.  Therefore <em>Edwards</em>\' application did not turn on the subject matter of the two interrogations.  486 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/675/case.html#681">486 U.

We likewise</p>\n<p>"attach[ed] no significance to the fact that the officer who conducted the second interrogation did not know that <em>[Roberson]</em> had made a request for counsel,"</p>\n<p>because "<em>Edwards</em> focuses on the state of mind of the suspect and not of the police."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/675/case.html#687">486 U.

In <em>Roberson,</em> we simply applied the legal principle established in <em>Miranda</em> and reconfirmed in <em>Edwards</em> to a set of facts that was not dissimilar in any salient way.  We did not articulate any new principles of Fifth Amendment jurisprudence that were not already established in 1983.</p>\n<p>Yet today, the Court classifies <em>Roberson</em> as a "new rule" <em>notwithstanding</em> the above, characterizing the "outcome in <em>Roberson</em> [as] susceptible to debate among reasonable minds."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#415">494 U. S. 415</a></span>.  For this conclusion, the majority appears to rely solely on the fact that the court below and several state courts had incorrectly predicted the outcome in <em>Roberson</em> by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="421">Page 494 U. S. 421</a></p><p> holding that the <em>Edwards</em> rule ought not apply here the second interrogation involves different subject matter.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But this reliance is perplexing.  The majority might mean to suggest that a particular result is reasonable so long as a certain number of courts reach the same result.  But this would be an odd criterion for "reasonableness."  Its application would be <em>ad hoc,</em> both because there appears to be no principled basis for choosing any particular number of courts whose agreement is required before the result is deemed "reasonable," and because the criterion ultimately rests on a bootstrap to the extent that the later courts reaching the result simply rely on the earlier courts\' having done the same.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the majority might mean that the lower court decisions foreshadowing the dissent\'s position in <em>Roberson,</em> though ultimately erroneous, were nevertheless "reasonable" according to some objective criterion of adjudication. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But the Court does not purport to identify any such criterion or explain its application in this case.  Instead, the Court announces in peremptory fashion that "[i]t would not have been an illogical or even a grudging application of <em>Edwards</em> to decide that it did not extend to the facts of <em>Roberson.</em>"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#415">494 U. S. 415</a></span>.  This characterization is mystifying, given our explanation in <em>Roberson</em> that the result was clearly dictated by <em>Edwards.</em> <em>See supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#419">494 U. S. 419</a></span>-420.</p>\n<p>The only conclusion discernible from the majority\'s discussion is that the majority would label "new" any rule of law favoring a state prisoner that can be distinguished from prior precedent on any conceivable basis, legal or factual. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 494 U. S. 422</a></p><p> converse of this conclusion is that, in the majority\'s view, adjudication according to "prevailing" law must consist solely of applying binding precedents to factual disputes that cannot be distinguished from prior cases in any imaginable way.  Because, after <em>Teague,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html">489 U. S. 288</a></span> (1989), a federal court may entertain a habeas petition on the merits only if the petitioner seeks application of "prevailing" law as so narrowly defined, the majority today limits federal courts\' habeas corpus function to reviewing state courts\' legal analysis under the equivalent of a "clearly erroneous" standard of review.  A federal court may no longer consider the merits of the petitioner\'s claim based on its best interpretation and application of the law prevailing at the time her conviction became final; rather, it must defer to the state court\'s decision rejecting the claim unless that decision is patently unreasonable. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s exceedingly broad definition of "new rule" -- and conversely its narrow definition of "prevailing" law -- betrays a vision of adjudication fundamentally at odds with any this Court has previously recognized.  According to Justice Harlan, whose retroactivity jurisprudence undergirds </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 494 U. S. 423</a></p><p> <em>Teague</em> and its progeny:</p>\n<p>"One need not be a rigid partisan of Blackstone to recognize that many, though not all, of this Court\'s constitutional decisions are grounded upon fundamental principles whose content does not change dramatically from year to year, but whose meanings are altered slowly and subtly as generation succeeds generation."</p>\n<p><em>Desist,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#263">394 U. S. 263</a></span> (Harlan, J., dissenting).  As every first-year law student learns, adjudication according to prevailing law means far more than obeying precedent by perfunctorily applying holdings in previous cases to virtually <em>identical</em> fact patterns.  Rather, such adjudication requires a judge to evaluate both the content of previously enunciated legal rules and the breadth of their application.  A judge must thereby discern whether the principles applied to specific fact patterns in prior cases fairly extend to govern <em>analogous</em> factual patterns.  In Justice Harlan\'s view, adjudication according to prevailing law demands that a court exhibit "conceptual faithfulness" to the principles underlying prior precedents, not just "decisional obedience" to precise holdings based upon their unique factual patterns.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#266">394 U. S. 266</a></span>, n. 5 (employing Justice Fortas\' terminology).  The inability of lower courts to predict significant reformulations by this Court of the principles underlying prior precedents does not excuse them from the obligation to draw reasoned conclusions from principles that are well established at the time of their decisions.</p>\n<p>The majority suggests obliquely that adoption of a "<em>new rule\' principle [that] validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#414">494 U. S. 414</a></span> -- which in turn means that adjudication according to "prevailing" law requires only strict "decisional obedience" to existing precedents -- would still serve the "<em>deterrence</em> function" animating federal habeas review.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in original).  But this claim begs a central question:  deterrence of what?  Under the definition of "prevailing" law embraced today, federal courts may not entertain habeas petitions challenging state court rejections of constitutional claims unless those </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 494 U. S. 424</a></em></p><p><em> state decisions are clearly erroneous.  So at best, the threat of habeas review will deter state courts only from completely indefensible rejections of federal claims.  State courts essentially are told today that, save for outright "illogical" defiance of a binding precedent precisely on point, their interpretations of federal constitutional guarantees -- no matter how cramped and unfaithful to the principles underlying existing precedent -- will no longer be subject to oversight through the federal habeas system.  State prosecutors surely will offer every conceivable basis in each case for distinguishing our prior precedents, and state courts will be free to "`disregard the plain purport of our decisions and to adopt a let\'s-wait-until-it\'s-decided [by the Supreme Court] approach.\'"  <em>United States v.

And, as explained above, "correct" adjudication has always been thought to require courts to exhibit "conceptual faithfulness" to the principles underlying our precedents and thereby to anticipate reasonably foreseeable applications of those principles.  <em>See, e.g., Johnson, supra,</em> 457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#549">457 U.

Justice Harlan would have held state courts responsible for "appl[ying] a well-established constitutional principle to govern a case which is closely analogous to those which have been previously considered in the prior case law."  <em>Desist, supra,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#263">394 U.

In the context of this case, Justice Harlan would not have held the rule in <em>Roberson</em> to be "new" today unless he could "say with . . . <em>assurance</em> that this Court would have ruled differently" (<em>i.e.,</em> in the State\'s favor) at the time Butler\'s conviction became final.  394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#264">394 U.
