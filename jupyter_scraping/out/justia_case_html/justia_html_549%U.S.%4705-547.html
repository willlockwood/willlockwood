S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B), but does not define \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Title 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) defines \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x9d (CSA).  Petitioner Lopez, a legal permanent resident alien, pleaded guilty to South Dakota charges of aiding and abetting another person\xe2\x80\x99s possession of cocaine, which state law treated as the equivalent of possessing the drug, a state felony.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began removal proceedings on the ground, <em>inter alia</em>, that Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s state conviction was for an aggravated felony.  The Immigration Judge ultimately ruled that despite the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s crime as a misdemeanor, see 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a), it was an aggravated felony under the INA owing to its being a felony under state law.  The judge ordered Lopez removed in light of 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3), which provides that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to cancel the removal of a person otherwise deportable does not reach a convict of an aggravated felony.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed the BIA.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Conduct made a felony under state law but a misdemeanor under the CSA is not a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x9d for INA purposes.  A state offense comes within the quoted phrase only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under the CSA.  The Government argues that possession\xe2\x80\x99s felonious character as a state crime is enough to turn it into an aggravated felony under the INA because the CSA punishes possession, albeit as a misdemeanor, while \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) requires only that the offense be punishable, not that it be punishable as a federal felony, so that a prior conviction in state court will satisfy the felony element because the State treats possession that way.  This argument is incoherent with any commonsense conception of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d the term ultimately being defined.  Because the statutes in play do not define \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court looks to the term\xe2\x80\x99s everyday meaning, <em>FDIC</em> v. <em>Meyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/471/index.html">510 U. S. 471</a>, 476, which ordinarily connotes some sort of commercial dealing.  Commerce, however, was no part of Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s South Dakota offense of helping someone else to possess, and certainly it is no element of simple possession, with which the State equates that crime.  Nor is the anomaly of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading limited to South Dakota cases: while federal law typically treats trafficking offenses as felonies and nontrafficking offenses as misdemeanors, several States deviate significantly from this pattern.  Reading \xc2\xa7924(c) the Government\xe2\x80\x99s way, then, would often turn simple possession into trafficking, just what the English language counsels not to expect, and that result makes the Court very wary of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Although the Government might still be right, there would have to be some indication that Congress meant to define an aggravated felony of illicit trafficking in an unorthodox and unexpected way.  There are good reasons to think it was doing no such thing here.  First, an offense that necessarily counts as \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d under the INA is a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(c), <em>i.e.,</em> a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).  To determine what felonies might qualify, the Court naturally looks to the definitions of crimes punishable as felonies under the CSA.  If Congress had meant the Court to look to state law, it would have found a much less misleading way to make its point.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument to the contrary contravenes normal ways of speaking and writing, which demonstrate that \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the \xe2\x80\xa6 Act\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable as such under the Act\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfelony as defined by the Act,\xe2\x80\x9d and does not refer to state felonies, so long as they would be punishable at all under the CSA.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument is not supported by the INA\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9capplies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).  Rather than wrenching the expectations raised by normal English usage, this provision has two perfectly straightforward jobs to do.  First, it provides that a generic description of \xe2\x80\x9can offense \xe2\x80\xa6 in this paragraph,\xe2\x80\x9d one not specifically couched as a state offense or a federal one, covers either one, and, second, it confirms that a state offense whose elements include the elements of a felony punishable under the CSA is an aggravated felony.  Thus, if Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s state crime actually fell within the general term \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d the state felony conviction would count as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of the existence of a federal felony counterpart; and a state offense of possessing more than five grams of cocaine base is an aggravated felony because it is a felony under the CSA, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a).  Nothing in the provision in question suggests that Congress changed the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA]\xe2\x80\x9d when it took that phrase from Title 18 of the U. S. Code and incorporated it into Title 8\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yet the Government admits that it has never begun a prosecution under 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) where the underlying \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d was a state felony but a federal misdemeanor.  This telling failure in the very context in which the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA]\xe2\x80\x9d appears in the Code belies the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that its interpretation is the more natural one.  Finally, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading would render the law of alien removal, see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3), and the law of sentencing for illegal entry into the country, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72L1.2, dependent on varying state criminal classifications even when Congress has apparently pegged the immigration statutes to the classifications Congress itself chose.  Congress would not have incorporated its own statutory scheme of felonies and misdemeanors if it meant courts to ignore it whenever a State chose to punish a given act more heavily.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  The general phrase \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d is left undefined, but \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) of Title 18 identifies the subcategory by defining \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x9d or under either of two other federal statutes having no bearing on this case.  Following the listing, \xc2\xa7101(a)43 of the INA provides in its penultimate sentence that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term [aggravated felony] applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law\xe2\x80\x9d or, in certain circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U.

Under the immigration statutes, for example, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to cancel the removal of a person otherwise deportable does not reach a convict of an aggravated felony.  \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  Nor is an aggravated felon eligible for asylum.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71158(b)(2)(A)(ii), 1158(b)(2)(B)(i).  And under the sentencing law, the Federal Guidelines attach special significance to the \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d designation: a conviction of unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States receives an eight-level increase for a prior aggravated felony conviction, but only four levels for \xe2\x80\x9cany other felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72L1.2 (Nov. 2005) (hereinafter USSG); <em>id.</em>, comment., n.\xc2\xa03 (adopting INA definition of aggravated felony).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although petitioner Jose Antonio Lopez entered the United States illegally in 1986, in 1990 he became a legal permanent resident.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i), and was also for an aggravated felony, see \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  Lopez conceded the controlled substance violation but contested the aggravated felony determination, which would disqualify him from discretionary cancellation of removal.  See \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  At first, the Immigration Judge agreed with Lopez that his state offense was not an aggravated felony because the conduct it proscribed was no felony under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).  But after the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) switched its position on the issue, the same judge ruled that Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s drug crime was an aggravated felony after all, owing to its being a felony under state law.  See <em>Matter of Yanez-Garcia</em>, 23 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 390 (2002) (announcing that BIA decisions would conform to the applicable Circuit law); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Briones-Mata</em>, 116 F.\xc2\xa03d 308 (CA8 1997) <em>(per curiam)</em> (holding state felony possession offenses are aggravated felonies).  That left Lopez ineligible for cancellation of removal, and the judge ordered him removed.

We now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The INA makes Lopez guilty of an aggravated felony if he has been convicted of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance \xe2\x80\xa6 including,\xe2\x80\x9d but not limited to, \xe2\x80\x9ca drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18).\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s state conviction was for helping someone else possess cocaine in South Dakota, which state law treated as the equivalent of possessing the drug, S.\xc2\xa0D. Codified Laws \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933, a state felony, \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x9342\xe2\x80\x935.  Mere possession is not, however, a felony under the federal CSA, see 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a), although possessing more than what one person would have for himself will support conviction for the federal felony of possession with intent to distribute, see \xc2\xa7841 (2000 ed. and Supp. III); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Kates</em>, 174 F.\xc2\xa03d 580, 582 (CA5 1999) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cIntent to distribute may be inferred from the possession of a quantity of drugs too large to be used by the defendant alone\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite this federal misdemeanor treatment, the Government argues that possession\xe2\x80\x99s felonious character as a state crime can turn it into an aggravated felony under the INA.  There, it says, illicit trafficking includes a drug trafficking crime as defined in federal Title 18.  Title 18 defines \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 801 et seq.),\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(c)(2), and the CSA punishes possession, albeit as a misdemeanor, see \xc2\xa7405(a), 102 Stat. 4384, as renumbered and amended by \xc2\xa71002(g), 104 Stat. 4828, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a).  That is enough, says the Government, because \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) requires only that the offense be punishable, not that it be punishable as a federal felony.  Hence, a prior conviction in state court will satisfy the felony element because the State treats possession that way.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are a few things wrong with this argument, the first being its incoherence with any commonsense conception of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d the term ultimately being defined.  The everyday understanding of \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking\xe2\x80\x9d should count for a lot here, for the statutes in play do not define the term, and so remit us to regular usage to see what Congress probably meant.  <em>FDIC</em> v. <em>Meyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/471/index.html">510 U. S. 471</a>, 476 (1994).  And ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking\xe2\x80\x9d means some sort of commercial dealing.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1534 (8th ed. 2004) (defining to \xe2\x80\x9ctraffic\xe2\x80\x9d as to \xe2\x80\x9ctrade or deal in (goods, esp. illicit drugs or other contraband)\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Urena-Ramirez</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 341 F.\xc2\xa03d 51, 57 (CA1 2003) (similar definition); <em>State</em> v. <em>Ezell</em>, 321 S.\xc2\xa0C. 421, 425, 468 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 679, 681 (App. 1996) (same).  Commerce, however, was no part of Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s South Dakota offense of helping someone else to possess, and certainly it is no element of simple possession, with which the State equates that crime.  Nor is the anomaly of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading limited to South Dakota cases: while federal law typically treats trafficking offenses as felonies and nontrafficking offenses as misdemeanors, several States deviate significantly from this pattern.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reading \xc2\xa7924(c) the Government\xe2\x80\x99s way, then, would often turn simple possession into trafficking, just what the English language tells us not to expect, and that result makes us very wary of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Cf. <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 11 (2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e cannot forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x98crime of violence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Which is not to deny that the Government might still be right; Humpty Dumpty used a word to mean \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98just what [he chose] it to mean\xe2\x80\x94neither more nor less,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and legislatures, too, are free to be unorthodox.  Congress can define an aggravated felony of illicit trafficking in an unexpected way.  But Congress would need to tell us so, and there are good reasons to think it was doing no such thing here.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, an offense that necessarily counts as \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d under the INA is a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(c), that is, a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).  And if we want to know what felonies might qualify, the place to go is to the definitions of crimes punishable as felonies under the Act; where else would one naturally look?  Although the Government would have us look to state law, we suspect that if Congress had meant us to do that it would have found a much less misleading way to make its point.  Indeed, other parts of \xc2\xa7924 expressly refer to guilt under state law, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7924(g)(3), (k)(2), and the implication confirms that the reference solely to a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA]\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) is to a crime punishable as a felony under the federal Act.

S. 16</a>, 23 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d (alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted)).  Unless a state offense is punishable as a federal felony it does not count.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government stresses that the text does not read \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable as a felony,\xe2\x80\x9d and that by saying simply \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d Congress left the door open to counting state felonies, so long as they would be punishable at all under the CSA.  But we do not normally speak or write the Government\xe2\x80\x99s way.  We do not use a phrase like \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA]\xe2\x80\x9d when we mean to signal or allow a break between the noun \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d and the contiguous modifier \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable under the [CSA],\xe2\x80\x9d let alone a break that would let us read the phrase as if it said \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the CSA whether or not as a felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Regular usage points in the other direction, and when we read \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the \xe2\x80\xa6 Act,\xe2\x80\x9d we instinctively understand \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable as such under the Act\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfelony as defined by the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Without some further explanation, using the phrase to cover even a misdemeanor punishable under the Act would be so much trickery, violating \xe2\x80\x9cthe cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cline</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/581/index.html">540 U.

That is why our interpretive regime reads whole sections of a statute together to fix on the meaning of any one of them, and the last thing this approach would do is divorce a noun from the modifier next to it without some extraordinary reason.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government thinks it has a good enough reason for doing just that, in the INA provision already mentioned, that the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9capplies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).  But before this provision is given the Government\xe2\x80\x99s expansive treatment, it makes sense to ask whether it would have some use short of wrenching the expectations raised by normal English usage, and in fact it has two perfectly straightforward jobs to do: it provides that a generic description of \xe2\x80\x9can offense \xe2\x80\xa6 in this paragraph,\xe2\x80\x9d one not specifically couched as a state offense or a federal one, covers either one, and it confirms that a state offense whose elements include the elements of a felony punishable under the CSA is an aggravated felony.  Thus, if Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s state crime actually fell within the general term \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d the state felony conviction would count as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of the existence of a federal felony counterpart; and a state offense of possessing more than five grams of cocaine base is an aggravated felony because it is a felony under the CSA, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the penultimate sentence of 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) is misplaced for a second reason.  The Government tries to justify its unusual reading of a defined term in the criminal code on the basis of a single sentence in the INA.  But nothing in the penultimate sentence of \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) suggests that Congress changed the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA]\xe2\x80\x9d when it took that phrase from Title 18 and incorporated it into Title 8\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yet the Government admits it has never begun a prosecution under 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) where the underlying \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d was a state felony but a federal misdemeanor.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\xe2\x80\x9336.  This is telling: the failure of even a single eager Assistant United States Attorney to act on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the [CSA]\xe2\x80\x9d in the very context in which that phrase appears in the United States Code belies the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that its interpretation is the more natural one.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading would render the law of alien removal, see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3), and the law of sentencing for illegal entry into the country, see USSG \xc2\xa72L1.2, dependent on varying state criminal classifications even when Congress has apparently pegged the immigration statutes to the classifications Congress itself chose.  It may not be all that remarkable that federal consequences of state crimes will vary according to state severity classification when Congress describes an aggravated felony in generic terms, without express reference to the definition of a crime in a federal statute (as in the case of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance\xe2\x80\x9d).  But it would have been passing strange for Congress to intend any such result when a state criminal classification is at odds with a federal provision that the INA expressly provides as a specific example of an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d (like the \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d).  We cannot imagine that Congress took the trouble to incorporate its own statutory scheme of felonies and misdemeanors if it meant courts to ignore it whenever a State chose to punish a given act more heavily.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two examples show the untoward consequences of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  Consider simple possession of marijuana.  Not only is it a misdemeanor under the CSA, see 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a), but the INA expressly excludes \xe2\x80\x9ca single offense involving possession for one\xe2\x80\x99s own use of 30 grams or less\xe2\x80\x9d from the controlled substance violations that are grounds for deportation, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)\n(2)(B)(i).  Yet by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s lights, if a State makes it a felony to possess a gram of marijuana the congressional judgment is supplanted, and a state convict is subject to mandatory deportation because the alien is ineligible for cancellation of removal.  See \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  There is no hint in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text that Congress was courting any such state-by-state disparity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The situation in reverse flouts probability just as much.  Possessing more than five grams of cocaine base is a felony under federal law.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a).  If a State drew the misdemeanor-felony line at six grams plus, a person convicted in state court of possessing six grams would not be guilty of an aggravated felony on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, which makes the law of the convicting jurisdiction dispositive.  See Brief for Respondent 48.  Again, it is just not plausible that Congress meant to authorize a State to overrule its judgment about the consequences of federal offenses to which its immigration law expressly refers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0True, the argument is not all one-sided.  The Government points out that some States graduate offenses of drug possession from misdemeanor to felony depending on quantity, whereas Congress generally treats possession alone as a misdemeanor whatever the amount (but leaves it open to charge the felony of possession with intent to distribute when the amount is large).  Thus, an alien convicted by a State of possessing large quantities of drugs would escape the aggravated felony designation simply for want of a federal felony defined as possessing a substantial amount.  This is so, but we do not weigh it as heavily as the anomalies just mentioned on the other side.  After all, Congress knows that any resort to state law will implicate some disuniformity in state misdemeanor-felony classifications, but that is no reason to think Congress meant to allow the States to supplant its own classifications when it specifically constructed its immigration law to turn on them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we hold that a state offense constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x9d only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.

The Court holds that Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s conviction does not constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d because federal law would classify Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s possession offense as a misdemeanor.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  As relevant to this case, the INA defines an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance \xe2\x80\xa6 including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  And \xe2\x80\x9cthe term \xe2\x80\x98drug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x99 means any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s state felony offense qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).  A plain reading of this definition identifies two elements: First, the offense must be a felony; second, the offense must be capable of punishment under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).  No one disputes that South Dakota punishes Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s crime as a felony.  See S.\xc2\xa0D. Codified Laws \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x9342\xe2\x80\x935 (1988).  Likewise, no one disputes that the offense was capable of punishment under the CSA.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a).  Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s possession offense therefore satisfies both elements, and the inquiry should end there.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, takes the inquiry further by reasoning that only <em>federal</em> felonies qualify as drug trafficking crimes.  According to the Court, the definition of drug trafficking crime contains an implied limitation: \xe2\x80\x9cany felony punishable [as a felony] under the\xe2\x80\x9d CSA.  The text does not support this interpretation.  Most obviously, the language \xe2\x80\x9cas a felony\xe2\x80\x9d appears nowhere in \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).  Without doubt, Congress could have written the definition with this limitation, but it did not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s suggested addition conflicts with the clear meaning of \xc2\xa7924(c)(2), which extends to both state and federal felonies.  Specifically, the definition broadly encompasses \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> felony\xe2\x80\x9d capable of being punished under the CSA.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cRead naturally, the word \xe2\x80\x98any\xe2\x80\x99 has an expansive meaning \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, 5 (1997) (plurality opinion); see also <em>Small</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/385/index.html">544 U. S. 385</a>, 397 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe broad phrase \xe2\x80\x98any court\xe2\x80\x99 unambiguously includes all judicial bodies with jurisdiction to impose the requisite conviction\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  The term \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d takes its meaning from Title 18, which classifies crimes as felonies when punishable by death or greater than one year of imprisonment.  \xc2\xa73559(a).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny felony\xe2\x80\x9d therefore includes both federal and state felonies: The classification depends only on the authorized term of imprisonment.  Accordingly, by the plain terms of \xc2\xa7924(c)(2), conduct prohibited by the CSA may qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d if under either federal law or state law the conduct is punishable by more than one year of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation finds support in other provisions in which Congress placed limits on the types of drug trafficking crimes eligible for consideration.  In particular, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) proscribes the use or possession of a firearm \xe2\x80\x9cduring and in relation to any \xe2\x80\xa6 drug trafficking crime \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States</em>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added); see also 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A.<em> </em>\xc2\xa7924(c)(5) (Supp. 2006) (using identical language in proscribing the use or possession of \xe2\x80\x9carmor piercing ammunition\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court has previously interpreted this language to limit \xe2\x80\x9cany \xe2\x80\xa6 drug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d to federal crimes.  <em>Gonzales</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 5.  This language, therefore, acts as a jurisdictional limitation, carving out the subset of <em>federal </em>drug trafficking crimes and making only those eligible for use in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) and 924(c)(5).  No similar federal-crime limitation appears in \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).  Interpreting the term \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime,\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in \xc2\xa7924(c)(2), to reach only federal felonies would render superfluous the federal-crime limitations in these other provisions.  See <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 174 (2001) (plurality opinion) (counseling against interpretations that result in surplus language).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation also finds support in the INA, which lists \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d and its subset of \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime[s]\xe2\x80\x9d as aggravated felonies.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B). The INA considers these offenses aggravated felonies \xe2\x80\x9cwhether in violation of Federal or State law\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) (penultimate sentence).  Thus, by incorporating \xc2\xa7924(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime,\xe2\x80\x9d the INA supports and confirms the conclusion that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d applies to both federal and state felonies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the INA isolates the relevant inquiry to the prosecuting jurisdiction.  Section\xc2\xa01227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of Title 8 makes an alien eligible for deportation only upon a <em>conviction</em> for an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  The conviction requirement suggests that the jurisdiction issuing the conviction determines whether the offense is a felony.  This result makes sense.  When faced with an actual conviction, it would be unusual to ask, hypothetically, whether that conviction would have been a felony in a different jurisdiction.  Furthermore, that hypothetical inquiry could cause significant inconsistencies.  For instance, where a State convicts an alien of a misdemeanor drug crime, but federal law classifies the crime as a felony, the misdemeanor conviction would constitute an aggravated felony.  This anomaly does not arise when relying on the prosecuting jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s classification of the crime.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach is unpersuasive.  At the outset of its analysis, the Court avers that it must look to the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe statutes in play do not define the term.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  That statement is incorrect.  Section 1101(a)(43)(B) of Title 8 clearly defines \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance,\xe2\x80\x9d at least in part, as \xe2\x80\x9ca drug trafficking crime (<em>as defined in section 924(c) of title 18</em>).\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Therefore, whatever else \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d might mean, it must include anything defined as a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).  Rather than grappling with this definition of the relevant term, the Court instead sets up a conflicting strawman definition.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority states that the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d involves \xe2\x80\x9csome sort of commercial dealing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  Because mere possession does not constitute commercial dealing, the Court concludes that Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s possession offense cannot qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d offense\xe2\x80\x94or, by implication, a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yet even the Court admits that the term \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d includes federal drug felonies, several of which are mere possession offenses.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a) (possession of more than five grams of cocaine base, possession of flunitrazepam, and repeat possession offenses).  If the Court recognizes, in light of \xc2\xa7924(c)(2), some mere possession offenses under the umbrella of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d it cannot reject Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s conviction out of hand.  Yet the Court downplays these \xe2\x80\x9cfew exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d in two footnotes, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cthis coerced inclusion of a few possession offenses\xe2\x80\x9d gives no reason to \xe2\x80\x9coverride [the] ordinary meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, nn.\xc2\xa04 and 6.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The inconsistency deserves more than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s passing reference.  By encompassing repeat possession offenses, the term \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d includes far more than \xe2\x80\x9ca few\xe2\x80\x9d offenses outside of its ordinary meaning.  It must include <em>every</em> type of possession offense under the CSA, so long as the offender has had a previous possession offense.  If defining \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d to include the entire range of unlawful possession does not provide a \xe2\x80\x9cclear statutory command to override ordinary meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d I do not know what would.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, gives only fleeting consideration to the text of \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) itself.  After referencing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under\xe2\x80\x9d the CSA, the Court asks \xe2\x80\x9cwhere else would one naturally look\xe2\x80\x9d other than the CSA to determine whether a felony qualifies as a drug trafficking crime.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  In response to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rhetorical question, I suggest that one might naturally look to the conviction itself to determine whether it is a felony.  When presented with an actual conviction, one would not expect to look to a hypothetical prosecution to determine whether an offender has committed a felony.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Continuing to avoid the text of \xc2\xa7924(c)(2), the Court instead focuses on what the statute does not say.  It concludes that Congress could have expressly referenced state law as in \xc2\xa7924(g)(3) and (k)(2).  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  The response, of course, is that Congress could just as well have defined a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany felony punishable <em>as a felony</em> under the CSA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rejoining, the Court resorts to an \xe2\x80\x9cinstinctiv[e] understand[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d that the statutory definition actually means \xe2\x80\x9cfelony as defined by the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Instinct notwithstanding, we must interpret what Congress actually wrote, not what it could have written.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinstinct\xe2\x80\x9d to interpret \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) to mean \xe2\x80\x9cfelony as defined by\xe2\x80\x9d the CSA creates an unnecessary ambiguity in the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony.\xe2\x80\x9d  The CSA defines \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7802(13).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, that definition seemingly should apply.  The Court concludes otherwise but never resolves the ambiguity it creates: It instead explains that \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d is defined by the CSA as something other than the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa07.  That explanation is, at best, unsatisfying.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After gliding past the statutory text, the Court expresses concern over the fact that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation allows federal immigration law to turn on varying state criminal classifications.  Congress apparently did not share this concern because some definitions of \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d explicitly turn on the State\xe2\x80\x99s authorized term of imprisonment, not a uniform federal classification.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(F), (G), (J), (P)\xe2\x80\x93(T).  Even the Court finds this variance \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\xa6 all that remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s real concern therefore has little to do with variations in state law.  Rather, it worries that \xe2\x80\x9ca state criminal classification [may be] at odds with a federal provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But, obviously, if a state offense does not qualify under the definitions in \xc2\xa71101(a)(43), then the offense cannot be an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  As shown in Part I, though, nothing about Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s offense conflicts with the plain language of \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) as incorporated into \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  He was convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony,\xe2\x80\x9d and his offense was \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable under the\xe2\x80\x9d CSA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also notes apparent anomalies in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  It asserts that, under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, a state felony conviction for simple possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana could be an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d even though the INA expressly excludes such an offense as grounds for deportation under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i).  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern has little basis in reality.  Only one State authorizes more than one year of imprisonment for possession of over 20 grams.  See Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7893.13(6)(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b), 775.082(3)(a)(3) (2006).  A few others classify possession of one ounce (or 28.3 grams) as a felony.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Nev. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7453.336(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2) (2004), (4), 193.130 (2003).  The mere possibility that a case could fall into this small gap and lead to removal provides no ground for the Court to depart from the plain meaning of \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, it is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation that will have a significant effect on removal proceedings involving state possession offenses.  Federal law treats possession of large quantities of controlled substances as felonious possession with intent to distribute.  States frequently treat the same conduct as simple possession offenses, which would escape classification as aggravated felonies under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Thus, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation will result in a large disparity between the treatment of federal and state convictions for possession of large amounts of drugs.  And it is difficult to see why Congress would \xe2\x80\x9cauthorize a State to overrule its judgment\xe2\x80\x9d about possession of large quantities of drugs any more than it would about other possession offenses.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court admits that its reading will subject an alien defendant convicted of a state misdemeanor to deportation if his conduct was punishable as a felony under the CSA.  Accordingly, even if never convicted of an actual felony, an alien defendant becomes eligible for deportation based on a hypothetical federal prosecution.  It is at least anomalous, if not inconsistent, that an actual misdemeanor may be considered an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because a plain reading of the statute would avoid the ambiguities and anomalies created by today\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion, I respectfully dissent. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority mistakenly contends that my interpretation also renders this language superfluous.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 n.\xc2\xa09.  As I have stated, the plain meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d includes two categories of felonies\xe2\x80\x94state and federal.  For the limiting language in \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) to have meaning, it must exclude one of those categories.  As a state felony, Lopez\xe2\x80\x99s possession offense does not fall within the category of federal drug trafficking crimes.  Consequently, it is not eligible for use under \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In its discussion of whether possession may constitute \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court takes its own trip \xe2\x80\x9cthrough the looking glass.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante,</em> at 6.  \xe2\x80\x9cCommerce,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the Court, \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly \xe2\x80\xa6 is no element of simple possession \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  Not long ago, the Court found the opposite to be true when interpreting the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power under the Commerce Clause.  See <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Raich</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/1/index.html">545 U. S. 1</a>, 22 (2005) (plurality opinion) (concluding that Congress may regulate the mere possession of marijuana as affecting \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d).  In <em>Raich</em>, the Court fell into the very trap it purports to identify today by \xe2\x80\x9cturn[ing] simple possession into [commerce], just what the English language tells us not to expect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6; see also <em>Raich, supra,</em> at 57\xe2\x80\x9358 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s broadening of the Commerce Clause stands in tension with its present narrow interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking,\xe2\x80\x9d which 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B) explicitly alters to include at least some possession offenses.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Several Courts of Appeals looked to this definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d when construing the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, 316 F.\xc2\xa03d 506, 512 (CA4 2003).  Although the Government would clearly prevail under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7802(13), it has conceded that this definition does not apply.  This concession makes good sense: The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d resides in Title 18, and it is therefore most natural to construe \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d as used in that title.  See, n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra</em>.  As discussed above, that definition as well requires that a crime be considered a felony if the State defines it as a felony.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n</font></font></font></div>'
