The instant cases form a sequel to that decision.  In No. 81-2188, the United States and various Indian Tribes brought actions in Federal District Court, seeking an adjudication of rights in certain streams in Montana.  Subsequently, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation filed a petition in state court to adjudicate water rights in the same streams.  Still later, the United States brought additional actions in Federal District Court, seeking to adjudicate its rights and the rights of various Indian Tribes in other Montana streams, and these rights also became involved in state proceedings.  Motions to dismiss the federal actions were granted, the District Court relying in part on <em>Colorado River.</em>  On consolidated appeals, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Montana might lack jurisdiction to adjudicate claims in state court because the Enabling Act admitting Montana to the Union and the provision of the Montana Constitution promulgated in response to that Act reserved "absolute jurisdiction and control" over Indian lands in Congress; that the State, however, might have acquired such jurisdiction under Pub.L. 280, which allowed a State to acquire certain jurisdiction over Indian affairs and to amend its constitution to remove any impediment to such jurisdiction in a constitutional or statutory declaimer; and that, even if it were found that Montana </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 463 U.

In No. 81-2147, various water rights claimants in Arizona filed petitions in state court to adjudicate rights in a number of river systems, and the United States was joined in each case both in its independent capacity and as trustee for various Indian Tribes.  Thereafter, some of these Indian Tribes filed suits in Federal District Court, seeking, <em>inter alia,</em> federal determinations of their water rights.  The District Court, relying on <em>Colorado River,</em> dismissed most of the actions, while staying one of them pending completion of the state proceedings.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Enabling Act under which Arizona was admitted to statehood and a provision of the Arizona Constitution, both of which were similar to the Montana Enabling Act and Constitution, disabled Arizona from adjudicating Indian water claims.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. The federal courts had jurisdiction to hear the suits brought both by the United States and the Indian Tribes, and a dismissal or stay would have been improper if there was no jurisdiction in the concurrent state actions.

That case held that (1) the McCarran Amendment, 66 Stat. 560, 43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 666, which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 463 U.

The questions in these cases are parallel:  (1) What is the effect of the McCarran Amendment in those States which, unlike Colorado, were admitted to the Union subject to federal legislation that reserved "absolute jurisdiction and control" over Indian lands in the Congress of the United States? (2) If the courts of such States do have jurisdiction to adjudicate Indian water rights, should concurrent federal suits brought by Indian tribes, rather than by the United States, and raising only Indian claims, also be subject to dismissal under the doctrine of <em>Colorado River</em>?</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>Colorado River</em> arose out of a suit brought by the Federal Government in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado seeking a declaration of its rights, and the rights of a number of Indian Tribes, to waters in certain rivers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 463 U. S. 550</a></p><p> and their tributaries located in one of the drainage basins of the State of Colorado.  In the suit, the Government asserted reserved rights, governed by federal law, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] as well as rights based on state law. Shortly after the federal suit was commenced, the United States was joined, pursuant to the McCarran Amendment, as a party in the ongoing state court comprehensive water adjudication being conducted for the same drainage basin.  The Federal District Court, on motion of certain of the defendants and intervenors, dismissed the federal suit, stating that the doctrine of abstention required deference to the state proceedings.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, and we in turn reversed the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>We began our analysis in <em>Colorado River</em> by conceding that the District Court had jurisdiction over the federal suit under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1345, the general provision conferring district court jurisdiction over most civil actions brought by the Federal Government.  We then examined whether the federal suit was nevertheless properly dismissed in view of the concurrent state court proceedings.  This part of the analysis began by considering</p>\n<p>"whether the McCarran Amendment provided consent to determine federal reserved rights held on behalf of Indians in state court,"</p>\n<p>424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#809">424 U. S. 809</a></span>, since,</p>\n<p>"given the claims for Indian water rights in [the federal suit], dismissal clearly would have been inappropriate if the state court had no jurisdiction to decide those claims."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  We concluded:</p>\n<p>"Not only the Amendment\'s language, but also its underlying policy, dictates a construction including Indian rights in its provisions. [<em>United States v. District Court for Eagle County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/520/case.html">401 U. S. 520</a></span> (1971),] rejected the conclusion that federal reserved rights in general were not reached by the Amendment for the reason that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 463 U.

S. 810</a></span>.  In sum, considering the important federal interest in allowing all water rights on a river system to be adjudicated in a single comprehensive state proceeding, and "bearing in mind the ubiquitous nature of Indian water rights in the Southwest," it was clear to us "that a construction of the Amendment excluding those rights from its coverage would enervate the Amendment\'s objective."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#811">424 U. S. 811</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We buttressed this conclusion with an examination of the legislative history of the McCarran Amendment.  We also noted:</p>\n<p>"Mere subjection of Indian rights to legal challenge in state court . . . would no more imperil those rights than would a suit brought by the Government in district court for their declaration. . . .  The Government has not abdicated any responsibility fully to defend Indian rights in state court, and Indian interests may be satisfactorily protected under regimes of state law.  The Amendment in no way abridges any substantive claim on behalf of Indians under the doctrine of reserved rights.  Moreover, as <em>Eagle County</em> said,"</p>\n<p>"questions [arising from the collision of private rights and reserved rights of the United States], including the volume and scope of particular reserved rights, are federal questions which, if preserved, can be reviewed [by the Supreme Court] after final judgment by the Colorado court."</p>\n<p>"401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/401/520/case.html#526">401 U.

We found that the dismissal could not be supported under the doctrine of abstention in any of its forms, but that it was justified as an application of traditional principles of</p>\n<p>"\'[w]ise judicial administration, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 463 U.

We stated that, although the federal courts had a "virtually unflagging obligation . . . to exercise the jurisdiction given them," 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#817">424 U.

In the case at hand, we noted the comprehensive nature of the state proceedings and the considerable expertise and technical resources available in those proceedings, 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#819">424 U. S. 819</a></span>-820.  We concluded:</p>\n<p>"[A] number of factors clearly counsel against concurrent federal proceedings.  The most important of these is the McCarran Amendment itself.  The clear federal policy evinced by that legislation is the avoidance of piecemeal adjudication of water rights in a river system.  This policy is akin to that underlying the rule requiring that jurisdiction be yielded to the court first acquiring control of property, for the concern in such instances is with avoiding the generation of additional litigation through permitting inconsistent dispositions of property.  This concern is heightened with respect to water rights, the relationships among which are highly interdependent.  Indeed, we have recognized that actions seeking the allocation of water essentially involve the disposition of property, and are best conducted in unified proceedings.  The consent to jurisdiction given by the McCarran Amendment bespeaks a policy that recognizes the availability of comprehensive state systems for adjudication of water rights as the means for achieving these goals."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#819">424 U.

In each of the underlying cases, either the United States as trustee or certain Indian Tribes on their own behalf, or both, asserted the right to have certain Indian water rights in Arizona or Montana adjudicated in federal court.</p>\n<p><em><em>The Montana Cases</em> (No. 81-2188)\n</em></p>\n<p>In January, 1975, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Montana seeking an adjudication of its rights in certain streams in that State.  Shortly thereafter, the United States brought two suits in the same court, seeking a determination of water rights both on its own behalf and on behalf of a number of Indian Tribes, including the Northern Cheyenne, in the same streams.  Each of the federal actions was a general adjudication which sought to determine the rights <em>inter sese</em> of all users of the stream, and not merely the rights of the plaintiffs.  On motion of the Northern Cheyenne, its action was consolidated with one of the Government actions.  The other concerned Tribes intervened as appropriate.</p>\n<p>At about the time that all this activity was taking place in federal court, the State of Montana was preparing to begin a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="554">Page 463 U. S. 554</a></p><p> process of comprehensive water adjudication under a recently passed state statute.  In July, 1975, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation filed petitions in state court commencing comprehensive proceedings to adjudicate water rights in the same streams at issue in the federal cases.</p>\n<p>Both sets of contestants having positioned themselves, nothing much happened for a number of years.  The federal proceedings were stayed for a time pending our decision in <em>Colorado River.</em>  When that decision came down, the State of Montana, one of the defendants in the federal suits, brought a motion to dismiss, which was argued in 1976 but not decided until 1979.  Meanwhile, process was completed in the various suits, answers were submitted, and discovery commenced.  Over in the state courts, events moved even more slowly, and no appreciable progress seems to have been made by 1979.</p>\n<p>In April, 1979, the United States brought four more suits in federal court, seeking to adjudicate its rights and the rights of various Indian Tribes in other Montana streams.  One month later, the Montana Legislature amended its water adjudication procedures "to expedite and facilitate the adjudication of existing water rights."  Act to Adjudicate Claims of Existing Water Rights in Montana, Ch. 697, \xc2\xa7 1(1), 1979 Mont. Laws 1901.  The legislation provided for the initiation of comprehensive proceedings by order of the Montana Supreme Court, the appointment of water judges throughout the State, and the consolidation of all existing actions within each water division.  It also provided, among other things, that the Montana Supreme Court should issue an order requiring all claimants not already involved in the state proceedings, including the United States on its own behalf or as trustee for the Indians, to file a statement of claim with the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation by a date set by the court, or be deemed to have abandoned any water rights claim.  \xc2\xa7 16, 1979 Mont.

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Montana court issued the required order, and the United States was served with formal notice thereof. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>In November, 1979, the two judges for the District of Montana jointly considered the motions to dismiss in each of the federal actions, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and granted each of them.  <em>Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation v. Tongue River Water Users Assn.,</em> 484 F.Supp. 31.  The court relied strongly on the new Montana legislation, stating:</p>\n<p>"The above-cited sections reflect both the policy and the essential mechanism for adjudication of state water rights.  Adjudication by adversary proceeding initiated by one claimant against all others in his drainage has been forsaken in favor of blanket adjudication of all claims, including federal and federal trust claims. . . .  It is clear that the adjudication contemplated by the [1979 legislation] is both comprehensive and efficient.  As the general adjudication has been initiated by recent order of the Montana Supreme Court, it would seem that the greater wisdom lies in following <em>Colorado River,</em> and, on the basis of wise judicial administration, deferring to the comprehensive state proceedings."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 35-36.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 463 U. S. 556</a></p><p> The District Court also noted, among other things, that the federal proceedings "are all in their infancy; service of process has been but recently completed," <em>id.</em> at 36, that the state forums were geographically more convenient to the parties, that</p>\n<p>"[t]he amount of time contemplated for completion of the state adjudication is significantly less than would be necessary for federal adjudication, insofar as the state has provided a special court system solely devoted to water rights adjudication,"</p>\n<p><em>ibid.,</em> and that</p>\n<p>"[t]he possibility of conflicting adjudications by the concurrent forums . . . looms large, and could be partially avoided only by staying the pending state adjudication, an action <em>Colorado River</em> has intimated is distinctly repugnant to a clear state policy and purpose."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>On appeal, a divided Court of Appeals reversed.  <em>Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation v. Adsit,</em> 668 F.2d 1080 (CA9 1982).  First, it held that Montana, unlike Colorado, might well lack jurisdiction to adjudicate Indian claims in state court.  The court reached this conclusion on the basis of two closely linked documents:  the Enabling Act under which Montana was admitted to statehood, and the Montana Constitution promulgated in response to that Enabling Act, both of which provide, in identical terms, that the people inhabiting Montana</p>\n<p>"agree and declare that they forever disclaim all right and title to . . . all lands . . . owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes; and that until the title thereto shall have been extinguished by the United States, the same shall be and remain subject to the disposition of the United States, and said Indian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States. . . ."</p>\n<p>Enabling Act of Feb. 22, 1889, \xc2\xa7 4, 25 Stat. 677 (North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington); Mont.Const., Ordinance No. I (1895).  The Court of Appeals concluded that, by their terms, the Enabling Act and constitutional disclaimer prohibit Montana </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 463 U. S. 557</a></p><p> from exercising even adjudicatory jurisdiction over Indian water rights, and that the McCarran Amendment effected no change in that disability.  It also held, however, that the State might have acquired such jurisdiction under Pub.L. 280, 67 Stat. 588, which, from 1953 until its amendment in 1968, allowed any State that wished to do so to acquire certain aspects of civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian affairs, and authorized States with constitutional or statutory disclaimers to "amend, where necessary, their State constitution or existing statutes, as the case may be, to remove any legal impediment" to the assumption of such jurisdiction.  \xc2\xa7 6, 67 Stat. 590.  <em>See generally Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html">439 U. S. 463</a></span> (1979).  The court did not decide whether Montana had amended its Constitution in accordance with the requirements of Pub.L. 280, <em>cf Yakima Indian Nation, supra,</em> at <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html#478">439 U. S. </a></span> but it criticized the District Court for not undertaking such an analysis.</p>\n<p>The second, and dispositive, ground of decision in the Court of Appeals, however, was its conclusion that,</p>\n<p>"[e]ven if we were to find that Montana had validly repealed the disclaimer language in its constitution, . . . [t]he limited factual circumstances of [<em>Colorado River</em>] prevent its application to the Montana litigation."</p>\n<p>668 F.2d at 1087.  In reaching this conclusion, the court relied in part on the infancy of both the federal and state proceedings in the Montana litigation, the possible inadequacy of the state proceedings (which it did not discuss in great detail), and the fact that the Indians (who could not be joined involuntarily in the state proceedings) might not be adequately represented by the United States in state court in light of conflicts of interest between the Federal Government\'s responsibilities as trustee and its own claims to water.</p>\n<p><em><em>The Arizona Cases</em> (No. 81-2147)\n</em></p>\n<p>In the mid-1970\'s, various water rights claimants in Arizona filed petitions in state court to initiate general adjudications </p><p><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 463 U. S. 558</a></p><p> to determine conflicting rights in a number of river systems.  In early 1979, process was served in one of the proceedings on approximately 12,000 known potential water claimants, including the United States.  In July, 1981, process was served in another proceeding on approximately 58,000 known water claimants, again including the United States.  In each case, the United States was joined both in its independent capacity and as trustee for various Indian Tribes.</p>\n<p>In March and April, 1979, a number of Indian Tribes whose rights were implicated by the state water proceedings filed a series of suits in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, asking variously for removal of the state adjudications to federal court, declaratory and injunctive relief preventing any further adjudication of their rights in state court, and independent federal determinations of their water rights.  A number of defendants in the federal proceedings filed motions seeking remand or dismissal.  The District Court, relying on <em>Colorado River,</em> remanded the removed actions, and dismissed most of the independent federal actions without prejudice.  <em>In re Determination of Conflicting Rights to Use of Water from Salt River Above Grante Reef Dam,</em> 484 F.Supp. 778 (1980). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It stayed one of the remaining actions pending the completion of state proceedings.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 81-2147, p. D-1.</p>\n<p>The Tribes appealed from these decisions, with the exception of the remand orders. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Enabling Act under which Arizona was admitted to statehood, 36 Stat. 557, and the Arizona Constitution, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 463 U. S. 559</a></p><p> Art. 20, 114, both of which contain wording substantially identical to the Montana Enabling Act and Constitution, disabled Arizona from adjudicating Indian water claims.  <em>San Carlos Apache Tribe v. Arizona,</em> 668 F.2d 1093 (CA9 1982); <em>Navajo Nation v. United States,</em> 668 F.2d 1100 (CA9 1982).  The court remanded to the District Court to determine whether Arizona nevertheless "properly asserted jurisdiction pursuant to Public Law 280."  668 F.2d at 1098; <em>see</em> 668 F.2d at 1102.  The court did not decide whether, if the State had properly asserted jurisdiction, dismissal would have been proper under <em>Colorado River,</em> except to note that</p>\n<p>"the district judge did not make findings on this issue, and the record indicates significant differences between these cases and <em>[Colorado River.]</em>"</p>\n<p>668 F.2d at 1098; <em>see</em> 668 F.2d at 1102.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 459 U.S. 821 (1982), in order to resolve a conflict among the Circuits regarding the role of federal and state courts in adjudicating Indian water rights. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>At the outset of our analysis, a number of propositions are clear.  First, the federal courts had jurisdiction here to hear the suits brought both by the United States and the Indian Tribes. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Second, it is also clear in these cases, as it was in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="560">Page 463 U. S. 560</a></p><p> <em>Colorado River,</em> that a dismissal or stay of the federal suits would have been improper if there was no jurisdiction in the concurrent state actions to adjudicate the claims at issue in the federal suits.  424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html">424 U. S. 800</a></span>.  Third, the parties here agree that the Court of Appeals erred in believing that, in the absence of state jurisdiction otherwise, Pub.L. 280 would have authorized the States to assume jurisdiction over the adjudication of Indian water rights.  To the contrary, Pub.L. 280 specifically withheld from state courts jurisdiction to adjudicate ownership or right to possession</p>\n<p>"of any real or personal property, <em>including water rights,</em> belonging to any Indian or any Indian tribe, band, or community that is held in trust by the United States or is subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States."</p>\n<p>28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1360(b) (emphasis added). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Thus, the presence or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="561">Page 463 U. S. 561</a></p><p> absence of jurisdiction must rise or fall without reference to whether the States have assumed jurisdiction under Pub.L. 280.</p>\n<p>Finally, it should be obvious that, to the extent that a claimed bar to state jurisdiction in these cases is premised on the respective State Constitutions, that is a question of state law over which the state courts have binding authority.  Because, in each of these cases, the state courts have taken jurisdiction over the Indian water rights at issue here, we must assume, until informed otherwise, that -- at least insofar as state law is concerned -- such jurisdiction exists.  We must therefore look, for our purposes, to the federal Enabling Acts and other federal legislation, in order to determine whether there is a federal bar to the assertion of state jurisdiction in these cases.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>That we were not required in <em>Colorado River</em> to interpret the McCarran Amendment in light of any statehood Enabling Act was largely a matter of fortuity, for Colorado is one of the few Western States that were not admitted to the Union pursuant to an Enabling Act containing substantially the same language as is found in the Arizona and Montana Enabling Acts. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Indeed, a substantial majority of Indian land -- including most of the largest Indian reservations -- lies in States subject to such Enabling Acts. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Moreover, the reason that Colorado was not subject to such an Enabling </p><p><a class="page-number" name="562">Page 463 U. S. 562</a></p><p> Act, and Arizona and Montana were, has more to do with historical timing than with deliberate congressional selection.  Colorado was admitted to the Union in 1876.  In 1882, this Court held in <em>United States v. McBratney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/104/621/case.html">104 U. S. 621</a></span>, that the federal courts in Colorado had no criminal jurisdiction in a murder committed by one non-Indian against another on an Indian reservation, pointing out that the case did not concern</p>\n<p>"the punishment of crimes committed by or against Indians, the protection of the Indians in their improvements, or the regulation by Congress of the alienation and descent of property and the government and internal police of the Indians."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/104/621/case.html#624">104 U. S. 624</a></span>.  We also suggested, however, that the result might have been different if Congress had expressly reserved all criminal jurisdiction on Indian reservations when Colorado was admitted to the Union, pointing to a similar disclaimer contained in the legislation by which Kansas was admitted to statehood in 1861.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/104/621/case.html#623">104 U. S. 623</a></span>-624; <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/72/737/case.html">The Kansas Indians,</a></span></em> 5 Wall. 737 (1867).  Probably in response to the <em>McBratney</em> decision, Congress resumed the practice of including reservations in Enabling Acts, and did so in the case of virtually every State admitted after 1882.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F12" name="T12">n</a> 12, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>Despite <em>McBratney</em> and <em>The Kansas Indians,</em> the presence or absence of specific jurisdictional disclaimers has rarely been dispositive in our consideration of state jurisdiction over Indian affairs or activities on Indian lands.  In <em>Draper v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/164/240/case.html">164 U. S. 240</a></span> (1896), for example, this Court held that, despite the jurisdictional reservation in the Montana Enabling Act, a federal court still did not have jurisdiction over a crime committed on an Indian reservation by one non-Indian against another.  We stated:</p>\n<p>"As equality of statehood is the rule, the words relied on here to create an exception cannot be construed as doing so, if, by any reasonable meaning, they can be otherwise treated.  The mere reservation of jurisdiction and control by the United States of \'Indian lands\' does not, of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="563">Page 463 U. S. 563</a></p><p> necessity, signify a retention of jurisdiction in the United States to punish all offences committed on such lands by others than Indians or against Indians."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/164/240/case.html#244">164 U. S. 244</a></span>-245.  Similarly, in <em>Organized Village of Kake v. Egan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/60/case.html">369 U. S. 60</a></span> (1962), we held that a reservation in the Alaska Enabling Act did not deprive the State of the right to regulate Indian fishing licensed by the Department of the Interior, finding that the state regulation neither interfered with Indian self-government nor impaired any right granted or reserved by federal law.  Conversely, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/515/case.html">Worcester v. Georgia,</a></span></em> 6 Pet. 515 (1832), perhaps the most expansive declaration of Indian independence from state regulation ever uttered by this Court, pertained to one of the original 13 States, unbound by any Enabling Act whatsoever.  <em>See also e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/72/761/case.html">72 U. S. </a></span></em> 5 Wall. 761,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/72/761/case.html#769">72 U. S. 769</a></span>-770 (1867) (reaching same conclusion as <em>The Kansas Indians, supra,</em> but without benefit of disclaimer).  And our many recent decisions recognizing crucial limits on the power of the States to regulate Indian affairs have rarely either invoked reservations of jurisdiction contained in statehood Enabling Acts by anything more than a passing mention or distinguished between disclaimer States and nondisclaimer States.  <em>See, e.g., New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/324/case.html">462 U. S. 324</a></span> (1983); <em>Ramah Navajo School Board v. Bureau of Revenue,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/832/case.html">458 U. S. 832</a></span> (1982); <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html">448 U. S. 136</a></span> (1980); <em>Bryan v. Itasca County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/373/case.html">426 U. S. 373</a></span> (1976); <em>Williams v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/case.html">358 U. S. 217</a></span> (1959).</p>\n<p>In light of this history, the parties in these cases have engaged in a vigorous debate as to the exact meaning and significance of the Arizona and Montana Enabling Acts. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  We </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 463 U. S. 564</a></p><p> need not resolve that debate, however, nor need we resort to the more general doctrines that have developed to chart the limits of state authority over Indians, because we are convinced that, whatever limitation the Enabling Acts or federal policy may have originally placed on state court jurisdiction over Indian water rights, those limitations were removed by the McCarran Amendment. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  <em>Cf. Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation,</em> 439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html#484">439 U. S. 484</a></span>-493.  Congress clearly would have had the right to distinguish between disclaimer and nondisclaimer States in passing the McCarran Amendment.  But the Amendment was designed to deal with a general problem arising out of the limitations that federal sovereign immunity placed on the ability of the States to adjudicate water rights, and nowhere in its text or legislative history do we find any indication that Congress intended the efficacy of the remedy to differ from one State to another.  Moreover, we stated in <em>Colorado River</em> that,</p>\n<p>"bearing in mind the ubiquitous nature of Indian water rights in the Southwest, it is clear that a construction of the Amendment excluding those rights from its coverage would enervate the Amendment\'s objective."</p>\n<p>424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#811">424 U. S. 811</a></span>.  The "ubiquitous nature of Indian water rights" is most apparent in the very States to which Congress attached jurisdictional reservations.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html#561">463 U. S. 561</a></span>.  To declare now that our holding in <em>Colorado River</em> applies only to that minority of Indian water claims located in States without jurisdictional reservations would constitute a curious and unwarranted retreat from the rationale behind our previous holding, and would work the very mischief that our decision in <em>Colorado River</em> sought to avoid.  We need not rely on the possibly overbroad statement in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 463 U. S. 565</a></p><p> <em>Draper v. United States</em> that "equality of statehood is the rule," 164 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/164/240/case.html#244">164 U. S. 244</a></span>, in order to conclude that, in this context at least, "equality of statehood" is sensible, necessary, and, most important, consistent with the will of Congress.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The second crucial issue in these cases is whether our analysis in <em>Colorado River</em> applies with full force to federal suits brought by Indian tribes, rather than by the United States, and seeking adjudication only of Indian water rights. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  This question is not directly answered by <em>Colorado River,</em> because we specifically reserved in that case "[w]hether similar considerations would permit dismissal of a water suit brought by a private party in federal district court."  424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#820">424 U. S. 820</a></span>, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="566">Page 463 U. S. 566</a></p><p> n. 26.  On reflection, however, we must agree with JUSTICE STEVENS, who, in dissenting from our decision, wrote:</p>\n<p>"[T]he Federal Government surely has no lesser right of access to the federal forum than does a private [party], such as an Indian asserting his own claim.  If this be so, today\'s holding will necessarily restrict the access to federal court of private plaintiffs asserting water rights claims in Colorado."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#827">424 U. S. 827</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The United States and the various Indian respondents raise a series of arguments why dismissal or stay of the federal suit is not appropriate when it is brought by an Indian tribe and only seeks to adjudicate Indian rights.  (1) Indian rights have traditionally been left free of interference from the States.  (2) State courts may be inhospitable to Indian rights.  (3) The McCarran Amendment, although it waived United States sovereign immunity in state comprehensive water adjudications, did not waive <em>Indian</em> sovereign immunity.  It is therefore unfair to force Indian claimants to choose between waiving their sovereign immunity by intervening in the state proceedings and relying on the United States to represent their interests in state court, particularly in light of the frequent conflict of interest between Indian claims and other federal interests and the right of the Indians under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1362 to bring suit on their own behalf in federal court. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  (4) Indian water rights claims are generally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="567">Page 463 U. S. 567</a></p><p> based on federal, rather than state, law.  (5) Because Indian water claims are based on the doctrine of "reserved rights," and take priority over most water rights created by state law, they need not, as a practical matter, be adjudicated <em>inter sese</em> with other water rights, and could simply be incorporated into the comprehensive state decree at the conclusion of the state proceedings.</p>\n<p>Each of these arguments has a good deal of force.  We note, though, that very similar arguments were raised and rejected in <em>United States v. District Court for Eagle County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/520/case.html">401 U. S. 520</a></span> (1971), and <em>Colorado River.</em> [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  More important, all of these arguments founder on one crucial fact:  if the state proceedings have jurisdiction over the Indian water rights at issue here, as appears to be the case, [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] then concurrent federal proceedings are likely to be duplicative and wasteful, generating "additional litigation through permitting inconsistent dispositions of property."  <em>Colorado River,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#819">424 U. S. 819</a></span>.  Moreover, since a judgment by either court would ordinarily be <em>res judicata</em> in the other, the existence of such concurrent proceedings creates the serious potential for spawning an unseemly and destructive race to see which forum can resolve the same issues first -- a race contrary to the entire spirit of the McCarran Amendment and prejudicial, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 463 U. S. 568</a></p><p> to say the least, to the possibility of reasoned decisionmaking by either forum.  The United States and many of the Indian Tribes recognize these concerns, but, in responding to them, they cast aside the sort of sound argument generally apparent in the rest of their submissions and rely instead on vague statements of faith and hope.  The United States, for example, states that adjudicating Indian water rights in federal court, despite the existence of a comprehensive state proceeding, would not</p>\n<p>"entail any duplication or potential for inconsistent judgments.  The federal court will quantify the Indian rights only if it is asked to do so before the State court has embarked on the task.  And, of course, once the United States district court has indicated its determination to perform that limited role, we assume the State tribunal will turn its attention to the typically more complex business of adjudicating all other claims on the stream.  <em>In the usual case,</em> the federal court will have completed its function earlier, and its quantification of Indian water rights will simply be incorporated in the comprehensive State court decree."</p>\n<p>Brief for United States 30 (emphasis added).  Similarly, the Navajo Nation states:</p>\n<p>"There is no reasonably foreseeable danger that [the] federal action [brought by the Navajo] will duplicate or delay state proceedings or waste judicial resources.  While the Navajo claim proceeds in federal court, the state court <em>can</em> move forward to assess, quantify, and rank the 58,000 state claims.  The Navajo federal action will be concluded long before the state court has finished its task."</p>\n<p>Brief for Respondent Navajo Nation in No. 81-2147, p. 22 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>The problem with these scenarios, however, is that they assume a cooperative attitude on the part of state courts, state legislatures, and state parties which is neither legally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="569">Page 463 U. S. 569</a></p><p> required nor realistically always to be expected.  The state courts need not "turn their attention" to other matters if they are prompted by state parties to adjudicate the Indian claims first.  Moreover, considering the specialized resources and experience of the state courts, it is not at all obvious that the federal actions "will be concluded long before" the state courts have issued at least preliminary judgments on the question of Indian water rights.  <em>Cf.</em> 484 F.Supp. at 36.</p>\n<p>The McCarran Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Colorado River,</em> allows and encourages state courts to undertake the task of quantifying Indian water rights in the course of comprehensive water adjudications.  Although adjudication of those rights in federal court instead might, in the abstract, be practical, and even wise, it will be neither practical nor wise as long as it creates the possibility of duplicative litigation, tension and controversy between the federal and state forums, hurried and pressured decisionmaking, and confusion over the disposition of property rights.</p>\n<p><em>Colorado River,</em> of course, does not require that a federal water suit must always be dismissed or stayed in deference to a concurrent and adequate comprehensive state adjudication.  Certainly, the federal courts need not defer to the state proceedings if the state courts expressly agree to stay their own consideration of the issues raised in the federal action pending disposition of that action.  Moreover, it may be in a particular case that, at the time a motion to dismiss is filed, the federal suit at issue is well enough along that its dismissal would itself constitute a waste of judicial resources and an invitation to duplicative effort.  <em>See Colorado River, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#820">424 U. S. 820</a></span>; <em>Moses H. Cone Hospital,</em> 460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/case.html#21">460 U. S. 21</a></span>-22.  Finally, we do not deny that, in a case in which the arguments for and against deference to the state adjudication were otherwise closely matched, the fact that a federal suit was brought by Indians on their own behalf and sought only to adjudicate Indian rights should be figured into the balance.

In light of our express holding in <em>Colorado River,</em> what we say here with regard to the suits brought by the Indians must apply <em>a fortiori</em> to the suits brought by the United States.  In addition, some of the cases before us sought adjudication of all the rights to a particular water system, rather than merely Indian or other federal water rights, and it is argued that these suits avoid the "piecemeal adjudication of water rights" which we found in <em>Colorado River</em> to be inconsistent with federal policy.  424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#819">424 U.

Given, however, that one of the best arguments in favor of retaining federal jurisdiction in Indian water cases is that Indian water rights can be adjudicated separately and then incorporated into the results of the comprehensive state proceedings, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html#567">463 U.

A comprehensive federal adjudication going on at the same time as a comprehensive state adjudication might not literally be "piecemeal."  It is, however, duplicative, wasteful, inconsistent with the McCarran Amendment\'s policy of</p>\n<p>"recogniz[ing] the availability of comprehensive state systems for adjudication of water rights as the means for [conducting unified water rights proceedings],"</p>\n<p>424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#819">424 U.

Moreover, contrary to the submissions by certain of the parties, any judgment against the United States, as trustee for the Indians, would ordinarily be binding on the Indians.  In addition, there is no indication in these cases that the state courts would deny the Indian parties leave to intervene to protect their interests.  Thus, although the Indians have the right to refuse to intervene even if they believe that the United States is not adequately representing their interests, the practical value of that right in this context is dubious, at best.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> Brief for United States in <em>United States v.

We stated that, in light of "the virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#817">424 U.

Substantially for the reasons set forth in JUSTICE STEVENS\' dissenting opinion, I believe that abstention is not appropriate in these cases.  Unlike the federal suit in <em>Colorado River,</em> the suits here are brought by Indian Tribes on their own behalf.  These cases thus implicate the strong congressional policy, embodied in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1362, of affording Indian tribes a federal forum.  Since \xc2\xa7 1362 reflects a congressional recognition of the "great hesitancy on the part of tribes to use State courts," S.Rep. No. 1507, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1966), tribes which have sued under that provision should not lightly be remitted to asserting their rights in a state forum.  Moreover, these cases also differ from <em>Colorado River</em> in that the exercise of federal jurisdiction here will not result in duplicative federal and state proceedings, since the District Court need only determine the water rights of the Tribes.  I therefore cannot agree that this is one of those "exceptional" situations justifying abstention.  424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#818">424 U.

Vested no later than the date each reservation was created, these Indian rights are superior in right to all subsequent appropriations under state law.  Not all of the issues arising from the application of the Winters doctrine have been resolved, because, in the past, the scope of Indian reserved rights has infrequently been adjudicated. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The important task of elaborating and clarifying these federal law issues in the cases now before the Court, and in future cases, should be performed by federal, rather than state, courts whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Federal adjudication of Indian water rights would not fragment an otherwise unified state court proceeding.  Since Indian reserved claims are wholly dissimilar to state law water claims, and since their amount does not depend on the total volume of water available in the water source or on the quantity of competing claims, it will be necessary to conduct separate proceedings to determine these claims even if the adjudication takes place in state court.  Subsequently the state court will incorporate these claims -- like claims under state law or Federal Government claims that have been formally adjudicated in the past -- into a single inclusive, binding decree for each water source.  Thus, as Justice Stewart wrote </p><p><a class="page-number" name="575">Page 463 U. S. 575</a></p><p> in dissent in <em>Colorado River</em>:</p>\n<p>"Whether the virtually identical separate proceedings take place in a federal court or a state court, the adjudication of the claims will be neither more nor less \'piecemeal.\'  Essentially the same process will be followed in each instance."</p>\n<p>424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#825">424 U. S. 825</a></span>.</p>\n<p>To justify virtual abandonment of Indian water rights claims to the state courts, the majority relies heavily on <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District,</em> which in turn discovered an affirmative policy of federal judicial abdication in the McCarran Amendment. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  I continue to believe that <em>Colorado River</em> read more into that Amendment than Congress intended, and cannot acquiesce in an extension of its reasoning.  Although the Court\'s decision in <em>Colorado River</em> did, indeed, foreshadow today\'s holding, it did not involve an Indian tribe\'s attempt to litigate on its own behalf, 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#820">424 U.

The majority today acknowledges that the question in these cases was "not directly answered," but in fact was "specifically reserved," in <em>Colorado River.</em> <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html#565">463 U. S. 565</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Although in some respects Indian tribes\' water claims are similar to other reserved federal water rights, different treatment is justified.  States and their citizens may well be more antagonistic toward Indian reserved rights than other federal reserved rights, both because the former are potentially greater in quantity and because they provide few direct or indirect benefits to non-Indian residents. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Indians have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="576">Page 463 U.

It is clear to me that the words "wise judicial administration" have been wrenched completely from their ordinary meaning.  One of the Arizona proceedings, in which process has been served on approximately 58,000 known water claimants, illustrates the practical consequences of giving the state courts the initial responsibility for the adjudication of Indian water rights claims.  Because this Court may not exercise appellate jurisdiction in state court litigation until after a final judgment has been entered by the highest court of the State, no federal tribunal will be able to review any federal question in the case until the entire litigation has been concluded.  The Court promises that</p>\n<p>"any state court decision alleged to abridge Indian water rights protected by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="579">Page 463 U. S. 579</a></p><p> federal law can expect to receive, if brought for review before this Court, a particularized and exacting scrutiny commensurate with the powerful federal interest in safeguarding those rights from state encroachment."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html#571">463 U. S. 571</a></span>.  If a state court errs in interpreting the <em>Winters</em> doctrine or an Indian treaty, and this Court ultimately finds it necessary to correct that error, the entire comprehensive state court water rights decree may require massive readjustment.  If, however, the quantification of Indian rights were to be adjudicated in a separate federal proceeding -- which presumably would be concluded long before the mammoth, conglomerate state adjudication comes to an end -- the state judgment would rest on a solid foundation that this Court should never need to examine.</p>\n<p>The Court acknowledges the logical force of these propositions, but sets them aside because the exercise of concurrent federal court jurisdiction would create</p>\n<p>"the possibility of duplicative litigation, tension and controversy between the federal and state forums, hurried and pressured decisionmaking, and confusion over the disposition of property rights."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html#569">463 U. S. 569</a></span>.  These possibilities arise, as the Court candidly admits, from a pessimistic assessment of the likelihood that state courts, state legislatures, and state parties will assume a "cooperative attitude."  In other words, the state courts might engage in an unseemly rush to judgment in order to give the Indians less water than they fear that the federal courts might provide.  If state courts cannot be expected to adhere to orderly processes of decisionmaking because of their hostility to the Indians, the statutory right accorded to Indian tribes to litigate in a federal tribunal is even more important.</p>\n<p>In my view, a federal court whose jurisdiction is invoked in a timely manner by an Indian tribe has a duty to determine the existence and extent of the tribe\'s reserved water rights under federal law.  It is inappropriate to stay or dismiss such federal court proceedings in order to allow determinations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="580">Page 463 U. S. 580</a></p><p> by state courts.  In the cases before us today, complaints were timely filed in federal court by the Indian Tribes, before or shortly after the institution of state water adjudication proceedings; the state proceedings in Arizona and Montana remain at an early stage.  The District Court should therefore grant the Tribes leave to amend the various complaints, where necessary, to seek adjudication of the scope and quantity of Indian reserved water rights and to eliminate other claims; the suits should then proceed in federal court.</p>\n<p>Today, however, on the tenuous foundation of a perceived congressional intent that has never been articulated in statutory language or legislative history, the Court carves out a further exception to the "virtually unflagging obligation" of federal courts to exercise their jurisdiction.  The Court does not -- and cannot -- claim that it is faithfully following general principles of law.  After all, just four months ago in <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/case.html">460 U. S. 1</a></span> (1983), the Court wrote:</p>\n<p>"[W]e emphasize that our task in cases such as this is not to find some substantial reason for the exercise of federal jurisdiction by the district court; rather, the task is to ascertain whether there exist \'exceptional\' circumstances, the \'clearest of justifications,\' that can suffice under <em>Colorado River</em> to justify the <em>surrender</em> of that jurisdiction.  Although in some rare circumstances the presence of state law issues may weigh in favor of that surrender . . . the presence of federal law issues must always be a major consideration weighing against surrender."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/case.html#25">460 U.

Pub.L. 280, 67 Stat. 588, codified at 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1360(b).
