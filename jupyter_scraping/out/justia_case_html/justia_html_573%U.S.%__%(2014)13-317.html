In Basic Inc. v. Levinson,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224\n, this Court held that investors could satisfy this reliance requirement by invoking a presumption that the price of stock traded in an efficient market reflects all public, material information\xe2\x80\x94including material misrepresentations.  The Court also held, however, that a defendant could rebut this presumption by showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock price\xe2\x80\x94that is, that it had no \xe2\x80\x9cprice impact.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondent Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), filed a putative class action against Halliburton and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton), alleging that they made misrepresentations designed to inflate Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s stock price, in violation of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.  The District Court initially denied EPJ Fund\xe2\x80\x99s class certification motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  But this Court vacated that judgment, concluding that securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causation\xe2\x80\x94a causal connection between the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 alleged misrepresentations and the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 economic losses\xe2\x80\x94at the class certification stage in order to invoke Basic\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reliance.  On remand, Halliburton argued that class certification was nonetheless inappropriate because the evidence it had earlier introduced to disprove loss causation also showed that its alleged misrepresentations had not affected its stock price.  By demonstrating the absence of any \xe2\x80\x9cprice impact,\xe2\x80\x9d Halliburton contended, it had rebutted the Basic presumption.  And without the benefit of that presumption, investors would have to prove reliance on an individual basis, meaning that individual issues would predominate over common ones and class certification would be inappropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).  The District Court rejected Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s argument and certified the class.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, concluding that Halliburton could use its price impact evidence to rebut the Basic presumption only at trial, not at the class certification stage.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        1.\xc2\xa0Halliburton has not shown a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial justification,\xe2\x80\x9d Dickerson v.

Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  The Court recognized in Basic, however, that requiring direct proof of reliance from every individual plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cwould place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market,\xe2\x80\x9d 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 245, and \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively would\xe2\x80\x9d prevent plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cfrom proceeding with a class action\xe2\x80\x9d in Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 suits, id., at 242.  To address these concerns, the Court held that plaintiffs could satisfy the reliance element of a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 action by invoking a rebuttable presumption of reliance. The Court based that presumption on what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cfraud-on-the-market\xe2\x80\x9d theory, which holds that \xe2\x80\x9cthe market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 246.  The Court also noted that the typical \xe2\x80\x9cinvestor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 247.  As a result, whenever an investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his \xe2\x80\x9creliance on any public material misrepresentations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may be presumed for purposes of a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id. at 247.

First, it argues that the Basic Court espoused \xe2\x80\x9ca robust view of market efficiency\xe2\x80\x9d that is no longer tenable in light of empirical evidence ostensibly showing that material, public information often is not quickly incorporated into stock prices.  The Court in Basic acknowledged, however, the debate among economists about the efficiency of capital markets and refused to endorse \xe2\x80\x9cany particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price.\xe2\x80\x9d  485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248, n.\xc2\xa028.  The Court instead based the presumption of reliance on the fairly modest premise that \xe2\x80\x9cmarket professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 247, n.\xc2\xa024.  Moreover, in making the presumption rebuttable, Basic recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a matter of proof.  Halliburton has not identified the kind of fundamental shift in economic theory that could justify overruling a precedent on the ground that it misunderstood, or has since been overtaken by, economic realities.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Halliburton also contests the premise that investors \xe2\x80\x9cinvest \xe2\x80\x98in reliance on the integrity of [the market] price,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 247, identifying a number of classes of investors for whom \xe2\x80\x9cprice integrity\xe2\x80\x9d is supposedly \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal or irrelevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Basic never denied the existence of such investors, who in any event rely at least on the facts that market prices will incorporate public information within a reasonable period and that market prices, however inaccurate, are not distorted by fraud.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (c)\xc2\xa0The principle of stare decisis has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special force\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin respect to statutory interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress remains free to alter what [the Court has] done.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 130\n. So too with Basic\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reliance.  The presumption is not inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s more recent decisions construing the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cause of action.  In Central Bank of Denver, N.\xc2\xa0A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.\xc2\xa0A.,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 164\n, and Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 148\n, the Court declined to effectively eliminate the reliance element by extending liability to entirely new categories of defendants who themselves had not made any material, public misrepresentation.  The Basic presumption, by contrast, merely provides an alternative means of satisfying the reliance element.  Nor is the Basic presumption inconsistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decisions governing class action certification, which require plaintiffs to prove\xe2\x80\x94not simply plead\xe2\x80\x94that their proposed class satisfies each requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, including, if applicable, the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  See, e.g., Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  The Basic presumption does not relieve plaintiffs of that burden but rather sets forth what plaintiffs must prove to demonstrate predominance.  Finally, Halliburton emphasizes the possible harmful consequences of the securities class actions facilitated by the Basic presumption, but such concerns are more appropriately addressed to Congress, which has in fact responded, to some extent, to many of them.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        2.\xc2\xa0For the same reasons the Court declines to overrule Basic\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reliance, it also declines to modify the prerequisites for invoking the presumption by requiring plaintiffs to prove \xe2\x80\x9cprice impact\xe2\x80\x9d directly at the class certification stage.  The Basic presumption incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff shows that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation was public and material and that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price.  Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation.  Requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly would take away the first constituent presumption.  Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s argument for doing so is the same as its argument for overruling the Basic presumption altogether, and it meets the same fate.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        3.\xc2\xa0The Court agrees with Halliburton, however, that defendants must be afforded an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance before class certification with evidence of a lack of price impact.  Defendants may already introduce such evidence at the merits stage to rebut the Basic presumption, as well as at the class certification stage to counter a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s showing of market efficiency.  Forbidding defendants to rely on the same evidence prior to class certification for the particular purpose of rebutting the presumption altogether makes no sense, and can readily lead to results that are inconsistent with Basic\xe2\x80\x99s own logic.  Basic allows plaintiffs to establish price impact indirectly, by showing that a stock traded in an efficient market and that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations were public and material.  But an indirect proxy should not preclude consideration of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s direct, more salient evidence showing that an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock\xe2\x80\x99s price and, consequently, that the Basic presumption does not apply.  Amgen does not require a different result.  There, the Court held that materiality, though a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presumption, should be left to the merits stage because it does not bear on the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  In contrast, the fact that a misrepresentation has price impact is \xe2\x80\x9cBasic\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental premise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  It thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class certification stage.  That is why, if reliance is to be shown through the Basic presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be proved before class certification.  Given that such indirect evidence of price impact will be before the court at the class certification stage in any event, there is no reason to artificially limit the inquiry at that stage by excluding direct evidence of price impact.

According to EPJ Fund, between June 3, 1999, and December 7, 2001, Halliburton made a series of misrepresentations regarding its potential liability in asbestos litigation, its expected revenue from certain construction contracts, and the anticipated benefits of its merger with another company\xe2\x80\x94all in an attempt to inflate the price of its stock.

The District Court found that the proposed class satisfied all the threshold requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a): It was sufficiently numerous, there were common questions of law or fact, the representative parties\xe2\x80\x99 claims were typical of the class claims, and the representatives could fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

That is because, even assuming an investor could prove that he was aware of the misrepresentation, he would still have to \xe2\x80\x9cshow a speculative state of facts, i.e., how he would have acted .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the misrepresentation had not been made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We also noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]equiring proof of individualized reliance\xe2\x80\x9d from every securities fraud plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively would .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. prevent[ ] [plaintiffs] from proceeding with a class action\xe2\x80\x9d in Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 suits.

If every plaintiff had to prove direct reliance on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation, \xe2\x80\x9cindividual issues then would .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. overwhelm[ ] the common ones,\xe2\x80\x9d making certification under Rule 23(b)(3) inappropriate.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        To address these concerns, Basic held that securities fraud plaintiffs can in certain circumstances satisfy the reliance element of a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 action by invoking a rebuttable presumption of reliance, rather than proving direct reliance on a misrepresentation.  The Court based that presumption on what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cfraud-on-the-market\xe2\x80\x9d theory, which holds that \xe2\x80\x9cthe market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 246.  The Court also noted that, rather than scrutinize every piece of public information about a company for himself, the typical \xe2\x80\x9cinvestor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the belief that it reflects all public, material information.  Id., at 247.  As a result, whenever the investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his \xe2\x80\x9creliance on any public material misrepresentations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may be presumed for purposes of a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Based on this theory, a plaintiff must make the following showings to demonstrate that the presumption of reliance applies in a given case: (1) that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known, (2) that they were material, (3) that the stock traded in an efficient market, and (4) that the plaintiff traded the stock between the time the misrepresentations were made and when the truth was revealed.  See id., at 248, n. 27; Halliburton I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At the same time, Basic emphasized that the presumption of reliance was rebuttable rather than conclusive.  Specifically, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received (or paid) by the plaintiff, or his decision to trade at a fair market price, will be sufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248.  So for example, if a defendant could show that the alleged misrepresentation did not, for whatever reason, actually affect the market price, or that a plaintiff would have bought or sold the stock even had he been aware that the stock\xe2\x80\x99s price was tainted by fraud, then the presumption of reliance would not apply.  Id., at 248\xe2\x80\x93249.  In either of those cases, a plaintiff would have to prove that he directly relied on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation in buying or selling the stock.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Halliburton contends that securities fraud plaintiffs should always have to prove direct reliance and that the Basic Court erred in allowing them to invoke a presumption of reliance instead.  According to Halliburton, the Basic presumption contravenes congressional intent and has been undermined by subsequent developments in economic theory.  Neither argument, however, so discredits Basic as to constitute \xe2\x80\x9cspecial justification\xe2\x80\x9d for overruling the decision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Halliburton first argues that the Basic presumption is inconsistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent in passing the 1934 Exchange Act.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Section 10(b) action is a \xe2\x80\x98judicial construct that Congress did not enact,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d this Court, Halliburton insists, \xe2\x80\x9cmust identify\xe2\x80\x94and borrow from\xe2\x80\x94the express provision that is \xe2\x80\x98most analogous to the private 10b\xe2\x80\x935 right of action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 12 (quoting Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.

According to Halliburton, the closest analogueto section 10(b) is section 18(a) of the Act, which cre-ates an express private cause of action allowing inves-tors to recover damages based on misrepresentations made in certain regulatory filings.\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778r(a).  That provision requires an investor to prove that he bought or sold stock \xe2\x80\x9cin reliance upon\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation.  Ibid.

In Basic, the dissenting Justices made the same argument based on section 18(a) that Halliburton presses here.  See 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 257\xe2\x80\x93258 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The Basic majority did not find that argument persuasive then, and Halliburton has given us no new reason to endorse it now.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s primary argument for overruling Basic is that the decision rested on two premises that can no longer withstand scrutiny.  The first premise concerns what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cefficient capital markets hypothesis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Basic stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 246.  From that statement, Halliburton concludes that the Basic Court espoused \xe2\x80\x9ca robust view of market efficiency\xe2\x80\x9d that is no longer tenable, for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98overwhelming empirical evidence\xe2\x80\x99 now \xe2\x80\x98suggests that capital markets are not fundamentally efficient.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 14\xe2\x80\x9316 (quoting Lev &amp; de Villiers, Stock Price Crashes and 10b\xe2\x80\x935 Damages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis, 47 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev 7, 20 (1994)).  To support this contention, Halliburton cites studies purporting to show that \xe2\x80\x9cpublic information is often not incorporated immediately (much less rationally) into market prices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 17; see id., at 16\xe2\x80\x9320.

Rather, in its view, Basic\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental error was to ignore the fact that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98efficiency is not a binary, yes or no question.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 20 (quoting Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 151, 167)).  The markets for some securities are more efficient than the markets for others, and even a single market can process different kinds of information more or less efficiently, depending on how widely the information is disseminated and how easily it is understood.  Brief for Petitioners at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Yet Basic, Halliburton asserts, glossed over these nuances, assuming a false dichotomy that renders the presumption of reliance both underinclusive and overinclusive: A misrepresentation can distort a stock\xe2\x80\x99s market price even in a generally inefficient market, and a misrepresentation can leave a stock\xe2\x80\x99s market price unaffected even in a generally efficient one.  Brief for Petitioners at 21.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms fail to take Basic on its own terms.  Halliburton focuses on the debate among economists about the degree to which the market price of a company\xe2\x80\x99s stock reflects public information about the company\xe2\x80\x94and thus the degree to which an investor can earn an abnormal, above-market return by trading on such information.  See Brief for Financial Economists as Amici Curiae 4\xe2\x80\x9310 (describing the debate).  That debate is not new.  Indeed, the Basic Court acknowledged it and declined to enter the fray, declaring that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e need not determine by adjudication what economists and social scientists have debated through the use of sophisticated statistical analysis and the application of economic the-ory.\xe2\x80\x9d  485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 246\xe2\x80\x93247, n.\xc2\xa024.  To recognize the presumption of reliance, the Court explained, was not \xe2\x80\x9cconclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 248, n.\xc2\xa028.  The Court instead based the presumption on the fairly modest premise that \xe2\x80\x9cmarket professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 247, n.\xc2\xa024.  Basic\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reliance thus does not rest on a \xe2\x80\x9cbinary\xe2\x80\x9d view of market efficiency.  Indeed, in making the presumption rebuttable, Basic recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a matter of proof.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The academic debates discussed by Halliburton have not refuted the modest premise underlying the presumption of reliance.  Even the foremost critics of the efficient-capital-markets hypothesis acknowledge that public information generally affects stock prices.  See, e.g., Shiller, We\xe2\x80\x99ll Share the Honors, and Agree to Disagree, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Oct. 27, 2013, p. BU6 (\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, prices reflect available information\xe2\x80\x9d).  Halliburton also conceded as much in its reply brief and at oral argument.  See Reply Brief 13 (\xe2\x80\x9cmarket prices generally respond to new, material information\xe2\x80\x9d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.  Debates about the precise degree to which stock prices accurately reflect public information are thus largely beside the point.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. price [of a stock] may be inaccurate does not detract from the fact that false statements affect it, and cause loss,\xe2\x80\x9d which is \xe2\x80\x9call that Basic requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schleicher v. Wendt, 618 F.\xc2\xa03d 679, 685 (CA7 2010) (Easterbrook, C. J.).  Even though the efficient capital markets hypothesis may have \xe2\x80\x9cgarnered substantial criticism since Basic,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 6 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), Halliburton has not identified the kind of fundamental shift in economic the-ory that could justify overruling a precedent on the ground that it misunderstood, or has since been overtaken by, economic realities.  Contrast State Oil Co. v. Khan,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 3 (1997)\n, unanimously overruling Albrecht v. Herald Co.,\n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 145 (1968)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Halliburton also contests a second premise underlying the Basic presumption: the notion that investors \xe2\x80\x9cinvest \xe2\x80\x98in reliance on the integrity of [the market] price.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 14 (quoting 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 247; alteration in original).  Halliburton identifies a number of classes of investors for whom \xe2\x80\x9cprice integrity\xe2\x80\x9d is supposedly \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal or irrelevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 14.  The primary example is the value investor, who believes that certain stocks are undervalued or overvalued and attempts to \xe2\x80\x9cbeat the market\xe2\x80\x9d by buying the undervalued stocks and selling the overvalued ones.

See also Brief for Vivendi S.\xc2\xa0A. as Amicus Curiae 3\xe2\x80\x9310 (describing the investment strategies of day trad-ers, volatility arbitragers, and value investors).  If many investors \xe2\x80\x9care indifferent to prices,\xe2\x80\x9d Halliburton contends, then courts should not presume that investors rely on the integrity of those prices and any misrepresentations incorporated into them.

As we recently explained, Basic concluded only that \xe2\x80\x9cit is reasonable to presume that most investors\xe2\x80\x94knowing that they have little hope of outperforming the market in the long run based solely on their analysis of publicly available information\xe2\x80\x94will rely on the security\xe2\x80\x99s market price as an unbiased assessment of the security\xe2\x80\x99s value in light of all public information.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amgen, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (emphasis added).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In any event, there is no reason to suppose that even Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s main counterexample\xe2\x80\x94the value investor\xe2\x80\x94is as indifferent to the integrity of market prices as Halliburton suggests.  Such an investor implicitly relies on the fact that a stock\xe2\x80\x99s market price will eventually reflect material information\xe2\x80\x94how else could the market correction on which his profit depends occur?  To be sure, the value investor \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not believe that the market price accurately reflects public information at the time he transacts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 11.  But to indirectly rely on a misstatement in the sense relevant for the Basic presumption, he need only trade stock based on the belief that the market price will incorporate public information within a reasonable period.  The value investor also presumably tries to estimate how undervalued or overvalued a particular stock is, and such estimates can be skewed by a market price tainted by fraud.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The principle of stare decisis has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special force\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin respect to statutory interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress remains free to alter what we have done.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  John R.

So too with Basic\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reliance.

That is because it provides a way of satisfying the reliance element of the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cause of action.  See, e.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336\n\xe2\x80\x93342 (2005).  As with any other element of that cause of action, Congress may overturnor modify any aspect of our interpretations of the reli-ance requirement, including the Basic presumption it-self.

Yet the Basic presumption, Halliburton asserts, does just the opposite, expanding the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cause of action.  Brief for Petitioners 27\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Not so.  In Central Bank and Stoneridge, we declined to extend Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 liability to entirely new categories of defendants who themselves had not made any material, public misrepresentation.  Such an extension, we explained, would have eviscerated the requirement that a plaintiff prove that he relied on a misrepresentation made by the defendant.  See Central Bank, supra, at 180; Stone-ridge, supra, at 157, 159.  The Basic presumption doesnot eliminate that requirement but rather provides an alternative means of satisfying it.  While the presumption makes it easier for plaintiffs to prove reliance, it does not alter the elements of the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cause of action and thus maintains the action\xe2\x80\x99s original legal scope.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Halliburton also argues that the Basic presumption cannot be reconciled with our recent decisions governing class action certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  Those decisions have made clear that plaintiffs wishing to proceed through a class action must actually prove\xe2\x80\x94not simply plead\xe2\x80\x94that their proposed class satisfies each requirement of Rule 23, including (if applicable) the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10); Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).  According to Halliburton, Basic relieves Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 plaintiffs of that burden, allowing courts to presume that common issues of reliance predominate over individual ones.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That is not the effect of the Basic presumption.  In securities class action cases, the crucial requirement for class certification will usually be the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  The Basic presumption does not relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving\xe2\x80\x94before class certification\xe2\x80\x94that this requirement is met.  Basic instead establishes that a plaintiff satisfies that burden by proving the prerequisites for invoking the presumption\xe2\x80\x94namely, publicity, materiality, market efficiency, and market timing.  The burden of proving those prerequisites still rests with plaintiffs and (with the exception of materiality) must be satisfied before class certification.  Basic does not, in other words, allow plaintiffs simply to plead that common questions of reliance predominate over individual ones, but rather sets forth what they must prove to demonstrate such predominance. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Basic does afford defendants an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance with respect to an individual plaintiff by showing that he did not rely on the integrity of the market price in trading stock.  While this has the effect of \xe2\x80\x9cleav[ing] individualized questions of reliance in the case,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 12, there is no reason to think that these questions will overwhelm common ones and render class certification inappropriate under Rule 23(b)(3).  That the defendant might attempt to pick off the occasional class member here or there through individualized rebuttal does not cause individual questions to predominate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, Halliburton and its amici contend that, by facilitating securities class actions, the Basic presumption produces a number of serious and harmful consequences.  Such class actions, they say, allow plaintiffs to extort large settlements from defendants for meritless claims; punish innocent shareholders, who end up having to pay settlements and judgments; impose excessive costs on businesses; and consume a disproportionately large share of judicial resources.  Brief for Petitioners 39\xe2\x80\x9345.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        These concerns are more appropriately addressed to Congress, which has in fact responded, to some extent, to many of the issues raised by Halliburton and its amici.  Congress has, for example, enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA),\n\n109Stat.\n737, which sought to combat perceived abuses in securities litigation with heightened pleading requirements, limits on damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, a \xe2\x80\x9csafe harbor\xe2\x80\x9d for certain kinds of statements, restrictions on the selection of lead plaintiffs in securities class actions, sanctions for frivolous litigation, and stays of discovery pending motions to dismiss.  See Amgen, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320).  And to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing these restrictions by bringing securities class actions under state law in state court, Congress also enacted the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998,\n\n112Stat.\n3227, which precludes many state law class actions alleging securities fraud.  See Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20).  Such legislation demonstrates Congress\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to consider policy concerns of the sort that Halliburton says should lead us to overrule Basic.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Halliburton proposes two alternatives to overruling Basic that would alleviate what it regards as the decision\xe2\x80\x99s most serious flaws.  The first alternative would require plaintiffs to prove that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation actually affected the stock price\xe2\x80\x94so-called \xe2\x80\x9cprice impact\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in order to invoke the Basic presumption.  It should not be enough, Halliburton contends, for plaintiffs to demonstrate the general efficiency of the market in which the stock traded.  Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s second proposed alternative would allow defendants to rebut the presumption of reliance with evidence of a lack of price impact, not only at the merits stage\xe2\x80\x94which all agree defendants may already do\xe2\x80\x94but also before class certification.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As noted, to invoke the Basic presumption, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known, (2) they were material, (3) the stock traded in an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff traded the stock between when the misrepresentations were made and when the truth was revealed.  See Basic, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248, n. 27; Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Each of these requirements follows from the fraud-on-the-market theory underlying the presumption.  If the misrepresentation was not publicly known, then it could not have distorted the stock\xe2\x80\x99s market price.  So too if the misrepresentation was immaterial\xe2\x80\x94that is, if it would not have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal mix\xe2\x80\x9d of information made available,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Basic, supra, at 231\xe2\x80\x93232 (quoting TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.,\n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438,\n449 (1976)\n)\xe2\x80\x94or if the market in which the stock traded was inefficient.  And if the plaintiff did not buy or sell the stock after the misrepresentation was made but before the truth was revealed, then he could not be said to have acted in reliance on a fraud-tainted price.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The first three prerequisites are directed at price impact\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhether the alleged misrepresentations affected the market price in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d  Halliburton I, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  In the absence of price impact, Basic\xe2\x80\x99s fraud-on-the-market theory and presumption of reliance collapse.  The \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental premise\xe2\x80\x9d underlying the presumption is \xe2\x80\x9cthat an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction.\xe2\x80\x9d  563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  If it was not, then there is \xe2\x80\x9cno grounding for any contention that [the] investor[ ] indirectly relied on th[at] misrepresentation[ ] through [his] reliance on the integrity of the market price.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Halliburton argues that since the Basic presumption hinges on price impact, plaintiffs should be required to prove it directly in order to invoke the presumption.  Proving the presumption\xe2\x80\x99s prerequisites, which are at best an imperfect proxy for price impact, should not suffice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Far from a modest refinement of the Basic presumption, this proposal would radically alter the required showing for the reliance element of the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cause of action.  What is called the Basic presumption actually incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff shows that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation was public and material and that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price.  Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        By requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly, Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would take away the first constituent presumption.  Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s argument for doing so is the same as its primary argument for overruling the Basic presumption altogether: Because market efficiency is not a yes-or-no proposition, a public, material misrepresentation might not affect a stock\xe2\x80\x99s price even in a generally efficient market.  But as explained, Basic never suggested otherwise; that is why it affords defendants an opportunity to rebut the presumption by showing, among other things, that the particular misrepresentation at issue did not affect the stock\xe2\x80\x99s market price.  For the same reasons we declined to completely jettison the Basic presumption, we decline to effectively jettison half of it by revising the prerequisites for invoking it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Even if plaintiffs need not directly prove price impact to invoke the Basic presumption, Halliburton contends that defendants should at least be allowed to defeat the presumption at the class certification stage through evidence that the misrepresentation did not in fact affect the stock price.  We agree.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        There is no dispute that defendants may introduce such evidence at the merits stage to rebut the Basic presumption.  Basic itself \xe2\x80\x9cmade clear that the presumption was just that, and could be rebutted by appropriate evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d including evidence that the asserted misrepresentation (or its correction) did not affect the market price of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s stock.  Halliburton I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5); see Basic, supra, at 248.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Nor is there any dispute that defendants may introduce price impact evidence at the class certification stage, so long as it is for the purpose of countering a plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s showing of market efficiency, rather than directly rebutting the presumption.  As EPJ Fund acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]f course .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. defendants can introduce evidence at class certification of lack of price impact as some evidence that the market is not efficient.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 53.  See also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        After all, plaintiffs themselves can and do introduce evidence of the existence of price impact in connection with \xe2\x80\x9cevent studies\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94regression analyses that seek to show that the market price of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s stock tends to respond to pertinent publicly reported events.  See Brief for Law Professors as Amici Curiae 25\xe2\x80\x9328.  In this case, for example, EPJ Fund submitted an event study of various episodes that might have been expected to affect the price of Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s stock, in order to demonstrate that the market for that stock takes account of material, public information about the company.  See App. 217\xe2\x80\x93230 (describing the results of the study).  The episodes examined by EPJ Fund\xe2\x80\x99s event study included one of the alleged misrepresentations that form the basis of the Fund\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  See id., at 230, 343\xe2\x80\x93344.  See also In\xc2\xa0re Xcelera.com Securities Litigation, 430 F.\xc2\xa03d 503, 513 (CA1 2005) (event study included effect of misrepresentation challenged in the case).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Defendants\xe2\x80\x94like plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94may accordingly submit price impact evidence prior to class certification.  What defendants may not do, EPJ Fund insists and the Court of Appeals held, is rely on that same evidence prior to class certification for the particular purpose of rebutting the presumption altogether.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This restriction makes no sense, and can readily lead to bizarre results.  Suppose a defendant at the certification stage submits an event study looking at the impact on the price of its stock from six discrete events, in an effort to refute the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim of general market efficiency.  All agree the defendant may do this.  Suppose one of the six events is the specific misrepresentation asserted by the plaintiffs.  All agree that this too is perfectly acceptable.  Now suppose the district court determines that, despite the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s study, the plaintiff has carried its burden to prove market efficiency, but that the evidence shows no price impact with respect to the specific misrepresentation challenged in the suit.  The evidence at the certification stage thus shows an efficient market, on which the alleged misrepresentation had no price impact.  And yet under EPJ Fund\xe2\x80\x99s view, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 action should be certified and proceed as a class action (with all that entails), even though the fraud-on-the-market theory does not apply and common reliance thus cannot be presumed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Such a result is inconsistent with Basic\xe2\x80\x99s own logic.  Under Basic\xe2\x80\x99s fraud-on-the-market theory, market efficiency and the other prerequisites for invoking the presumption constitute an indirect way of showing price impact.  As explained, it is appropriate to allow plaintiffs to rely on this indirect proxy for price impact, rather than requiring them to prove price impact directly, given Basic\xe2\x80\x99s rationales for recognizing a presumption of reliance in the first place.  See supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, 16\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But an indirect proxy should not preclude direct evidence when such evidence is available.  As we explained in Basic, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the price received (or paid) by the plaintiff .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. will be sufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe basis for finding that the fraud had been transmitted through market price would be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d  485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248.  And without the presumption of reliance, a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 suit cannot proceed as a class action: Each plaintiff would have to prove reliance individually, so common issues would not \xe2\x80\x9cpredominate\xe2\x80\x9d over individual ones, as required by Rule 23(b)(3).  Id., at 242.  Price impact is thus an essential precondition for any Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 class action.  While Basic allows plaintiffs to establish that precondition indirectly, it does not require courts to ignore a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s direct, more salient evidence showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock\xe2\x80\x99s market price and, consequently, thatthe Basic presumption does not apply.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals relied on our decision in Amgen in holding that Halliburton could not introduce evidence of lack of price impact at the class certification stage.  The question in Amgen was whether plaintiffs could be required to prove (or defendants be permitted to disprove) materiality before class certification.  Even though materiality is a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presumption, we held that it should be left to the merits stage, because it does not bear on the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  We reasoned that materiality is an objective issue susceptible to common, classwide proof.  568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  We also noted that a failure to prove materiality would necessarily defeat every plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim on the merits; it would not simply preclude invocation of the presumption and thereby cause individual questions of reliance to predominate over common ones.  Ibid.  See also id., at ___ (slip op., at 17\xe2\x80\x9318).  In this latter respect, we explained, materiality differs from the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites, neither of which is necessary to prove a Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 claim on the merits.  Id., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 16\xe2\x80\x9318).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        EPJ Fund argues that much of the foregoing could be said of price impact as well.  Fair enough.  But price impact differs from materiality in a crucial respect.  Given that the other Basic prerequisites must still be proved at the class certification stage, the common issue of materiality can be left to the merits stage without risking the certification of classes in which individual issues will end up overwhelming common ones.  And because materiality is a discrete issue that can be resolved in isolation from the other prerequisites, it can be wholly confined to the merits stage.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Price impact is different.  The fact that a misrepresentation \xe2\x80\x9cwas reflected in the market price at the time of [the] transaction\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that it had price impact\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9cBasic\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental premise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Halliburton I, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  It thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class certification stage.  That is why, if reliance is to be shown through the Basic presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be proved before class certification.  Without proof of those prerequisites, the fraud-on-the-market theory underlying the presumption completely collapses, rendering class certification inappropriate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But as explained, publicity and market efficiency are nothing more than prerequisites for an indirect showing of price impact.  There is no dispute that at least such indirect proof of price impact \xe2\x80\x9cis needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the class will \xe2\x80\x98predominate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Amgen, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis deleted); see id., at ___ (slip op., at 16\xe2\x80\x9317).  That is so even though such proof is also highly relevant at the merits stage.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our choice in this case, then, is not between allowing price impact evidence at the class certification stage or relegating it to the merits.  Evidence of price impact will be before the court at the certification stage in any event.  The choice, rather, is between limiting the price impact inquiry before class certification to indirect evidence, or allowing consideration of direct evidence as well.  As explained, we see no reason to artificially limit the inquiry at the certification stage to indirect evidence of price impact.  Defendants may seek to defeat the Basic presumption at that stage through direct as well as indirect price impact evidence.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        More than 25 years ago, we held that plaintiffs could satisfy the reliance element of the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cause of action by invoking a presumption that a public, material misrepresentation will distort the price of stock traded in an efficient market, and that anyone who purchases the stock at the market price may be considered to have done so in reliance on the misrepresentation.  We adhere to that decision and decline to modify the prerequisites for invoking the presumption of reliance.  But to maintain the consistency of the presumption with the class certification requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, defendants must be afforded an opportunity before class certification to defeat the presumption through evidence that an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the market price of the stock.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Because the courts below denied Halliburton that opportunity, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970954">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 13\xe2\x80\x93317</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">HALLIBURTON CO., et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS v.

Levinson,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224 (1988)\n, demonstrates the wisdom of this rule.  Basic presented the question how investors must prove the reliance element of the implied Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cause of action\xe2\x80\x94the requirement that the plaintiff buy or sell stock in reliance on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misstatement\xe2\x80\x94when they transact on modern, impersonal securities exchanges.  Were the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 action statu-tory, the Court could have resolved this question by interpreting the statutory language.  Without a statute to interpret for guidance, however, the Court began instead with a particular policy \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d: for investors in impersonal markets, the traditional reliance requirement was hard to prove and impossible to prove as common among plaintiffs bringing 10b\xe2\x80\x935 class-action suits.  Id., at 242, 245.  With the task thus framed as \xe2\x80\x9cresol[ving]\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98problem\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rather than interpreting statutory text, id., at 242, the Court turned to nascent economic theory and naked intuitions about investment behavior in its efforts to fashion a new, easier way to meet the reliance requirement.  The result was an evidentiary presumption, based on a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud on the market\xe2\x80\x9d theory, that paved the way for class actions under Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Today we are asked to determine whether Basic was correctly decided.  The Court suggests that it was, and that stare decisis demands that we preserve it.  I disagree.  Logic, economic realities, and our subsequent jurisprudence have undermined the foundations of the Basic presumption, and stare decisis cannot prop up the fa\xc3\xa7ade that remains.

To prove reliance, the plaintiff must show \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98transaction causation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., that the specific misstatement induced \xe2\x80\x9cthe investor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to engage in the transaction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Erica P.

Such proof \xe2\x80\x9censures that there is a proper \xe2\x80\x98connection between a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation and a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, that the plaintiff has not just lost money as a result of the misstatement, but that he was actually defrauded by it.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4); see also Dirks v. SEC,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 646\n\xe2\x80\x93667, n. 27 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o constitute a violation of Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, there must be fraud.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  [T]here always are winners and losers; but those who have \xe2\x80\x98lost\xe2\x80\x99 have not necessarily been defrauded\xe2\x80\x9d).  Without that connection, Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 is reduced to a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98scheme of investor\xe2\x80\x99s insurance,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because a plaintiff could recover whenever the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misstatement distorted the stock price\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether the misstatement had actually tricked the plaintiff into buying (or selling) the stock in the first place.  Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336,\n345 (2005)\n (quoting Basic, supra, at 252 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d reliance element requires a plaintiff to \xe2\x80\x9csho[w] that he was aware of a company\xe2\x80\x99s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. based on that spe-cific misrepresentation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Erica P. John Fund, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4).  But investors who purchase stock from third parties on impersonal exchanges (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange) often will not be aware of any particular statement made by the issuer of the security, and therefore cannot establish that they transacted based on a specific misrepresentation.  Nor is the traditional reliance requirement amenable to class treatment; the inherently individualized nature of the reliance inquiry renders it impossible for a 10b\xe2\x80\x935 plaintiff to prove that common questions predominate over individual ones, making class certification improper.  See Basic, supra, at 242; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Citing these difficulties of proof and class certification, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242, 245, the Basic Court dispensed with the traditional reliance requirement in favor of a new one based on the fraud-on-the-market theory.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The new version of reliance had two related parts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, Basic suggested that plaintiffs could meet the reliance requirement \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98indirectly,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 245.  The Court reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ideally, [the market] transmits information to the investor in the processed form of a market price.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 244.  An investor could thus be said to have \xe2\x80\x9crelied\xe2\x80\x9d on a specific misstatement if (1) the market had incorporated that statement into the market price of the security, and (2) the investor then bought or sold that security \xe2\x80\x9cin reliance on the integrity of the [market] price,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 247, i.e., based on his belief that the market price \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reflect[ed]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the stock\xe2\x80\x99s underlying \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98value,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 244.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, Basic created a presumption that this \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d form of \xe2\x80\x9creliance\xe2\x80\x9d had been proved.  Based primarily on certain assumptions about economic theory and investor behavior, Basic afforded plaintiffs who traded in efficient markets an evidentiary presumption that both steps of the novel reliance requirement had been satisfied\xe2\x80\x94that (1) the market had incorporated the specific misstatement into the market price of the security, and (2) the plaintiff did transact in reliance on the integrity of that price.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Id., at 247.  A defendant was ostensibly entitled to rebut the presumption by putting forth evidence that either of those steps was absent.  Id., at 248.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Basic\xe2\x80\x99s reimagined reliance requirement was a mistake, and the passage of time has compounded its failings.  First, the Court based both parts of the presumption of reliance on a questionable understanding of disputed economic theory and flawed intuitions about investor behavior.  Second, Basic\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable presumption is at odds with our subsequent Rule 23 cases, which require plaintiffs seeking class certification to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98affirmatively demonstrate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d certification requirements like the predominance of common questions.  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10)).  Finally, Basic\xe2\x80\x99s presumption that investors rely on the integrity of the market price is virtually irrebuttable in practice, which means that the \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d reliance element effectively exists in name only.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Basic based the presumption of reliance on two factual assumptions. The first assumption was that, in a \xe2\x80\x9cwell-developed market,\xe2\x80\x9d public statements are generally \xe2\x80\x9creflected\xe2\x80\x9d in the market price of securities.  485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 247.  The second was that investors in such markets transact \xe2\x80\x9cin reliance on the integrity of that price.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In other words, the Court created a presumption that a plaintiff had met the two-part, fraud-on-the-market version of the reliance requirement because, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense and probability\xe2\x80\x9d suggested that each of those parts would be met.  Id., at 246.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In reality, both of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s key assumptions are highly contestable and do not provide the necessary support for Basic\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reliance.  The first assumption\xe2\x80\x94that public statements are \xe2\x80\x9creflected\xe2\x80\x9d in the market price\xe2\x80\x94was grounded in an economic theory that hasgarnered substantial criticism since Basic.  The second as-sumption\xe2\x80\x94that investors categorically rely on the integrity of the market price\xe2\x80\x94is simply wrong.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s first assumption was that \xe2\x80\x9cmost publicly available information\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including public misstatements\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis reflected in [the] market price\xe2\x80\x9d of a security.  Id., at 247.  The Court grounded that assumption in \xe2\x80\x9cempirical studies\xe2\x80\x9d testing a then-nascent economic theory known as the efficient capital markets hypothesis.  Id., at 246\xe2\x80\x93247.  Specifically, the Court relied upon the \xe2\x80\x9csemi-strong\xe2\x80\x9d version of that theory, which posits that the average investor cannot earn above-market returns (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cbeat the market\xe2\x80\x9d) in an efficient market by trading on the basis of publicly available information.  See, e.g., Stout, The Mechanisms of Market Inefficiency: An Introduction to the New Finance, 28 J. Corp. L. 635, 640, and n. 24 (2003) (citing Fama, Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work, 25 J. Finance 383, 388 (1970)).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  The upshot of the hypothesis is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe market price of shares traded on well-developed markets [will] reflec[t] all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Basic, supra, at 246.  At the time of Basic, this version of the efficient capital markets hypothesis was \xe2\x80\x9cwidely accepted.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Dunbar &amp; Heller 463\xe2\x80\x93464.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This view of market efficiency has since lost its luster.  See, e.g., Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 151, 175 (\xe2\x80\x9cDoubts about the strength and pervasiveness of market efficiency are much greater today than they were in the mid-1980s\xe2\x80\x9d).  As it turns out, even \xe2\x80\x9cwell-developed\xe2\x80\x9d markets (like the New York Stock Exchange) do not uniformly incorporate information into market prices with high speed.  \xe2\x80\x9c[F]riction in accessing public information\xe2\x80\x9d and the presence of \xe2\x80\x9cprocessing costs\xe2\x80\x9d means that \xe2\x80\x9cnot all public information will be impounded in a security\xe2\x80\x99s price with the same alacrity, or perhaps with any quickness at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cox, Understanding Causation in Private Securities Lawsuits: Building on Amgen, 66 Vand. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1719, 1732 (2013) (hereinafter Cox).  For example, information that is easily digestible (merger announcements or stock splits) or especially prominent (Wall Street Journal articles) may be incorporated quickly, while information that is broadly applicable or technical (Securities and Exchange Commission filings) may be incorporated slowly or even ignored.  See Stout, supra, at 653\xe2\x80\x93656; see e.g., In\xc2\xa0re Merck &amp; Co. Securities Litigation, 432 F.\xc2\xa03d 261, 263\xe2\x80\x93265 (CA3 2005) (a Wall Street Journal article caused a steep decline in the company\xe2\x80\x99s stock price even though the same information was contained in an earlier SEC disclosure).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Further, and more importantly, \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming empirical evidence\xe2\x80\x9d now suggests that even when markets do incorporate public information, they often fail to do so accurately.

U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 135, 141 (2002); Dunbar &amp; Heller 476\xe2\x80\x93483.  Such anomalies make it difficult to tell whether, at any given moment, a stock\xe2\x80\x99s price accurately reflects its value as indicated by all publicly available information.  In sum, economists now understand that the price impact Basic assumed would happen reflexively is actually far from certain even in \xe2\x80\x9cwell-developed\xe2\x80\x9d markets.  Thus, Basic\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense and probability\xe2\x80\x9d support a presumption of reliance rests on shaky footing.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Basic Court also grounded the presumption of reliance in a second assumption: that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.\xe2\x80\x9d  485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 247.  In other words, the Court assumed that investors transact based on the belief that the market price accurately reflects the underlying \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98value\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the security.  See id., at 244 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[P]urchasers generally rely on the price of the stock as a reflection of its value\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Basic Court appears to have adopted this assumption about investment behavior based only on what it believed to be \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 246.  The Court found it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98hard to imagine that there ever is a buyer or seller who does not rely on market integrity.  Who would knowingly roll the dice in a crooked crap game?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 246\xe2\x80\x93247.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s rather superficial analysis does not withstand scrutiny.  It cannot be seriously disputed that a great many investors do not buy or sell stock based on a belief that the stock\xe2\x80\x99s price accurately reflects its value.  Many investors in fact trade for the opposite reason\xe2\x80\x94that is, because they think the market has under- or overvalued the stock, and they believe they can profit from that mispricing.  Id., at 256 (opinion of White, J.); see, e.g., Macey, The Fraud on the Market Theory: Some Preliminary Issues, 74 Cornell L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 923, 925 (1989) (The \xe2\x80\x9copposite\xe2\x80\x9d of Basic\xe2\x80\x99s assumption appears to be true; some investors \xe2\x80\x9cattempt to locate undervalued stocks in an effort to \xe2\x80\x98beat the market\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in essence betting that the market .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is in fact inefficient\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, securities transactions often take place because the transacting parties disagree on the security\xe2\x80\x99s value.  See, e.g., Stout, Are Stock Markets Costly Casinos? Disagreement, Mar-ket Failure, and Securities Regulation, 81 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev.611, 619 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]vailable evidence suggests that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in-vestor disagreement inspires the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of equities transactions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Other investors trade for reasons entirely unrelated to price\xe2\x80\x94for instance, to address changing liquidity needs, tax concerns, or portfolio balancing requirements.  See id., at 657\xe2\x80\x93658; see also Cox 1739 (investors may purchase \xe2\x80\x9cdue to portfolio rebalancing arising from its obeisance to an indexing strategy\xe2\x80\x9d).  These investment decisions\xe2\x80\x94made with indifference to price and thus without regard for price \xe2\x80\x9cintegrity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are at odds with Basic\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of what motivates investment decisions.  In short, Basic\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that all investors rely in common on \xe2\x80\x9cprice integrity\xe2\x80\x9d is simply wrong.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority tries (but fails) to reconcile Basic\xe2\x80\x99s assumption about investor behavior with the reality that many investors do not behave in the way Basic assumed.  It first asserts that Basic rested only on the more modest view that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98most investors\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rely on the integrity of a security\xe2\x80\x99s market price.

That gloss is difficult to square with Basic\xe2\x80\x99s plain language: \xe2\x80\x9cAn investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.\xe2\x80\x9d  Basic, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 247; see also id., at 246\xe2\x80\x93247 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]t is hard to imagine that there ever is a buyer or seller who does not rely on market integrity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  In any event, neither Basic nor the majority offers anything more than a judicial hunch as evidence that even \xe2\x80\x9cmost\xe2\x80\x9d investors rely on price integrity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority also suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason to suppose\xe2\x80\x9d that investors who buy stock they believe to be undervalued are \xe2\x80\x9cindifferent to the integrity of market prices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  Such \xe2\x80\x9cvalue investor[s],\xe2\x80\x9d according to the majority, \xe2\x80\x9cimplicitly rel[y] on the fact that a stock\xe2\x80\x99s market price will eventually reflect material information\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpresumably tr[y] to estimate how undervalued or overvalued a particular stock is\xe2\x80\x9d by reference to the market price.  Ibid.  Whether the majority\xe2\x80\x99s unsupported claims about the thought processes of hypothetical investors are accurate or not, they are surely beside the point.  Whatever else an investor believes about the market, he simply does not \xe2\x80\x9crely on the integrity of the market price\xe2\x80\x9d if he does not believe that the market price accurately reflects public information at the time he transacts.  That is, an investor cannot claim that a public misstatement induced his transaction by distorting the market price if he did not buy at that price while believing that it accurately incorporated that public information.  For that sort of investor, Basic\xe2\x80\x99s critical fiction falls apart.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Basic\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reliance also conflicts with our more recent cases clarifying Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s class-certification requirements.  Those cases instruct that \xe2\x80\x9ca party seeking to maintain a class action \xe2\x80\x98must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance\xe2\x80\x99 with Rule 23.\xe2\x80\x9d  Comcast, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).

Under Basic, plaintiffs who invoke the presumption of reliance (by proving its predicates) are deemed to have met the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  See ante, at 14; Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6) (Basic \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitates class certification by recognizing a rebuttable presumption of classwide reliance\xe2\x80\x9d); Basic, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242, 250 (holding that the District Court appropriately certified the class based on the presumption of reliance).  But, invoking the Basic presumption does not actually prove that individual questions of reliance will not overwhelm the common questions in the case.  Basic still requires a showing that the individual investor bought or sold in reliance on the integrity of the market price and, crucially, permits defendants to rebut the presumption by producing evidence that individual plaintiffs do not meet that description.  See id., at 249 (\xe2\x80\x9cPetitioners .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could rebut the presumption of reliance as to plaintiffs who would have divested themselves of their Basic shares without relying on the integrity of the market\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, by its own terms, Basic entitles defendants to ask each class member whether he traded in reliance on the integrity of the market price.  That inquiry, like the traditional reliance inquiry, is inherently individualized; questions about the trading strategies of individual investors will not generate \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Wal-Mart Stores, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10).  See supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x939; see also Cox 1736, n. 55 (Basic\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that defendants could rebut the presumption \xe2\x80\x9cby proof the investor would have traded anyway appears to require individual inquiries into reliance\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Basic thus exempts Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 plaintiffs from Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s proof requirement.  Plaintiffs who invoke the presumption of reliance are deemed to have shown predominance as a matter of law, even though the resulting rebuttable presumption leaves individualized questions of reliance in the case and predominance still unproved.  Needless to say, that exemption was beyond the Basic Court\xe2\x80\x99s power to grant.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It would be bad enough if Basic merely provided an end-run around Rule 23.  But in practice, the so-called \xe2\x80\x9crebuttable presumption\xe2\x80\x9d is largely irrebuttable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Basic Court ostensibly afforded defendants an opportunity to rebut the presumption by providing evidence that either aspect of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s fraud-on-the-market reliance\xe2\x80\x94price impact, or reliance on the integrity of the market price\xe2\x80\x94is missing.  485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248\xe2\x80\x93249.  As it turns out, however, the realities of class-action procedure make rebuttal based on an individual plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s lack of reliance virtually impossible.  At the class-certification stage, rebuttal is only directed at the class representatives, which means that counsel only needs to find one class member who can withstand the challenge.  See Grundfest, Damages and Reliance Under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 69 Bus. Lawyer 307, 362 (2014).  After class certification, courts have refused to allow defendants to challenge any plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the integrity of the market price prior to a determination on classwide liability.  See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (collecting cases rejecting postcertification attempts to rebut individual class members\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on price integrity as not pertinent to classwide liability).  One search for rebuttals on individual-reliance grounds turned up only six cases out of the thousands of Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 actions brought since Basic.  Grundfest, supra, at 360.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The apparent unavailability of this form of rebuttal has troubling implications.  Because the presumption is conclusive in practice with respect to investors\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on price integrity, even Basic\xe2\x80\x99s watered-down reliance requirement has been effectively eliminated.  Once the presumption attaches, the reliance element is no longer an obstacle to prevailing on the claim, even though many class members will not have transacted in reliance on price integrity, see supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  And without a func-tional reliance requirement, the \xe2\x80\x9cessential element\xe2\x80\x9d that ensures the plaintiff has actually been defrauded, see Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 159, Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 becomes the very \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98scheme of investor\xe2\x80\x99s insurance\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the rebuttable presumption was supposed to prevent.

Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 130,\n139 (2008)\n; some internal quotation marks omitted).  But Basic, of course, has nothing to do with statutory interpretation.  The case concerned a judge-made evidentiary presumption for a judge-made element of the implied 10b\xe2\x88\x925 private cause of action, itself \xe2\x80\x9ca judicial construct that Congress did not enact in the text of the relevant statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stoneridge, supra, at 164.  We have not afforded stare decisis \xe2\x80\x9cspecial force\xe2\x80\x9d outside the context of statu-tory interpretation, see Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n. 6 (2014) (Thomas,\xc2\xa0J. dissenting) (slip op., at 15, n.\xc2\xa06 and for good reason.  In statutory cases, it is perhaps plausible that Congress watches over its enactments and will step in to fix our mistakes, so we may leave to Congress the judgment whether the interpretive question is better left \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98settled\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98settled right,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc.,\n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409,\n424 (1986)\n.  But this rationale is untenable when it comes to judge-made law like \xe2\x80\x9cimplied\xe2\x80\x9d private causes of action, which we retain a duty to superintend.  See, e.g., Exxon Shipping Co. v.

Thus, when we err in areas of judge-made law, we ought to presume that Congress expects us to correct our own mistakes\xe2\x80\x94not the other way around.  That duty is especially clear in the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 context, where we have said that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he federal courts have accepted and exercised the principal responsibility for the continuing elaboration of the scope of the 10b\xe2\x80\x935 right and the definition of the duties it imposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Musick, Peeler &amp; Garrett v.

Since Basic, Congress has enacted two major securities laws: the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA),\n\n109Stat.\n737, and the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA),\n\n112Stat.\n3227.  The PSLRA \xe2\x80\x9csought to combat perceived abuses in securities litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 15, and SLUSA prevented plaintiffs from avoiding the PSLRA\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions by bringing class actions in state court, ibid.  Neither of these Acts touched the reliance element of the implied Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 private cause of action or the Basic presumption.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Contrary to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument (the majority wisely skips this next line of defense), we cannot draw from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 silence on this matter an inference that Congress approved of Basic.  To begin with, it is inappropriate to give weight to \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 unenacted opinion\xe2\x80\x9d when construing judge-made doctrines, because doing so allows the Court to create law and then \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively codif[y]\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cbased only on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to address it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bay Mills, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 14).  Our Constitution, however, demands that laws be passed by Congress and signed by the President.  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa77.  Adherence to Basic based on congressional inaction would invert that requirement by insulating error from correction merely because Congress failed to pass a law on the subject.  Cf. Patterson, supra, at 175, n.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongressional inaction cannot amend a duly enacted statute\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At any rate, arguments from legislative inaction are speculative at best.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cimpossible to assert with any degree of assurance that congressional failure to act represents\xe2\x80\x9d affirmative congressional approval of\xe2\x80\x99 one of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bay Mills, supra, at ___ (Thomas,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Patterson, supra, at 175, n. 1).  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because it is indeterminate; \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Central Bank of Denver, N.

If the Act did not ratify even the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 private cause of action, it cannot be read to ratify sub silentio the presumption of reliance this Court affixed to that action.  Further, the PSLRA and SLUSA operate to curtail abuses of various private causes of action under our securities laws\xe2\x80\x94hardly an indication that Congress approved of Basic\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of the 10b\xe2\x80\x935 private cause of action.
