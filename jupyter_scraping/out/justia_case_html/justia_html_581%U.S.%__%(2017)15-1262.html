Prior to that redistricting, neither district had a majority black voting-age population (BVAP), but both consistently elected the candidates preferred by most African-American voters.  The new map significantly altered both District 1 and District 12.  The State needed to add almost 100,000 people to District 1 to comply with the one-person-one-vote principle, and it chose to take most of those people from heavily black areas of Durham\xe2\x80\x94increasing the district\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP from 48.6% to 52.7%.  The State also reconfigured District 12, increasing its BVAP from 43.8% to 50.7%.  Registered voters in those districts (here called \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d) filed suit against North Carolina officials (collectively, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Carolina\xe2\x80\x9d), complaining of impermissible racial gerrymanders.  A three-judge District Court held both districts unconstitutional.  It found that racial considerations predominated in the drawing of District 1\xe2\x80\x99s lines and rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s claim that this action was justified by the VRA.  As for District 12, the court again found that race predominated, and it explained that the State made no attempt to justify its attention to race in designing that district.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held:</i></p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s victory in a similar state-court lawsuit does not dictate the disposition of this case or alter the applicable standard of review.  Before this case was filed, a state trial court rejected a claim by several civil rights groups that Districts 1 and 12 were unlawful racial gerrymanders.  The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed that decision under the state-court equivalent of clear error review.  The State claims that the plaintiffs are members of the same organizations that brought the earlier case, and thus precluded from raising the same questions anew.  But the State never satisfied the District Court that the alleged affiliation really existed.  And because the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s factual finding was reasonable, it defeats North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to argue for claim or issue preclusion here.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The State\xe2\x80\x99s backup argument about the proper standard of review also falls short.  The rule that a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings are reviewed only for clear error contains no exception for findings that diverge from those made in another court.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).  Although the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is certainly relevant, the premise of clear error review is that there are often \xe2\x80\x9ctwo permissible views of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Bessemer City</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 564\n.  Even assuming that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s findings capture one such view, the only question here is whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment represents another.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The District Court did not err in concluding that race furnished the predominant rationale for District 1\xe2\x80\x99s redesign and that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in complying with the VRA could not justify that consideration of race.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The record shows that the State purposefully established a racial target for the district and that the target \xe2\x80\x9chad a direct and significant impact\xe2\x80\x9d on the district\xe2\x80\x99s configuration, <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U. S., at ___, subordinating other districting criteria.  Faced with this body of evidence, the District Court did not clearly err in finding that race predominated in drawing District 1; indeed, it could hardly have concluded anything but.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s use of race as the predominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.  The State argues that it had good reasons to believe that it had to draw a majority-minority district to avoid liability for vote dilution under \xc2\xa72 of the VRA.  <i>Thornburg</i> v. <i>Gingles</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30\n, identifies three threshold conditions for proving such a vote-dilution claim: (1) A \xe2\x80\x9cminority group\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority\xe2\x80\x9d in some reasonably configured legislative district, <i>id.,</i> at 50; (2) the minority group must be \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically cohesive,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 51; and (3) a district\xe2\x80\x99s white majority must \xe2\x80\x9cvote[\xc2\xa0] sufficiently as a bloc\xe2\x80\x9d to usually \xe2\x80\x9cdefeat the minority\xe2\x80\x99s preferred candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid</i>.  If a State has good reason to think that all three of these conditions are met, then so too it has good reason to believe that \xc2\xa72 requires drawing a majority-minority district.  But if not, then not.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Here, electoral history provided no evidence that a \xc2\xa72 plaintiff could demonstrate the third <i>Gingles </i>prerequisite.  For nearly 20 years before the new plan\xe2\x80\x99s adoption, African-Americans made up less than a majority of District 1\xe2\x80\x99s voters, but their preferred candidates scored consistent victories.  District 1 thus functioned as a \xe2\x80\x9ccrossover\xe2\x80\x9d district, in which members of the majority help a \xe2\x80\x9clarge enough\xe2\x80\x9d minority to elect its candidate of choice.  <i>Bartlett</i> v. <i>Strickland</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n (plurality opinion).  So experience gave the State no reason to think that the VRA required it to ramp up District 1\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The State counters that because it needed to substantially increase District 1\xe2\x80\x99s population, the question facing the state mapmakers was not whether the <i>then-existing</i> District 1 violated \xc2\xa72, but whether the <i>future</i> District 1 would do so if drawn without regard to race.  But that reasoning, taken alone, cannot justify the State\xe2\x80\x99s race-based redesign of the district.  Most important, the State points to no meaningful legislative inquiry into the key issue it identifies: whether a new, enlarged District 1, created without a focus on race, could lead to \xc2\xa72 liability.  To have a strong basis to conclude that \xc2\xa72 demands race-based measures to augment a district\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP, the State must evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish the <i>Gingles</i> preconditions in a new district created without those measures.  Nothing in the legislative record here fits that description.  And that is no accident:  The redistricters believed that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Strickland </i>mandated a 50%-plus BVAP in District 1.  They apparently reasoned that if, as <i>Strickland </i>held, \xc2\xa72 does not <i>require</i> crossover districts (for groups insufficiently large under <i>Gingles</i>), then \xc2\xa72 also cannot be <i>satisfied by </i>crossover districts (for groups meeting <i>Gingles</i>\xe2\x80\x99<i> </i>size condition).  But, as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa72 jurisprudence makes clear, unless <i>each </i>of the three <i>Gingles</i> prerequisites is established, \xe2\x80\x9cthere neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Growe</i> v. <i>Emison</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 25\n.  North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s belief that it was compelled to redraw District 1 (a successful crossover district) as a majority-minority district thus rested on a pure error of law.  Accordingly, the Court upholds the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the State\xe2\x80\x99s use of race as the predominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">3.\xc2\xa0The District Court also did not clearly err by finding that race predominated in the redrawing of District 12.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9334.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The district\xe2\x80\x99s legality turns solely on which of two possible reasons predominantly explains its reconfiguration.  The plaintiffs contended at trial that North Carolina intentionally increased District 12\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP in the name of ensuring preclearance under \xc2\xa75 of the VRA.  According to the State, by contrast, the mapmakers moved voters in and out of the district as part of a \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly\xe2\x80\x9d political gerrymander, without regard to race.  After hearing evidence supporting both parties\xe2\x80\x99 accounts, the District Court accepted the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses special challenges for a trial court, which must make \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a sensitive inquiry\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d into all \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98circumstantial and direct evidence of intent\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to assess whether the plaintiffs have proved that race, not politics, drove a district\xe2\x80\x99s lines.  <i>Hunt</i> v. <i>Cromartie</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 541\n (<i>Cromartie I</i>).  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s job is different\xe2\x80\x94and generally easier.  It affirms a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s factual finding as to racial predominance so long as the finding is \xe2\x80\x9cplausible\xe2\x80\x9d; it reverses only when \xe2\x80\x9cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 573\xe2\x80\x93574.  In assessing a finding\xe2\x80\x99s plausibility, moreover, the Court gives singular deference to a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgments about the credibility of witnesses.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).  Applying those principles here, the evidence at trial\xe2\x80\x94including live witness testimony subject to credibility determinations\xe2\x80\x94adequately supports the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for District 12\xe2\x80\x99s reconfiguration.  And contrary to the State\xe2\x80\x99s view, the court had no call to dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs did not proffer an alternative design for District 12.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0By slimming the district and adding a couple of knobs to its snakelike body, North Carolina added 35,000 African-Americans and subtracted 50,000 whites, turning District 12 into a majority-minority district.  State Senator Robert Rucho and State Representative David Lewis\xe2\x80\x94the chairs of the two committees responsible for preparing the revamped plan\xe2\x80\x94publicly stated that racial considerations lay behind District 12\xe2\x80\x99s augmented BVAP.  Specifically, Rucho and Lewis explained that because part of Guilford County, a jurisdiction covered by \xc2\xa75 of the VRA, lay in the district, they had increased the district\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP to ensure preclearance of the plan.  Dr. Thomas Hofeller, their hired mapmaker, confirmed that intent.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance submission to the Justice Department indicated a similar determination to concentrate black voters in District 12.  And, in testimony that the District Court found credible, Congressman Mel Watt testified that Rucho disclosed a majority-minority target to him in 2011.  Hofeller testified that he had drawn District 12\xe2\x80\x99s lines based on political data, and that he checked the racial data only <i>after</i> he drew a politics-based line between adjacent areas in Guilford County.  But the District Court disbelieved Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s asserted indifference to the new district\xe2\x80\x99s racial composition, pointing to his contrary deposition testimony and a significant contradiction in his trial testimony.  Finally, an expert report lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 case, showing that, regardless of party, a black voter in the region was three to four times more likely than a white voter to cast a ballot within District 12\xe2\x80\x99s borders.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that all this evidence proved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error review.  Maybe this Court would have evaluated the testimony differently had it presided over the trial; or then again, maybe it would not have.  Either way, the Court is far from having a \xe2\x80\x9cdefinite and firm conviction\xe2\x80\x9d that the District Court made a mistake in concluding from the record before it that racial considerations predominated in District 12\xe2\x80\x99s design<i>.  </i>Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Finally, North Carolina argues that when race and politics are competing explanations of a district\xe2\x80\x99s lines, plaintiffs must introduce an alternative map that achieves a State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted political goals while improving racial balance.  Such a map can serve as key evidence in a race-versus-politics dispute, but it is hardly the <i>only </i>means to disprove a State\xe2\x80\x99s contention that politics drove a district\xe2\x80\x99s lines.  In this case, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 introduction of mostly direct and some circumstantial evidence gave the District Court a sufficient basis, sans any map, to resolve the race-or-politics question.  Although a plaintiff will sometimes need an alternative map, as a practical matter, to make his case, such a map is merely an evidentiary tool to show that an equal protection violation has occurred; neither its presence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering claim.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">North Carolina claims that a passage of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <i>Cromartie II</i> makes an alternative map essential in cases like this one, but the reasoning of <i>Cromartie II</i> belies that reading.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or justify the categorical rule that the State claims to find there, and the entire thrust of the opinion runs counter to an inflexible counter-map requirement.  Rightly understood, the passage on which the State relies had a different and narrower point: Given the weak evidence of a racial gerrymander offered in <i>Cromartie II</i>, only maps that would <i>actually</i> show what the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 had not could carry the day.  This case, in contrast, turned not on the possibility of creating more optimally constructed districts, but on direct evidence of the General Assembly\xe2\x80\x99s intent in creating the actual District 12\xe2\x80\x94including many hours of trial testimony subject to credibility determinations.  That evidence, the District Court plausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 burden of debunking North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s politics defense.

In its current incarnation, District 1 is anchored in the northeastern part of the State, with appendages stretching both south and west (the latter into Durham).  District 12 begins in the south-central part of the State (where it takes in a large part of Charlotte) and then travels northeast, zig-zagging much of the way to the State\xe2\x80\x99s northern border.  (Maps showing the districts are included in an appendix to this opinion.)  Both have quite the history before this Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We first encountered the two districts, in their 1992 versions, in <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630 (1993)\n.  There, we held that voters stated an equal protection claim by alleging that Districts 1 and 12 were unwarranted racial gerrymanders.  See <i>id.</i>, at 642, 649.  After a remand to the District Court, the case arrived back at our door.  See <i>Shaw II</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 899\n.  That time, we dismissed the challenge to District 1 for lack of standing, but struck down District 12.  The design of that \xe2\x80\x9cserpentine\xe2\x80\x9d district, we held, was nothing if not race-centric, and could not be justified as a reasonable attempt to comply with the VRA.  <i>Id.,</i> at 906; see <i>id.,</i> at 911\xe2\x80\x93918.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The next year, the State responded with a new districting plan, including a new District 12\xe2\x80\x94and residents of that district brought another lawsuit alleging an impermissible racial gerrymander.  A District Court sustained the claim twice, but both times this Court reversed.  See <i>Hunt</i> v. <i>Cromartie</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 541 (1999)\n (<i>Cromartie I</i>); <i>Cromartie II</i>,\n\n532 U. S. 234\n.  Racial considerations, we held, did not predominate in designing the revised District 12.  Rather, that district was the result of a <i>political </i>gerrymander\xe2\x80\x94an effort to engineer, mostly \xe2\x80\x9cwithout regard to race,\xe2\x80\x9d a safe Democratic seat.  <i>Id.</i>, at 245.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State redrew its congressional districts again in 2001, to account for population changes revealed in the prior year\xe2\x80\x99s census.  Under the 2001 map, which went unchallenged in court, neither District 1 nor District 12 had a black voting-age population (called a \xe2\x80\x9cBVAP\xe2\x80\x9d) that was a majority of the whole: The former had a BVAP of around 48%, the latter a BVAP of around 43%.  See App. 312, 503.  Nonetheless, in five successive general elections conducted in those reconfigured districts, all the candidates preferred by most African-American voters won their contests\xe2\x80\x94and by some handy margins.  In District 1, black voters\xe2\x80\x99 candidates of choice garnered as much as 70% of the total vote, and never less than 59%.  See 5 Record 636, 638, 641, 645, 647 (Pls. Exh. 112).  And in District 12, those candidates won with 72% of the vote at the high end and 64% at the low.  See <i>id.,</i> at 637, 640, 643, 646, 650.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Another census, in 2010, necessitated yet another congressional map\xe2\x80\x94(finally) the one at issue in this case.  State Senator Robert Rucho and State Representative David Lewis, both Republicans, chaired the two committees jointly responsible for preparing the revamped plan.  They hired Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a veteran political mapmaker, to assist them in redrawing district lines.  Several hearings, drafts, and revisions later, both chambers of the State\xe2\x80\x99s General Assembly adopted the scheme the three men proposed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The new map (among other things) significantly altered both District 1 and District 12.  The 2010 census had revealed District 1 to be substantially underpopulated: To comply with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s one-person-one-vote principle, the State needed to place almost 100,000 new people within the district\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries.  See App. 2690; <i>Evenwel</i> v. <i>Abbott</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 3) (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tates must draw congressional districts with populations as close to perfect equality as possible\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rucho, Lewis, and Hofeller chose to take most of those people from heavily black areas of Durham, requiring a finger-like extension of the district\xe2\x80\x99s western line.  See Appendix, <i>infra</i>.  With that addition, District 1\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP rose from 48.6% to 52.7%.  See App. 312\xe2\x80\x93313.  District 12, for its part, had no need for significant total-population changes: It was overpopulated by fewer than 3,000 people out of over 730,000.  See <i>id</i>., at 1150.  Still, Rucho, Lewis, and Hofeller decided to reconfigure the district, further narrowing its already snakelike body while adding areas at either end\xe2\x80\x94most relevantly here, in Guilford County.  See Appendix, <i>infra</i>; App. 1164.  Those changes appreciably shifted the racial composition of District 12: As the district gained some 35,000 African-Americans of voting age and lost some 50,000 whites of that age, its BVAP increased from 43.8% to 50.7%.  See 2 Record 349 (Fourth Affidavit of Dan Frey, Exh. 5); <i>id.,</i> at 416 (Exh. 11).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Registered voters in the two districts (David Harris and Christine Bowser, here called \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d) brought this suit against North Carolina officials (collectively, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Carolina\xe2\x80\x9d), complaining of impermissible racial gerrymanders.  After a bench trial, a three-judge District Court held both districts unconstitutional.  All the judges agreed that racial considerations predominated in the design of District 1.  See <i>Harris </i>v. <i>McCrory</i>, 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 600, 611 (MDNC 2016).  And in then applying strict scrutiny, all rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that it had a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong basis\xe2\x80\x9d for thinking that the VRA compelled such a race-based drawing of District 1\xe2\x80\x99s lines.  <i>Id.,</i> at 623.  As for District 12, a majority of the panel held that \xe2\x80\x9crace predominated\xe2\x80\x9d over all other factors, including partisanship.  <i>Id.</i>, at 622.  And the court explained that the State had failed to put forward any reason, compelling or otherwise, for its attention to race in designing that district.  See <i>ibid.  </i>Judge Osteen dissented from the conclusion that race, rather than politics, drove District 12\xe2\x80\x99s lines\xe2\x80\x94yet still characterized the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view as \xe2\x80\x9c[e]minently reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 640.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State filed a notice of appeal, and we noted probable jurisdiction.  <i>McCrory</i> v. <i>Harris</i>,<i> </i>579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We address at the outset North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s contention that a victory it won in a very similar state-court lawsuit should dictate (or at least influence) our disposition of this case.  As the State explains, the North Carolina NAACP and several other civil rights groups challenged Districts 1 and 12 in state court immediately after their enactment, charging that they were unlawful racial gerrymanders.  See Brief for Appellants 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  By the time the plaintiffs before us filed this action, the state trial court, in <i>Dickson </i>v. <i>Rucho</i>, had rejected those claims\xe2\x80\x94finding that in District 1 the VRA justified the General Assembly\xe2\x80\x99s use of race and that in District 12 race was not a factor at all.  See App. 1969.  The North Carolina Supreme Court then affirmed that decision by a 4\xe2\x80\x933 vote, applying the state-court equivalent of clear error review.  See <i>Dickson </i>v. <i>Rucho</i>, 368 N.\xc2\xa0C. 481, 500, 781 S. E. 2d 404, 419 (2015), modified on denial of reh\xe2\x80\x99g, 368 N.\xc2\xa0C. 673, 789 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 436 (2016), cert. pending, No. 16\xe2\x80\x9324.  In this Court, North Carolina makes two related arguments based on the <i>Dickson </i>litigation: first, that the state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment should have barred this case altogether, under familiar principles of claim and issue preclusion; and second, that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions should cause us to conduct a \xe2\x80\x9csearching review\xe2\x80\x9d of the decision below, rather than deferring (as usual) to its factual findings.  Reply Brief 6.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State\xe2\x80\x99s preclusion theory rests on an assertion about how the plaintiffs in the two cases are affiliated.  As the State acknowledges, one person\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit generally does not bar another\xe2\x80\x99s, no matter how similar they are in substance.  See <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>Sturgell</i>,\n\n553 U. S. 880\n\xe2\x80\x93893 (2008) (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cdeep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court\xe2\x80\x9d).  But when plaintiffs in two cases have a special relationship, a judgment against one can indeed bind both.  See <i>id.,</i> at 893\xe2\x80\x93895 (describing six categories of qualifying relationships).  The State contends that Harris and Bowser, the plaintiffs here, are members of organizations that were plaintiffs in <i>Dickson</i>.  And according to North Carolina, that connection prevents the pair from raising anew the questions that the state court previously resolved against those groups.  See Brief for Appellants 20\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But North Carolina never satisfied the District Court that the alleged affiliation really existed.  When the State argued that its preclusion theory entitled it to summary judgment, Harris and Bowser responded that they were not members of any of the organizations that had brought the <i>Dickson </i>suit.  See 3 Record 1577\xe2\x80\x931582 (Defs. Motion for Summary Judgment); 4 Record 101\xe2\x80\x93106 (Pls. Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment).  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 dueling contentions turned on intricate issues about those groups\xe2\x80\x99 membership policies (<i>e.g., </i>could Harris\xe2\x80\x99s payment of dues to the national NAACP, or Bowser\xe2\x80\x99s financial contribution to the Mecklenburg County NAACP, have made either a member of the state branch?).  Because of those unresolved \xe2\x80\x9cfactual disputes,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court denied North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment.  4 Record 238 (July 29, 2014 Order).  And nothing in the subsequent trial supported the State\xe2\x80\x99s assertion about Harris\xe2\x80\x99s and Bowser\xe2\x80\x99s organizational ties: Indeed, the State chose not to present any further evidence relating to the membership issue.  Based on the resulting record, the District Court summarily rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Harris and Bowser were something other than independent plaintiffs.  See 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 609.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That conclusion defeats North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to argue for claim or issue preclusion here.  We have no basis for assessing the factual assertions underlying the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument any differently than the District Court did.  Nothing in the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence clearly rebuts Harris\xe2\x80\x99s and Bowser\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that they never joined any of the <i>Dickson </i>groups.  We need not decide whether the alleged memberships would have supported preclusion if they had been proved.  It is enough that the District Court reason-ably thought they had not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State\xe2\x80\x99s back-up argument about our standard of review also falls short.  The rule that we review a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings for clear error contains no exception for findings that diverge from those made in another court.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6) (\xe2\x80\x9cFindings of fact .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 352,\n369 (1991)\n (plurality opinion) (applying the same standard to a state court\xe2\x80\x99s findings).  Whatever findings are under review receive the benefit of deference, without regard to whether a court in a separate suit has seen the matter differently.  So here, we must ask not which court considering Districts 1 and 12 had the better view of the facts, but simply whether the court below\xe2\x80\x99s view is clearly wrong.  That does not mean the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is wholly irrelevant: It is common sense that, all else equal, a finding is more likely to be plainly wrong if some judges disagree with it.  Cf. <i>Glossip</i> v. <i>Gross</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 17) (noting that we are even less likely to disturb a factual determination when \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple trial courts have reached the same finding\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the very premise of clear error review is that there are often \xe2\x80\x9ctwo permissible\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94because two \xe2\x80\x9cplausible\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cviews of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Anderson</i>, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 574; see <i>supra,</i> at 4.  Even assuming the state court\xe2\x80\x99s findings capture one such view, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment may yet represent another.  And the permissibility of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s account is the only question before us.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With that out of the way, we turn to the merits of this case, beginning (appropriately enough) with District 1.  As noted above, the court below found that race furnished the predominant rationale for that district\xe2\x80\x99s redesign.  See <i>supra,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  And it held that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in complying with the VRA could not justify that consideration of race.  See <i>supra,</i> at 7<i>.  </i>We uphold both conclusions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Uncontested evidence in the record shows that the State\xe2\x80\x99s mapmakers, in considering District 1, purposefully established a racial target: African-Americans should make up no less than a majority of the voting-age population.  See 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 611\xe2\x80\x93614.  Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis were not coy in expressing that goal.  They repeatedly told their colleagues that District 1 had to be majority-minority, so as to comply with the VRA.  During a Senate debate, for example, Rucho explained that District 1 \xe2\x80\x9cmust include a sufficient number of African-Americans\xe2\x80\x9d to make it \xe2\x80\x9ca majority black district.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 689\xe2\x80\x93690.  Similarly, Lewis informed the House and Senate redistricting committees that the district must have \xe2\x80\x9ca majority black voting age population.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 610.  And that objective was communicated in no uncertain terms to the legislators\xe2\x80\x99 consultant.  Dr. Hofeller testified multiple times at trial that Rucho and Lewis instructed him \xe2\x80\x9cto draw [District 1] with a [BVAP] in excess of 50 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d  159 F. Supp. 3d, at 613; see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>ibid.</i> (\xe2\x80\x9cOnce again, my instructions [were] that the district had to be drawn at above 50 percent\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Hofeller followed those directions to the letter, such that the 50%-plus racial target \xe2\x80\x9chad a direct and significant impact\xe2\x80\x9d on District 1\xe2\x80\x99s configuration.  <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at __ (slip op., at 17).  In particular, Hofeller moved the district\xe2\x80\x99s borders to encompass the heavily black parts of Durham (and only those parts), thus taking in tens of thousands of additional African-American voters.  That change and similar ones, made (in his words) to ensure that the district\xe2\x80\x99s racial composition would \xe2\x80\x9cadd[\xc2\xa0] up correctly,\xe2\x80\x9d deviated from the districting practices he other-wise would have followed.  App. 2802.  Hofeller candidly admitted that point: For example, he testified, he sometimes could not respect county or precinct lines as he wished because \xe2\x80\x9cthe more important thing\xe2\x80\x9d was to create a majority-minority district.  <i>Id</i>., at 2807; see <i>id</i>., at 2809.  The result is a district with stark racial borders: Within the same counties, the portions that fall inside District 1 have black populations two to three times larger than the portions placed in neighboring districts.  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>19; cf. <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 17\xe2\x80\x9318) (relying on similar evidence to find racial predominance).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Faced with this body of evidence\xe2\x80\x94showing an announced racial target that subordinated other districting criteria and produced boundaries amplifying divisions between blacks and whites\xe2\x80\x94the District Court did not clearly err in finding that race predominated in drawing District 1.  Indeed, as all three judges recognized, the court could hardly have concluded anything but.  See 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 611 (calling District 1 a \xe2\x80\x9ctextbook example\xe2\x80\x9d of race-based districting).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The more substantial question is whether District 1 can survive the strict scrutiny applied to racial gerrymanders.  As noted earlier, we have long assumed that complying with the VRA is a compelling interest.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.  And we have held that race-based districting is narrowly tailored to that objective if a State had \xe2\x80\x9cgood reasons\xe2\x80\x9d for thinking that the Act demanded such steps.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.  North Carolina argues that District 1 passes muster under that standard: The General Assembly (so says the State) had \xe2\x80\x9cgood reasons to believe it needed to draw [District 1] as a majority-minority district to avoid Section 2 liability\xe2\x80\x9d for vote dilution.  Brief for Appellants 52.  We now turn to that defense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court identified, in <i>Thornburg </i>v. <i>Gingles</i>,<i> </i>three threshold conditions for proving vote dilution under \xc2\xa72 of the VRA.  See 478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50\xe2\x80\x9351.  First, a \xe2\x80\x9cminority group\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority\xe2\x80\x9d in some reasonably configured legislative district.  <i>Id.,</i> at 50.  Second, the minority group must be \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically cohesive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 51.  And third, a district\xe2\x80\x99s white majority must \xe2\x80\x9cvote[\xc2\xa0] sufficiently as a bloc\xe2\x80\x9d to usually \xe2\x80\x9cdefeat the minority\xe2\x80\x99s preferred candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Those three showings, we have explained, are needed to establish that \xe2\x80\x9cthe minority [group] has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice\xe2\x80\x9d in a possible district, but that racially polarized voting prevents it from doing so in the district as actually drawn because it is \xe2\x80\x9csubmerg[ed] in a larger white voting population.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Growe</i> v. <i>Emison</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 25,\n40 (1993)\n.  If a State has good reason to think that all the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Gingles</i> preconditions\xe2\x80\x9d are met, then so too it has good reason to believe that \xc2\xa72 requires drawing a majority-minority district.  See <i>Bush </i>v. <i>Vera</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 952,\n978 (1996)\n (plurality opinion).  But if not, then not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, electoral history provided no evidence that a \xc2\xa72 plaintiff could demonstrate the third <i>Gingles </i>prerequisite\xe2\x80\x94effective white bloc-voting.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  For most of the twenty years prior to the new plan\xe2\x80\x99s adoption, African-Americans had made up less than a majority of District 1\xe2\x80\x99s voters; the district\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP usually hovered between 46% and 48%.  See 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 606; App. 312.

Those victories (indeed, landslides) occurred because the district\xe2\x80\x99s white population did <i>not </i>\xe2\x80\x9cvote[\xc2\xa0] sufficiently as a bloc\xe2\x80\x9d to thwart black voters\xe2\x80\x99 preference, <i>Gingles</i>, 478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51; rather, a meaningful number of white voters joined a politically cohesive black community to elect that group\xe2\x80\x99s favored candidate.  In the lingo of voting law, District 1 functioned, election year in and election year out, as a \xe2\x80\x9ccross-over\xe2\x80\x9d district, in which members of the majority help a \xe2\x80\x9clarge enough\xe2\x80\x9d minority to elect its candidate of choice.  <i>Bartlett</i> v. <i>Strickland</i>,\n\n556 U. S. 1,\n13 (2009)\n (plurality opinion).  When voters act in that way, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is difficult to see how the majority-bloc-voting requirement could be met\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and hence how \xc2\xa72 liability could be established.  <i>Id.,</i> at 16.  So experience gave the State no reason to think that the VRA required it to ramp up District 1\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State counters that, in this context, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  See Brief for Appellants 57\xe2\x80\x9358; Reply Brief 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  Recall here that the State had to redraw its whole congressional map following the 2010 census.  See <i>supra,</i> at 5.  And in particular, the State had to add nearly 100,000 new people to District 1 to meet the one-person-one-vote standard.  See <i>supra</i>, at 6<i>.  </i>That meant about 13% of the voters in the new district would never have voted there before.  See App. 2690; Reply Brief 20.  So, North Carolina contends, the question facing the state mapmakers was not whether the <i>then-existing</i> District 1 violated \xc2\xa72.  Rather, the question was whether the <i>future</i> District 1 would do so if drawn without regard to race.  And that issue, the State claims, could not be resolved by \xe2\x80\x9cfocusing myopically on past elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 19.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But that reasoning, taken alone, cannot justify North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s race-based redesign of District 1.  True enough, a legislature undertaking a redistricting must assess whether the new districts it contemplates (not the old ones it sheds) conform to the VRA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  And true too, an inescapable influx of additional voters into a district may suggest the possibility<i> </i>that its former track record of compliance can continue only if the legislature intentionally adjusts its racial composition.  Still, North Carolina too far downplays the significance of a longtime pattern of white crossover voting in the area that would form the core of the redrawn District 1.  See <i>Gingles</i>, 478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 57 (noting that longtime voting patterns are highly probative of racial polarization).  And even more important, North Carolina can point to no meaningful legislative inquiry into what it now rightly identifies as the key issue: whether a new, enlarged District 1, created without a focus on race but however else the State would choose, could lead to \xc2\xa72 liability.  The prospect of a significant population increase in a district only raises\xe2\x80\x94it does not answer\xe2\x80\x94the question whether \xc2\xa72 requires deliberate measures to augment the district\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP.  (Indeed, such population growth could cut in either direction, depending on who comes into the district.)  To have a strong basis in evidence to conclude that \xc2\xa72 demands such race-based steps, the State must carefully evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish the <i>Gingles </i>preconditions\xe2\x80\x94including effective white bloc-voting\xe2\x80\x94in a new district created without those measures.  We see nothing in the legislative record that fits that description.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And that absence is no accident: Rucho and Lewis proceeded under a wholly different theory\xe2\x80\x94arising not from <i>Gingles </i>but from <i>Bartlett </i>v. <i>Strickland</i>\xe2\x80\x94of what \xc2\xa72 demanded in drawing District 1.  <i>Strickland </i>involved a geographic area in which African-Americans could not form a majority of a reasonably compact district.  See 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 8 (plurality opinion).  The African-American community, however, was sizable enough to enable the formation of a crossover district, in which a substantial bloc of black voters, if receiving help from some white ones, could elect the candidates of their choice.  See <i>supra,</i> at 14.  A plurality of this Court, invoking the first <i>Gingles </i>precondition, held that \xc2\xa72 did not require creating that district: When a minority group is not sufficiently large to make up a majority in a reasonably shaped district, \xc2\xa72 simply does not apply.  See 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 18\xe2\x80\x9320.  Over and over in the legislative record, Rucho and Lewis cited <i>Strickland </i>as mandating a 50%-plus BVAP in District 1.  See App. 355\xe2\x80\x93356, 363\xe2\x80\x93364, 472\xe2\x80\x93474, 609\xe2\x80\x93610, 619, 1044.  They apparently reasoned that if, as <i>Strickland </i>held, \xc2\xa72 does not <i>require</i> crossover districts (for groups insufficiently large under <i>Gingles</i>), then \xc2\xa72 also cannot be <i>satisfied by </i>crossover districts (for groups in fact meeting <i>Gingles</i>\xe2\x80\x99 size condition).  In effect, they concluded, whenever a legislature <i>can</i> draw a majority-minority district, it <i>must</i> do so\xe2\x80\x94even if a crossover district would also allow the minority group to elect its favored candidates.  See 1 Tr. 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (counsel\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [S]tate interpreted\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Strickland</i> to say that, in order to protect African-Americans\xe2\x80\x99 electoral strength and thus avoid \xc2\xa72 liability, the BVAP in District 1 \xe2\x80\x9cneed[ed] to be above 50 percent\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That idea, though, is at war with our \xc2\xa72 jurisprudence\xe2\x80\x94<i>Strickland </i>included.  Under the State\xe2\x80\x99s view, the third <i>Gingles </i>condition is no condition at all, because even in the absence of effective white bloc-voting, a \xc2\xa72 claim could succeed in a district (like the old District 1) with an under-50% BVAP.  But this Court has made clear that unless <i>each </i>of the three <i>Gingles</i> prerequisites is established, \xe2\x80\x9cthere neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Growe</i>, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 41.  And <i>Strickland</i>, far from supporting North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s view, underscored the necessity of demonstrating effective white bloc-voting to prevail in a \xc2\xa72 vote-dilution suit.  The plurality explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n areas with substantial crossover voting,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72 plaintiffs would not \xe2\x80\x9cbe able to establish the third <i>Gingles </i>precondition\xe2\x80\x9d and so \xe2\x80\x9cmajority-minority districts would not be required.\xe2\x80\x9d  556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 24; see also <i>ibid. </i>(noting that States can \xe2\x80\x9cdefend against alleged \xc2\xa72 violations by pointing to crossover voting patterns and to effective crossover districts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s belief that it was compelled to redraw District 1 (a successful crossover district) as a majority-minority district rested not on a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong basis in evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead on a pure error of law.  <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum: Although States enjoy leeway to take race-based actions reasonably judged necessary under a proper interpretation of the VRA, that latitude cannot rescue District 1.  We by no means \xe2\x80\x9cinsist that a state legislature, when redistricting, determine <i>precisely</i> what percent minority population [\xc2\xa72 of the VRA] demands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  But neither will we approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is supported by no evidence and whose <i>raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre </i>is a legal mistake.  Accordingly, we uphold the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s use of race as the predominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We now look west to District 12, making its fifth(!) appearance before this Court.  This time, the district\xe2\x80\x99s legality turns, and turns solely, on which of two possible reasons predominantly explains its most recent reconfiguration.  The plaintiffs contended at trial that the General Assembly chose voters for District 12, as for District 1, because of their race; more particularly, they urged that the Assembly intentionally increased District 12\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP in the name of ensuring preclearance under the VRA\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa75.  But North Carolina declined to mount any defense (similar to the one we have just considered for District 1) that \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s requirements in fact justified race-based changes to District 12\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because \xc2\xa75 could not reasonably be understood to have done so, see n.\xc2\xa010, <i>infra</i>.  Instead, the State altogether denied that racial considerations accounted for (or, indeed, played the slightest role in) District 12\xe2\x80\x99s redesign.  According to the State\xe2\x80\x99s version of events, Senator Rucho, Representative Lewis, and Dr. Hofeller moved voters in and out of the district as part of a \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly\xe2\x80\x9d political gerrymander, without regard to race.  6 Record 1011.  The mapmakers drew their lines, in other words, to \xe2\x80\x9cpack\xe2\x80\x9d District 12 with Democrats, not African-Americans.  After hearing evidence supporting both parties\xe2\x80\x99 accounts, the District Court accepted the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses special challenges for a trial court.  In the more usual case alleging a racial gerrymander\xe2\x80\x94where no one has raised a partisanship defense\xe2\x80\x94the court can make real headway by exploring the challenged district\xe2\x80\x99s conformity to traditional districting principles, such as compactness and respect for county lines.  In <i>Shaw II</i>, for example, this Court emphasized the \xe2\x80\x9chighly irregular\xe2\x80\x9d shape of then-District 12 in concluding that race predominated in its design.  517 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 905 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But such evidence loses much of its value when the State asserts partisanship as a defense, because a bizarre shape\xe2\x80\x94as of the new District 12\xe2\x80\x94can arise from a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical motivation\xe2\x80\x9d as well as a racial one.  <i>Cromartie I</i>, 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 547, n.\xc2\xa03.  And crucially, political and racial reasons are capable of yielding similar oddities in a district\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries.  That is because, of course, \xe2\x80\x9cracial identification is highly correlated with political affiliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cromartie II</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 243.  As a result of those redistricting realities, a trial court has a formidable task: It must make \xe2\x80\x9ca sensitive inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d into all \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstantial and direct evidence of intent\xe2\x80\x9d to assess whether the plaintiffs have managed to disentangle race from politics and prove that the former drove a district\xe2\x80\x99s lines.  <i>Cromartie I</i>, 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 546 (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our job is different\xe2\x80\x94and generally easier.  As described earlier, we review a district court\xe2\x80\x99s finding as to racial predominance only for clear error, except when the court made a legal mistake.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Under that standard of review, we affirm the court\xe2\x80\x99s finding so long as it is \xe2\x80\x9cplausible\xe2\x80\x9d; we reverse only when \xe2\x80\x9cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 573\xe2\x80\x93574; see <i>supra,</i> at 4.  And in deciding which side of that line to come down on, we give singular deference to a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgments about the credibility of witnesses.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).  That is proper, we have explained, because the various cues that \xe2\x80\x9cbear so heavily on the listener\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of and belief in what is said\xe2\x80\x9d are lost on an appellate court later sifting through a paper record.  <i>Anderson</i>, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 575.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of those principles, we uphold the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of racial predominance respecting District 12.  The evidence offered at trial, including live witness testimony subject to credibility determinations, adequately supports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the district\xe2\x80\x99s reconfiguration.  And no error of law infected that judgment: Contrary to North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s view, the District Court had no call to dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs did not proffer an alternative design for District 12 as circumstantial evidence of the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Begin with some facts and figures, showing how the redistricting of District 12 affected its racial composition.  As explained above, District 12 (unlike District 1) was approximately the right size as it was: North Carolina did not\xe2\x80\x94indeed, could not\xe2\x80\x94much change its total population.  See <i>supra,</i> at 6.  But by further slimming the district and adding a couple of knobs to its snakelike body (including in Guilford County), the General Assembly incorporated tens of thousands of new voters and pushed out tens of thousands of old ones.  And those changes followed racial lines: To be specific, the new District 12 had 35,000 more African-Americans of voting age and 50,000 fewer whites of that age.  (The difference was made up of voters from other racial categories.)  See<i> ibid</i>.  Those voter exchanges produced a sizable jump in the district\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP, from 43.8% to 50.7%.  See <i>ibid.</i>  The Assembly thus turned District 12 (as it did District 1, see <i>supra,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311) into a majority-minority district.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As the plaintiffs pointed out at trial, Rucho and Lewis had publicly stated that racial considerations lay behind District 12\xe2\x80\x99s augmented BVAP.  In a release issued along with their draft districting plan, the two legislators ascribed that change to the need to achieve preclearance of the plan under \xc2\xa75 of the VRA.  See App. 358.  At that time, \xc2\xa75 covered Guilford County and thus prohibited any \xe2\x80\x9cretrogression in the [electoral] position of racial minorities\xe2\x80\x9d there.  <i>Beer</i>, 425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141; see 31 Fed. Reg. 5081 (1966).  And part of Guilford County lay within District 12, which meant that the Department of Justice would closely scrutinize that district\xe2\x80\x99s new lines.  In light of those facts, Rucho and Lewis wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the presence of Guilford County in the Twelfth District, we have drawn our proposed Twelfth District at a [BVAP] level that is above the percentage of [BVAP] found in the current Twelfth District.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 358.  According to the two legislators, that race-based \xe2\x80\x9cmeasure w[ould] ensure preclearance of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Thus, the District Court found, Rucho\xe2\x80\x99s and Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s own account \xe2\x80\x9cevince[d] intentionality\xe2\x80\x9d as to District 12\xe2\x80\x99s racial composition: <i>Because of </i>the VRA, they increased the number of African-Americans.  159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 617.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Hofeller confirmed that intent in both deposition testimony and an expert report.  Before the redistricting, Hofeller testified, some black residents of Guilford County fell within District 12 while others fell within neighboring District 13.  The legislators, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cdecided to reunite the black community in Guilford County into the Twelfth.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 558; see <i>id.,</i> at 530\xe2\x80\x93531.  Why?  Hofeller responded, in language the District Court emphasized: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n order to be cautious and draw a plan that would pass muster under the Voting Rights Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 558; see 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 619.  Likewise, Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s expert report highlighted the role of the VRA in altering District 12\xe2\x80\x99s lines.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]indful that Guilford County was covered\xe2\x80\x9d by \xc2\xa75, Hofeller explained, the legislature \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined that it was prudent to reunify [the county\xe2\x80\x99s] African-American community\xe2\x80\x9d into District 12.  App. 1103.  That change caused the district\xe2\x80\x99s compactness to decrease (in expert-speak, it \xe2\x80\x9clowered the Reock Score\xe2\x80\x9d), but that was a sacrifice well worth making: It would \xe2\x80\x9cavoid the possibility of a [VRA] charge\xe2\x80\x9d that would \xe2\x80\x9cinhibit[\xc2\xa0] preclearance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance submission to the Justice Department indicated a similar determination to concentrate black voters in District 12.  \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the concerns of the Redistricting Chairs,\xe2\x80\x9d North Carolina there noted, had to do with the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s years-old objection to \xe2\x80\x9ca failure by the State to create a second majority minority district\xe2\x80\x9d (that is, in addition to District 1).  <i>Id</i>., at 478.  The submission then went on to explain that after considering alternatives, the redistricters had designed a version of District 12 that would raise its BVAP to 50.7%.

In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, that passage once again indicated that making District 12 majority-minority was no \xe2\x80\x9cmere coincidence,\xe2\x80\x9d but a deliberate attempt to avoid perceived obstacles to preclearance.  159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 617.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And still there was more: Perhaps the most dramatic testimony in the trial came when Congressman Mel Watt (who had represented District 12 for some 20 years) recounted a conversation he had with Rucho in 2011 about the district\xe2\x80\x99s future make-up.  According to Watt, Rucho said that \xe2\x80\x9chis leadership had told him that he had to ramp the minority percentage in [District 12] up to over 50 percent to comply with the Voting Rights Law.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 2369; see <i>id</i>., at 2393.

Hofeller explained that Rucho and Lewis instructed him, first and foremost, to make the map as a whole \xe2\x80\x9cmore favorable to Republican candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 2682.  One agreed-on stratagem in that effort was to pack the historically Democratic District 12 with even more Democratic voters, thus leaving surrounding districts more reliably Republican.  See <i>id</i>., at 2682\xe2\x80\x932683, 2696\xe2\x80\x932697.  To that end, Hofeller recounted, he drew District 12\xe2\x80\x99s new boundaries based on political data\xe2\x80\x94specifically, the voting behavior of precincts in the 2008 Presidential election between Barack Obama and John McCain.  See <i>id</i>., at 2701\xe2\x80\x932702.  Indeed, he claimed, he displayed only this data, and no racial data, on his computer screen while mapping the district.  See <i>id</i>., at 2721.

The court recalled Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s contrary deposition testimony\xe2\x80\x94his statement (repeated in only slightly different words in his expert report) that Rucho and Lewis \xe2\x80\x9cdecided\xe2\x80\x9d to shift African-American voters into District 12 \xe2\x80\x9cin order to\xe2\x80\x9d ensure preclearance under \xc2\xa75.  See 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 619\xe2\x80\x93620; App. 558.  And the court explained that even at trial, Hofeller had given testimony that undermined his \xe2\x80\x9cblame it on politics\xe2\x80\x9d claim.  Right after asserting that Rucho and Lewis had told him \xe2\x80\x9c[not] to use race\xe2\x80\x9d in designing District 12, Hofeller added a qualification: \xe2\x80\x9cexcept perhaps with regard to Guilford County.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 2791; see <i>id</i>., at 2790.  As the District Court understood, that is the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cexception\xe2\x80\x9d that goes pretty far toward swallowing the rule.  District 12 saw a net increase of more than 25,000 black voters in Guilford County, relative to a net gain of fewer than 35,000 across the district: So the newly added parts of that county played a major role in pushing the district\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP over 50%.  See <i>id</i>., at 384, 500\xe2\x80\x93502.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]  The District Court came away from Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s self-contradictory testimony unpersuaded that this decisive influx of black voters was an accident.  Whether the racial make-up of the county was displayed on his computer screen or just fixed in his head, the court thought, Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s denial of race-based districting \xe2\x80\x9cr[ang] hollow.\xe2\x80\x9d  159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 620, n.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, an expert report by Dr. Stephen Ansolabehere lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 race-not-politics case.  Ansolabehere looked at the six counties overlapping with District 12\xe2\x80\x94essentially the region from which the mapmakers could have drawn the district\xe2\x80\x99s population.  The question he asked was: Who from those counties actually ended up in District 12?  The answer he found was: Only 16% of the region\xe2\x80\x99s white registered voters, but 64% of the black ones.  See App. 321\xe2\x80\x93322.  Ansolabehere next controlled for party registration, but discovered that doing so made essentially no difference: For example, only 18% of the region\xe2\x80\x99s white Democrats wound up in District 12, whereas 65% of the black Democrats did.  See <i>id.</i>, at 332.  The upshot was that, regardless of party, a black voter was three to four times more likely than a white voter to cast his ballot within District 12\xe2\x80\x99s borders.  See <i>ibid.  </i>Those stark disparities led Ansolabehere to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9crace, and not party,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cthe dominant factor\xe2\x80\x9d in District 12\xe2\x80\x99s design.  <i>Id</i>., at 337.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]  His report, as the District Court held, thus tended to confirm the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 direct evidence of racial predominance.  See 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 620\xe2\x80\x93621.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that all this evidence proved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error review.  The court emphasized that the districting plan\xe2\x80\x99s own architects had repeatedly described the influx of African-Americans into District 12 as a \xc2\xa75 compliance measure, not a side-effect of political gerrymandering.  And those contemporaneous descriptions comported with the court\xe2\x80\x99s credibility determinations about the trial testimony\xe2\x80\x94that Watt told the truth when he recounted Rucho\xe2\x80\x99s resolve to hit a majority-BVAP target; and conversely that Hofeller skirted the truth (especially as to Guilford County) when he claimed to have followed only race-blind criteria in drawing district lines.  We cannot disrespect such credibility judgments.  See <i>Anderson</i>, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 575 (A choice to believe \xe2\x80\x9cone of two or more witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d can \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually never be clear error\xe2\x80\x9d)<i>.  </i>And more generally, we will not take it upon ourselves to weigh the trial evidence as if we were the first to hear it.  See <i>id.,</i> at 573 (A \xe2\x80\x9creviewing court oversteps\xe2\x80\x9d under Rule 52(a) \xe2\x80\x9cif it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court\xe2\x80\x9d).  No doubt other interpretations of that evidence were permissible.  Maybe we would have evaluated the testimony differently had we presided over the trial; or then again, maybe we would not have.  Either way\xe2\x80\x94and it is only <i>this</i> which matters\xe2\x80\x94we are far from having a \xe2\x80\x9cdefinite and firm conviction\xe2\x80\x9d that the District Court made a mistake in concluding from the record before it that racial considerations predominated in District 12\xe2\x80\x99s design<i>.</i></p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The State mounts a final, legal rather than factual, attack on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of racial predominance.  When race and politics are competing explanations of a district\xe2\x80\x99s lines, argues North Carolina, the party challenging the district must introduce a particular kind of circumstantial evidence: \xe2\x80\x9can alternative [map] that achieves the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s political objectives while improving racial balance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellants 31 (emphasis deleted).  That is true, the State says, irrespective of what other evidence is in the case\xe2\x80\x94so even if the plaintiff offers powerful direct proof that the legislature adopted the map it did for racial reasons.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  Because the plaintiffs here (as all agree) did not present such a counter-map, North Carolina concludes that they cannot prevail.  The dissent echoes that argument.  See <i>post</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have no doubt that an alternative districting plan, of the kind North Carolina describes, can serve as key evidence in a race-versus-politics dispute.  One, often highly persuasive way to disprove a State\xe2\x80\x99s contention that politics drove a district\xe2\x80\x99s lines is to show that the legislature had the capacity to accomplish all its partisan goals without moving so many members of a minority group into the district.  If you were <i>really</i> sorting by political behavior instead of skin color (so the argument goes) you would have done\xe2\x80\x94or, at least, could just as well have done\xe2\x80\x94<i>this</i>.  Such would-have, could-have, and (to round out the set) should-have arguments are a familiar means of undermining a claim that an action was based on a permissible, rather than a prohibited, ground.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Dretke</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 231,\n249 (2005)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIf that were the [real] explanation for striking [juror] Warren[,] the prosecutors should have struck [juror] Jenkins\xe2\x80\x9d too).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But they are hardly the <i>only </i>means.  Suppose that the plaintiff in a dispute like this one introduced scores of leaked emails from state officials instructing their mapmaker to pack as many black voters as possible into a district, or telling him to make sure its BVAP hit 75%.  Based on such evidence, a court could find that racial rather than political factors predominated in a district\xe2\x80\x99s design, with or without an alternative map.  And so too in cases lacking that kind of smoking gun, as long as the evidence offered satisfies the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof.  In <i>Bush </i>v. <i>Vera</i>, for example, this Court upheld a finding of racial predominance based on \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial direct evidence of the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s racial motivations\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including credible testimony from political figures and statements made in a \xc2\xa75 preclearance submission\xe2\x80\x94plus circumstantial evidence that redistricters had access to racial, but not political, data at the \xe2\x80\x9cblock-by-block level\xe2\x80\x9d needed to explain their \xe2\x80\x9cintricate\xe2\x80\x9d designs.  See 517 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 960\xe2\x80\x93963 (plurality opinion).  Not a single Member of the Court thought that the absence of a counter-map made any difference.  Similarly, it does not matter in this case, where the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 introduction of mostly direct and some circumstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x94documents issued in the redistricting process, testimony of government officials, expert analysis of demographic patterns\xe2\x80\x94gave the District Court a sufficient basis, sans any map, to resolve the race-or-politics question.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s task, in other words, is simply to persuade the trial court\xe2\x80\x94without any special evidentiary prerequisite\xe2\x80\x94that race (not politics) was the \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant consideration in deciding to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. <i>Bethune-Hill</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 8, 10) (rejecting a similar effort to elevate one form of \xe2\x80\x9cpersuasive circumstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in a dispute respecting racial predominance to a \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory precondition\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold requirement\xe2\x80\x9d of proof).  That burden of proof, we have often held, is \xe2\x80\x9cdemanding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>E.g., Cromartie II</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 241.  And because that is so, a plaintiff will sometimes need an alternative map, as a practical matter, to make his case.  But in no area of our equal protection law have we forced plaintiffs to submit one particular form of proof to prevail.  See <i>Arlington Heights</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.</i>,\n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 252\n\xe2\x80\x93268 (1977) (offering a varied and non-exhaustive list of \xe2\x80\x9csubjects of proper inquiry in determining whether racially discriminatory intent existed\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor would it make sense to do so here.  The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the unjustified drawing of district lines based on race.  An alternative map is merely an evidentiary tool to show that such a substantive violation has occurred; neither its presence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering claim.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">North Carolina insists, however, that we have already said to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94more particularly, that our decision in <i>Cromartie II </i>imposed a non-negotiable \xe2\x80\x9calternative-map requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellants 31.  As the State observes, <i>Cromartie II</i> reversed as clearly erroneous a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that race, rather than politics, predominated in the assignment of voters to an earlier incarnation of District 12.  See 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 241; <i>supra,</i> at 5.  And as the State emphasizes, a part of our opinion faulted the <i>Cromartie </i>plaintiffs for failing to offer a convincing account of how the legislature could have accomplished its political goals other than through the map it chose.  See 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 257\xe2\x80\x93258.  We there stated:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIn a case such as this one where majority-minority districts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles.  That party must also show that those districting alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 258.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">According to North Carolina, that passage alone settles this case, because it makes an alternative map \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d to a finding that District 12 (a majority-minority district in which race and partisanship are correlated) was a racial gerrymander.  Reply Brief 11.  Once again, the dissent says the same.  See <i>post</i>, at 7.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the reasoning of <i>Cromartie II </i>belies that reading.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or justify the categorical rule that the State claims to find there.  (Certainly the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s current defense of that rule, see <i>post</i>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311, was nowhere in evidence.)  And given the strangeness of that rule\xe2\x80\x94which would treat a mere form of evidence as the very substance of a constitutional claim, see <i>supra,</i> at 29\xe2\x80\x9331\xe2\x80\x94we cannot think that the Court adopted it without any explanation.  Still more, the entire thrust of the <i>Cromartie II</i> opinion runs counter to an inflexible counter-map requirement.  If the Court had adopted that rule, it would have had no need to weigh each piece of evidence in the case and determine whether, taken together, they were \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d to show \xe2\x80\x9cthe predominance of race in the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s line-drawing process.\xe2\x80\x9d  532 U. S., at 243\xe2\x80\x93244.  But that is exactly what <i>Cromartie II</i> did, over a span of 20 pages and in exhaustive detail.  Item by item, the Court discussed and dismantled the supposed proof, both direct and circumstantial, of race-based redistricting.  All that careful analysis would have been superfluous\xe2\x80\x94that dogged effort wasted\xe2\x80\x94if the Court viewed the absence or inadequacy of a single form of evidence as necessarily dooming a gerrymandering claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Rightly understood, the passage from <i>Cromartie II </i>had a different and narrower point, arising from and reflecting the evidence offered in that case.  The direct evidence of a racial gerrymander, we thought, was extremely weak: We said of one piece that it \xe2\x80\x9csays little or nothing about whether race played a predominant role\xe2\x80\x9d in drawing district lines; we said of another that it \xe2\x80\x9cis less persuasive than the kinds of direct evidence we have found significant in other redistricting cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 253\xe2\x80\x93254 (emphasis deleted).  Nor did the report of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 expert impress us overmuch: In our view, it \xe2\x80\x9coffer[ed] little insight into the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s true motive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 248.  That left a set of arguments of the would-have-could-have variety.  For example, the plaintiffs offered several maps purporting to \xe2\x80\x9cshow how the legislature might have swapped\xe2\x80\x9d some mostly black and mostly white precincts to obtain greater racial balance \xe2\x80\x9cwithout harming [the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s] political objective.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 255 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the Court determined that none of those proposed exchanges would have worked as advertised\xe2\x80\x94essentially, that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cyou could have redistricted differently\xe2\x80\x9d arguments failed on their own terms.  See <i>id.</i>, at 254\xe2\x80\x93257.  Hence emerged the demand quoted above, for maps that would <i>actually</i> show what the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 had not.  In a case like <i>Cromartie II</i>\xe2\x80\x94that is, one in which the plaintiffs had meager direct evidence of a racial gerrymander and needed to rely on evidence of forgone alternatives\xe2\x80\x94only maps of that kind could carry the day.  <i>Id.</i>, at 258.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this case is most unlike <i>Cromartie II</i>, even though it involves the same electoral district some twenty years on.  This case turned not on the possibility of creating more optimally constructed districts, but on direct evidence of the General Assembly\xe2\x80\x99s intent in creating the actual District 12, including many hours of trial testimony subject to credibility determinations.  That evidence, the District Court plausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 burden of debunking North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cit was really politics\xe2\x80\x9d defense; there was no need for an alternative map to do the same job.

Those striking patterns, the mapmaker claimed, were nothing more than the result of his own reliance on voting data from the 2008 Presidential election\xe2\x80\x94because that information (<i>i.e., </i>who voted for Obama and who for McCain) tracked race better than it did party registration.  See App. 1101, 1111\xe2\x80\x931114; cf. <i>Cromartie II</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234,\n245 (2001)\n (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cparty registration and party preference do not always correspond\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we have just recounted, however, the District Court had other reasons to disbelieve Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that he used solely that electoral data to draw District 12\xe2\x80\x99s lines.  See <i>supra</i>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  And Ansolabehere contended that even if Hofeller did so, that choice of data could itself suggest an intent to sort voters by race.  Voting results from a \xe2\x80\x9csingle [Presidential] election with a Black candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d Ansolabehere explained, would be a \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic and unusual\xe2\x80\x9d indicator of future party preference, because of the racial dynamics peculiar to such a match-up.

But if the plaintiffs have already proved by a preponderance of the evidence that race predominated in drawing district lines, then we have no warrant to demand that they jump through additional evidentiary hoops (whether the exercise would cost a hundred dollars or a million, a week\xe2\x80\x99s more time or a year\xe2\x80\x99s).  Or at least that would be so if we followed the usual rules.  Underlying the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view that we should not\xe2\x80\x94that we should instead create a special evidentiary burden\xe2\x80\x94is its belief that \xe2\x80\x9clitigation of this sort\xe2\x80\x9d often seeks to \xe2\x80\x9cobtain in court what [a political party] could not achieve in the political arena,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post</i>, at 9, and so that little is lost by making suits like this one as hard as possible.  But whatever the possible motivations for bringing such suits (and the dissent says it is <i>not</i> questioning \xe2\x80\x9cwhat occurred here,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>), they serve to prevent legislatures from taking unconstitutional districting action\xe2\x80\x94which happens more often than the dissent must suppose.  State lawmakers sometimes misunderstand the VRA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements (as may have occurred here with respect to \xc2\xa75), leading them to employ race as a predominant districting criterion when they should not.  See <i>supra</i>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9324, and n.\xc2\xa010.  Or they may resort to race-based districting for ultimately political reasons, leveraging the strong correlation between race and voting behavior to advance their partisan interests.  See nn. 1, 7, <i>supra</i>.  Or, finally\xe2\x80\x94though we hope less commonly\xe2\x80\x94they may simply seek to suppress the electoral power of minority voters.

Rejecting that explanation, a three-judge court found that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s predominant motive was racial, specifically to pack African-Americans into District 12.  See <i>Cromartie </i>v.<i> Hunt</i>, 133 F. Supp. 2d 407, 420 (EDNC 2000).  But this Court held that this finding of fact was clearly erroneous.  <i>Cromartie II</i>,<i> </i>532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 256.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A critical factor in our analysis was the failure of those challenging the district to come forward with an alternative redistricting map that served the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s political objective as well as the challenged version without producing the same racial effects.

After the 2010 census, the North Carolina Legislature, with the Republicans in the majority, drew the present version of District 12.  The challengers contend that this version violates equal protection because the predominant motive of the legislature was racial: to pack the district with African-American voters.  The legislature responds that its objective was political: to pack the district with Democrats and thus to increase the chances of Republican candidates in neighboring districts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">You might think that the <i>Cromartie II</i> rule would be equally applicable in this case, which does not differ in any relevant particular, but the majority executes a stunning about-face.

See <i>Davis </i>v. <i>Bandemer</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 109,\n129 (1986)\n.  Partisan gerrymandering dates back to the founding, see <i>Vieth</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 274\xe2\x80\x93276 (plural-ity opinion), and while some might find it distasteful, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur prior decisions have made clear that a jurisdiction may engage in constitutional political gerrymandering, even if it so happens that the most loyal Democrats happen to be black Democrats and even if the State were <i>conscious </i>of that fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cromartie I</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 551 (emphasis in original); <i>Vera</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 964 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second factor is that \xe2\x80\x9cracial identification is highly correlated with political affiliation\xe2\x80\x9d in many jurisdictions.  <i>Cromartie II</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 243 (describing correlation in North Carolina).  This phenomenon makes it difficult to distinguish between political and race-based decisionmaking.

Then, at the end of our opinion, we stated:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWe can put the matter more generally as follows: In a case such as this one where majority-minority districts (or the approximate equivalent) are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles.

In this case, as in <i>Cromartie II</i>, the plaintiffs allege a racial gerrymander, and the State\xe2\x80\x99s defense is that political motives explain District 12\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries.  In such a case, <i>Cromartie II </i>instructed, plaintiffs must submit an alternative redistricting map demonstrating that the legislature could have achieved its political goals without the racial effects giving rise to the racial gerrymandering allegation.  But in spite of this instruction, plaintiffs in this case failed to submit such a map.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  See Brief for Appellees 31\xe2\x80\x9336.

When a federal court says that race was a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s predominant purpose in drawing a district, it accuses the legislature of \xe2\x80\x9coffensive and demeaning\xe2\x80\x9d conduct.  <i>Miller</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 912.  Indeed, we have said that racial gerrymanders \xe2\x80\x9cbea[r] an uncomfortable re-semblance to political apartheid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Shaw I</i>, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 647.  That is a grave accusation to level against a state legislature.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ederal-court review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is well settled that reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 915 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Cromartie II</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242.  When a federal court finds that race predominated in the redistricting process, it inserts itself into that process.  That is appropriate\xe2\x80\x94indeed, constitutionally required\xe2\x80\x94if the legislature truly did draw district boundaries on the basis of race.  But if a court mistakes a political gerrymander for a racial gerrymander, it illegitimately invades a traditional domain of state authority, usurping the role of a State\xe2\x80\x99s elected representatives.  This does violence to both the proper role of the Judiciary and the powers reserved to the States under the Constitution.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is a final, often-unstated danger where race and politics correlate: that the federal courts will be transformed into weapons of political warfare.  Unless courts \xe2\x80\x9cexercise extraordinary caution\xe2\x80\x9d in distinguishing race-based redistricting from politics-based redistricting, <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 916,<i> </i>they will invite the losers in the redistricting process to seek to obtain in court what they could not achieve in the political arena.  If the majority party draws districts to favor itself, the minority party can deny the majority its political victory by prevailing on a racial gerrymandering claim.  Even if the minority party loses in court, it can exact a heavy price by using the judicial process to engage in political trench warfare for years on end.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although I do not imply that this is what occurred here, this case <i>does</i> reflect what litigation of this sort can look like.  This is the <i>fifth time</i> that North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s 12th Congressional District has come before this Court since 1993, and we have almost reached a new<i> </i>redistricting cycle without any certainty as to the constitutionality of North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s <i>current</i> redistricting map.  Given these dangers, <i>Cromartie II</i> was justified in crafting an evidentiary rule to prevent false positives.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority nevertheless absolves the challengers of their failure to submit an alternative map.  It argues that an alternative map cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cthe <i>only </i>means\xe2\x80\x9d of proving racial predominance, and it concludes from this that an alternative map \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not matter in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 29\xe2\x80\x9330 (emphasis in original).  But even if there are cases in which a plaintiff could prove a racial gerrymandering claim without an alternative map, they would be exceptional ones in which the evidence of racial predominance is overwhelming.  This most definitely is not one of those cases, see Part III\xe2\x80\x93C, <i>infra</i>, and the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 failure to produce an alternative map mandates reversal.  Moreover, even in an exceptional case, the absence of such a map would still be strong evidence that a district\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries were determined by politics rather than race.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  The absence of a map would \xe2\x80\x9cmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <i>ante</i>, at 30.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority questions the legitimacy of the alternative-map requirement, <i>ante</i>, at 29\xe2\x80\x9331, and n.\xc2\xa015, but the rule is a sound one.  It rests on familiar principles regarding the allocation of the burdens of production and persuasion and the assessment of evidence.  First, in accordance with the general rule in civil cases, plaintiffs in a case like this bear the burden of proving that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s motive was unconstitutional.  Second, what must be shown is not simply that race played a part in the districting process but that it played the predominant role.  Third, a party challenging a districting plan must overcome the strong presumption that the plan was drawn for constitutionally permissible reasons.  <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 915.  Fourth, when those responsible for adopting a challenged plan contend that the plan was devised for partisan political ends, they are making an admission that may not sit well with voters, so the explanation should not be lightly dismissed.  Cf. Fed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3).  And finally, the <i>Cromartie II</i> rule takes into account the difficulty of proving a negative.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For challengers like those in the present case, producing a map that meets the <i>Cromartie II</i> test should not be hard if the predominant reason for a challenged plan really was race and not politics.  Plaintiffs mounting a challenge to a districting plan are almost always sophisticated litigants who have the assistance of experts, and that is certainly true in the present case.  Today, an expert with a computer can easily churn out redistricting maps that control for any number of specified criteria, including prior voting patterns and political party registration.  Therefore, if it is indeed possible to find a map that meets the <i>Cromartie II</i> test, it should not be too hard for the challengers to do so.  The State, on the other hand, cannot prove that no map meeting the <i>Cromartie II</i> test can be drawn.  Even if a State submits, say, 100 alternative maps that fail the test, that would not prove that no such map could pass it.  The relative ease with which the opposing parties can gather evidence is a familiar consideration in allocating the burden of production.  See 1 C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \xc2\xa763, p. 316 (2d ed. 1994); 21 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa75122, pp. 556\xe2\x80\x93557 (1977).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if we set aside the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 failure to submit an alternative map, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that race predominated in the drawing of District 12 is clearly erroneous.  The State offered strong and coherent evidence that politics, not race, was the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s predominant aim, and the evidence supporting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary finding is weak and manifestly inadequate in light of the high evidentiary standard that our cases require challengers to meet in order to prove racial predominance.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">My analysis will proceed in three steps.  First, I will discuss what the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s mapmaker did and why this approach is entirely consistent with his stated political objectives.  Then, I will explain why this approach inevitably had the racial effect to which the challengers object.  Finally, I will address the evidence of racial predominance on which the majority relies and show why it is inadequate to sustain the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In order to understand the mapmaker\xe2\x80\x99s approach, the first element to be kept in mind is that the basic shape of District 12 was legitimately taken as a given.  When a new census requires redistricting, it is a common practice to start with the plan used in the prior map and to change the boundaries of the prior districts only as needed to comply with the one-person, one-vote mandate and to achieve other desired ends.  This approach honors settled expectations and, if the prior plan survived legal challenge, minimizes the risk that the new plan will be overturned.  And that is the approach taken by the veteran mapmaker in the present case, Dr. Thomas Hofeller.  App. 523 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe normal starting point is always from the existing districts\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Dr. Hofeller began with the prior version of District 12 even though that version had a strange, serpentine shape.  <i>Cromartie I</i>, 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 544; App. 1163.  That design has a long history.  It was first adopted in 1992, and subsequent redistricting plans have built on the 1992 plan.  <i>Ibid.  </i>In <i>Cromartie</i> <i>II</i>, we sustained the constitutionality of the 1997 version of District 12, which featured the same basic shape.  See 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 258.  And retention of this same basic shape is not challenged in this case.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Using the prior design as his starting point, Dr. Hofeller assumed that District 12 would remain a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong Democratic distric[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 521.  He stated that he drew \xe2\x80\x9cthe [overall redistricting] plan to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. have an increased number of competitive districts for GOP candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 520, and that he therefore moved more Democratic voters into District 12 in order to \xe2\x80\x9cincrease Republican opportunities in the surrounding districts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 1606.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under the map now before us, District 12 is bordered by four districts.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  Running counterclockwise, they are: District 5 to the northwest; District 9 to the southwest; District 8 to the southeast; and District 6 to the northeast.  See Appendix, <i>ante</i>.  According to Dr. Hofeller, the aim was to make these four districts\xe2\x80\x94considered as a whole\xe2\x80\x94more secure for Republicans.  App. 1606, 2696.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To do this, Dr. Hofeller set out in search of pockets of Democratic voters that could be moved into District 12 from areas adjoining or very close to District 12\xe2\x80\x99s prior boundaries.  Of the six counties through which District 12 passes, the three most heavily Democratic (and also the most populous) are Forsyth, Guilford, and Mecklenburg, which contain the major population centers of Winston-Salem, Greensboro, and Charlotte, respectively.  See 7 Record 480\xe2\x80\x93482; App. 1141.  As a measure of voting preferences, Dr. Hofeller used the results of the then-most recent Presidential election, <i>i.e.</i>, the election of 2008.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1149, 2697, 2721\xe2\x80\x932722.  In that election, these three counties voted strongly for the Democratic candidate, then-Senator Barack Obama, while the other three counties, Cabarrus, Davidson, and Rowan, all voted for the Republican candidate, Senator John McCain.  See 4 Record 1341\xe2\x80\x931342.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two of the three Democratic counties, Forsyth and Guilford, are located at the northern end of District 12, while the other Democratic county, Mecklenburg, is on the southern end.  See Appendix, <i>ante.</i>  The middle of the district (often called the \xe2\x80\x9ccorridor\xe2\x80\x9d) passes through the three more Republican-friendly counties\xe2\x80\x94Cabarrus, Davidson, and Rowan.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Thus, if a mapmaker sat down to increase the proportion of Democrats in District 12 and to reduce the proportion in neighboring districts, the most obvious way to do that was to pull additional Democrats into the district from the north and south (the most populous and heavily Democratic counties) while shifting Republican voters out of the corridor.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That, in essence, is what Dr. Hofeller did\xe2\x80\x94as the majority acknowledges.  <i>Ante</i>, at 6 (Dr. Hofeller \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow[ed District 12\xe2\x80\x99s] already snakelike body while adding areas at either end\xe2\x80\x9d); App. 1150 (Table 1), 1163.  Dr. Hofeller testified that he sought to shift parts of Mecklenburg County out of Districts 8 and 9 (in order to reduce the percentage of Democrats in these two districts) and that this required him to increase the coverage of Mecklenburg County in District 12.  <i>Id</i>., at 1142\xe2\x80\x931143, 1607, 2753.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Dr. Hofeller testified that he also had political plans for the current map\xe2\x80\x99s District 6, which differed substantially from the version in the prior map.  Dr. Hofeller wanted to improve the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 prospects in this new district by minimizing its coverage of Guilford County\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic population.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1143, 1607, 2693, 2697, 2752.  That also meant increasing the population of Guilford County Democrats in District 12.  <i>Id</i>., at 1143, 1607, 2697.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This influx of Democratic voters from the two most populous counties in District 12 required shedding voters elsewhere in order to comply with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s mandate of one-person, one-vote, see <i>Kirkpatrick </i>v. <i>Preisler</i>,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 526\n\xe2\x80\x93531 (1969),[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]<i> </i>and the population removed had to be added to a bordering district.  App. 523.  Parts of Davidson and Rowan Counties were therefore shifted to District 5, <i>id</i>., at 1143, 1150 (Table 1), but Dr. Hofeller testified that this would not have been sufficient to satisfy the one-person, one-vote standard, so he also had to move voters from heavily Democratic Forsyth County into District 5, <i>id</i>., at 1143, 2697, 2752\xe2\x80\x932753.  Doing so did not undermine his political objective, he explained, because District 5 \xe2\x80\x9cwas stronger [for Republicans] to begin with and could take those [Forsyth] Democratic precincts\xe2\x80\x9d without endangering Republican chances in the district.  <i>Id</i>., at 2753; see also <i>id</i>., at 2697.  The end result was that, under the new map now at issue, the three major counties in the north and south constitute a larger percentage of District 12\xe2\x80\x99s total population, while the corridor lost population.  See <i>id</i>., at 1150 (Table 1), 2149 (Finding 187).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A comparison of the 2008 Presidential election vote under the old and new versions of the districts shows the effect of Dr. Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s map.  District 8 (which, of the four districts bordering District 12 under the 2011 map, was the most Democratic district) saw a drop of almost 11% in the Democratic vote under the new map.  See 2 Record 354, 421.  District 9 saw a drop in the percentage of registered Democrats, <i>id.</i>, at 350, 417, although the vote percentage for the Democratic Presidential candidate remained essentially the same (increasing by 0.39%).  <i>Id.</i>, at 354, 421.  District 5, which was heavily Republican under the prior map and was redrawn to absorb Democrats from Forsyth County, saw about a 7-point swing in favor of the Democratic candidate, but it remained a strong Republican district.  <i>Ibid.</i>  New District 6 is less susceptible to comparison because its boundaries are completely different from the district bearing that number under the old plan, but the new District 6 was solidly Republican, with a Republican Presidential vote percentage of nearly 56%.  <i>Ibid.</i>  As stated by the state court that considered and rejected the same constitutional challenge now before us:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cBy increasing the number of Democratic voters in the 2011 Twelfth Congressional District located in Mecklenburg and Guilford Counties, the 2011 Congressional Plan created other districts that were more competitive for Republican candidates as compared to the 2001 versions of these districts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 2150 (Finding 191).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The results of subsequent congressional elections show that Dr. Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s plan achieved its goal.  In 2010, prior to the adoption of the current plan, Democrats won 7 of the 13 districts, including District 8.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  But by 2016, Republicans controlled 10 of the 13 districts, including District 8, and all the Republican candidates for the House of Representatives won their races with at least 56% of the vote.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  In accordance with the map\xe2\x80\x99s design, the only Democratic seats remaining after 2016 were in Districts 1, 4, and 12.  <i>Id.,</i> at 521.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, there is strong evidence in the record to sup-port  Dr. Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that the changes made to the 2001 map were designed to maximize Republican opportunities.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I now turn to the connection between the mapmaker\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and the effect on the percentage of African-Americans in District 12.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As we recognized in <i>Cromartie II</i>, political party preference and race are highly correlated in North Carolina generally and in the area of Congressional District 12 in particular.  App. 2022 (state trial court finding that \xe2\x80\x9cracial identification correlates highly with political affiliation\xe2\x80\x9d in North Carolina).  The challenger\xe2\x80\x99s expert, Dr. Stephen Ansolabehere, corroborated this important point.  Dr. Ansolabehere calculated the statewide correlation between race and voting in 2008[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>] and found a correlation of 0.8, which is \xe2\x80\x9cvery high.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 342, 352 (Table 1).  See also J. Levin, J. Fox, &amp; D. Forde, Elementary Statistics in Social Research 370 (12th ed. 2014); R. Witte &amp; J. Witte, Statistics 138 (10th ed. 2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the area of District 12, the correlation is even higher.  There, Dr. Ansolabehere found that the correlation \xe2\x80\x9capproach[ed] 1,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 342, that is, almost complete overlap.  These black Democrats also constitute a supermajority of Democrats in the area covered by the district.  Under the 2001 version of District 12\xe2\x80\x94which was drawn by Democrats and was never challenged as a racial gerrymander\xe2\x80\x94black registered voters constituted 71.44% of Democrats in the district.  2 Record 350; see also App. 2145 (Finding 173).[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]  What this means is that a mapmaker seeking to pull Democrats into District 12 would unavoidably pull in a very large percentage of African-Americans.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The distribution of Democratic voters magnified this effect.  Dr. Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s plan required the identification of areas of Democratic strength that were near District 12\xe2\x80\x99s prior boundaries.  Dr. Hofeller prepared maps showing the distribution of Democratic voters by precinct,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]  see <i>id</i>., at 1148\xe2\x80\x931149, 1176\xe2\x80\x931177, 1181, and those maps show that these voters were highly concentrated around the major urban areas of Winston-Salem (in Forsyth County), Greensboro (in Guilford County), and Charlotte (in Mecklenberg County).  Dr. Ansolabehere, the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 expert, prepared maps showing the distribution of black registered voters in these same counties, see <i>id</i>., at 322\xe2\x80\x93328; 1 Record 128\xe2\x80\x93133, and a comparison of these two sets of maps reveals that the clusters of Democratic voters generally overlap with those of registered black voters.  In other words, the population of nearby Democrats who could be moved into District 12 was heavily black.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is that, so long as the legislature chose to retain the basic shape of District 12 and to increase the number of Democrats in the district, it was inevitable that the Democrats brought in would be disproportionately black.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">None of this should come as a surprise.  After all, when the basic shape of District 12 was created after the 1990 census, the express goal of the North Carolina Legislature was to create a majority-minority district.  See <i>Shaw I</i>, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 633\xe2\x80\x93636.  It has its unusual shape <i>because</i> it was originally designed to capture pockets of black voters.  See <i>Shaw </i>v. <i>Hunt</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 899\n\xe2\x80\x93906 (1996) (<i>Shaw II</i>).  Although the legislature has modified the district since then, see<i> Cromartie I</i>, 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 544 (describing changes from the 1991 version to the 1997 version),<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cit retains its basic \xe2\x80\x98snakelike\xe2\x80\x99 shape and continues to track Interstate 85.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; 1 Record 35 (Appellees\xe2\x80\x99 Complaint) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongressional District 12 has existed in roughly its current form since 1992, when it was drawn as a majority African-American district .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); see also App. 1163 (showing the 1997, 2001, and 2011 versions of District 12).  The original design of the district was devised to ensure a high concentration of black voters, and as long as the basic design is retained (as it has been), one would expect that to continue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While plaintiffs failed to offer any alternative map, Dr. Hofeller produced a map showing what District 12 would have looked like if his computer was programmed simply to maximize the Democratic vote percentage in the district, while still abiding by the requirement of one-person, one-vote.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1148.  The result was a version of District 12 that is very similar to the version approved by the North Carolina Legislature.  See <i>id</i>., at 1175; <i>id</i>., at 1615\xe2\x80\x931618.  Indeed, this maximum-Democratic plan had a black voting age population of 50.73%, which is actually <i>higher</i> than District 12\xe2\x80\x99s black voting age population of 50.66%.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1154 (Table 5).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, the increase in the black voting age population of District 12 is easily explained by a coherent (and generally successful) political strategy.  <i>Cromartie II</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 245 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] legislature may, by placing reliable Democratic precincts within a district without regard to race, end up with a district containing more heavily African-American precincts, but the reasons would be political rather than racial\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Amazingly, a reader of the majority opinion (and the opinion of the District Court) would remain almost entirely ignorant of the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s political strategy and the relationship between that strategy and the racial composition of District 12.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>]  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is like Hamlet without the prince.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">17</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority focuses almost all its attention on a few references to race by those responsible for the drafting and adoption of the redistricting plan.  But the majority reads far too much into these references.  First, what the plaintiffs had to prove was not simply that race played <i>some </i>role in the districting process but that it was the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s <i>predominant </i>consideration.  Second, as I have explained, a court must exercise \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary caution\xe2\x80\x9d before finding that a state legislature\xe2\x80\x99s predominant reason for a districting plan was racial.  <i>Miller, </i>515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 916.  This means that comments should not be taken out of context and given the most sinister possible meaning.  Third, the findings of the state courts in a virtually identical challenge to District 12 are entitled to respectful consideration.  A North Carolina trial court, after hearing much the same evidence as the court below, found that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s predominant motive was political, not racial.  That decision was affirmed by the North Carolina Supreme Court.  <i>Dickson </i>v<i>.</i> <i>Rucho</i>, 367 N.\xc2\xa0C. 542, 766 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 238 (2014), vacated and remanded, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, aff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99d on remand, 368 N.\xc2\xa0C. 481, 781 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 404 (2015), cert. pending, No. 16\xe2\x80\x9324.  Even if the judgment in the state case does not bar the present case under the doctrine of res judicata, see <i>ante</i>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939, the state-court finding illustrates the thinness of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proof.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, it must be kept in mind that references to race by those responsible for drawing or adopting a redistricting plan are not necessarily evidence that the plan was adopted for improper racial reasons.  Under our precedents, it is unconstitutional for the government to consider race in almost any context, and therefore any mention of race by the decisionmakers may be cause for suspicion.  We have said, however, that that is not so in the redistricting context.  For one thing, a State like North Caro-lina that was either wholly or partially within the coverage of \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 could not redistrict without heeding that provision\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against racial retrogression, see\n\n52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710304(b); <i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus </i>v.<i> Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934), and therefore race had to be kept in mind.  In addition, all legislatures must also take into account the possibility of a challenge under \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act claiming that a plan illegally dilutes the voting strength of a minority community.  See <i>League of United Latin American Citizens </i>v.<i> Perry</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399,\n425 (2006)\n.  If a State ultimately concludes that it must take race into account in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act, it must show that it had a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98strong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x99 in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 22).  But those involved in the redistricting process may legitimately make statements about Voting Rights Act compliance before deciding that the Act does not provide a need for race-based districting.  And it is understandable for such individuals to explain that a race-neutral plan happens to satisfy the criteria on which Voting Rights Act challengers might insist.  In short, because of the Voting Rights Act, consideration and discussion of the racial effects of a plan may be expected.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>The June 17, 2011, Statement</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I begin with a piece of evidence that the majority does <i>not </i>mention, namely, the very first item cited by the District Court in support of its racial-predominance finding.  This evidence consisted of a June 17, 2001, statement by Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis, the state legislators who took the lead in the adoption of the current map.  In that statement, Rucho and Lewis referred to \xe2\x80\x9cconstructing [Voting Rights Act] majority black districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1025.  Seizing upon the use of the plural term \xe2\x80\x9cdistricts,\xe2\x80\x9d the court below seemed to think that it had found a smoking gun.  <i>Harris </i>v. <i>McCrory</i>, 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 600, 616 (MDNC 2016)<i>.</i>  The State had insisted that its plan drew only one majority-minority congressional district, District 1, but since the June 17 statement \xe2\x80\x9cclearly refers to multiple districts that are now majority minority,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid., </i>the court below viewed the statement as telling evidence that an additional congressional district, presumably District 12, had been intentionally designed to be a majority-minority district and was thus based on race.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is a glaring problem with this analysis: The June 17 statement was about <i>state legislative districts</i>, not <i>federal congressional districts</i>.  See App. 1024\xe2\x80\x931033.  The United States, as <i>amicus curiae</i> in support of plaintiffs, concedes that the District Court made a mistake by relying on the June 17 statement.  Brief for United States 27, n.\xc2\xa013.  The majority, by contrast, tries to ignore this error. But the District Court gave the June 17 statement pride-of-place in its opinion, mentioning it first in its analysis, and the District Court seemed to think that this evidence was particularly significant, stating that the reference to multiple districts was not \xe2\x80\x9cthe result of happenstance, a mere slip of the pen.\xe2\x80\x9d  159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 616.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s error shows a troubling lack of precision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>The \xc2\xa75 Preclearance Request</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Under \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act, North Carolina requested preclearance from the Department of Justice shortly after the Legislature approved the new congressional plan.  <i>Id.</i>, at 608.  In its preclearance application, the State noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne of the concerns of the Redistricting Chairs was that in 1992, the Justice Department had objected to the 1991 Congressional Plan because of a failure by the State to create a second majority minority district.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 478.  The application says that the Redistricting Chairs \xe2\x80\x9csought input from Congressman [Mel] Watt[, the African-American incumbent who represented District 12,] regarding options for re-drawing his district,\xe2\x80\x9d and that after this consultation, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Chairs had the impression that Congressman Watt would oppose any redrawing of the Twelfth District .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as originally contemplated by the 1992 Justice Department objection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>The Chairs drew District 12 <i>\xe2\x80\x9c</i>[b]ased in part on this input from Congressman Watt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 478\xe2\x80\x93479.<i> </i>Two sentences later in the same paragraph, the application observed that the black voting age population for District 12 went up from 43.77% to 50.66% and that therefore the district \xe2\x80\x9cmaintains, and in fact increases, the African-American community\xe2\x80\x99s ability to elect their candidate of choice in District 12.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 479.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">According to the majority, this statement shows a \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination to concentrate black voters in District 12.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 23.  In fact, it shows no such thing.  The statement explains that Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis decided <i>not</i> to construct District 12 as a majority-minority district\xe2\x80\x94as the 1992 Justice Department had demanded\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[b]ased in part on\xe2\x80\x9d the input they received from Congressman Watt, whom they thought \xe2\x80\x9cwould oppose\xe2\x80\x9d drawing the district \xe2\x80\x9cas originally contemplated by the 1992 Justice Department objection.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 478\xe2\x80\x93479.  If anything, this document cuts <i>against</i> a finding of racial predominance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statement\xe2\x80\x99s matter-of-fact reference to the increase in District 12\xe2\x80\x99s black voting age population hardly shows that the legislature altered District 12 <i>for the purpose</i> of causing this increase.  An entirely natural interpretation is that the Redistricting Chairs simply reported this fact so that it would be before the Justice Department in the event that the Department had renewed Voting Rights Act concerns.  Only by reading a great deal between the lines and adopting the most sinister possible interpretation can the statement be viewed as pointed evidence of a predominantly racial motive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>The Mel Watt Testimony</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In both the District Court and the state trial court, Congressman Watt testified that, while the redistricting plan was being developed, Senator Rucho invited him to his home to discuss the new boundaries of District 12.  <i>Id.,</i> at 2368\xe2\x80\x932369, 1343\xe2\x80\x931344.  According to Congressman Watt, Senator Rucho said that the Republican leadership wanted him to \xe2\x80\x9cramp the 12th Congressional District up to over 50 percent black\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthey believed it was required .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by the Voting Rights Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1344, 2369, 2393.  In the state proceedings, Senator Rucho denied making any such statement, <i>id.,</i> at 1703, and another state legislator present at the meeting, Representative Ruth Samuelson, gave similar testimony, <i>id.,</i> at 1698.  Neither Senator Rucho nor Representative Samuelson testified in federal court (although their state court testimony was made part of the federal record).  See <i>id.,</i> at 2847.  But the District Court credited Congressman Watt\xe2\x80\x99s testimony based on its assessment of his demeanor and the consistency of his recollection, 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 617\xe2\x80\x93618, and I accept that credibility finding for purposes of our review.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">18</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But even assuming that Congressman Watt\xe2\x80\x99s recollection was completely accurate, all that his testimony shows is that legislative leaders <i>at one point in the process</i> thought that they had to draw District 12 as a majority-minority district in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act; it does <i>not</i> show that they actually <i>did</i> draw District 12 with the goal of creating a majority-minority district.  And as explained in the discussion of the preclearance request above, Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis stated that they ultimately turned away from the creation of a majority-minority district after consulting with Congressman Watt.  <i>\xe2\x80\x9c</i>Based in part on this input from Congressman Watt,\xe2\x80\x9d they said they decided <i>not</i> to draw the district as the 1992 Department of Justice had suggested\xe2\x80\x94that is, as a majority-minority district.  App. 478\xe2\x80\x93479.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This account is fully consistent with Congressman Watt\xe2\x80\x99s testimony about his meeting with Senator Rucho.  Congressman Watt noted that Senator Rucho was uncomfortable with the notion of increasing the black voting age population, <i>id.,</i> at 2369, 2393,<i> </i>and Congressman Watt testified that he told Senator Rucho that he was opposed to the idea,  <i>id.,</i> at 1345, 2369, 2393.  So it makes sense that Senator Rucho was dissuaded from taking that course by Congressman Watt\xe2\x80\x99s reaction.  And Dr. Hofeller consistently testified that he was never asked to meet a particular black voting age population target, see Part III\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x935, <i>infra, </i>and that<i> </i>the only data displayed on his screen when he drew District 12 was political data.  See <i>infra</i>, at 27, n. 19.  Thus, Congressman Watt\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, even if taken at face value, is entirely consistent with what the preclearance request recounts: After initially contemplating the possibility of drawing District 12 as a majority-minority district, the legislative leadership met with Congressman Watt, who convinced them not to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">4</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>Dr. Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s Statements About Guilford County</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Under the prior map, both Guilford County and the Greensboro African-American community were divided between the 12th and 13th Districts.  This had been done, Dr. Hofeller explained, \xe2\x80\x9cto make both the Old 12th and 13th Districts strongly Democratic.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1103; see also <i>id.,</i> at 555, 2821; 1 Record 132\xe2\x80\x93133 (showing racial demographics of Guilford precincts under 2001 and 2011 maps).  But the Republican legislature wanted to make the area surrounding District 12 more Republican.  The new map eliminated the old 13th District and created a new district bearing that number farther to the east.  The territory to the north of Greensboro that had previously been in the 13th District was placed in a new district, District 6, which was constructed to be a Republican-friendly district, and the new map moved more of the Greensboro area into the new District 12.  This move was entirely consistent with the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s stated goal of concentrating Democrats in the 12th District and mak-ing the surrounding districts hospitable to Republican candidates.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Dr. Hofeller testified that the placement of the Greensboro African-American community in the 12th District was the result of this political strategy.  He stated that the portion of Guilford County absorbed by District 12 \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t moved into CD\xc2\xa012 because it had a substantial black population.  It was moved into CD\xc2\xa012 because it had a substantial Democratic political voting record\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 2824.  And Dr. Hofeller maintained that he was never instructed to draw District 12 as a majority-minority district or to increase the district\xe2\x80\x99s black voting age population.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>id.,</i> at 520, 556\xe2\x80\x93558, 1099, 1603\xe2\x80\x931604, 2682\xe2\x80\x932683, 2789.  Instead, he testified that political considerations determined the boundaries of District 12 and that the only data displayed on his computer screen when he drew the challenged map was voting data from the 2008 Presidential election.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">19</a>]  <i>Id.,</i> at 1149, 2697, 2721\xe2\x80\x932722.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Dr. Hofeller acknowledged, however, that there had been concern about the possibility of a Voting Rights Act challenge to this treatment of the Greensboro African-American community.  Guilford County was covered by \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act, and as noted, \xc2\xa75 prohibits retrogression.  Under the old map, the Guilford County African-American community was split between the old District 13 and District 12, and in both of those districts, black voters were able to elect the candidates of their choice by allying with white Democratic voters.  Under the new map, however, if the Greensboro black community had been split between District 12 and the new Republican-friendly District 6, the black voters in the latter district would be unlikely to elect the candidate of their choice.  Placing the African-American community in District 12 avoided this consequence.  Even Congressman Watt conceded that there were potential \xc2\xa75 concerns relating to the black community in Guilford County.  <i>Id.,</i> at 2387\xe2\x80\x932388.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The thrust of many of Dr. Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s statements about the treatment of Guilford County was that the reuniting of the Greensboro black community in District 12 was nothing more than a welcome byproduct of his political strat-egy.  He testified that he <i>first</i> drew the district based on political considerations and <i>then</i> checked to ensure that Guilford County\xe2\x80\x99s black population was not fractured.  <i>Id.,</i> at 2822 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen we checked it, we found that we did not have an issue in Guilford County with fracturing the black .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. community\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>id.,</i> at 556, 2821, 2823.  This testimony is entirely innocuous.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is no doubt, however, that Dr. Hofeller also made a few statements that may be read to imply that concern about Voting Rights Act litigation was part of the motivation for the treatment of Guilford County.  He testified at trial that he \xe2\x80\x9cwas instructed [not] to use race in any form <i>except perhaps with regard to Guilford County</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 2791 (emphasis added).  See <i>id.,</i> at 1103 (the legislature \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined that it was prudent to reunify the African-American community in Guilford County\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 558 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t was decided to reunite the black community in Guilford County into the Twelfth\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These statements by Dr. Hofeller convinced the District Court that the drawing of District 12 was not a \xe2\x80\x9cpurely .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. politically driven affair.\xe2\x80\x9d  159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 619.  But in order to prevail, the plaintiffs had to show much more\xe2\x80\x94that race was the <i>predominant</i> reason for the drawing of District 12, and these few bits of testimony fall far short of that showing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our decision in <i>Cromartie II</i> illustrates this point.  In that case, the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s mapmaker made a statement that is remarkably similar to Dr. Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s.  Gerry Cohen, the \xe2\x80\x9clegislative staff member responsible for drafting districting plans,\xe2\x80\x9d reported: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I have moved Greensboro Black community into the 12th, and now need to take [about] 60,000 out of the 12th.  I await your direction on this.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 254.  This admission did not persuade the Court that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s predominant motive was racial.  The majority ignores this obvious parallel with <i>Cromartie II</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, in an attempt to magnify the importance of the treatment of Guilford County, the majority plays games with statistics.  It states that \xe2\x80\x9cDistrict 12 saw a net increase of more than 25,000 black voters in Guilford County, relative to a net gain of fewer than 35,000 across the district: So the newly added parts of that county played a major role in pushing the district\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP over 50%.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 26.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This is highly misleading.  First, since the black voting age population of District 12 is just barely over 50%\xe2\x80\x94specifically, 50.66%\xe2\x80\x94almost <i>any</i> decision that increased the number of voting age blacks in District 12 could be said to have \xe2\x80\x9cplayed a major role in pushing the district\xe2\x80\x99s BVAP over 50%.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the majority provides the total number of voting age blacks added to District 12 from Guilford County (approximately 25,000) alongside the total number of voting age blacks added to the district (approximately 35,000), and this has the effect of making Guilford County look like it is the overwhelming contributor to the district\xe2\x80\x99s net increase in black voting age population.  In truth, Mecklenburg County was by far the greatest contributor of voting age blacks to District 12 in both absolute terms (approximately 147,000) and in terms of new voting age blacks (approximately 37,000).  See App. 384, 500\xe2\x80\x93502.  Indeed, if what matters to the majority is how much individual counties increased District 12\xe2\x80\x99s black voting age population percentage, Davidson County deserves attention as well, since the portion of the county within District 12 lost over 26,000 more voting age whites than blacks.  <i>Ibid.  </i>That is greater than the net number of voting age blacks added to the district by Guilford County or Mecklenburg County.  <i>Ibid.</i>  As with so much in the majority opinion, the issue here is more nuanced\xe2\x80\x94and much more favorable to the State\xe2\x80\x94than the majority would have it seem.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">5</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>The July 1, 2011, Statement</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For reasons similar to those just explained, the majority makes far too much of a statement issued by Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis on July 1, 2011, when the new districting plan was proposed.  Particularly in light of Dr. Hofeller\xe2\x80\x99s later testimony about the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s partisan objectives, it is apparent that this statement does not paint an entirely reliable picture of the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s aims.  The statement begins with this proclamation: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the beginning, our goal has remained the same: the development of fair and legal congressional and legislative districts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 353, and the statement seriously downplays the role of politics in the map-drawing process, acknowledging only that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have not been ignorant of the partisan impacts of the districts we have created,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 361.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statement discusses the treatment of Guilford County in a section with the heading \xe2\x80\x9cCompliance with the Voting Rights Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 355\xe2\x80\x93358.  In that section, Rucho and Lewis state: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the presence of Guilford County in the Twelfth District, we have drawn our proposed Twelfth District at a black voting age level that is above the percentage of black voting age population found in the current Twelfth District.  We believe that this measure will ensure preclearance of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 358.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority and the District Court interpret this passage to say that Rucho and Lewis decided to move black voters from Guilford County into District 12 in order to ward off Voting Rights Act liability.  <i>Ante</i>, at 22 (\xe2\x80\x9c<i>Because of</i> the VRA, [Rucho and Lewis] increased the number of African-Americans\xe2\x80\x9d in District 12 (citing 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 617; emphasis in original)).  But that is hardly the only plausible interpretation.  The statement could just as easily be understood as \xe2\x80\x9can explanation by [the] legislature that <i>because</i> they chose to add Guilford County back into CD\xc2\xa012, the district ended up with an increased ability to elect African-American candidates, rather than the legislature explaining that they chose to add Guilford County back into CD\xc2\xa012 because of the [racial] results that addition created.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 635 (Osteen, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis in original).  And because we are obligated to presume the good faith of the North Carolina Legislature, this latter interpretation is the appropriate one.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But even if one adopts the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, it adds little to the analysis.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s close and incriminating reading of a statement issued to win public support for the new plan may represent poetic justice: Having attempted to blur the partisan aim of the new District 12, the legislature is hoisted on its own petard.  But poetic justice is not the type of justice that we are supposed to dispense.  This statement is <i>some</i> evidence that race played a role in the drawing of District 12, but it is a mistake to give this political statement too much weight.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Again, we made precisely this point in <i>Cromartie II</i>.  There, the \xe2\x80\x9clegislative redistricting leader,\xe2\x80\x9d then-Senator Roy Cooper, testified before a legislative committee that the proposed plan \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98provides for .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>racial</i> and partisan <i>balance</i>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253 (emphasis added).  The District Court read the statement literally and concluded that the district had been drawn with a racial objective.  <i>Ibid.</i>  But this Court dismissed the statement, reasoning that although \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase shows that the legislature considered race, along with other partisan and geographic considerations; .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. it says little or nothing about whether race played a <i>predominant</i> role comparatively speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What was good in <i>Cromartie II</i> should also be good here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">6</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>Dr. Ansolabehere\xe2\x80\x99s Testimony</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, the majority cites Dr. Ansolabehere\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that black registered voters in the counties covered by District 12 were more likely to be drawn into District 12 than white registered voters and that black registered Democrats were more likely to be pulled in than white registered Democrats.  <i>Ante</i>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is an obvious flaw in Dr. Ansolabehere\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  He assumed that, if race was not the driving force behind the drawing of District 12, \xe2\x80\x9cwhite and black registered voters would have approximately the same likelihood of inclusion in a given Congressional District.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 2597 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that would be true only if black and white voters were <i>evenly distributed</i> throughout the region, and his own maps showed that this was not so.  See <i>id.,</i> at 322\xe2\x80\x93328; 1 Record 128\xe2\x80\x93133.  Black voters were concentrated in the cities located at the north and south ends of the district and constituted a supermajority of Democrats in the area covered by District 12.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93B, <i>supra</i>.<i> </i>As long as the basic shape of the district was retained, moving Democrats from areas outside but close to the old district boundaries naturally picked up far more black Democrats than white Democrats.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This explanation eluded Dr. Ansolabehere because he refused to consider either the implications of the political strategy that the legislature claimed to have pursued or the effects of the changes to District 12 on the surrounding districts.  App. 2578\xe2\x80\x932582.  The result was a distorted\xe2\x80\x94and largely useless\xe2\x80\x94analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Reviewing the evidence outlined above,[<a href="#F20" name="T20">20</a>] two themes emerge.  First, District 12\xe2\x80\x99s borders and racial composition are readily explained by political considerations and the effects of the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s political strategy on the demographics of District 12.  Second, the majority largely ignores this explanation, as did the court below, and instead adopts the most damning interpretation of all available evidence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Both of these analytical maneuvers violate our clearly established precedent.

See <i>Holder </i>v. <i>Hall</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 874\n\xe2\x80\x93923 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As to District 12, I agree with the Court that the District Court did not clearly err when it determined that race was North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s predominant motive in drawing the district.

The Court reached the contrary conclusion in <i>Cromartie II</i> only by misapplying our deferential standard for reviewing factual findings.  See <i>id.,</i> at 259\xe2\x80\x93262.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not repeat <i>Cromartie II</i>\xe2\x80\x99s error, and indeed it confines that case to its particular facts.
