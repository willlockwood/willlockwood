The plaintiff unions allege that, in violation of the antitrust laws, the multiemployer association and its members coerced certain third parties, as well as some of the association\'s members, to enter into business relationships with nonunion firms.  This coercion, according to the complaint, adversely affected the trade of certain unionized firms, and thereby restrained the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 459 U. S. 521</a></p><p> business activities of the unions.  The question presented is whether the complaint sufficiently alleges that the unions have been "injured in [their] business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws," and may therefore recover treble damages under \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act.  38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15.  Unlike the majority of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, we agree with the District Court\'s conclusion that the complaint is insufficient.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The two named plaintiffs (the Union) -- the California State Council of Carpenters and the Carpenters 46 Northern Counties Conference Board -- are affiliated with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, AFL-CIO.  The Union represents more than 50,000 individuals employed by the defendants in the carpentry, drywall, piledriving, and related industries throughout the State of California.  The Union\'s complaint is filed as a class action on behalf of numerous affiliated local unions and district councils.  The defendants are Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. (Associated), a membership corporation composed of various building and construction contractors, approximately 250 members of Associated who are identified by name in an exhibit attached to the complaint, and 1,000 unidentified coconspirators.</p>\n<p>The Union and Associated, and their respective predecessors, have been parties to collective bargaining agreements governing the terms and conditions of employment in construction-related industries in California for over 25 years.  The wages and other benefits paid pursuant to these agreements amount to more than $750 million per year.  In addition, approximately 3,000 contractors who are not members of Associated have entered into separate "memorandum agreements" with the Union, which bind them to the terms of the master collective bargaining agreements between the Union and Associated.  The amended complaint does not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 459 U. S. 522</a></p><p> state the number of nonsignatory employers or the number of nonunion employees who are active in the relevant market.</p>\n<p>In paragraphs 23 and 24 of the amended complaint, the Union alleges the factual basis for five different damages claims. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Paragraph 23 alleges generally that the defendants conspired to abrogate and weaken the collective bargaining relationship between the Union and the signatory employers.  In seven subsections, paragraph 24 sets forth activities allegedly committed pursuant to the conspiracy.  The most specific allegations relate to the labor relations between the parties. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The complaint\'s description of actions affecting nonparties is both brief and vague.  It is alleged that defendants</p>\n<p>"(3) Advocated, encouraged, induced, and aided nonmembers of defendant Associated General Contractors of California, Inc., to refuse to enter into collective bargaining relationships with plaintiffs and each of them;"</p>\n<p>"(4) Advocated, encouraged, induced, <em>coerced,</em> aided and encouraged owners of land and other letters of construction contracts to hire contractors and subcontractors who are not signatories to collective bargaining agreements with plaintiffs and each of them; "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="523">Page 459 U. S. 523</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"(5) Advocated, induced, <em>coerced,</em> encouraged, and aided members of Associated General Contractors of California, Inc., nonmembers of Associated General Contractors of California, Inc., and \'memorandum contractors\' to enter into subcontracting agreements with subcontractors who are not signatories to any collective bargaining agreements with plaintiffs and each of them. . . ."</p>\n<p>App. E to Pet. for Cert. 17-19 (emphasis added). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Paragraph 25 describes the alleged "purpose and effect" of these activities:  first, "to weaken, destroy, and restrain the trade of certain contractors," who were either members of Associated or memorandum contractors who had signed agreements with the Union; and second, to restrain "the free exercise of the business activities of plaintiffs and each of them." [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Plaintiffs claim that these alleged antitrust violations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="524">Page 459 U. S. 524</a></p><p> caused them $25 million in damages. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The complaint does not identify any specific component of this damages claim.</p>\n<p>After hearing "lengthy oral argument" and after receiving two sets of written briefs, one filed before and the second filed after this Court\'s decision in <em>Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/616/case.html">421 U. S. 616</a></span> (1975), the District Court dismissed the complaint, including the federal antitrust claim.  404 F.Supp. 1067 (ND Cal.1975). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The court observed that the complaint alleged "a rather vague, general conspiracy," and that the allegations "appear typical of disputes a union might have with an employer," which, in the normal course, are resolved by grievance and arbitration or by the NLRB.  <em>Id.</em> at 1069. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Without seeking to clarify or further amend the first amended complaint, the Union filed its notice of appeal on October 9, 1975.</p>\n<p>Over five years later, on November 20, 1980, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\'s dismissal of the Union\'s federal antitrust claim.  648 F.2d 527. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The majority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="525">Page 459 U. S. 525</a></p><p> of the Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court\'s characterization of the antitrust claim; it adopted a construction of the amended complaint which is somewhat broader than the allegations in the pleading itself. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The Court of Appeals held (1) that a Sherman Act violation -- a group boycott -- had been alleged, <em>id.</em> at 531-532; (2) that the defendants\' conduct was not within the antitrust exemption for labor activities, <em>id.</em> at 532-536; and (3) that the plaintiffs had standing to recover damages for the injury to their own business activities occasioned by the defendants\' "industry-wide boycott against all subcontractors with whom the Unions had signed agreements. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 537.  In support of the Union\'s standing, the majority reasoned that the Union was within the area of the economy endangered by a breakdown of competitive conditions, not only because injury to the Union was a foreseeable consequence of the antitrust violation, but also because that injury was specifically intended by the defendants.  The court noted that its conclusion was consistent with other cases holding that union organizational </p><p><a class="page-number" name="526">Page 459 U. S. 526</a></p><p> and representational activities constitute a form of business protected by the antitrust laws. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>As the case comes to us, we must assume that the Union can prove the facts alleged in its amended complaint.  It is not, however, proper to assume that the Union can prove facts that it has not alleged, or that the defendants have violated the antitrust laws in ways that have not been alleged. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>We first note that the Union\'s most specific claims of injury involve matters that are not subject to review under the antitrust laws.  The amended complaint alleges that the defendants have breached their collective bargaining agreements in various ways, and that they have manipulated their corporate names and corporate status in order to divert business to nonunion divisions or firms that they actually control.  Such deceptive diversion of business to the nonunion portion of a so-called "double-breasted" operation might constitute a breach of contract, an unfair labor practice, or perhaps even a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="527">Page 459 U. S. 527</a></p><p> common law fraud or deceit, but in the context of the bargaining relationship between the parties to this litigation, such activities are plainly not subject to review under the federal antitrust laws. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Similarly, the charge that the defendants "advocated, encouraged, induced, and aided nonmembers . . . to refuse to enter into collective bargaining relationships" with the Union (\xef\xbf\xbd 24(3)) does not describe an antitrust violation. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The Union\'s antitrust claims arise from alleged restraints caused by defendants in the market for construction contracting and subcontracting. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The complaint alleges that defendants "coerced" [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] two classes of persons:  (1) landowners and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="528">Page 459 U. S. 528</a></p><p> others who let construction contracts, <em>i.e.,</em> the defendants\' customers and potential customers; and (2) general contractors, <em>i.e.,</em> defendants\' competitors and defendants themselves.  Coercion against the members of both classes was designed to induce them to give some of their business -- but not necessarily all of it -- to nonunion firms. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Although the pleading does not allege that the coercive conduct increased the aggregate share of nonunion firms in the market, it does allege that defendants\' activities weakened and restrained the trade "of certain contractors."  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em>  Thus, particular victims of coercion may have diverted particular contracts to nonunion firms, and thereby caused certain unionized subcontractors to lose some business.</p>\n<p>We think the Court of Appeals properly assumed that such coercion might violate the antitrust laws. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  An agreement to restrain trade may be unlawful even though it does not entirely exclude its victims from the market.  <em>See Associated Press v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/1/case.html">326 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/1/case.html#17">326 U. S. 17</a></span> (1945).  Coercive activity that prevents its victims from making free choices between market alternatives is inherently destructive of competitive conditions, and may be condemned even without proof of its actual market effect.  <em>Cf. Klors, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/207/case.html">359 U. S. 207</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/207/case.html#210">359 U. S. 210</a></span>-214 (1959). [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="529">Page 459 U. S. 529</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Even though coercion directed by defendants at third parties in order to restrain the trade of "certain" contractors and subcontractors may have been unlawful, it does not, of course, necessarily follow that still another party -- the Union -- is a person injured by reason of a violation of the antitrust laws within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We first consider the language in the controlling statute.  <em>See Consumer Product Safety Comm\'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/102/case.html">447 U. S. 102</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/102/case.html#108">447 U. S. 108</a></span> (1980).  The class of persons who may maintain a private damages action under the antitrust laws is broadly defined in \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15.  That section provides:</p>\n<p>"Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney\'s fee."</p>\n<p>A literal reading of the statute is broad enough to encompass every harm that can be attributed directly or indirectly to the consequences of an antitrust violation.  Some of our prior cases have paraphrased the statute in an equally expansive way. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  But before we hold that the statute is as broad as its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="530">Page 459 U. S. 530</a></p><p> words suggest, we must consider whether Congress intended such an open-ended meaning.</p>\n<p>The critical statutory language was originally enacted in 1890 as \xc2\xa7 7 of the Sherman Act.  26 Stat. 210.  The legislative history of the section shows that Congress was primarily interested in creating an effective remedy for consumers who were forced to pay excessive prices by the giant trusts and combinations that dominated certain interstate markets. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  That history supports a broad construction of this remedial provision.  A proper interpretation of the section cannot, however, ignore the larger context in which the entire statute was debated. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="531">Page 459 U. S. 531</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The repeated references to the common law in the debates that preceded the enactment of the Sherman Act make it clear that Congress intended the Act to be construed in the light of its common law background. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Senator Sherman stated that the bill</p>\n<p>"does not announce a new principle of law, but applies old and well-recognized principles of the common law to the complicated jurisdiction of our State and Federal Government. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]"</p>\n<p>Thus, our comments on the need for judicial interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1 are equally applicable to \xc2\xa7 7:</p>\n<p>"One problem presented by the language of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act is that it cannot mean what it says.  The statute says that \'every\' contract that restrains trade is unlawful.  But, as Mr. Justice Brandeis perceptively noted, restraint is the very essence of every contract; read literally, \xc2\xa7 1 would outlaw the entire body of private contract law. . . ."</p>\n<p>"Congress, however, did not intend the text of the Sherman Act to delineate the full meaning of the statute or its application in concrete situations.  The legislative history makes it perfectly clear that it expected the courts to give shape to the statute\'s broad mandate by drawing on common law tradition."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/679/case.html">National Society of</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="532">Page 459 U.

Just as the substantive content of the Sherman Act draws meaning from its common law antecedents, so must we consider the contemporary legal context in which Congress acted when we try to ascertain the intended scope of the private remedy created by \xc2\xa7 7.</p>\n<p>In 1890, notwithstanding general language in many state constitutions providing in substance that "every wrong shall have a remedy," [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] a number of judge-made rules circumscribed the availability of damages recoveries in both tort and contract litigation -- doctrines such as foreseeability and proximate cause, [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] directness of injury, [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] certainty of damages, [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="533">Page 459 U. S. 533</a></p><p> and privity of contract. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Although particular common law limitations were not debated in Congress, the frequent references to common law principles imply that Congress simply assumed that antitrust damages litigation would be subject to constraints comparable to well-accepted common law rules applied in comparable litigation. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>The federal judges who first confronted the task of giving meaning to \xc2\xa7 7 so understood the congressional intent.  Thus, in 1910, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held as a matter of law that neither a creditor nor a stockholder of a corporation that was injured by a violation of the antitrust laws could recover treble damages under \xc2\xa7 7.  <em>Loeb v. Eastman</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 459 U. S. 534</a></p><p> <em>Kodak Co.,</em> 183 F. 704.  The court explained that the plaintiff\'s injury as a stockholder was "indirect, remote, and consequential."  <em>Id.</em> at 709. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  This holding was consistent with Justice Holmes\' explanation of a similar construction of the remedial provision of the Interstate Commerce Act a few years later:  "The general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step."  <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/245/531/case.html">245 U.

[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  When Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act in 1914, and when it reenacted that section in 1955, 69 Stat. 282, it adopted the language of \xc2\xa7 7 and presumably also the judicial gloss that avoided a simple literal interpretation.</p>\n<p>As this Court has observed, the lower federal courts have been</p>\n<p>"virtually unanimous in concluding that Congress did not intend the antitrust laws to provide a remedy in damages for all injuries that might conceivably be traced to an antitrust violation."</p>\n<p><em>Hawaii v.

Just last Term we stated:</p>\n<p>"An antitrust violation may be expected to cause ripples of harm to flow through the Nation\'s economy; but, \'despite the broad wording of \xc2\xa7 4, there is a point beyond which the wrongdoer should not be held liable.\'  [<em>Illinois</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="535">Page 459 U.

Instead, as was required in common law damages litigation in 1890, the question requires us to evaluate the plaintiff\'s harm, the alleged wrongdoing by the defendants, and the relationship between them. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>There is a similarity between the struggle of common law judges to articulate a precise definition of the concept of "proximate cause" [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] and the struggle of federal judges to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="536">Page 459 U. S. 536</a></p><p> articulate a precise test to determine whether a party injured by an antitrust violation may recover treble damages. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  It is common ground that the judicial remedy cannot encompass every conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing.  In both situations, the infinite variety of claims that may arise make it virtually impossible to announce a blackletter rule that will dictate the result in every case. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Instead, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 459 U. S. 537</a></p><p> previously decided cases identify factors that circumscribe and guide the exercise of judgment in deciding whether the law affords a remedy in specific circumstances.</p>\n<p>The factors that favor judicial recognition of the Union\'s antitrust claim are easily stated.  The complaint does allege a causal connection between an antitrust violation and harm to the Union and further alleges that the defendants intended to cause that harm.  As we have indicated, however, the mere fact that the claim is literally encompassed by the Clayton Act does not end the inquiry.  We are also satisfied that an allegation of improper motive, although it may support a plaintiff\'s damages claim under \xc2\xa7 4, [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>] is not a panacea that will enable any complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  Indeed, in <em>McCready,</em> we specifically held:  "The availability of the \xc2\xa7 4 remedy to some person who claims its benefit is not a question of the specific intent of the conspirators."  457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/465/case.html#479">457 U. S. 479</a></span>. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 459 U. S. 538</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A number of other factors may be controlling.  In this case, it is appropriate to focus on the nature of the plaintiff\'s alleged injury.  As the legislative history shows, the Sherman Act was enacted to assure customers the benefits of price competition, and our prior cases have emphasized the central interest in protecting the economic freedom of participants in the relevant market. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Last Term in <em>Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, supra,</em> we identified the relevance of this central policy to a determination of the plaintiff\'s right to maintain an action under \xc2\xa7 4.  McCready alleged that she was a consumer of psychotherapeutic services and that she had been injured by the defendants\' conspiracy to restrain competition in the market for such services. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  The Court stressed the fact that "McCready\'s injury was of a type that Congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the antitrust laws."  457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/465/case.html#483">457 U. S. 483</a></span>, citing <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/477/case.html">429 U.

After noting that her injury "was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict on psychologists and the psychotherapy market," 457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/465/case.html#484">457 U. S. 484</a></span>, the Court concluded that such an injury "falls squarely within the area of congressional concern."  <em>Ibid.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 459 U. S. 539</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In this case, however, the Union was neither a consumer nor a competitor in the market in which trade was restrained. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  It is not clear whether the Union\'s interests would be served or disserved by enhanced competition in the market.  As a general matter, a union\'s primary goal is to enhance the earnings and improve the working conditions of its membership; that goal is not necessarily served, and indeed may actually be harmed, by uninhibited competition among employers striving to reduce costs in order to obtain a competitive advantage over their rivals. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  At common law -- as well as in the early days of administration of the federal antitrust laws -- the collective activities of labor unions were regarded as a form of conspiracy in restraint of trade. [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  Federal policy has since developed not only a broad labor exemption from the antitrust laws, [<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>] but also a separate body of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 459 U. S. 540</a></p><p> labor law specifically designed to protect and encourage the organizational and representational activities of labor unions.  Set against this background, a union, in its capacity as bargaining representative, will frequently not be part of the class the Sherman Act was designed to protect, especially in disputes with employers with whom it bargains.  In each case, its alleged injury must be analyzed to determine whether it is of the type that the antitrust statute was intended to forestall.  <em>See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/477/case.html#487">429 U. S. 487</a></span>-488.  In this case, particularly in light of the longstanding collective bargaining relationship between the parties, the Union\'s labor-market interests seem to predominate, and the <em>Brunswick</em> test is not satisfied.</p>\n<p>An additional factor is the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury.  In this case, the chain of causation between the Union\'s injury and the alleged restraint in the market for construction subcontracts contains several somewhat vaguely defined links.  According to the complaint, defendants applied coercion against certain landowners and other contracting parties in order to cause them to divert business from certain union contractors to nonunion contractors. [<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>]  As a result, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="541">Page 459 U. S. 541</a></p><p> the Union\'s complaint alleges, the Union suffered unspecified injuries in its "business activities." [<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]  It is obvious that any such injuries were only an indirect result of whatever harm may have been suffered by "certain" construction contractors and subcontractors. [<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]</p>\n<p>If either these firms or the immediate victims of coercion by defendants have been injured by an antitrust violation, their injuries would be direct and, as we held in <em>McCready,</em> they would have a right to maintain their own treble damages actions against the defendants.  An action on their behalf would encounter none of the conceptual difficulties that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 459 U. S. 542</a></p><p> encumber the Union\'s claim. [<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>]  The existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement diminishes the justification for allowing a more remote party such as the Union to perform the office of a private attorney general. [<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>]  Denying the Union a remedy on the basis of its allegations in this case is not likely to leave a significant antitrust violation undetected or unremedied.</p>\n<p>Partly because it is indirect, and partly because the alleged effects on the Union may have been produced by independent factors, the Union\'s damages claim is also highly speculative.  There is, for example, no allegation that any collective bargaining agreement was terminated as a result of the coercion, no allegation that the aggregate share of the contracting market controlled by union firms has diminished, no allegation that the number of employed union members has declined, and no allegation that the Union\'s revenues in the form of dues or initiation fees have decreased.  Moreover, although coercion against certain firms is alleged, there is no assertion that any such firm was prevented from doing business with any union firms, or that any firm or group of firms was subjected to a complete boycott.  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a> <a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a> and  <a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a> <em>supra.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 459 U. S. 543</a></p><p> Other than the alleged injuries flowing from breaches of the collective bargaining agreements -- injuries that would be remediable under other laws -- nothing but speculation informs the Union\'s claim of injury by reason of the alleged unlawful coercion.  Yet, as we have recently reiterated, it is appropriate for \xc2\xa7 4 purposes "to consider whether a claim rests at bottom on some abstract conception or speculative measure of harm."  <em>Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready,</em> 457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/465/case.html#475">457 U. S. 475</a></span>, n. 11, citing <em>Hawaii v.

[<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>]</p>\n<p>The indirectness of the alleged injury also implicates the strong interest, identified in our prior cases, in keeping the scope of complex antitrust trials within judicially manageable limits. [<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]  These cases have stressed the importance of avoiding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 459 U. S. 544</a></p><p> either the risk of duplicate recoveries on the one hand, or the danger of complex apportionment of damages on the other.  Thus, in <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/481/case.html">392 U. S. 481</a></span> (1968), we refused to allow the defendants to discount the plaintiffs\' damages claim to the extent that overcharges had been passed on to the plaintiffs\' customers.  We noted that any attempt to ascertain damages with such precision "would often require additional long and complicated proceedings involving massive evidence and complicated theories."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/481/case.html#493">392 U.

S. 720</a></span> (1977), we held that treble damages could not be recovered by indirect purchasers of concrete blocks who had paid an enhanced price because their suppliers had been victimized by a price-fixing conspiracy.  We observed that potential plaintiffs at each level in the distribution chain would be in a position to assert conflicting claims to a common fund, the amount of the alleged overcharge, thereby creating the danger of multiple liability for the fund and prejudice to absent plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>"Permitting the use of pass-on theories under \xc2\xa7 4 essentially would transform treble damages actions into massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge from direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate consumers.  However appealing this attempt to allocate the overcharge might seem in theory, it would add whole new dimensions of complexity to treble-damages suits, and seriously undermine their effectiveness."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/720/case.html#737">431 U. S. 737</a></span>-738.</p>\n<p>The same concerns should guide us in determining whether the Union is a proper plaintiff under \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act. [<a href="#F51" name="T51">Footnote 51</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="545">Page 459 U. S. 545</a></p><p> As the Court wrote in <em>Illinois Brick,</em> massive and complex damages litigation not only burdens the courts, but also undermines the effectiveness of treble damages suits.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/720/case.html#745">431 U. S. 745</a></span>.  In this case, if the Union\'s complaint asserts a claim for damages under \xc2\xa7 4, the District Court would face problems of identifying damages and apportioning them among directly victimized contractors and subcontractors and indirectly affected employees and union entities.  It would be necessary to determine to what extent the coerced firms diverted business away from union subcontractors, and then to what extent those subcontractors absorbed the damage to their businesses or passed it on to employees by reducing the workforce or cutting hours or wages.  In turn, it would be necessary to ascertain the extent to which the affected employees absorbed their losses and continued to pay union dues. [<a href="#F52" name="T52">Footnote 52</a>]</p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that the Union\'s allegations of consequential harm resulting from a violation of the antitrust laws, although buttressed by an allegation of intent to harm the Union, are insufficient as a matter of law.  Other relevant factors -- the nature of the Union\'s injury, the tenuous and speculative character of the relationship between the alleged antitrust violation and the Union\'s alleged injury, the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages, and the existence of more direct victims of the alleged conspiracy -- weigh heavily against judicial enforcement of the Union\'s antitrust claim.  Accordingly, we hold that, based on the allegations of this complaint, the District </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 459 U. S. 546</a></p><p> Court was correct in concluding that the Union is not a person injured by reason of a violation of the antitrust laws within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act.

Finally, he concluded that an injury that affected only the Union\'s organizational and representational activity was remediable under the labor laws, rather than the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc on May 22, 1981.

There is no allegation of wrongful conduct directed at nonunion subcontracting firms.  We therefore assume that, if any nonunion firms refused to bargain with the Union because of the conspiracy, they did so because they were rewarded with business they would not otherwise have obtained.  Thus, nonunion firms could not be considered victims of the conspiracy; rather, they appear to have been its indirect beneficiaries.  None are named either as defendants or as coconspirators.</p>\n<p>The amended complaint also does not allege any restraint on competition in the market for labor union services.  Unlike the two cases involving union plaintiffs cited by the Court of Appeals, <em>see</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra,</em> in this case, there is no claim that competition between rival unions has been injured, or even that any rival unions exist.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The complaint does not specify the nature of the "coercion."

Although previous price-fixing cases had involved agreements among sellers to fix sales prices, the Court readily concluded that the Act applied equally to an agreement among competing buyers to fix purchase prices.  The Court stated:</p>\n<p>"The statute does not confine its protection to consumers, or to purchasers, or to competitors, or to sellers.  Nor does it immunize the outlawed acts because they are done by any of these.  <em>Cf. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/310/150/case.html">310 U.

In each of those cases, however, the actual plaintiff was directly harmed by the defendants\' unlawful conduct.  The paraphrasing of the language of \xc2\xa7 4 in those opinions added nothing to the even broader language that the statute itself contains.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> 21 Cong.Rec. 1767-1768, 2455-2456, 2459, 2615, 3147-3148 (1890).  The original proposal, which merely allowed recovery of the amount of actual enhancement in price, was successively amended to authorize double-damages and then treble-damages recoveries, in order to provide otherwise remediless small consumers with an adequate incentive to bring suit.  <em>Id.</em> at 1765, 2455, 3145.  The same purpose was served by the special venue provisions, the provision for the recovery of attorney\'s fees, and the elimination of any requirement that the amount in controversy exceed the jurisdictional threshold applicable in other federal litigation.  <em>See, e.g., id.</em> at 2612, 3149.

Although Members of Congress referred particularly to common law definitions of "monopoly" and "restraint of trade," they appear to have been generally aware that the statute would be construed by common law courts in accordance with traditional canons.  For example, at the beginning of the debate on the Sherman Act, one Senator cautioned his colleagues:</p>\n<p>"A careful analysis of the terms of the bill is essential.  We must know what it means, what its legal effect is, if we give force to it as it is written. . . .  We must adopt, therefore, the known methods of the courts in determining what the bill means."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1765.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, the State Constitution of Illinois, adopted in 1870, provided:</p>\n<p>"Every person ought to find a certain remedy in the laws for all injuries and wrongs which he may receive in his person, property or reputation. . . ."</p>\n<p>Art. II, \xc2\xa7 19.  Comparable provisions were found in the State Constitutions of Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Vermont.  <em>See generally</em> F. Hough, American Constitutions (1871).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>One treatise stated:  "Natural, proximate, and legal results are all that damages can be recovered for, even under a statute entitling one <em>to recover any damage.\'"  3 J. Lawson, Rights, Remedies, and Practice 1740 (1890).  Another leading treatise explained:\n</em></p>\n<p>"The chief and sufficient reason for this rule is to be found in the impossibility of tracing consequences through successive steps to the remote cause, and the necessity of pausing in the investigation of the chain of events at the point beyond which experience and observation convince us we cannot press our inquiries with safety."</p>\n<p>T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73 (2d ed. 1888).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>In torts, a leading treatise on damages set forth the general principle that,</p>\n<p>"<em>[w]here the plaintiff sustains injury from the defendant\'s conduct to a third person, it is too remote</em> if the plaintiff sustains no other than a contract relation to such a third person, or is under contract obligation on his account, and the injury consists only in impairing the ability or inclination of such person to perform his part, or in increasing the plaintiff\'s expense or labor of fulfilling such contract, unless the wrongful act is willful for that purpose."</p>\n<p>Thus, A, who had agreed with a town to support all the town paupers for a specific period, in return for a fixed sum, had no cause of action against S for assaulting and beating one of the paupers, thereby putting A to increased expense.  Similarly, a purchaser under an output contract with a manufacturer had no right of recovery against a trespasser who stopped the company\'s machinery, and a creditor could not recover against a person who had forged a note, causing diminution in the dividends from an estate.  1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55-56 (1882) (emphasis in original, footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Similarly, in contract, the common law courts drew a distinction between direct and consequential damages; the latter had to be specifically included in the contract to be recoverable.  <em>See id.</em> at 74-93; 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages 203-244 (8th ed. 1891) (discussing the rule of <em>Hadley v. Baxendale,</em> 9 Exch. 341, 156 Eng.Rep. 145 (1854)).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>The common law required the plaintiff to prove, with certainty, both the existence of damages and the causal connection between the wrong and the injury.  No damages could be recovered for uncertain, conjectural, or speculative losses.  <em>See generally</em> cases cited in F. Bohlen, Cases on the Law of Torts 292-312 (2d ed.1925) (cases alleging emotional harm to plaintiff).  Even if the injury was easily provable, there would be no recovery if the plaintiff could not sufficiently establish the causal connection.  <em>See</em> 1 Sutherland, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F25" name="T25">n</a> 25, at 94-126; 1 Sedgwick, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F25" name="T25">n</a> 25, at 245-294.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T27" name="F27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., Winterbottom v.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.,</em> 166 F. 820 (CC Mass.1909).  Applying "ordinary principles of law" to the general language of the statute, the court held that a stockholder had no legally cognizable antitrust claim against defendants for illegally acquiring the corporation, thereby rendering plaintiff\'s stock worthless.  Plaintiff\'s claim was not distinguishable from any injury sustained by the company itself.  Therefore, the court stated, a contrary result would "subject the defendant not merely to treble damages, but to sextuple damages, for the same unlawful act."  <em>Id.</em> at 823.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court held in that case that the plaintiff shippers could recover damages from the defendant railroad for charging an excessive freight rate, even though they had been able to pass on the damage to their purchasers.

As commentators have observed, the focus of the doctrine of "antitrust standing" is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional doctrine.  Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the court must make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action.  <em>See</em> Berger &amp; Bernstein, An Analytical Framework for Antitrust Standing, 86 Yale L.J. 809, 813, n. 11 (1977); Pollock, Standing to Sue, Remoteness of Injury, and the Passing-On Doctrine, 32 A.B.A. Antitrust L.J. 5, 6-7 (1966).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T32" name="F32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>In his comment, <em>Mahoney v. Beatman:</em>  A Study in Proximate Cause, 39 Yale L.J. 532, 533 (1930), Leon Green noted:  "Legal theory is too rich in content not to afford alternative ways, and frequently several of them, for stating an acceptable judgment."  Earlier, in his Rationale of Proximate Cause 135-136 (1927) (footnote omitted), Green had written:</p>\n<p>"\'Cause,\' although irreducible in its concept, could not escape the ruffles and decorations so generously bestowed:  remote, proximate, direct, immediate, adequate, efficient, operative, inducing, moving, active, real, effective, decisive, supervening, primary, original, contributory, ultimate, concurrent, <em>causa causans,</em> legal, responsible, dominating, natural, probable, and others.  The difficulty now is in getting anyone to believe that so simple a creature could have been so extravagantly garbed."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T33" name="F33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>Some courts have focused on the directness of the injury, <em>e.g., Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co.,</em> 183 F. 704, 709 (CA3 1910); <em>Productive Inventions, Inc. v. Trico Products Corp.,</em> 224 F.2d 678, 679 (CA2 1955), <em>cert. denied,</em> 350 U.S. 936 (1956); <em>Volasco Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co.,</em> 308 F.2d 383, 394-395 (CA6 1962), <em>cert. denied,</em> 372 U.S. 907 (1963).  Others have applied the requirement that the plaintiff must be in the "target area" of the antitrust conspiracy, that is, the area of the economy which is endangered by a breakdown of competitive conditions in a particular industry.  <em>E.g., Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp.,</em> 632 F.2d 539, 546-547 (CA5 1980); <em>Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd.,</em> 605 F.2d 1, 17-18 (CA1 1979); <em>Calderone Enterprises Corp. v.

In this case, we need not reach petitioner\'s contentions that the alleged activities are within the statutory and nonstatutory labor exemptions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T44" name="F44">Footnote 44</a>]</p>\n<p>There is a parallel between these allegations and the claim in <em>Connell Construction Co. v.

The plaintiff in that case, a general building contractor, was coerced by the defendant union into signing an agreement not to deal with nonunion subcontractors.  Similarly, in the <em>McCready</em> case, the plaintiff was the direct victim of unlawful coercion.  As the Court noted,</p>\n<p>"McCready did not yield to Blue Shield\'s coercive pressure, and bore Blue Shield\'s sanction in the form of an increase in the net cost of her psychologist\'s services."</p>\n<p>457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/465/case.html#483">457 U.

Her status was thus comparable to that of a contracting or subcontracting firm that refused to yield to the defendants\' coercive practices, and therefore suffered whatever sanction that coercion imposed.  Like McCready, and like Connell Construction Co., such a firm could maintain an action against the defendants.  In contrast, the Union is neither a participant in the market for construction contracts or subcontracts nor a direct victim of the defendants\' coercive practices.  We therefore need not decide whether the direct victim of a boycott, who suffers a type of injury unrelated to antitrust policy, may recover damages when the ultimate purpose of the boycott is to restrain competition in the relevant economic market.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T45" name="F45">Footnote 45</a>]</p>\n<p>Its brief merely echoes the Court of Appeals\' description of its allegations:</p>\n<p>"the Unions have been injured in their business, <em>i.e.,</em> organizing carpentry industry employees, negotiating and policing collective bargaining agreements, and securing jobs for their members."</p>\n<p>Brief for Respondents 25-26.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T46" name="F46">Footnote 46</a>]</p>\n<p>Because of the absence of specific allegations, we can only speculate about the specific components of the Union\'s claim.  If the Union asserts that its attempts to organize previously nonunion firms have been frustrated because nonunion firms wish to continue to obtain business from those subjected to coercion by the defendants, its harm stems most directly from the conduct of persons who are not victims of the conspiracy.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F14" name="T14">n</a> 14, <em>supra.</em>  If the Union claims that dues payments were adversely affected because employees had less incentive to join the Union in light of expanding nonunion job opportunities, its damage is more remote than the harm allegedly suffered by unionized subcontractors.  The same is true if the Union contends that revenues from dues payments declined because its members lost jobs or wages because their unionized employers lost business.  That harm, moreover, is even more indirect than the already indirect injury to its members, yet a number of decisions have denied standing to employees with merely derivative injuries.  <em>See, e.g., Pitchford v. PEPI, Inc.,</em> 531 F.2d 92, 97 (CA3), <em>cert. denied,</em> 426 U.S. 935 (1976); <em>Contreras v.

The Court does not suggest that a union is not a "person" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 4, or that plaintiffs cannot prove injury to their "business or property."  Moreover, it would require a strained reading of \xc2\xa7 4 to conclude that a party that an antitrust violation was aimed at cannot prove that it suffered injury "by reason of" an antitrust violation.</p>\n<p>Far from supporting the Court\'s conclusion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/519/case.html#531">459 U. S. 531</a></span>-533, the common law background of the antitrust laws highlights the anomaly of denying a remedy to the intended victim of unlawful conduct.  Since antitrust violations are essentially "tortious acts," <em>Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/251/case.html">327 U. S. 251</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/251/case.html#264">327 U. S. 264</a></span> (1946), [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] the most apt analogy is to the common law of torts.  Although many legal battles have been fought over the extent of tort liability for remote consequences </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 459 U. S. 548</a></p><p> of <em>negligent</em> conduct, it has always been assumed that the victim of an <em>intentional</em> tort can recover from the tortfeasor if he proves that the tortious conduct was a cause-in-fact of his injuries.  An inquiry into proximate cause has traditionally been deemed unnecessary in suits against intentional tortfeasors. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  For example, if one party makes false representations to another, intending them to be communicated to a third party and acted upon to his detriment, the third party can bring an action for misrepresentation against the originator of the false information if he suffers injury as a result. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Indeed, in many situations the common law holds </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 459 U.

[<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  I am not aware of any cases exonerating an intentional tortfeasor from responsibility for the intended consequences of his actions merely because he inflicted harm upon his victim indirectly, rather than directly.</p>\n<p>This case does not implicate the sort of "articulable consideration of statutory policy" which we have deemed necessary to deny standing to a party encompassed by the language of \xc2\xa7 4.  <em>Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready,</em> 457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/465/case.html#473">457 U. S. 473</a></span>.  In <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/477/case.html">429 U. S. 477</a></span> (1977), we denied standing to parties that suffered injury because an illegal acquisition prevented them from reaping profits that they would have reaped had the acquired firms been permitted to fail.  We reasoned that permitting recovery for "the profits [plaintiffs] would have realized had competition been reduced" would be "inimical" to the purposes of the antitrust laws, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/477/case.html#488">429 U.

S. 489</a></span>.  This consideration of statutory policy is not applicable here, for plaintiffs allege that they suffered injury as a result of the defendants\' efforts to coerce and induce letters of construction contracts and others to deal with nonunion carpentry firms solely because of their nonunion status.  If plaintiffs prove their allegations, they will prove that they suffered harm attributable to the anticompetitive consequences of the defendants\' restraint of trade.</p>\n<p>Nor does the present case implicate the consideration of statutory policy underlying this Court\'s decisions in <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/720/case.html">431 U. S. 720</a></span> (1977), and <em>Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/251/case.html">405 U. S. 251</a></span> (1972).  Critical to the denial of standing in those cases was the risk of duplicative recovery that would have been created by affording the plaintiffs </p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 459 U. S. 550</a></p><p> standing. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In <em>Illinois Brick,</em> the Court held that an indirect purchaser has no standing to sue a seller on the theory that overcharges paid to the seller by a direct purchaser were passed on to the indirect purchaser.  431 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/720/case.html#730">431 U. S. 730</a></span>-731.  If the Court had held in <em>Illinois Brick</em> that the indirect purchaser has standing, sellers would have faced the prospect of two treble damages actions based on the same overcharges.  <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/481/case.html">392 U. S. 481</a></span> (1968), had established that a direct purchaser can sue a seller for the entire amount of the seller\'s overcharges, and that the seller cannot assert as a defense that the direct purchaser passed the overcharges through to its customers (the indirect purchasers).  Similarly, in <em>Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.,</em> where the State of Hawaii sought to recover for financial harm allegedly suffered by the general economy of the State, the Court denied standing because</p>\n<p>"[a] large and ultimately indeterminable part of the injury to the \'general economy,\' as it is measured by economists, is no more than a reflection of injuries to the \'business or property\' of consumers, for which they may recover themselves under \xc2\xa7 4."</p>\n<p>405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/251/case.html#264">405 U. S. 264</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>There is no risk of double recovery here.  The plaintiff unions seek recovery for injuries distinct from those that other parties may have suffered.  One such distinct injury </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 459 U. S. 551</a></p><p> plaintiffs may have suffered is a decrease in union dues resulting from a reduction in work available to union members.  In addition to regular dues, it is not uncommon for employees to pay periodic dues representing a percentage of their wages.  <em>See</em> R. Gorman, Basic Text on Labor Law 650 (1976). [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  If union members lost work as a result of the alleged restraint of trade, their wages and thus the dues collected by the plaintiff unions may have been reduced.</p>\n<p>Any recovery of lost dues by the plaintiff unions would not duplicate recoveries that might be obtained by either unionized carpentry firms or employees of those firms.  A recovery of lost dues by a union would not duplicate a recovery for lost profits that might be obtained by a firm for which union members worked, for union dues are not an element of a firm\'s profits.  Nor would a recovery of lost dues by a union duplicate recoveries of lost wages that employees might obtain.  Although periodic union dues are based on a percentage of wages, there would be no double recovery, because union dues would be subtracted from lost wages in calculating the employees\' damages.  The <em>Hanover Shoe</em> rule barring the assertion of a "pass-through" defense would not prevent subtraction of union dues from wages in determining the employees\' damages.  The <em>Hanover Shoe</em> rule was designed to avoid the "additional long and complicated proceedings involving massive evidence and complicated theories" that would be required to determine the extent to which price overcharges were passed through to an indirect purchaser.  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/481/case.html#493">392 U. S. 493</a></span>.  In sharp contrast, where union dues are a percentage of wages, there is no difficulty in determining the amount of dues that a union lost as a result of a reduction in the wages earned by union members. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 459 U.
