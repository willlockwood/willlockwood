The area it governs is divided into five separate subdivisions called \xe2\x80\x9cReaches,\xe2\x80\x9d each of which is further divided into smaller \xe2\x80\x9csubbasins.\xe2\x80\x9d  At issue here are rights under the Compact to water located in Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s portion of Reach II, subbasin 5.  In Reach II, the Compact\xe2\x80\x94recognizing that Louisiana lacks suitable reservoir sites to store water during high flow periods and that the upstream States (Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas) were unwilling to release their own stored water for the benefit of a downstream State\xe2\x80\x94granted control over the water in four upstream subbasins (subbasins 1 through 4) to the States in which each subbasin is located and required that water in a fifth subbasin, subbasin 5, be allowed to flow to Louisiana at certain minimum levels.  Section 5.05(b)(1) of the Compact gives the States \xe2\x80\x9cequal rights\xe2\x80\x9d to the use of subbasin 5\xe2\x80\x99s waters when the flow is 3,000 cubic feet per second (CFS) or more, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided no state is entitled to more than 25 percent of the water in excess of 3,000 [CFS].\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the Compact, States are also entitled to continue with their intrastate water administration.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Tarrant Regional Water District (Tarrant) is a Texas state agency responsible for providing water to north-central Texas and its rapidly growing population.  After unsuccessfully attempting to purchase water from Oklahoma and others, Tarrant sought a water resource permit from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board (OWRB), respondents here, to take surface water from a tributary of the Red River at a point located in Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s portion of subbasin 5 of Reach II.  Knowing that the OWRB would likely deny its permit application because of Oklahoma water laws that effectively prevent out-of-state applicants from taking or diverting water from within Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s borders, Tarrant filed suit in federal court simultaneously with its permit application, seeking to enjoin the OWRB\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of the state statutes on grounds that they were pre-empted by federal law in the form of the Compact and violated the Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in water.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the OWRB, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0The Compact does not pre-empt the Oklahoma water statutes.

Tarrant observes that \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cequal rights\xe2\x80\x9d language grants each State an equal entitlement to subbasin 5\xe2\x80\x99s waters, subject to a 25 percent cap, and argues that its silence concerning state lines indicates that the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s drafters did not intend the provision to allocate water according to state borders.  The OWRB counters that \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cequal rights\xe2\x80\x9d afford each State an equal opportunity to use subbasin 5\xe2\x80\x99s excess water within each State\xe2\x80\x99s own borders, but that its silence on cross-border rights indicates that the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s drafters had no intention to create any such rights in the signatory States.

New Mexico, \n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124\n, the Court begins by examining the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s express terms as the best indication of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  However, \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence is, at the very least, ambiguous regarding cross-border rights under the Compact, so the Court turns to other interpretive tools to shed light on the drafters\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  Three things persuade the Court that the Compact did not grant cross-border rights: the well-established principle that States do not easily cede their sovereign powers; the fact that other interstate water compacts have treated cross-border rights explicitly; and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 course of dealing.

Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410.  So, for example, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] court deciding a question of title to [a] bed of navigable water [within a State\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries] must .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. begin with a strong presumption\xe2\x80\x99 against defeat of a State\xe2\x80\x99s title.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Alaska, \n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  It follows, then, that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f any inference at all is to be drawn from\xe2\x80\x9d silence in compacts touching on the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to control their waters, \xe2\x80\x9cit is that each State was left to regulate the activities of her own citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  Virginia v. Maryland, \n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56\n.  Tarrant contends that \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence infers that the signatory States dispensed with the core state prerogative to control water within its borders.  But since States rarely relinquish their sovereign powers, the better understanding is that there would be a clear indication of such devolution, not inscrutable silence.  Tarrant counters that its interpretation would not intrude on any sovereign prerogative of Oklahoma, which would retain its authority to regulate the water within its borders.  But adopting Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s reading would necessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and three other States silently surrendered substantial control over their waters when they agreed to the Compact.

See, e.g., Alabama v. North Carolina, \n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 330\n, ___.  Many compacts feature unambiguous language permitting signatory States to cross each other\xe2\x80\x99s borders to fulfill obligations under the compacts, and many provide for the terms and mechanics of how such relationships will operate.  The absence of comparable provisions in the Red River Compact strongly suggests that cross-border rights were never intended to be part of the agreement.  Tarrant claims that not all interstate compacts have such explicit language, but cites only one such compact, and even it sets out a detailed scheme that would apply to any contemplated diversions.  Similarly, even if \xc2\xa72.05(d) of the Compact, which gives \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach Signatory State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the right to\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[u]se the bed and banks of the Red River and its tributaries to convey stored water, imported or exported water, and water apportioned according to this Compact,\xe2\x80\x9d is read to establish cross-border diversions, it does so through express language, not through an inference from silence.

See Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Once the Compact was approved in 1980, no signatory State pressed for a cross-border diversion until Tarrant filed suit in 2007.  And Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s earlier offer to purchase water from Oklahoma was a strange decision if Tarrant believed the Compact entitled it to demand water without payment.  Nor is there any indication that Tarrant, any other Texas agency, or Texas itself previously made any mention of cross-border rights within the Compact; and none of the other signatory States has ever made such a claim.

Tarrant claims that the statutes discriminate against interstate commerce by preventing water left unallocated under the Compact from being distributed out of State.  But Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that some water is left \xe2\x80\x9cunallocated\xe2\x80\x9d is incorrect.  The interpretive comment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that when the flow is above 3,000 CFS, \xe2\x80\x9call states are free to use whatever amount of water they can put to beneficial use,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the requirement that if the amount of available water cannot satisfy all of those uses, \xe2\x80\x9ceach state will honor the other\xe2\x80\x99s right to 25% of the excess flow.\xe2\x80\x9d  If more than 25 percent of subbasin 5\xe2\x80\x99s water is located in Oklahoma, that water is not \xe2\x80\x9cunallocated\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma unless and until another State calls for an accounting and Oklahoma is asked to refrain from utilizing more than its entitled share.

Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water District (Tarrant), a Texas agency, claims that it is entitled to acquire water under the Compact from within Oklahoma and that therefore the Compact pre-empts several Oklahoma statutes that restrict out-of-state diversions of water.  In the alternative, Tarrant argues that the Oklahoma laws are unconstitutional restrictions on interstate commerce.  We hold that Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s claims lack merit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Red River (or River) begins in the Llano Estacado Mesa on the border between New Mexico and Texas.  From this broad plain, it first runs through the Texas Panhandle and then marks the border between Texas and Oklahoma.  It continues in an easterly direction until it reaches the shared border with Arkansas.  Once the River enters Arkansas, it turns southward and flows into Louisiana, where it empties into the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs an important geographic feature of this region, the Red River has lent its name to a valley, a Civil War campaign, and a famed college football rivalry between the Longhorns of Texas and the Sooners of Oklahoma.  But college pride has not been the only source of controversy between Texas and Oklahoma regarding the Red River.  The River has been the cause of numerous historical conflicts between the two States, leading to a mobilization of their militias at one time, Oklahoma v. Texas, \n\n258 U.\xc2\xa0S. 574, \n580 (1922)\n, and the declaration of martial law along a stretch of the River by Oklahoma Governor \xe2\x80\x9cAlfalfa Bill\xe2\x80\x9d Murray at another, see Okla.

Such disputes over the River and its waters are a natural result of the River\xe2\x80\x99s distribution of water flows.  The River\xe2\x80\x99s course means that upstream States like Oklahoma and Texas may appropriate substantial amounts of water from both the River and its tributaries to the disadvantage of downstream States like Arkansas and especially Lou-isiana, which lacks sufficiently large reservoirs to store water.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAbsent an agreement among the States, disputes over the allocation of water are subject to equitable apportionment by the courts, Arizona v. California, \n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 605, \n609 (1983)\n, which often results in protracted and costly legal proceedings.  Thus in 1955, to forestall future disputes over the River and its water, Congress authorized the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas to negotiate a compact to apportion the water of the Red River basin among themselves.  See Act of Aug. 11, 1955, Pub. L. 346, \n\n69Stat.\n654.  These negotiations lasted over 20 years and finally culminated in the signing of the Red River Compact in 1978.

Comment on Art.\xc2\xa0V, 1 App. 27.  The problem was that Louisiana, the farthest downstream State, lacks suitable reservoir sites and therefore cannot store water during high flow periods to meet its future needs.  The upstream States (Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas), which control the River\xe2\x80\x99s flow, were unwilling to release water stored within their own reservoirs for the benefit of any downstream States, like Louisiana.  Without any such release, there would be no guaranteed flow of water to Louisiana.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe provisions of the Compact relating to Reach II were crafted to address this problem.  To this end, Reach II was divided into five subbasins.

In particular, the population of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area in north Texas has grown from roughly 5.1 million inhabitants in 2000 to almost 6.4 million in 2010, a jump of over 23 percent and among the largest in the United States during this period.  See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, P. Mackun &amp; S. Wilson, Population Distribution and Change: 2000 to 2010 (Mar. 2011).  This growth has strained regional water supplies, and north Texas\xe2\x80\x99 need for water has been exacerbated in recent years by a long and costly drought.

From 2000 to 2002, Tarrant, along with several other Texas water districts, offered to purchase water from Oklahoma and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations.  See 2 App. 336\xe2\x80\x93382.

These statutes include a requirement that the OWRB consider, when evaluating an application to take water out of State, whether that water \xe2\x80\x9ccould feasibly be transported to alleviate water short- ages in the State of Oklahoma.\xe2\x80\x9d  Okla. Stat., Tit. 82, \xc2\xa7105.12(A)(5) (West 2013).  The statutes also require that no permit issued by the OWRB to use water outside of the State shall \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mpair the ability of the State of Oklahoma to meet its obligations under any interstate stream compact.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7105.12A(B)(1).  A separate provision creates a permitting review process that applies only to out-of- state water users.  \xc2\xa7105.12(F).  Oklahoma also requires legislative approval for out-of-state water-use permits, \xc2\xa7105.12A(D), and further provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ater use within Oklahoma .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be developed to the maximum extent feasible for the benefit of Oklahoma so that out-of-state downstream users will not acquire vested rights therein to the detriment of the citizens of this state,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71086.1(A)(3).  Interpreting these laws, Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general has concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cwe consider the proposition unrealistic that an out-of-state user is a proper permit applicant before the [OWRB]\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e can find no intention to create the possibility that such a valuable resource as water may become bound, without compensation, to use by an out-of-state user.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 App. 118.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen Tarrant filed its permit application, it also filed suit against respondents in Federal District Court.  As relevant here, Tarrant sought to enjoin enforcement of the Oklahoma water statutes by the OWRB.

Tarrant reaches this interpretation in two steps.  First, it observes that \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cequal rights\xe2\x80\x9d language grants each State an equal entitlement to the waters of subbasin 5, subject to a 25 percent cap.  Second, Tarrant argues \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence concerning state lines indicates that the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s drafters did not intend to allocate water according to state borders in this section.  According to Tarrant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x9825 percent\xe2\x80\x99 language [of \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)] makes clear that, in exercising its \xe2\x80\x98equal rights\xe2\x80\x99 to the common pool of water, no State may take more than a one-quarter share,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief 3, but any of the signatory States may \xe2\x80\x9ccross state lines to obtain [its] shar[e] of Subbasin 5 waters,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 32.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe OWRB disputes this reading.  In its view, the \xe2\x80\x9cequal rights\xe2\x80\x9d promised by \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1) afford each State an equal opportunity to make use of the excess water within subbasin 5 of Reach II but only within each State\xe2\x80\x99s own borders.  This is because the OWRB reads \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence differently from Tarrant.  The OWRB interprets that provision\xe2\x80\x99s absence of language granting any cross-border rights to indicate that the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s drafters had no intention to create any such rights in the signatory States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnraveling the meaning of \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence with respect to state lines is the key to resolving whether the Compact pre-empts the Oklahoma water statutes.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  If \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence means that state borders are irrelevant to the allocation of water in subbasin 5 of Reach II, then the Oklahoma water laws at issue conflict with the cross-border rights created by federal law in the form of the Compact and must be pre-empted.  But if \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence instead reflects a background understanding on the part of the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s drafters that state borders were to be respected within the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s allocation, then the Oklahoma statutes do not conflict with the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s allocation of water.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tInterstate compacts are construed as contracts under the principles of contract law.  Texas v. New Mexico, \n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124, \n128 (1987)\n.  So, as with any contract, we begin by examining the express terms of the Compact as the best indication of the intent of the parties, see also Montana v. Wyoming, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, and n.\xc2\xa04, ___, (2011) (slip op., at 5, and n.\xc2\xa04, 17); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7203(b) (1979).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTarrant argues that because other provisions of the Compact reference state borders, \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence with respect to state lines must mean that the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s drafters intended to permit cross-border diversions.  For example, \xc2\xa75.03(b), which governs subbasin 3 of Reach II, provides that\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he States of Oklahoma and Arkansas shall have free and unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin within their respective states, subject, however, to the limitation that Oklahoma shall allow a quantity of water equal to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. 40 percent of the total runoff originating below the following existing, authorized or proposed last major downstream damsites in Okla- homa to flow into Arkansas.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 App. 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tSection 6.03(b), which covers subbasin 3 of Reach III, similarly provides that \xe2\x80\x9cTexas and Louisiana within their respective boundaries shall each have the unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin subject to the following [conditions].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 33 (emphasis added).  Thus, \xc2\xa75.03(b) and \xc2\xa76.03(b) mimic \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1) in allocating water rights within a subbasin, but differ in that they make explicit ref-erence to water use \xe2\x80\x9cwithin\xe2\x80\x9d state boundaries.  Relying on the expressio unius canon of construction, Tarrant finds that \xc2\xa75.05(b)\xe2\x80\x99s silence regarding borders is significant because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed [that] Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 29 (quoting Russello v. United States, \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16, \n23 (1983)\n).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s argument fails to account for other sections of the Compact that cut against its reading.  For example, \xc2\xa75.05(b)(3), which governs the waters of subbasin 5 in Reach II when flows are below 1,000 CFS, requires that during such periods, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma allow water \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective states to flow into the Red River as required to maintain a 1,000 [CFS] flow at the Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 App. 25 (emphasis added).  Obviously none of the upstream States can redirect water that lies outside of their borders, so the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective states\xe2\x80\x9d is superfluous in \xc2\xa75.05(b)(3).  In contrast, \xc2\xa75.05(b)(2), which governs when the River\xe2\x80\x99s flow at the Arkansas-Louisiana border is above 1,000 CFS but below 3,000 CFS, requires that upstream States allow a flow to Louisiana equivalent to 40 percent of total weekly runoff originating within the subbasin and 40 percent of undesignated water flowing into subbasin 5 of Reach II.  Id., at 25.  This language can only refer to water within each State\xe2\x80\x99s borders because otherwise each State would have to contribute 40 percent to the total water flow, which would add up to more than 100 percent.  Read together and to avoid absurd results, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75.05(b)(2) and (3) suggest that each upstream State is individually responsible for ensuring that sufficient subbasin 5 water located within its respective borders flows down to Louisiana, even though \xc2\xa75.05(b)(2) lacks any explicit reference to state lines.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence regarding state lines to other of the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s provisions would produce further anomalous results.  Consider \xc2\xa76.01(b).  That provision states that \xe2\x80\x9cTexas is apportioned sixty (60) percent of the runoff of [subbasin 1 of Reach III] and shall have unrestricted use thereof; Arkansas is entitled to forty (40) percent of the runoff of this subbasin.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 32.  Because Texas is upstream from Arkansas, water flows from Texas to Arkansas.  Given this situation, the commonsense reason for \xc2\xa76.01(b)\xe2\x80\x99s 60-to-40 allocation is to prevent Texas from barring the flow of water to Arkansas.  While there is no reference to state boundaries in the section\xe2\x80\x99s text, the unstated assumption underlying this provision is that Arkansas must wait for its 40 percent share to go through Texas before it can claim it.  But applying Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of silence regarding state borders to this section would imply that Arkansas could enter into Texas without having to wait for the water that will inevitably reach it.  This counterintuitive outcome would thwart the self-evident purposes of the Compact.  Further, other provisions of the Compact share this structure of allocating a proportion of water that will flow from an upstream State to a downstream one.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Accepting Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s reading would upset the balance struck by all these sections.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the very least, the problems that arise from Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s proposed reading suggest that \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence is ambiguous regarding cross-border rights under the Compact.  We therefore turn to other interpretive tools to shed light on the intent of the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s drafters.  See Oklahoma v.

We think that the better understanding of \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s silence is that the parties drafted the Compact with this legal background in mind, and therefore did not intend to grant each other cross-border rights under the Compact.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn response, Tarrant contends that its interpretation would not intrude on any sovereign prerogative of Oklahoma because that State would retain its authority to regulate the water within its borders.  Because anyone seeking water from Oklahoma would still have to apply to the OWRB, receive a permit, and abide by its conditions, Tarrant argues that Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign authority remains untouched by its interpretation.  But Tarrant cannot have it both ways.  Adopting Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s reading would necessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and three other States silently surrendered substantial control over the water within their borders when they agreed to the Compact.  Given the background principles we have described above, we find this unlikely to have been the intent of the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s signatories.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLooking to the customary practices employed in other interstate compacts also helps us to ascertain the intent of the parties to this Compact.

Many of these other compacts feature language that unambiguously permits signatory States to cross each other\xe2\x80\x99s borders to fulfill obligations under the compacts.  See, e.g., Amended Bear River Compact, Art. VIII(A), \n\n94Stat.\n12 (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o State shall deny the right of another signatory State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to acquire rights to the use of water .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in one State for use of water in another\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The absence of comparable language in the Red River Compact counts heavily against Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s reading of it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTellingly, many of these compacts provide for the terms and mechanics of how such cross-border relationships will operate, including who can assert such cross-border rights, see, e.g., Kansas-Nebraska Big Blue River Compact, Art. VII(1), \n\n86Stat.\n198, who should bear the costs of any cross-border diversions, see, e.g., Belle Fourche River Compact, Art. VI, \n\n58Stat.\n96\xe2\x80\x9397, and how such diversions should be administered, Arkansas River Basin Compact, Kansas-Oklahoma, Art. VII(A), \n\n80Stat.\n1411.

Consider the mechanics of a cross-border diversion or taking of water in this case.  If Tarrant were correct, then applicants from Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana could all apply to the OWRB for permits to take water from Oklahoma.  The OWRB would then be obligated to determine the total amount of water in Oklahoma beyond the 25 percent cap created in \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1), given that the Compact would only obligate Oklahoma to deliver water beyond its quarter share.  This alone would be a herculean task because the Compact does not require ongoing monitoring or accounting, see Compact \xc2\xa72.11, 1 App. 13, and not all of the water in subbasin 5 is located or originates in Oklahoma.  Moreover, the OWRB would be tasked with determining the priority under the Compact of applicants from other States.  This would almost certainly require the OWRB to not only determine whether Oklahoma had received more or less than its 25 percent allotment, but whether other States had as well.  Put plainly, the end result would be a jurisdictional and administrative quagmire.  The pro-visions in the other interstate water compacts resolve these complications.  The absence of comparable provisions in the Red River Compact strongly suggests that cross-border rights were never intended to be part of the States\xe2\x80\x99 agreement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTarrant counters that not all interstate compacts that permit cross-border diversions have explicit language to this effect.  On this front, Tarrant manages to identify one interstate compact that it contends permits cross-border diversions without express language to that effect, the Upper Niobrara River Compact, Pub. L. 91\xe2\x80\x9352, \n\n83Stat.\n86.  Tarrant observes that this compact, which deals with a river mostly located in Nebraska with only a small portion in Wyoming, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here shall be no restrictions on the use of the surface waters of [the river] by Wyoming.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Art. V(A)1, id., at 88.  Tarrant suggests that this language, coupled with the fact that the bulk of the river is in Nebraska, implicitly indicates that the compact grants Wyoming a right to enter Nebraska and use the river\xe2\x80\x99s water.  First, we are not convinced that a single compact\xe2\x80\x99s failure to reference state borders does much to detract from the overall custom in this area.  See supra, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318, and n. 12.  Second, the Upper Niobrara River Compact is not a helpful counterexample for Tarrant.  The general provision that Tarrant quotes is paired with a host of detailed conditions.  See Arts. V(A)1(a)\xe2\x80\x93(f), \n\n83Stat.\n88.  Contrary to Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s position, then, assuming that the Upper Niobrara River compact does create any cross-border rights, it does so not through silence, but through the detailed scheme that would apply to any such contemplated diversions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTarrant also argues that \xc2\xa72.05(d) of the Red River Compact, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach Signatory State shall have the right to\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[u]se the bed and banks of the Red River and its tributaries to convey stored water, imported or exported water, and water apportioned according to this Compact,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 App. 11, in fact authorizes cross-border diversions.  Because the present border between Texas and Oklahoma east of the Texas Panhandle is set by the vegetation line on the south bank of the River, Red River Boundary Compact, \n\n114Stat.\n919, Tarrant contends that \xc2\xa72.05(d) reflects an understanding on the part of the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s drafters that state borders could be crossed.  But the issue is not as simple as Tarrant makes it out to be.  When the Compact was drafted, the Texas-Oklahoma border was fixed at the south bank of the River.  See Texas v. Oklahoma, \n\n457 U.\xc2\xa0S. 172 (1982)\n.  If Texas was able to access water through the south bank of the River\xe2\x80\x94an issue left unbriefed by the parties\xe2\x80\x94the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s framers may have believed that Texas could reach the River and take water from it without having to enter Oklahoman land, casting doubt on Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s theory.  In any event, even if \xc2\xa72.05(d) is read to establish a cross-border right, it does so through express language setting forth the location and purposes under which such an incursion is permissible.  This is different from the inference from silence that Tarrant asks us to draw in \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe parties\xe2\x80\x99 conduct under the Compact also undermines Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s position.  A \xe2\x80\x9cpart[y\xe2\x80\x99s] course of performance under the Compact is highly significant\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of its understanding of the compact\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at___ (slip op., at 14).  Since the Compact was approved by Congress in 1980, no signatory State had pressed for a cross-border diversion under the Compact until Tarrant filed its suit in 2007.  Brief for Respondents 26, 49\xe2\x80\x9351.  Indeed, Tarrant attempted to purchase water from Oklahoma over the course of 2000 until 2002, see supra, at 7, a strange offer if Tarrant believed it was entitled to demand such water without payment under the Compact.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn response, Tarrant maintains that there were \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling business reasons\xe2\x80\x9d for it to purchase water.  Reply Brief 17.  We are unpersuaded.  If Tarrant believed that it had a right to water located in Oklahoma, there would have been \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling business reasons\xe2\x80\x9d to mention this right given that billions of dollars were at stake.  See 2 App. 362\xe2\x80\x93363 (summarizing Texas purchase proposal).  Yet there is no indication that Tarrant or any other Texas agency or the State of Texas itself previously made any mention of cross-border rights within the Compact, and none of the other signatory States has ever made such a claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Compact creates no cross-border rights in Texas.  Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s remaining arguments do not persuade us otherwise.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, Tarrant argues that its interpretation of the Compact is necessary to realize the \xe2\x80\x9cstructure and purpose of Reach II.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 34\xe2\x80\x9338.  Tarrant contends that because the boundary of subbasin 5 is set by the location of the last existing, authorized, or proposed sites for a downstream dam before the Red River, see Compact \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75.01(a), 5.02(a), 5.03(b), 5.04(a), 1 App. 22\xe2\x80\x9324, the Compact allows each of the States upstream from Louisiana to prevent water from flowing from its tributaries into subbasin 5.  Tarrant reasons that each State will therefore hold whatever water it needs in its upstream basins.  Given this, Tarrant maintains that any water that a State voluntarily allows to reach subbasin 5 must be surplus water that State did not intend to use, and if the upstream State has no need for that water, then there is no reason not to allow other States to access and use it, even across borders.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis argument is founded on a shaky premise: It assumes that flows from these dammed-up tributaries are the sole source of water in subbasin 5.  But \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1) explains that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ignatory States shall have equal rights to the use of runoff originating in subbasin 5,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cwater flowing into subbasin 5,\xe2\x80\x9d which would include flows from the main stem of the River itself.  Id., at 25.  Thus, there are waters that are specific to subbasin 5 separate from those originating in the tributaries covered by subbasins 1 through 4.  Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s account of the purposes of subbasin 5 does not explain how these waters were to be allocated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTarrant\xe2\x80\x99s second argument regarding the purposes of Reach II is that \xc2\xa75.05(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s 25 percent cap on each State\xe2\x80\x99s access to excess water in subbasin 5 should be read to imply that if a State cannot access sufficient water within its borders to meet its share under the cap, then it must be able to cross borders to reach that water.  Were it otherwise, Tarrant explains, the 25 percent cap would have no purpose.  To support this argument, Tarrant draws on a 1970 engineering report that it contends shows that only 16 percent of the freshwater flowing into subbasin 5 was located in Texas.  Brief for Petitioner 9, n.\xc2\xa05.  The OWRB challenges this percentage with its own calculations drawn from the report, and asserts that Texas had access to at least 29 percent of the excess water in subbasin 5 within its own borders.  Brief for Respondents 26, 47\xe2\x80\x9348, and n.\xc2\xa017.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFortunately, we need not delve into calculations based on a decades-old engineering report to resolve this argument.  As we have explained, supra, at 4\xe2\x80\x936, Texas does not have a minimum guarantee of 25 percent of the excess water in subbasin 5.  If it believes that Oklahoma is using more than its 25 percent allotment and wishes to stop it from doing so, then it may call for an accounting under \xc2\xa72.11 of the Compact and, depending on the results of that accounting, insist that Oklahoma desist from taking more than its provided share.  See Compact \xc2\xa72.11, and Comment on Art.\xc2\xa0II, 1 App. 13\xe2\x80\x9316.  This is the appropriate remedy provided under the Compact.  But Texas has never done so and Tarrant offers no evidence that in the present day Texas cannot access its 25 percent share on its own land.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the Compact\xe2\x80\x99s terms, water located within Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s portion of subbasin 5 of Reach II remains under Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s control.  Accordingly, Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s theory that Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s water statutes are pre-empted because they prevent Texas from exercising its rights under the Compact must fail for the reason that the Compact does not create any cross-border rights in signatory States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTarrant also challenges the constitutionality of the Oklahoma water statutes under a dormant Commerce Clause theory.  Tarrant argues that the Oklahoma water statutes impermissibly \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discriminat[e] against interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x99 for the \xe2\x80\x98forbidden purpose\xe2\x80\x99 of favoring local interests\xe2\x80\x9d by erecting barriers to the distribution of water left unallocated under the Compact.

Tarrant\xe2\x80\x99s argument is premised on the position that if we \xe2\x80\x9cadopt the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s or respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation [of the Compact], .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a substantial amount of Reach II, Subbasin 5 water located in Oklahoma is not apportioned to any State and therefore is available to permit applicants like Tarrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 47.  So, Tarrant continues, because Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s laws prevent this \xe2\x80\x9cunallocated water\xe2\x80\x9d from being distributed out of State, those laws violate the Commerce Clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTarrant\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that that the Compact leaves some water \xe2\x80\x9cunallocated\xe2\x80\x9d is incorrect.  The interpretive comment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that when the River\xe2\x80\x99s flow is above 3,000 CFS, \xe2\x80\x9call states are free to use whatever amount of water they can put to beneficial use,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the requirement that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the states have competing uses and the amount of water available in excess of 3000 CFS cannot satisfy all such uses, each state will honor the other\xe2\x80\x99s right to 25% of the excess flow.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 App. 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  If more than 25 percent of subbasin 5\xe2\x80\x99s water is located in Oklahoma, that water is not \xe2\x80\x9cunallocated\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma unless and until another State calls for an accounting and Oklahoma is asked to refrain from utilizing more than its entitled share.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F13" name="T13">\n\t\t\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The Oklahoma water statutes can- not discriminate against interstate commerce with re-spect to unallocated waters because the Compact leaves no waters unallocated.
