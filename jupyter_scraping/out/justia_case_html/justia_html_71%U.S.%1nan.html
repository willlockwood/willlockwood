He stated that the counsel in the case in California had been unaware of the rule requiring such a suggestion and motion to be made at the first term, for which reason they had not sent on the papers at an earlier day, and he submitted the fact as a sufficient reason for granting the motion now, inasmuch as the cause having been already continued till the next term, the granting of it would not cause and delay in the hearing.</p>\n<p>In support of this view, he cited <em>Clark v. Hacket</em> [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and <em>Morgan v. Curtenius.</em> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court granted leave and ordered the certiorari.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/66/77/case.html">66 U.
