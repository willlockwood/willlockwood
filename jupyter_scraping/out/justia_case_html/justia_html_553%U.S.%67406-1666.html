It operates in Iraq under the unified command of U. S. military officers, at the Iraqi Government\xe2\x80\x99s request, and in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions.  Pursuant to the U.\xc2\xa0N. mandate, MNF\xe2\x80\x93I forces detain individuals alleged to have committed hostile or warlike acts in Iraq, pending investigation and prosecution in Iraqi courts under Iraqi law.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shawqi Omar and Mohammad Munaf (hereinafter petitioners) are American citizens who voluntarily traveled to Iraq and allegedly committed crimes there.  They were each captured by military forces operating as part of the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I; given hearings before MNF\xe2\x80\x93I Tribunals composed of American officers, who concluded that petitioners posed threats to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security; and placed in the custody of the U. S. military operating as part of the MNF-I.  Family members filed next-friend habeas corpus petitions on behalf of both petitioners in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Omar\xe2\x80\x99s case, after the Department of Justice informed Omar that the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I had decided to refer him to the Central Criminal Court of Iraq for criminal proceedings, his attorney sought and obtained a preliminary injunction from the District Court barring Omar\xe2\x80\x99s removal from United States or MNF-I custody.  Affirming, the D. C. Circuit first upheld the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of habeas jurisdiction, finding that <em>Hirota</em> v. <em>MacArthur</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/338/197/index.html">338 U. S. 197</a>, did not preclude review because Omar, unlike the habeas petitioners in<em> Hirota</em>, had yet to be convicted by a foreign tribunal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Meanwhile, the District Court in Munaf\xe2\x80\x99s case dismissed his habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.  The court concluded that <em>Hirota</em> controlled and required that the petition be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the American forces holding Munaf were operating as part of an international force\xe2\x80\x94the MNF-I.  The D. C. Circuit agreed and affirmed.  It distinguished its prior decision in <em>Omar</em>, which upheld jurisdiction over Omar\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition, on the grounds that Munaf had been convicted by a foreign tribunal while Omar had not.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The habeas statute extends to American citizens held overseas by American forces operating subject to an American chain of command.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the federal courts lack jurisdiction over the detainees\xe2\x80\x99 habeas petitions in such circumstances because the American forces holding Omar and Munaf operate as part of a multinational force is rejected.  The habeas statute, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241(c)(1), applies to persons held \xe2\x80\x9cin custody under or by color of the authority of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The disjunctive \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72241(c)(1) makes clear that actual Government custody suffices for jurisdiction, even if that custody could be viewed as \xe2\x80\x9cunder \xe2\x80\xa6 color of\xe2\x80\x9d another authority, such as the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I.  </p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the District Court lacks jurisdiction in these cases because the multinational character of the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I, like the multinational character of the tribunal at issue in Hirota</em>, means that the MNF-I is not a United States entity subject to habeas.  The present cases differ from <em>Hirota </em>in several respects.  The Court in <em>Hirota</em> may have found it significant, in considering the nature of the tribunal established by General MacArthur, that in that case the Government argued that General MacArthur was not subject to United States authority, that his duty was to obey the Far Eastern Commission and not the U. S. War Department, and that no process this Court could issue would have any effect on his action.   Here, in contrast, the Government acknowledges that U. S. military commanders answer to the President.  These cases also differ from <em>Hirota </em>in that they concern American citizens, and the Court has indicated that habeas jurisdiction can depend on citizenship.  See <em>e.g., Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/index.html">339 U. S. 763</a>, 781.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02. Federal district courts, however, may not exercise their habeas jurisdiction to enjoin the United States from transferring individuals alleged to have committed crimes and detained within the territory of a foreign sovereign to that sovereign for criminal prosecution.  Because petitioners state no claim in their habeas petitions for which relief can be granted, their habeas petitions should have been promptly dismissed, and no injunction should have been entered.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9328.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The District Court abused its discretion in granting Omar a preliminary injunction, which the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit interpreted as prohibiting the Government from (1) transferring Omar to Iraqi custody, (2) sharing with the Iraqi Government details concerning any decision to release him, and (3) presenting him to the Iraqi courts for investigation and prosecution, without even considering the merits of the habeas petition.  A preliminary injunction is an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary and drastic remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  It should never be awarded as of right, <em>Yakus</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/414/index.html">321 U. S. 414</a>, 440, and requires a demonstration of, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9ca likelihood of success on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>O Centro Esp\xc3\xadrita Beneficente Uni\xc4\x83o do Vegetal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/418/index.html">546 U. S. 418</a>, 428.   But neither the District Court nor the D. C. Circuit considered the likelihood of success as to the merits of Omar\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.  Instead, the lower courts concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional issues\xe2\x80\x9d implicated by Omar\xe2\x80\x99s petition presented difficult and substantial questions.  A difficult question as to jurisdiction is, of course, no reason to grant a preliminary injunction.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The foregoing analysis would require reversal and remand in each of these cases: The lower courts in Munaf erred in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, and the lower courts in Omar erred in issuing and upholding the preliminary injunction.  Our review of a preliminary injunction, however, \xe2\x80\x9cis not confined to the act of granting the injunctio[n].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>City and County of Denver</em> v. <em>New York Trust Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/229/123/index.html">229 U. S. 123</a>, 136.  Rather, a reviewing court has the power on appeal from an interlocutory order \xe2\x80\x9cto examine the merits of the case \xe2\x80\xa6 and upon deciding them in favor of the defendant to dismiss the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>North Carolina R. Co.</em> v. <em>Story</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/268/288/index.html">268 U. S. 288</a>, 292.  In short, there are occasions when it is appropriate for a court reviewing a preliminary injunction to proceed to the merits; given that the present cases implicate sensitive foreign policy issues in the context of ongoing military operations, this is one of them.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that they are entitled to habeas relief because they have a legally enforceable right not to be transferred to Iraqi authorities for criminal proceedings and because they are innocent civilians unlawfully detained by the Government.  With respect to the transfer claim, they request an injunction prohibiting the Government from transferring them to Iraqi custody.  With respect to the unlawful detention claim, they seek release but only to the extent it would not result in unlawful transfer to Iraqi custody.  Because both requests would interfere with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign right to \xe2\x80\x9cpunish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Girard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/524/index.html">354 U. S. 524</a>, 529, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims do not state grounds upon which habeas relief may be granted.  Their habeas petitions should have been promptly dismissed and no injunction should have been entered.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9328.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Habeas is governed by equitable principles.  Thus, prudential concerns may \xe2\x80\x9crequire a federal court to forgo the exercise of its habeas \xe2\x80\xa6 power.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Francis</em> v. <em>Henderson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/536/index.html">425 U. S. 536</a>, 539.   Here, the unusual nature of the relief sought by petitioners suggests that habeas is not appropriate.  Habeas is at its core a remedy for unlawful executive detention.  <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/507/index.html">542 U. S. 507</a>, 536.  The typical remedy is, of course, release.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Preiser</em> v. <em>Rodriguez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/475/index.html">411 U. S. 475</a>, 484.  But the habeas petitioners in these cases do not want simple release; that would expose them to apprehension by Iraqi authorities for criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x94precisely what they went to federal court to avoid.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The habeas petitioners do not dispute that they voluntarily traveled to Iraq, that they remain detained within the sovereign territory of Iraq today, or that they are alleged to have committed serious crimes in Iraq.  Indeed, Omar and Munaf both concede that, if they were not in MNF\xe2\x80\x93I custody, Iraq would be free to arrest and prosecute them under Iraqi law.  Further, Munaf is the subject of ongoing Iraqi criminal proceedings and Omar would be but for the present injunction.  Given these facts, Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute them for crimes committed on its soil, even if its criminal process does not come with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, see <em>Neely</em> v. <em>Henkel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/180/109/index.html">180 U. S. 109</a>, 123.  As Chief Justice Marshall explained nearly two centuries ago, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schooner Exchange</em> v. <em>McFaddon</em>, 7 Cranch 116, 136.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has twice applied that principle in rejecting claims that the Constitution precludes the Executive from transferring a prisoner to a foreign country for prosecution in an allegedly unconstitutional trial.  <em>Wilson, supra,</em> at 529\xe2\x80\x93530; <em>Neely</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 112\xe2\x80\x93113, 122.  Omar and Munaf concede that Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute them for alleged violations of its law.  Yet they went to federal court seeking an order that would allow them to defeat precisely that sovereign authority.  But habeas corpus does not bar the United States from transferring a prisoner to the sovereign authority he concedes has a right to prosecute him.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9crelease\xe2\x80\x9d claim adds nothing to their \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer\xe2\x80\x9d claim and fails for the same reasons, given that the release they seek is release that would avoid transfer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is of course even more at issue here: <em>Neely</em> involved a charge of embezzlement and <em>Wilson </em>the peacetime actions of a serviceman.  The present cases concern individuals captured and detained within an ally\xe2\x80\x99s territory during ongoing hostilities involving our troops.  It would be very odd to hold that the Executive can transfer individuals such as those in the <em>Neely </em>and <em>Wilson </em>cases, but cannot transfer to an ally detainees captured by our Armed Forces for engaging in serious hostile acts against that ally in what the Government refers to as \xe2\x80\x9can active theater of combat.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9323. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 allegations that their transfer to Iraqi custody is likely to result in torture are a matter of serious concern but those allegations generally must be addressed by the political branches, not the judiciary.  The recognition that it is for the democratically elected branches to assess practices in foreign countries and to determine national policy in light of those assessments is nothing new.  As Chief Justice Marshall explained in the <em>Schooner Exchange</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cexemptions from territorial jurisdiction . . . must be derived from the consent of the sovereign of the territory\xe2\x80\x9d and are \xe2\x80\x9crather questions of policy than of law, \xe2\x80\xa6 they are for diplomatic, rather than legal discussion.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Cranch, at 143, 146.  In the present cases, the Government explains that it is the policy of the United States not to transfer an individual in circumstances where torture is likely to result and that the State Department has determined that the Justice Ministry\xe2\x80\x94the department which has authority over Munaf and Omar\xe2\x80\x94as well as its prison and detention facilities, have generally met internationally accepted standards for basic prisoner needs.  The judiciary is not suited to second-guess such determinations.  Pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that, under <em>Valentine</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Neidecker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/5/index.html">299 U. S. 5</a>, the Executive lacks discretion to transfer a citizen to Iraqi custody unless \xe2\x80\x9clegal authority\xe2\x80\x9d to do so \xe2\x80\x9cis given by act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 9, is rejected.  <em>Valentine </em>was an extradition case; the present cases involve the transfer to a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s authority of an individual captured and already detained in that sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s territory.  <em>Wilson, supra,</em> also forecloses petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contention.  A Status of Forces Agreement there seemed to give the habeas petitioner a right to trial by an American military tribunal, rather than a Japanese court, 354 U. S., at 529, but this Court found no \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional or statutory\xe2\x80\x9d impediment to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of its jurisdiction in light of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign interest in prosecuting crimes committed within its borders, <em>id.,</em> at 530.

The force operates under the unified command of United States military officers, at the request of the Iraqi Government, and in accordance with United Nations (U.\xc2\xa0N.) Security Council Resolutions.  Pursuant to the U.\xc2\xa0N. mandate, MNF\xe2\x80\x93I forces detain individuals alleged to have committed hostile or warlike acts in Iraq, pending investigation and prosecution in Iraqi courts under Iraqi law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These consolidated cases concern the availability of habeas corpus relief arising from the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I\xe2\x80\x99s detention of American citizens who voluntarily traveled to Iraq and are alleged to have committed crimes there.  We are confronted with two questions.  <em>First</em>, do United States courts have jurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of American citizens challenging their detention in Iraq by the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I?  <em>Second</em>, if such jurisdiction exists, may district courts exercise that jurisdiction to enjoin the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I from transferring such individuals to Iraqi custody or allowing them to be tried before Iraqi courts?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that the habeas statute extends to American citizens held overseas by American forces operating subject to an American chain of command, even when those forces are acting as part of a multinational coalition.  Under circumstances such as those presented here, however, habeas corpus provides petitioners with no relief.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pursuant to its U.\xc2\xa0N. mandate, the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the authority to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. G to Pet. for Cert. in 07\xe2\x80\x93394, p.\xc2\xa074a, \xc2\xb610 (quoting U.\xc2\xa0N. Security Council, U.\xc2\xa0N. Doc. S/Res/1546, \xc2\xb610 (June 2004)).  To this end, the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I engages in a variety of military and humanitarian activities.  The multinational force, for example, conducts combat operations against insurgent factions, trains and equips Iraqi security forces, and aids in relief and reconstruction efforts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MNF\xe2\x80\x93I forces also detain individuals who pose a threat to the security of Iraq.  The Government of Iraq retains ultimate responsibility for the arrest and imprisonment of individuals who violate its laws, but because many of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s prison facilities have been destroyed, the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I agreed to maintain physical custody of many such individuals during Iraqi criminal proceedings.  MNF\xe2\x80\x93I forces are currently holding approximately 24,000 detainees.  An American military unit, Task Force 134, oversees detention operations and facilities in Iraq, including those located at Camp Cropper, the detention facility currently housing Shawqi Omar and Mohammad Munaf (herein-\nafter petitioners).  The unit is under the command of United States military officers who report to General David Petraeus.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Shawqi Omar, an American-Jordanian citizen, voluntarily traveled to Iraq in 2002.  In October 2004, Omar was captured and detained in Iraq by U. S. military forces operating as part of the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I during a raid of his Baghdad home.  Omar is believed to have provided aid to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi\xe2\x80\x94the late leader of al Qaeda in Iraq\xe2\x80\x94by facilitating his group\xe2\x80\x99s connection with other terrorist groups, bringing foreign fighters into Iraq, and planning and executing kidnappings in Iraq.  MNF\xe2\x80\x93I searched his home in an effort to capture and detain insurgents who were associated with al-Zarqawi.  The raid netted an Iraqi insurgent and four Jordanian fighters along with explosive devices and other weapons. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The captured insurgents gave sworn statements implicating Omar in insurgent cell activities.  The four Jordanians testified that they had traveled to Iraq with Omar to commit militant acts against American and other Coalition Forces.  Each of the insurgents stated that, while living in Omar\xe2\x80\x99s home, they had surveilled potential kidnap victims and conducted weapons training.  The insurgents explained that Omar\xe2\x80\x99s fluency in English allowed him to lure foreigners to his home in order to kidnap and sell them for ransom.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following Omar\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, a three-member MNF\xe2\x80\x93I Tribunal composed of American military officers concluded that Omar posed a threat to the security of Iraq and designated him a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity internee.\xe2\x80\x9d  The tribunal also found that Omar had committed hostile and warlike acts, and that he was an enemy combatant in the war on terrorism.

The CRRB, like the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I Tribunal, concluded that Omar\xe2\x80\x99s continued detention was necessary because he posed a threat to Iraqi security.

In light of these admissions, it is unsurprising that the United States has never argued that it lacks the authority to release Munaf or Omar, or that it requires the consent of other countries to do so.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think these concessions the end of the jurisdictional inquiry.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument\xe2\x80\x94that the federal courts have no jurisdiction over American citizens held by American forces operating as multinational agents\xe2\x80\x94is not easily reconciled with the text of \xc2\xa72241(c)(1).

The disjunctive \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72241(c)(1) makes clear that actual custody by the United States suffices for jurisdiction, even if that custody could be viewed as \xe2\x80\x9cunder \xe2\x80\xa6 color of\xe2\x80\x9d another authority, such as the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s primary contention is that the District Courts lack jurisdiction in these cases because of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Hirota</em>.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That slip of a case cannot bear the weight the Government would place on it.  In <em>Hirota</em>, Japanese citizens sought permission to file habeas corpus applications directly in this Court.  The petitioners were noncitizens detained in Japan.  They had been convicted and sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East\xe2\x80\x94an international tribunal established by General Douglas MacArthur acting, as the Court put it, in his capacity as \xe2\x80\x9cthe agent of the Allied Powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  338 U. S., at 198.  Although those familiar with the history of the period would appreciate the possibility of confusion over who General MacArthur took orders from, the Court concluded that the sentencing tribunal was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a tribunal of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court then held that, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder the foregoing circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d United States courts had \xe2\x80\x9cno power or authority to review, to affirm, set aside or annul the judgments and sentences\xe2\x80\x9d imposed by that tribunal.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Accordingly, the Court denied petitioners leave to file their habeas corpus applications, without further legal analysis.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that the multinational character of the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I, like the multinational character of the tribunal at issue in <em>Hirota</em>, means that it too is not a United States entity subject to habeas.  Reply Brief for Federal Parties 5\xe2\x80\x937.  In making this claim, the Government acknowledges that the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I is subject to American authority, but contends that the same was true of the tribunal at issue in <em>Hirota</em>.  In <em>Hirota</em>, the Government notes, the petitioners were held by the United States Eighth Army, which took orders from General MacArthur, 338 U. S., at 199 (Douglas, J., concurring), and were subject to an \xe2\x80\x9cunbroken\xe2\x80\x9d chain of U.

The facts suggesting that the tribunal in <em>Hirota</em> was subject to an \xe2\x80\x9cunbroken\xe2\x80\x9d United States chain of command were not among the \xe2\x80\x9cforegoing circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d cited in the <em>per curiam </em>opinion disposing of the case, <em>id.,</em> at 198.  They were highlighted only in Justice Douglas\xe2\x80\x99s belated opinion concurring in the result, published five months after that <em>per curiam</em>.  <em>Id.</em>, at 199, n.*.  Indeed, arguing before this Court, Solicitor General Perlman stated that General MacArthur did not serve \xe2\x80\x9cunder the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\xe2\x80\x9d that his duty was \xe2\x80\x9cto obey the directives of the Far Eastern Commission and not our War Department,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cno process that could be issued from this court \xe2\x80\xa6 would have any effect on his action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>Hirota</em> v. <em>MacArthur</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1948, No. 239, pp. 42, 50, 51.

These cases concern American citizens while <em>Hirota </em>did not, and the Court has indicated that habeas jurisdiction can depend on citizenship.

Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa72948, p. 129 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller) (footnotes omitted); it is never awarded as of right, <em>Yakus</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/414/index.html">321 U.

Rather, a party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9ca likelihood of success on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>O Centro Esp\xc3\xadrita Beneficente Uni\xc4\x83o do Vegetal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/418/index.html">546 U.

But one searches the opinions below in vain for any mention of a likelihood of success as<em> </em>to the merits of Omar\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.  Instead, the District Court concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>jurisdictional </em>issues\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>presented questions \xe2\x80\x9cso serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberative investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Omar</em> v. <em>Harvey,</em> 416 F.

As a result, the Court of Appeals held that it \xe2\x80\x9cneed not address\xe2\x80\x9d the merits of Omar\xe2\x80\x99s habeas claims: those merits had \xe2\x80\x9cno relevance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A difficult question as to jurisdiction is, of course, no reason to grant a preliminary injunction.  It says nothing about the \xe2\x80\x9clikelihood of success on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d other than making such success more <em>unlikely</em> due to potential impediments to even reaching<em> </em>the merits.  Indeed, if all a \xe2\x80\x9clikelihood of success on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d meant was that the district court likely had jurisdiction, then preliminary injunctions would be the rule, not the exception.  In light of these basic principles, we hold that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to grant a preliminary injunction on the view that the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional issues\xe2\x80\x9d in Omar\xe2\x80\x99s case were tough, without even considering the merits of the underlying habeas petition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What we have said thus far would require reversal and remand in each of these cases: The lower courts in <em>Munaf </em>erred in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, and the lower courts in <em>Omar </em>erred in issuing and upholding the preliminary injunction.

S. 241</a>, 251 (1886), follows from the precatory language of the habeas statute, and from its common-law origins.  The habeas statute provides only that a writ of habeas corpus \xe2\x80\x9c<em>may</em> be granted,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72241(a) (emphasis added), and directs federal courts to \xe2\x80\x9cdispose of [habeas petitions] as law and justice require,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72243.  See <em>Danforth</em> v. <em>Minnesota</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314).  Likewise, the writ did not issue in England \xe2\x80\x9cas of mere course,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather required the petitioner to demonstrate why the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary power of the crown\xe2\x80\x9d should be exercised, 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 132 (1768); even then, courts were directed to \xe2\x80\x9cdo as to justice shall appertain,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 <em>id.</em>, at 131 (1765).  The question, therefore, even where a habeas court has the power to issue the writ, is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether this be a case in which [that power] ought to be exercised.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte Watkins</em>, 3 Pet. 193, 201 (1830) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the outset, the nature of the relief sought by the habeas petitioners suggests that habeas is not appropriate in these cases.  Habeas is at its core a remedy for unlawful executive detention.  <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/507/index.html">542 U. S. 507</a>, 536 (2004) (plurality opinion).  The typical remedy for such detention is, of course, release.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Preiser</em> v. <em>Rodriguez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/475/index.html">411 U. S. 475</a>, 484 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody\xe2\x80\x9d).  But here the last thing petitioners want is simple release; that would expose them to apprehension by Iraqi authorities for criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x94precisely what petitioners went to federal court to avoid.  At the end of the day, what petitioners are really after is a court order requiring the United States to shelter them from the sovereign government seeking to have them answer for alleged crimes committed within that sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s borders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The habeas petitioners do not dispute that they voluntarily traveled to Iraq, that they remain detained within the sovereign territory of Iraq today, or that they are alleged to have committed serious crimes in Iraq.  Indeed, Omar and Munaf both concede that, if they were not in MNF\xe2\x80\x93I custody, Iraq would be free to arrest and prosecute them under Iraqi law.  See Tr. in <em>Omar,</em> No. 06\xe2\x80\x935126 (CADC), pp. 48\xe2\x80\x9349, 59 (Sept. 11, 2006); Tr. in <em>Mohammed, </em>No. 06\xe2\x80\x931455 (DC), pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (Oct. 10, 2006).    There is, moreover, no question that Munaf is the subject of ongoing Iraqi criminal proceedings and that Omar would be but for the present injunction.  Munaf was convicted by the CCCI, and while that conviction was overturned on appeal, his case was remanded to and is again pending before the CCCI.  The MNF\xe2\x80\x93I referred Omar to the CCCI for prosecution at which point he sought and obtained an injunction that prohibits his prosecution.  See 479 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 16, n.\xc2\xa03 (Brown, J., dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[Omar] has not yet had a trial or even an investigative hearing in the CCCI due to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented injunction\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (citing Opposition to Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Motion for Injunctive Relief 18\xe2\x80\x9319, in <em>Munaf </em>v. <em>Harvey</em>, No. 06\xe2\x80\x935324 (CADC, Oct. 25, 2006))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given these facts, our cases make clear that Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute Omar and Munaf for crimes committed on its soil.  As Chief Justice Marshall explained nearly two centuries ago, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schooner Exchange</em> v. <em>McFaddon</em>, 7 Cranch 116, 136 (1812).

We disagree.

We noted that Japan had exclusive jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cto punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\xe2\x80\x9d unless it had surrendered that jurisdiction.  <em>Id.,</em> at 529.  Consequently, even though Japan had ceded some of its jurisdiction to the United States pursuant to a bilateral Status of Forces Agreement, the United States could waive that jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94as it had done in Girard\xe2\x80\x99s case\xe2\x80\x94and the habeas court was without authority to enjoin Girard\xe2\x80\x99s transfer to the Japanese authorities.  <em>Id.</em>, at 529\xe2\x80\x93530.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, in <em>Neely</em> v. <em>Henkel</em>, <em>supra</em>, this Court held that habeas corpus was not available to defeat the criminal jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign, even when application of that sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s law would allegedly violate the Constitution.  Neely\xe2\x80\x94the habeas petitioner and an American citizen\xe2\x80\x94was accused of violating Cuban law in Cuba.  <em>Id.</em>, at 112\xe2\x80\x93113.  He was arrested and detained in the United States.  <em>Id.</em>, at 113.  The United States indicated its intent to extradite him, and Neely filed suit seeking to block his extradition on the grounds that Cuban law did not provide the panoply of rights guaranteed him by the Constitution of the United States.  <em>Id</em>., at 122.  We summarily rejected this claim: \xe2\x80\x9cThe answer to this suggestion is that those [constitutional] provisions have no relation to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the United States against the laws of a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Neely alleged no claim for which a \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge on <em>habeas corpus</em>\xe2\x80\x9d could issue.  <em>Id.</em>, at 125.  Accordingly, the United States was free to transfer him to Cuban custody for prosecution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present cases, the habeas petitioners concede that Iraq has the sovereign authority to prosecute them for alleged violations of its law, yet nonetheless request an injunction prohibiting the United States from transferring them to Iraqi custody.  But as the foregoing cases make clear, habeas is not a means of compelling the United States to harbor fugitives from the criminal justice system of a sovereign with undoubted authority to prosecute them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9crelease\xe2\x80\x9d claim adds nothing to their \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer\xe2\x80\x9d claim.  That claim fails for the same reasons the transfer claim fails, given that the release petitioners seek is release in a form that would avoid transfer.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\xe2\x80\x9348; App. 40 (coupling Munaf\xe2\x80\x99s claim for release with a request for order requiring the United States to bring him to a U. S. court); App. 123 (same with respect to Omar).  Such \xe2\x80\x9crelease\xe2\x80\x9d would impermissibly interfere with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wilson, supra</em>, at 529; the \xe2\x80\x9crelease\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners seek is nothing less than an order commanding our forces to smuggle them out of Iraq.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals in Omar\xe2\x80\x99s case took the extraordinary step of upholding an injunction that prohibited the Executive from releasing Omar\xe2\x80\x94the quintessential habeas remedy\xe2\x80\x94if the United States shared information about his release with its military ally, Iraq.  479 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 13.  Habeas does not require the United States to keep an unsuspecting nation in the dark when it releases an alleged criminal insurgent within its borders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, because Omar and Munaf are being held by United States Armed Forces at the behest of the Iraqi Government pending their prosecution in Iraqi courts, <em>Mohammed</em>, 456 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 117, release of <em>any</em> kind would interfere with the sovereign authority of Iraq \xe2\x80\x9cto punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wilson, supra</em>, at 529.  This point becomes clear given that the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I, pursuant to its U.\xc2\xa0N. mandate, is authorized to \xe2\x80\x9ctake all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d App. G to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x93394, p. 74a, \xc2\xb610, and specifically to provide for the \xe2\x80\x9cinternment [of individuals in Iraq] where this is necessary for imperative reasons of security,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 86a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Iraqi Government is ultimately \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible for [the] arrest, detention and imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d of individuals who violate its laws, S.\xc2\xa0C. Res. 1790, Annex I, \xc2\xb64, p.\xc2\xa06, U.\xc2\xa0N. Doc. S/RES/1790 (Dec. 18, 2007), the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I maintains physical custody of individuals like Munaf and Omar while their cases are being heard by the CCCI, <em>Mohammed</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 117.  Indeed, Munaf is currently held at Camp Cropper pursuant to the express order of the Iraqi Courts.  See <em>In re Hikmat</em>, No. 19/Pub. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n/2007, at 5 (directing that Munaf \xe2\x80\x9cremain in custody pending the outcome\xe2\x80\x9d of further Iraqi proceedings).  As that court order makes clear, MNF\xe2\x80\x93I detention is an integral part of the Iraqi system of criminal justice.  MNF\xe2\x80\x93I forces augment the Iraqi Government\xe2\x80\x99s peacekeeping efforts by functioning, in essence, as its jailor.  Any requirement that the MNF\xe2\x80\x93I release a detainee would, in effect, impose a release order on the Iraqi Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The habeas petitioners acknowledge that <em>some </em>interference with a foreign criminal system is too much.  They concede that \xe2\x80\x9cit is axiomatic that an American court does not provide collateral review of proceedings in a foreign tribunal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Habeas Petitioners 39 (citing <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/677/index.html">541 U. S. 677</a>, 700 (2004)).  We agree, but see no reason why habeas corpus should permit a prisoner detained within a foreign sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s territory to prevent a trial from going forward in the first place.  It did not matter that the habeas petitioners in <em>Wilson</em> and <em>Neely</em> had not been convicted.  354 U. S., at 525\xe2\x80\x93526; 180 U. S., at 112\xe2\x80\x93113.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9cthe same principles of comity and respect for foreign sovereigns that preclude judicial scrutiny of foreign convictions necessarily render invalid attempts to shield citizens from foreign prosecution in order to preempt such nonreviewable adjudications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Omar</em>, 479 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 17 (Brown, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To allow United States courts to intervene in an ongoing foreign criminal proceeding and pass judgment on its legitimacy seems at least as great an intrusion as the plainly barred collateral review of foreign convictions.

Yet in those cases we held that the Constitution allows the Executive to transfer American citizens to foreign authorities for criminal prosecution.  It would be passing strange to hold that the Executive lacks that same authority where, as here, the detainees were captured by our Armed Forces for engaging in serious hostile acts against an ally in what the Government refers to as \xe2\x80\x9can active theater of combat.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Parties 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such a conclusion would implicate not only concerns about interfering with a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s recognized prerogative to apply its criminal law to those alleged to have committed crimes within its borders, but also concerns about unwarranted judicial intrusion into the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conduct military operations abroad.  Our constitutional framework \xe2\x80\x9crequires that the judiciary be as scrupulous not to interfere with legitimate Army matters as the Army must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Orloff</em> v. <em>Willoughby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/83/index.html">345 U. S. 83</a>, 94 (1953).  Those who commit crimes within a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s territory may be transferred to that sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s government for prosecution; there is hardly an exception to that rule when the crime at issue is not embezzlement but unlawful insurgency directed against an ally during ongoing hostilities involving our troops.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners contend that these general principles are trumped in their cases because their transfer to Iraqi custody is likely to result in torture.  This allegation was raised in Munaf\xe2\x80\x99s petition for habeas, App. 39, \xc2\xb646, but not in Omar\xe2\x80\x99s.  Such allegations are of course a matter of serious concern, but in the present context that concern is to be addressed by the political branches, not the judiciary.  See M. Bassiouni, International Extradition: United States Law and Practice 921 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Habeas corpus</em> has been held not to be a valid means of inquiry into the treatment the relator is anticipated to receive in the requesting state\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion is reflected in the cases already cited.  Even with respect to claims that detainees would be denied constitutional rights if transferred, we have recognized that it is for the political branches, not the judiciary, to assess practices in foreign countries and to determine national policy in light of those assessments.  Thus, the Court in <em>Neely</em> concluded that an American citizen who \xe2\x80\x9ccommits a crime in a foreign country\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccannot complain if required to submit to such modes of trial and to such punishment as the laws of that country may prescribe for its own people,\xe2\x80\x9d but went on to explain that this was true \xe2\x80\x9cunless a different mode be provided for by treaty stipulation between that country and the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  180 U.

Diplomacy was the means of addressing the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the same token, while the Court in <em>Wilson </em>stated the general principle that a \xe2\x80\x9csovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders,\xe2\x80\x9d it recognized that this rule could be altered by diplomatic agreement in light of particular concerns\xe2\x80\x94as it was in that case\xe2\x80\x94and by a decision of the Executive to waive jurisdiction granted under that agreement\xe2\x80\x94as it was in that case.  354 U. S., at 529.  See also <em>Kinsella</em>, 351 U. S., at 479 (alteration of jurisdictional rule through \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully drawn agreements\xe2\x80\x9d).  This recognition that it is the political branches that bear responsibility for creating exceptions to the general rule is nothing new; as Chief Justice Marshall explained in the <em>Schooner Exchange</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cexemptions from territorial jurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6 must be derived from the consent of the sovereign of the territory\xe2\x80\x9d and are \xe2\x80\x9crather questions of policy than of law, that they are for diplomatic, rather than legal discussion.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Cranch, at 143, 146.  The present concerns are of the same nature as the loss of constitutional rights alleged in <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Neely</em>,<em> </em>and are governed by the same principles.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Executive Branch may, of course, decline to surrender a detainee for many reasons, including humanitarian ones.  Petitioners here allege only the possibility of mistreatment in a prison facility; this is not a more extreme case in which the Executive has determined that a detainee is likely to be tortured but decides to transfer him anyway.  Indeed, the Solicitor General states that it is the policy of the United States <em>not</em> to transfer an individual in circumstances where torture is likely to result.  Brief for Federal Parties 47; Reply Brief for Federal Parties 23.  In these cases the United States explains that, although it remains concerned about torture among some sectors of the Iraqi Government, the State Department has determined that the Justice Ministry\xe2\x80\x94the department that would have authority over Munaf and Omar\xe2\x80\x94as well as its prison and detention facilities have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98generally met internationally accepted standards for basic prisoner needs.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Solicitor General explains that such determinations are based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe Executive\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the foreign country\xe2\x80\x99s legal system and \xe2\x80\xa6 the Executive[\xe2\x80\x99s] \xe2\x80\xa6 ability to obtain foreign assurances it considers reliable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Parties 47.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Judiciary is not suited to second-guess such determinations\xe2\x80\x94determinations that would require federal courts to pass judgment on foreign justice systems and undermine the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to speak with one voice in this area.  See The Federalist No. 42, p. 279 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf we are to be one nation in any respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations\xe2\x80\x9d).  In contrast, the political branches are well situated to consider sensitive foreign policy issues, such as whether there is a serious prospect of torture at the hands of an ally, and what to do about it if there is.  As Judge Brown noted, \xe2\x80\x9cwe need not assume the political branches are oblivious to these concerns.  Indeed, the other branches possess significant diplomatic tools and leverage the judiciary lacks.\xe2\x80\x9d  479 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 20, n.\xc2\xa06 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners briefly argue that their claims of potential torture may not be readily dismissed on the basis of these principles because the FARR Act prohibits transfer when torture may result.  Brief for Habeas Petitioners 51\xe2\x80\x9352.  Neither petitioner asserted a FARR Act claim in his petition for habeas, and the Act was not raised in any of the certiorari filings before this Court.  Even in their merits brief in this Court, the habeas petitioners hardly discuss the issue.  <em>Id.,</em> at 17, 51\xe2\x80\x9352, 57\xe2\x80\x9358.  The Government treats the issue in kind.  Reply Brief for Federal Parties 24\xe2\x80\x9326.  Under such circumstances we will not consider the question.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the habeas petitioners raise the additional argument that the United States may not transfer a detainee to Iraqi custody, not because it would be unconstitutional to do so, but because the \xe2\x80\x9c[G]overnment may not transfer a citizen without legal authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Habeas Petitioners 54.  The United States, they claim, bears the burden of \xe2\x80\x9cidentify[ing] a treaty or statute that permits it to transfer the[m] to Iraqi custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 49.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The habeas petitioners rely prominently on <em>Valentine</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Neidecker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/5/index.html">299 U. S. 5</a> (1936), where we ruled that the Executive may not extradite a person held within the United States unless \xe2\x80\x9clegal authority\xe2\x80\x9d to do so \xe2\x80\x9cis given by act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 9.  But <em>Valentine </em>is readily distinguishable.  It involved the extradition of an individual from the United States; this is not an extradition case, but one involving the transfer to a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s authority of an individual captured and already detained in that sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s territory.  In the extradition context, when a \xe2\x80\x9cfugitive criminal\xe2\x80\x9d is found within the United States, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98there is no authority vested in any department of the government to seize [him] and surrender him to a foreign power,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the absence of a pertinent constitutional or legislative provision.  <em>Ibid.  </em>But Omar and Munaf voluntarily traveled to Iraq and are being held there.  They are therefore subject to the territorial jurisdiction of that sovereign, not of the United States.  Moreover, as we have explained, the petitioners are being held by the United States, acting as part of MNF\xe2\x80\x93I, at the request of and on behalf of the Iraqi Government.  It would be more than odd if the Government had no authority to transfer them to the very sovereign on whose behalf, and within whose territory, they are being detained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The habeas petitioners further contend that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Wilson</em> supports their argument that the Executive lacks the discretion to transfer a citizen absent a treaty or statute.  Brief for Habeas Petitioners 54\xe2\x80\x9355.  Quite the opposite.  <em>Wilson</em> forecloses it.  The only \xe2\x80\x9cauthority\xe2\x80\x9d at issue in <em>Wilson</em>\xe2\x80\x94a Status of Forces Agreement\xe2\x80\x94seemed to give the habeas petitioner in that case a right to be tried by an American military tribunal, not a Japanese court.  354 U. S., at 529.  Nevertheless, in light of the background principle that Japan had a sovereign interest in prosecuting crimes committed within its borders, this Court found no \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional or statutory\xe2\x80\x9d impediment to the United States\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of its jurisdiction under the agreement. <em> Id.</em>, at 530.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Munaf and Omar are alleged to have committed hostile and warlike acts within the sovereign territory of Iraq during ongoing hostilities there.  Pending their criminal prosecution for those offenses, Munaf and Omar are being held in Iraq by American forces operating pursuant to a U.\xc2\xa0N. Mandate and at the request of the Iraqi Government.  Petitioners concede that Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute them for alleged violations of its law.  Yet they went to federal court seeking an order that would allow them to defeat precisely that sovereign authority.  Habeas corpus does not require the United States to shelter such fugitives from the criminal justice system of the sovereign with authority to prosecute them.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all the reasons given above, petitioners state no claim in their habeas petitions for which relief can be granted, and those petitions should have been promptly dismissed.

There is, however, some authority for the proposition that this Court has original subject-matter jurisdiction only over \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137, 174 (1803) (quoting U.

The injunction is not so easily narrowed.  It was entered on the theory that Omar might be \xe2\x80\x9cpresented to the CCCI and in that same day, be tried, [and] convicted,\xe2\x80\x9d thus depriving the United States district courts of jurisdiction.  <em>Omar</em> v. <em>Harvey</em>, 416 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 19, 29 (DC 2006).  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation makes no sense under that theory: If a conviction would deprive the habeas court of jurisdiction, a trial, with or without the defendant, could result in just such a jurisdiction-divesting order.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The United States has in fact entered into treaties that provide procedural protections to American citizens tried in other nations.

Even if considered on the merits, several issues under the FARR Act claim would have to be addressed.  First, the Act speaks to situations where a detainee is being \xe2\x80\x9creturned\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ca country.\xe2\x80\x9d  FARR Act \xc2\xa72242(a), 112 Stat. 2681\xe2\x80\x93822 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be the policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, regardless of whether the person is physically present in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1465 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 85, Art. 3, S. Treaty Doc.

It is not settled that the Act addresses the transfer of an individual located in Iraq to the Government of Iraq; arguably such an individual is not being \xe2\x80\x9creturned\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ca country\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he is already there.</p>\n<p>\n\nSecond, claims under the FARR Act may be limited to certain immigration proceedings.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion makes clear that those circumstances include the following: (1) Omar and Munaf \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily traveled to Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 16.  They are being held (2) in the \xe2\x80\x9cterritory\xe2\x80\x9d of (3) an \xe2\x80\x9call[y]\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States, <em>ante, </em>at 22, (4) by our troops, see <em>ante, </em>at 8, (5) \xe2\x80\x9cduring ongoing hostilities\xe2\x80\x9d that (6) \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] our troops,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 22.  (7) The government of a foreign sovereign, Iraq, has decided to prosecute them \xe2\x80\x9cfor crimes committed on its soil.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 17.  And (8) \xe2\x80\x9cthe State Department has determined that \xe2\x80\xa6 the department that would have authority over Munaf and Omar \xe2\x80\xa6 as well as its prison and detention facilities have generally met internationally accepted standards for basic prisoner needs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because I consider these circumstances essential to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, I join its opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court accordingly reserves judgment on an \xe2\x80\x9cextreme case in which the Executive has determined that a detainee [in United States custody] is likely to be tortured but decides to transfer him anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  I would add that nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion should be read as foreclosing relief for a citizen of the United States who resists transfer, say, from the American military to a foreign government for prosecution in a case of that sort, and I would extend the caveat to a case in which the probability of torture is well documented, even if the Executive fails to acknowledge it.  Although the Court rightly points out that any likelihood of extreme mistreatment at the receiving government\xe2\x80\x99s hands is a proper matter for the political branches to consider, see <em>ante,</em> at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, if the political branches did favor transfer it would be in order to ask whether substantive due process bars the Government from consigning its own people to torture.  And although the Court points out that habeas is aimed at securing release, not protective detention, see <em>ante,</em> at 16, habeas would not be the only avenue open to an objecting prisoner; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere federally protected rights [are threatened], it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Hood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/678/index.html">327 U.
