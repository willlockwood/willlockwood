Agency</i> v. <i>Arkison</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Inter partes review falls squarely within the public-rights doctrine.  The decision to grant a patent is a matter involving public rights.  Inter partes review is simply a reconsideration of that grant, and Congress has permissibly reserved the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s authority to conduct that reconsideration.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(i) The grant of a patent falls within the public-rights doctrine.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Duell</i>,\n\n172 U.\xc2\xa0S. 576, 582\n\xe2\x80\x93583.

Specifically, patents are \xe2\x80\x9cpublic franchises.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Seymour</i> v. <i>Osborne</i>, 11 Wall. 516, 533.  Additionally, granting patents is one of \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional functions\xe2\x80\x9d that can be carried out by \xe2\x80\x9cthe executive or legislative departments\xe2\x80\x9d without \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judicial determination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Crowell</i> v. <i>Benson</i>,\n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 22, 50\n\xe2\x80\x9351.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(ii)\xc2\xa0Inter partes review involves the same basic matter as the grant of a patent.  It is \xe2\x80\x9ca second look at an earlier .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. grant,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC</i> v. <i>Lee</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, and it involves the same interests as the original grant, see <i>Duell</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 586.  That inter partes review occurs after the patent has issued does not make a difference here.  Patents remain \xe2\x80\x9csubject to [the Board\xe2\x80\x99s] authority\xe2\x80\x9d to cancel outside of an Article III court, <i>Crowell, supra, </i>at 50, and this Court has recognized that franchises can be qualified in this manner, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Louisville Bridge Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n242 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409, 421\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Three decisions that recognize patent rights as the \xe2\x80\x9cprivate property of the patentee,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States</i> v. <i>American Bell Telephone Co.</i>,\n\n128 U.\xc2\xa0S. 315, 370\n, do not contradict this conclusion.  See also <i>McCormick Harvesting Machine Co.</i> v. <i>Aultman</i>,\n\n169 U.\xc2\xa0S. 606, 609\n; <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Duchesne</i>, 19 How. 183, 197.  Nor do they foreclose the kind of post-issuance administrative review that Congress has authorized here.  Those cases were decided under the Patent Act of 1870 and are best read as describing the statutory scheme that existed at that time.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Although patent validity was often decided in 18th-century English courts of law, that history does not establish that inter partes review violates the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d principle that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress may not \xe2\x80\x98withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Stern</i> v. <i>Marshall</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 462, 484\n.  Another means of canceling a patent at that time\xe2\x80\x94a petition to the Privy Council to vacate a patent\xe2\x80\x94closely resembles inter partes review.  The parties have cited nothing to suggest that the Framers were not aware of this common practice when writing the Patent Clause, or that they excluded the practice from the scope of the Clause.   Relatedly, the fact that American courts have traditionally adjudicated patent validity in this country does not mean that they must forever do so.  See <i>post</i>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  Historical practice is not decisive here because matters governed by the public-rights doctrine may be assigned to the Legislature, the Executive, or the Judiciary.  <i>Ex parte Bakelite Corp.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 451.  That Congress chose the courts in the past does not foreclose its choice of the PTO today.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0Finally, the similarities between the various procedures used in inter partes review and procedures typically used in courts does not lead to the conclusion that inter partes review violates Article III.  This Court has never adopted a \xe2\x80\x9clooks like\xe2\x80\x9d test to determine if an adjudication has improperly occurred outside an Article III court.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Williams</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n289 U.\xc2\xa0S. 553, 563\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(e)\xc2\xa0This holding is narrow.  The Court addresses only the constitutionality of inter partes review and the precise constitutional challenges that Oil States raised here.  The decision should not be misconstrued as suggesting that patents are not property for purposes of the Due Process Clause or the Takings Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0Inter partes review does not violate the\n \nSeventh Amendment.  When Congress properly assigns a matter to adjudication in a non-Article III tribunal, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nSeventh Amendment poses no independent bar to the adjudication of that action by a nonjury factfinder.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Granfinanciera, S. A.</i> v. <i>Nordberg</i>,\n\n492 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33, 52\n\xe2\x80\x9353.  Thus, the rejection of Oil States\xe2\x80\x99 Article III challenge also resolves its\n \nSeventh Amendment challenge.

Congress can grant patents itself by statute.  See, <i>e.g., Bloomer </i>v. <i>McQuewan</i>, 14 How. 539, 548\xe2\x80\x93550 (1853).  And, from the founding to today, Congress has authorized the Executive Branch to grant patents that meet the statutory requirements for patentability.

It need not be adjudicated in Article III court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Inter partes review involves the same basic matter as the grant of a patent.

The Board considers the same statutory requirements that the PTO considered when granting the patent.  See\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7311(b).  Those statutory requirements prevent the \xe2\x80\x9cissuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Graham </i>v. <i>John Deere Co. of Kansas City</i>,\n\n383 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 6 (1966)\n.  So, like the PTO\xe2\x80\x99s initial review, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s inter partes review protects \xe2\x80\x9cthe public\xe2\x80\x99s paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cuozzo</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Thus, inter partes review involves the same interests as the determination to grant a patent in the first instance.  See <i>Duell</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 586.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The primary distinction between inter partes review and the initial grant of a patent is that inter partes review occurs <i>after </i>the patent has issued.  But that distinction does not make a difference here.  Patent claims are granted subject to the qualification that the PTO has \xe2\x80\x9cthe au- thority to reexamine\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps cancel\xe2\x80\x94a patent claim\xe2\x80\x9d in an inter partes review.  See <i>Cuozzo</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 3).  Patents thus remain \xe2\x80\x9csubject to [the Board\xe2\x80\x99s] authority\xe2\x80\x9d to cancel outside of an Article III court.  <i>Crowell</i>, 285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has recognized that franchises can be qualified in this manner.  For example, Congress can grant a franchise that permits a company to erect a toll bridge, but qualify the grant by reserving its authority to revoke or amend the franchise.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Louisville Bridge Co. </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n242 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409, 421 (1917)\n (collecting cases).  Even after the bridge is built, the Government can exercise its reserved authority through legislation or an administrative proceeding.  See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 420\xe2\x80\x93421; <i>Hannibal Bridge Co. </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n221 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194, 205 (1911)\n;<i> Bridge Co. </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n105 U.\xc2\xa0S. 470, 478\n\xe2\x80\x93482 (1882).  The same is true for franchises that permit companies to build railroads or telegraph lines.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>United States </i>v. <i>Union Pacific R. Co.</i>,\n\n160 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 24\n\xe2\x80\x9325, 37\xe2\x80\x9338 (1895).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, the public-rights doctrine covers the matter resolved in inter partes review.  The Constitution does not prohibit the Board from resolving it outside of an Article III court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Oil States challenges this conclusion, citing three decisions that recognize patent rights as the \xe2\x80\x9cprivate property of the patentee.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>American Bell Telephone Co.</i>, 128 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 370; see also <i>McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. </i>v. <i>Aultman</i>,\n\n169 U.\xc2\xa0S. 606, 609 (1898)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[A granted patent] has become the property of the patentee\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Du- chesne</i>, 19 How. 183, 197 (1857) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he rights of a party under a patent are his private property\xe2\x80\x9d).  But those cases do not contradict our conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Patents convey only a specific form of property right\xe2\x80\x94a public franchise.  See <i>Pfaff</i>, 525 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 63\xe2\x80\x9364.  And patents are \xe2\x80\x9centitled to protection as any other property, <i>consisting of a franchise</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Seymour</i>, 11 Wall. at 533 (emphasis added).  As a public franchise, a patent can confer only the rights that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute prescribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gayler</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 494; <i>Wheaton </i>v. <i>Peters</i>, 8 Pet. 591, 663\xe2\x80\x93664 (1834) (noting that Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to prescribe the conditions on which such right shall be enjoyed\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is noteworthy that one of the precedents cited by Oil States acknowledges that the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s rights are \xe2\x80\x9cderived altogether\xe2\x80\x9d from statutes, \xe2\x80\x9care to be regulated and measured by these laws, and cannot go beyond them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Brown</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 195.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One such regulation is inter partes review.  See <i>Cuozzo</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  The Patent Act provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubject to the provisions of this title, patents shall have the attributes of personal property.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7261.  This provision qualifies any property rights that a patent owner has in an issued patent, subjecting them to the express provisions of the Patent Act.  See <i>eBay Inc. </i>v. <i>MercExchange, L. L. C.</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388, 392 (2006)\n.  Those provisions include inter partes review.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7311\xe2\x80\x93319.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor do the precedents that Oil States cites foreclose the kind of post-issuance administrative review that Congress has authorized here.  To be sure, two of the cases make broad declarations that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he only authority competent to set a patent aside, or to annul it, or to correct it for any reason whatever, is vested in the courts of the United States, and not in the department which issued the pat- ent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCormick</i> <i>Harvesting Machine Co.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 609; accord, <i>American Bell Telephone Co.</i>, 128 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 364.  But those cases were decided under the Patent Act of 1870.  See <i>id</i>., at 371; <i>McCormick Harvesting Machine Co.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 611.  That version of the Patent Act did not include any provision for post-issuance administrative review.  Those precedents, then, are best read as a description of the statutory scheme that existed at that time.  They do not resolve Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Constitution to establish a different scheme.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Oil States and the dissent contend that inter partes review violates the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d principle that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress may not \xe2\x80\x98withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stern</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 484 (quoting <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 18 How., at 284).  They argue that this is so because patent validity was often decided in English courts of law in the 18th century.  For example, if a patent owner brought an infringement action, the defendant could challenge the validity of the patent as an affirmative defense.  See Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide If Patents Are Valid? 99 Va. L. Rev. 1673, 1682, 1685\xe2\x80\x931686, and n.\xc2\xa052 (2013).  Or, an individual could challenge the validity of a patent by filing a writ of <i>scire facias</i> in the Court of Chancery, which would sit as a law court when adjudicating the writ.  See <i>id.,</i> at 1683\xe2\x80\x931685, and n.\xc2\xa044; Bottomley, Patent Cases in the Court of Chancery, 1714\xe2\x80\x9358, 35 J. Legal Hist. 27, 36\xe2\x80\x9337, 41\xe2\x80\x9343 (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this history does not establish that patent validity is a matter that, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom its nature,\xe2\x80\x9d must be decided by a court.  <i>Stern</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 484 (quoting <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 284).  The aforementioned proceedings were between private parties.  But there was another means of canceling a patent in 18th-century England, which more closely resembles inter partes review: a petition to the Privy Council to vacate a patent.  See Lemley, <i>supra,</i> at 1681\xe2\x80\x931682; Hulme, Privy Council Law and Practice of Letters Patent for Invention From the Restoration to 1794, 33 L. Q. Rev. 63 (1917).  The Privy Council was composed of the Crown\xe2\x80\x99s advisers.  Lemley, <i>supra,</i> at 1681.  From the 17th through the 20th centuries, English patents had a standard revocation clause that permitted six or more Privy Counsellors to declare a patent void if they determined the invention was contrary to law, \xe2\x80\x9cprejudicial\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinconvenient,\xe2\x80\x9d not new, or not invented by the patent owner.  See 11 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 426\xe2\x80\x93427, and n.\xc2\xa06 (1938); Davies, The Early History of the Patent Specification, 50 L. Q. Rev. 86, 102\xe2\x80\x93106 (1934).  Individuals could petition the Council to revoke a patent, and the petition was referred to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General examined the petition, considered affidavits from the petitioner and patent owner, and heard from counsel.  See, <i>e.g., Bull </i>v. <i>Lydall</i>, PC2/81, pp. 180\xe2\x80\x93181 (1706).  Depending on the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, the Council would either void the patent or dismiss the petition.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Darby</i> v. <i>Betton</i>, PC2/99, pp. 358\xe2\x80\x93359 (1745\xe2\x80\x931746) (voiding the patent); <i>Baker</i> v. <i>James</i>, PC2/103, pp. 320\xe2\x80\x93321, 346\xe2\x80\x93347 (1752) (dismissing the petition).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Privy Council was a prominent feature of the English system.  It had exclusive authority to revoke patents until 1753, and after that, it had concurrent jurisdiction with the courts.  See Hulme, 33 L. Q. Rev., at 189\xe2\x80\x93191, 193\xe2\x80\x93194.  The Privy Council continued to consider revocation claims and to revoke patents throughout the 18th century.  Its last revocation was in 1779.  See <i>id.,</i> at 192\xe2\x80\x93193.  It considered, but did not act on, revocation claims in 1782, 1794, and 1810.  See <i>ibid.</i>; <i>Board of Ordinance </i>v. <i>Parr</i>, PC1/3919 (1810).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Patent Clause in our Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cwas written against the backdrop\xe2\x80\x9d of the English system.  <i>Graham</i>, 383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 5.  Based on the practice of the Privy Council, it was well understood at the founding that a patent system could include a practice of granting patents subject to potential cancellation in the executive proceeding of the Privy Council.  The parties have cited nothing in the text or history of the Patent Clause or Article III to suggest that the Framers were not aware of this common practice.  Nor is there any reason to think they excluded this practice during their deliberations.  And this Court has recognized that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithin the scope established by the Constitution, Congress may set out conditions and tests for patentability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 6.  We conclude that inter partes review is one of those conditions.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For similar reasons, we disagree with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that, because courts have traditionally adjudicated patent validity in this country, courts must forever continue to do so.  See <i>post,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  Historical practice is not decisive here because matters governed by the public-rights doctrine \xe2\x80\x9cfrom their nature\xe2\x80\x9d can be resolved in multiple ways: Congress can \xe2\x80\x9creserve to itself the power to decide,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdelegate that power to executive officers,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccommit it to judicial tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ex parte Bakelite Corp.</i>, 279 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 451.  That Congress chose the courts in the past does not foreclose its choice of the PTO today.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, Oil States argues that inter partes review violates Article III because it shares \xe2\x80\x9cevery salient characteristic associated with the exercise of the judicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 20.  Oil States highlights various procedures used in inter partes review: motion practice before the Board; discovery, depositions, and cross-examination of witnesses; introduction of evidence and objections based on the Federal Rules of Evidence; and an adversarial hearing before the Board.  See\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7316(a); 77 Fed. Reg. 48758, 48761\xe2\x80\x9348763 (2012).  Similarly, Oil States cites PTO regulations that use terms typically associated with courts\xe2\x80\x94calling the hearing a \xe2\x80\x9ctrial,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 48758; the Board members \xe2\x80\x9cjudges,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 48763; and the Board\xe2\x80\x99s final decision a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 48761, 48766\xe2\x80\x9348767.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this Court has never adopted a \xe2\x80\x9clooks like\xe2\x80\x9d test to determine if an adjudication has improperly occurred outside of an Article III court.  The fact that an agency uses court-like procedures does not necessarily mean it is exercising the judicial power.  See <i>Freytag</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 910 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  This Court has rejected the notion that a tribunal exercises Article III judicial power simply because it is \xe2\x80\x9ccalled a court and its decisions called judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n289 U.\xc2\xa0S. 553, 563 (1933)\n.  Nor does the fact that an administrative adjudication is final and binding on an individual who acquiesces in the result necessarily make it an exercise of the judicial power.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 18 How., at 280\xe2\x80\x93281 (permitting the Treasury Department to conduct \xe2\x80\x9cfinal and binding\xe2\x80\x9d audits outside of an Article III court).  Al- though inter partes review includes some of the features of adversarial litigation, it does not make any binding determination regarding \xe2\x80\x9cthe liability of [Greene\xe2\x80\x99s Energy] to [Oil States] under the law as defined.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Crowell</i>, 285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51.

We address the constitutionality of inter partes review only.  We do not address whether other patent matters, such as infringement actions, can be heard in a non-Article III forum.  And because the Patent Act provides for judicial review by the Federal Circuit, see\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7319, we need not consider whether inter partes review would be constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cwithout any sort of intervention by a court at any stage of the proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Atlas Roofing Co. </i>v. <i>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 442, 455\n, n.\xc2\xa013 (1977).  Moreover, we address only the precise constitutional challenges that Oil States raised here.  Oil States does not challenge the retroactive application of inter partes review, even though that procedure was not in place when its patent issued.  Nor has Oil States raised a due process challenge.  Finally, our decision should not be misconstrued as suggesting that patents are not property for purposes of the Due Process Clause or the Takings Clause.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. </i>v. <i>College Savings Bank</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 627, 642 (1999)\n; <i>James </i>v. <i>Campbell</i>,\n\n104 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356, 358 (1882)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In addition to Article III, Oil States challenges inter partes review under the\n \nSeventh Amendment.  The\n \nSeventh Amendment preserves the \xe2\x80\x9cright of trial by jury\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cSuits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents establish that, when Congress properly assigns a matter to adjudication in a non-Article III tribunal, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nSeventh Amendment poses no independent bar to the adjudication of that action by a nonjury factfinder.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Granfinanciera, S.\xc2\xa0A. </i>v. <i>Nordberg</i>,\n\n492 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33, 53\n\xe2\x80\x9354 (1989); accord, <i>Atlas Roofing Co.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 450\xe2\x80\x93455.  No party challenges or attempts to distinguish those precedents.  Thus, our rejection of Oil States\xe2\x80\x99 Article III challenge also resolves its\n \nSeventh Amendment challenge.

See 169 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 609\xe2\x80\x93610.  Modern invention patents, by contrast, are meaningfully different from land patents.

Then you endure the further cost and effort of applying for a patent, devoting maybe $30,000 and two years to that process alone.  At the end of it all, the Patent Office agrees your invention is novel and issues a patent.  The patent affords you exclusive rights to the fruits of your labor for two decades.  But what happens if someone later emerges from the woodwork, arguing that it was all a mistake and your patent should be canceled?  Can a political appointee and his administrative agents, instead of an independent judge, resolve the dispute?  The Court says yes.  Respectfully, I disagree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We sometimes take it for granted today that independent judges will hear our cases and controversies.  But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always so.  Before the Revolution, colonial judges depended on the crown for their tenure and salary and often enough their decisions followed their interests.  The problem was so serious that the founders cited it in their Declaration of Independence (see \xc2\xb611).  Once free, the framers went to great lengths to guarantee a degree of judicial independence for future generations that they themselves had not experienced.  Under the Constitution, judges \xe2\x80\x9chold their Offices during good Behaviour\xe2\x80\x9d and their \xe2\x80\x9cCompensation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall not be diminished during the[ir] Continuance in Office.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. III, \xc2\xa71.  The framers knew that \xe2\x80\x9ca fixed provision\xe2\x80\x9d for judges\xe2\x80\x99 financial support would help secure \xe2\x80\x9cthe independence of the judges,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9ca power over a man\xe2\x80\x99s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 79, p.\xc2\xa0472 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted).  They were convinced, too, that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]eriodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to [the courts\xe2\x80\x99] necessary independence.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A. Hamilton).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today, the government invites us to retreat from the promise of judicial independence.  Until recently, most everyone considered an issued patent a personal right\xe2\x80\x94no less than a home or farm\xe2\x80\x94that the federal government could revoke only with the concurrence of independent judges.  But in the statute before us Congress has tapped an executive agency, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, for the job.  Supporters say this is a good thing because the Patent Office issues too many low quality patents; allowing a subdivision of that office to clean up problems after the fact, they assure us, promises an efficient solution.  And, no doubt, dispensing with constitutionally prescribed procedures is often expedient.  Whether it is the guarantee of a warrant before a search, a jury trial before a conviction\xe2\x80\x94or, yes, a judicial hearing before a property interest is stripped away\xe2\x80\x94the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s constraints can slow things down.  But economy supplies no license for ignoring these\xe2\x80\x94often vitally inefficient\xe2\x80\x94 protections.  The Constitution \xe2\x80\x9creflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is not our place to replace that judgment with our own.  <i>United States </i>v.<i> Stevens</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460, 470 (2010)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider just how efficient the statute before us is.  The Director of the Patent Office is a political appointee who serves at the pleasure of the President.  35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(a)(1), (a)(4).  He supervises and pays the Board members responsible for deciding patent disputes.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71(a), 3(b)(6), 6(a).  The Director is allowed to select which of these members, and how many of them, will hear any particular patent challenge.  See \xc2\xa76(c).  If they (somehow) reach a result he does not like, the Director can add more members to the panel\xe2\x80\x94including himself\xe2\x80\x94and order the case reheard.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76(a), (c); <i>In re Alappat</i>, 33 F.\xc2\xa03d 1526, 1535 (CA Fed. 1994) (en banc); <i>Nidec Motor Corp. </i>v.<i> Zhongshan Broad Ocean Motor Co.

But can there be any doubt that it also represents a retreat from the promise of judicial independence?  Or that when an independent Judiciary gives ground to bureaucrats in the adjudication of cases, the losers will often prove the unpopular and vulnerable?  Powerful interests are capable of amassing armies of lobbyists and lawyers to influence (and even capture) politically accountable bureaucracies.  But what about everyone else?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, all this invites the question: how do we know which cases independent judges must hear?  The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s original public meaning supplies the key, for the Constitution cannot secure the people\xe2\x80\x99s liberty any less today than it did the day it was ratified.  The relevant constitutional provision, Article III, explains that the federal \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial Power\xe2\x80\x9d is vested in independent judges.  As originally understood, the judicial power extended to \xe2\x80\x9csuit[s] at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i> v. <i>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</i>, 18 How. 272, 284 (1856).  From this and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve recently explained, it follows that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a suit is made of the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the courts at Westminster in 1789 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and is brought within the bounds of federal jurisdiction, the responsibility for deciding that suit rests with\xe2\x80\x9d Article III judges endowed with the protections for their independence the framers thought so important.  <i>Stern </i>v.<i> Marshall</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 462, 484 (2011)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court does not quarrel with this test.  See <i>ante</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  We part ways only on its application.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As I read the historical record presented to us, only courts could hear patent challenges in England at the time of the founding.  If facts were in dispute, the matter first had to proceed in the law courts.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Newsham </i>v. <i>Gray</i>, 2 Atk. 286, 26 Eng. Rep. 575 (Ch. 1742).  If successful there, a challenger then had to obtain a writ of <i>scire facias</i> in the law side of the Court of Chancery.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Pfander, Jurisdiction-Stripping and the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Power To Supervise Inferior Tribunals, 78 Texas L. Rev. 1433, 1446, n.\xc2\xa053 (2000); Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide If Patents Are Valid? 99 Va. L. Rev. 1673, 1686\xe2\x80\x931687 (2013) (Lemley, Juries).  The last time an executive body (the King\xe2\x80\x99s Privy Council) invalidated an invention patent on an ordinary application was in 1746, in <i>Darby </i>v. <i>Betton</i>, PC2/99, pp.\xc2\xa0358\xe2\x80\x93359; and the last time the Privy Council even <i>considered</i> doing so was in 1753, in <i>Baker </i>v. <i>James</i>, PC2/103, pp.\xc2\xa0320\xe2\x80\x93321.  After <i>Baker </i>v. <i>James</i>, the Privy Council \xe2\x80\x9cdivest[ed] itself of its functions\xe2\x80\x9d in ordinary patent disputes, Hulme, Privy Council Law and Practice of Letters Patent for Invention from the Restoration to 1794 (Pt. II), 33 L. Q. Rev. 180, 194 (1917), which \xe2\x80\x9cthereafter [were] adjudicated solely by the law courts, as opposed to the [crown\xe2\x80\x99s] prerogative courts,\xe2\x80\x9d Mossoff, Rethinking the Development of Patents: An Intellectual History, 1550\xe2\x80\x931800, 52 Hastings L.\xc2\xa0J. 1255, 1286\xe2\x80\x931287 (2001) (Mossoff, Rethinking Patents).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This shift to courts paralleled a shift in thinking.  Patents began as little more than feudal favors.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1261.  The crown both issued and revoked them.  Lemley, Juries 1680\xe2\x80\x931681.  And they often permitted the lucky recipient the exclusive right to do very ordinary things, like operate a toll bridge or run a tavern.  <i>Ibid.  </i>But by the 18th century, inventors were busy in Britain and invention patents came to be seen in a different light.  They came to be viewed not as endowing accidental and anticompetitive monopolies on the fortunate few but as a procompetitive means to secure to individuals the fruits of their labor and ingenuity; encourage others to emulate them; and promote public access to new technologies that would not otherwise exist.  Mossoff, Rethinking Patents 1288\xe2\x80\x931289.  The Constitution itself reflects this new thinking, authorizing the issuance of patents precisely because of their contribution to the \xe2\x80\x9cProgress of Science and useful Arts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn essence, there was a change in perception\xe2\x80\x94from viewing a patent as a contract between the crown and the patentee to viewing it as a \xe2\x80\x98social contract\xe2\x80\x99 between the patentee and society.\xe2\x80\x9d  Waltersheid, The Early Evolution of the United States Patent Law: Antecedents (Part 3), 77 J. Pat. &amp; T. Off. Soc. 771, 793 (1995).  And as invention patents came to be seen so differently, it is no surprise courts came to treat them more solicitously.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unable to dispute that judges alone resolved virtually all patent challenges by the time of the founding, the Court points to three English cases that represent the Privy Council\xe2\x80\x99s dying gasp in this area: <i>Board of Ordnance </i>v. <i>Wilkinson</i>,<i> </i>PC2/123 (1779); <i>Grill [Grice] </i>v.<i> Waters</i>, PC2/127 (1782); and <i>Board of Ordnance </i>v. <i>Parr</i>,<i> </i>PC1/3919 (1810).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Filed in 1779, 1782, and 1810, each involved an effort to override a patent on munitions during wartime, no doubt in an effort to increase their supply.  But even then appealing to the Privy Council was seen as a last resort.  The 1779 petition (the last Privy Council revocation ever) came only after the patentee twice refused instructions to litigate the patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity in a court of law.  G\xc3\xb3mez-Arostegui &amp; Bottomley, Privy Council and <i>Scire Facias</i> 1700\xe2\x80\x931883, p.\xc2\xa06 (Nov. 6, 2017) https://ssrn.com/abstract=3054989 (citing <i>Board of Ordnance </i>v. <i>Wilkinson</i>,<i> </i>PC2/123 (1779), and PC1/11/150 (1779)).

Meanwhile, in response to the 1810 petition the Attorney General admitted that <i>scire facias</i> was the \xe2\x80\x9cusual manner\xe2\x80\x9d of revoking a patent and so directed the petitioner to proceed at law even as he suggested the Privy Council might be available in the event of a \xe2\x80\x9cvery pressing and imminent\xe2\x80\x9d danger to the public.  <i>Id.,</i> at 20 (citing PC1/3919 (1810)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the end, these cases do very little to support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  At most, they suggest that the Privy Council might have possessed some residual power to revoke patents to address wartime necessities.  Equally, they might serve only as more unfortunate evidence of the maxim that in time of war, the laws fall silent.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  But whatever they do, these cases do not come close to proving that patent disputes were routinely permitted to proceed outside a court of law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Any lingering doubt about English law is resolved for me by looking to our own.  While the Court is correct that the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Clause \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98was written against the backdrop\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of English practice, <i>ante, </i>at 14 (quoting <i>Graham</i> v. <i>John Deere Co. of Kansas City</i>,\n\n383 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 5 (1966)\n), it\xe2\x80\x99s also true that the Clause sought to <i>reject</i> some of early English practice.  Reflecting the growing sentiment that patents shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used for anticompetitive monopolies over \xe2\x80\x9cgoods or businesses which had long before been enjoyed by the public,\xe2\x80\x9d the framers wrote the Clause to protect only procompetitive invention patents that are the product of hard work and insight and \xe2\x80\x9cadd to the sum of useful knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  In light of the Patent Clause\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on this score, courts took the view that when the federal government \xe2\x80\x9cgrants a patent the grantee is entitled to it <i>as a matter of right</i>, and does not receive it, as was originally supposed to be the case in England, as a matter of grace and favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>James</i> v. <i>Campbell</i>,\n\n104 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356, 358 (1882)\n (emphasis added).  As Chief Justice Marshall explained, courts treated American invention patents as recognizing an \xe2\x80\x9cinchoate property\xe2\x80\x9d that exists \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the moment of invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Evans </i>v.<i> Jordan</i>, 8 F. Cas. 872, 873 (No. 4,564) (CC Va. 1813).  American patent holders thus were thought to \xe2\x80\x9chol[d] a property in [their] invention[s] by as good a title as the farmer holds his farm and flock.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hovey </i>v.<i> Henry</i>, 12 F. Cas. 603, 604 (No. 6,742) (CC Mass. 1846) (Woodbury, J.).  And just as with farm and flock, it was widely accepted that the government could divest patent owners of their rights only through proceedings before independent judges.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This view held firm for most of our history.  In fact, from the time it established the American patent system in 1790 until about 1980, Congress left the job of invalidating patents at the federal level to courts alone.  The only apparent exception to this rule cited to us was a 4 year period when <i>foreign</i> patentees had to \xe2\x80\x9cwork\xe2\x80\x9d or commercialize their patents or risk having them revoked.  Hovenkamp, The Emergence of Classical American Patent Law, 58 Ariz. L. Rev. 263, 283\xe2\x80\x93284 (2016).  And the fact that for almost 200 years \xe2\x80\x9cearlier Congresses avoided use of [a] highly attractive\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and surely more efficient\xe2\x80\x94means for extinguishing patents should serve as good \xe2\x80\x9creason to believe that the power was thought not to exist\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the founding.  <i>Printz </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 898, 905 (1997)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One more episode still underscores the point.  When the Executive sought to claim the right to cancel a patent in the 1800s, this Court firmly rebuffed the effort.  The Court explained:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been settled by repeated decisions of this court that when a patent has [been issued by] the Patent Office, it has passed beyond the control and jurisdiction of that office, and is not subject to be revoked or cancelled by the President, or any other officer of the Government.  It has become the property of the patentee, and as such is entitled to the same legal protection as other property.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. </i>v.<i> Aultman</i>,\n\n169 U.\xc2\xa0S. 606, 608\n\xe2\x80\x93609 (1898) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a result, the Court held, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he only authority competent to set a patent aside, or to annul it, or to correct it for any reason whatever, is vested in the courts of the United States, and not in the department which issued the pat- ent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 609.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court today replies that <i>McCormick</i> sought only to interpret certain statutes then in force, not the Constitution.  <i>Ante</i>, at 11, and n.\xc2\xa03.  But this much is hard to see.  Allowing the Executive to withdraw a patent, <i>McCormick</i> said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be to deprive the applicant of his property without due process of law, and would be in fact an invasion of the judicial branch of the government by the executive.\xe2\x80\x9d  169 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 612.  <i>McCormick</i> also pointed to \xe2\x80\x9crepeated decisions\xe2\x80\x9d in similar cases that themselves do not seem to rest merely on statutory grounds.  See <i>id.</i>, at 608\xe2\x80\x93609 (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Schurz</i>,\n\n102 U.\xc2\xa0S. 378 (1880)\n, and <i>United States</i> v. <i>American Bell Telephone Co.</i>,\n\n128 U.\xc2\xa0S. 315 (1888)\n).  And <i>McCormick </i>equated invention patents with land patents.  169 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 609<i>.  </i>That is significant because, while the Executive has always dispensed public lands to homesteaders and other private persons, it has never been constitutionally empowered to withdraw land patents from their recipients (or their successors-in-interest) except through a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment of a court.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v.<i> Stone</i>, 2 Wall. 525, 535 (1865); <i>Wellness Int\xe2\x80\x99l Network, Ltd. </i>v.<i> Sharif</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough Congress could authorize executive agencies to dispose of public rights in lands\xe2\x80\x94often by means of adjudicating a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications for a land grant under a statute\xe2\x80\x94the United States had to go to the courts if it wished to revoke a patent\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With so much in the relevant history and precedent against it, the Court invites us to look elsewhere.  Instead of focusing on the revocation of patents, it asks us to abstract the level of our inquiry and focus on their issuance.  Because the job of issuing invention patents traditionally belonged to the Executive, the Court proceeds to argue, the job of revoking them can be left there too.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x9310.  But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t follow.  Just because you give a gift doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you forever enjoy the right to reclaim it.  And, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, just because the Executive could <i>issue</i> an invention (or land) patent did not mean the Executive could <i>revoke</i> it.  To reward those who had proven the social utility of their work (and to induce others to follow suit), the law long afforded patent holders more protection than that against the threat of governmental intrusion and dispossession.  The law requires us to honor those historical rights, not diminish them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Still, the Court asks us to look away in yet another direction.  At the founding, the Court notes, the Executive could sometimes both dispense and revoke public franchises.  And because, it says, invention patents are a species of public franchises, the Court argues the Executive should be allowed to dispense and revoke them too.  <i>Ante</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But labels aside, by the time of the founding the law treated patents protected by the Patent Clause quite differently from ordinary public franchises.  Many public franchises amounted to little more than favors resembling the original royal patents the framers expressly refused to protect in the Patent Clause.  The Court points to a good example: the state-granted exclusive right to operate a toll bridge.  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  By the founding, courts in this country (as in England) had come to view anticompetitive monopolies like that with disfavor, narrowly construing the rights they conferred.  See<i> Proprietors of Charles River Bridge</i> v. <i>Proprietors of Warren Bridge</i>, 11 Pet. 420, 544 (1837).  By contrast, courts routinely applied to invention patents protected by the Patent Clause the \xe2\x80\x9cliberal common sense construction\xe2\x80\x9d that applies to other instruments creating private property rights, like land deeds.  <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Palmer</i>, 7 F. Cas. 154, 158 (No. 3,645) (CC Va. 1827) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.); see also Mossoff, Reevaluating the Patent Privilege 990 (listing more differences in treatment).  As Justice Story explained, invention patents protected by the Patent Clause were \xe2\x80\x9cnot to be treated as mere monopolies odious in the eyes of the law, and therefore not to be favored.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ames </i>v.<i> Howard</i>, 1 F. Cas. 755, 756 (No. 326) (CC Mass. 1833).  For precisely these reasons and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, the law traditionally treated pat- ents issued under the Patent Clause very differently than monopoly franchises when it came to governmental invasions.  Patents alone required independent judges.  Nor can simply invoking a mismatched label obscure that fact.  The people\xe2\x80\x99s historic rights to have independent judges decide their disputes with the government should not be a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented\xe2\x80\x9d by such \xe2\x80\x9csimpl[e] maneuver[s].\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Bank Markazi</i> v. <i>Peterson</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision may not represent a rout but it at least signals a retreat from Article III\xe2\x80\x99s guarantees.  Ceding to the political branches ground they wish to take in the name of efficient government may seem like an act of judicial restraint.  But enforcing Article III isn\xe2\x80\x99t about protecting judicial authority for its own sake.  It\xe2\x80\x99s about ensuring the people today and tomorrow enjoy no fewer rights against governmental intrusion than those who came before.  And the loss of the right to an independent judge is never a small thing.  It\xe2\x80\x99s for that reason Hamilton warned the judiciary to take \xe2\x80\x9call possible care .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to defend itself against\xe2\x80\x9d intrusions by the other branches.
