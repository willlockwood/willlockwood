In 1972, the Act was amended by expanding the "navigable waters" situs to include certain adjoining land and by adding a status requirement that employees covered by the Act be "engaged in maritime employment" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 2(3) of the Act.  In this case, an employee (Churchill) of respondent construction firm was injured while performing his job on the deck of a cargo barge being used in the construction of a sewage treatment plant extending over the Hudson River in New York.  Churchill\'s claim for compensation under the LHWCA was administratively denied on the ground that he was not "engaged in maritime employment" under \xc2\xa7 2(3).  On Churchill\'s petition for review, in which the Director of the Office of Workers\' Compensation Programs (Director) (petitioner here) participated as respondent in support of Churchill, the Court of Appeals held that Churchill was not in "maritime employment" because his employment lacked a "significant relationship to navigation or to commerce on navigable waters."</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1.

(part 2) 1424, as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="299">Page 459 U. S. 299</a></p><p> amended, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 901 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. V) (hereinafter LHWCA or Act).  Before 1972, LHWCA coverage extended only to injuries sustained on the actual "navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock)."  44 Stat. (part 2) 1426.  As part of its 1972 Amendments of the Act, Congress expanded the "navigable waters" <em>situs</em> to include certain adjoining land areas, \xc2\xa7 3(a), 86 Stat. 1251, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 903(a).  At the same time, Congress added a <em>status</em> requirement that employees covered by the Act must be "engaged in maritime employment" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 2(3) of the Act. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  We granted certiorari in this case, 455 U.S. 937 (1982), to consider whether a marine construction worker, who was injured while performing his job upon actual navigable waters, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and who would have been covered by the Act before 1972, is "engaged in maritime employment," and thus covered by the amended Act. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We hold that the worker is "engaged in maritime employment" for purposes of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 459 U. S. 300</a></p><p> coverage under the amended LHWCA. Accordingly, we reverse the decision below.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The facts are not in dispute.  Respondent Perini North River Associates (Perini) contracted to build the foundation of a sewage treatment plant that extends approximately 700 feet over the Hudson River between 136th and 145th Streets in Manhattan.  The project required that Perini place large, hollow circular pipes called caissons in the river, down to embedded rock, fill the caissons with concrete, connect the caissons together above the water with concrete beams, and place precast concrete slabs on the beams.  The caissons were delivered by rail to the shore, where they were loaded onto supply barges and towed across the river to await unloading and installation.</p>\n<p>The injured worker, Raymond Churchill, was an employee of Perini in charge of all work performed on a cargo barge used to unload caissons and other materials from the supply barges and to set caissons in position for insertion into the embedded rock.  Churchill was on the deck of the cargo barge giving directions to a crane operator engaged in unloading a caisson from a supply barge when a line used to keep the caissons in position snapped and struck Churchill.  He sustained injuries to his head, leg, and thumb. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Churchill filed a claim for compensation under the LHWCA.  Perini denied that Churchill was covered by the Act, and, after a formal hearing pursuant to \xc2\xa7 19 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 919 (1976 ed. and Supp. V), an Administrative Law Judge determined that Churchill was not "engaged in maritime employment" under \xc2\xa7 2(3) of the Act because his job lacked "some relationship to navigation and commerce on navigable waters."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a.  Churchill and the Director, Office of Workers\' Compensation Programs </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 459 U. S. 301</a></p><p> (Director), appealed to the Benefits Review Board, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 21(b)(3) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 921(b)(3).  The Board affirmed the Administrative Law Judge\'s denial of coverage on the theory that marine construction workers involved in building facilities not ultimately used in navigation or commerce upon navigable waters are not engaged in "maritime employment."  12 BRBS 929, 933 (1980). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  One Board Member dissented, arguing that</p>\n<p>"all injuries sustained in the course of employment by employees over \'navigable waters,\' as that term was defined prior to the 1972 Amendments, are covered under the [amended] Act."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 935. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Churchill then sought review of the Board\'s decision in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, under \xc2\xa7 21(c) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 921(c). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Director participated as respondent, and filed a brief in support of Churchill\'s position.  The Second Circuit denied Churchill\'s petition, relying on its decision in <em>Fusco v. Perini North River Associates,</em> 622 F.2d 1111 (1980), <em>cert. denied,</em> 449 U.S. 1131 (1981).  According to the Second Circuit, Churchill was not in "maritime employment," because his employment lacked a "<em>significant relationship to navigation or to commerce on navigable waters.\'"  <em>Churchill v. Perini North River Associates,</em> 652 F.2d 255, 256, n. 1 (1981).  The Director now seeks review of the Second Circuit denial of Churchill\'s petition.  The Director agrees with the position taken by the dissenting member of the Benefits Review Board:  the LHWCA does not require </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 459 U. S. 302</a></em></p><p><em> that an employee show that his employment possesses a "significant relationship to navigation or to commerce," where, as here, the employee is injured while working upon the actual navigable waters in the course of his employment, and would have been covered under the pre-1972 LHWCA. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Before we consider whether Churchill is covered by the Act, we must address Perini\'s threshold contention that the Director does not have standing to seek review of the decision below.  According to Perini, the Director\'s only interest in this case is in furthering a different interpretation of the Act than the one rendered by the Administrative Law Judge, the Benefits Review Board, and the Court of Appeals. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Perini\'s claim ignores the procedural posture in which this case comes before the Court.  That posture makes it unnecessary for us to consider whether the Director, as the agency </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 459 U. S. 303</a></p><p> official "responsible for the administration and enforcement" of the Act, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] has standing as an aggrieved party to seek review of the decision below. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The Director is not alone in arguing that Churchill is covered under the LHWCA.  Churchill, the injured employee, is before the Court as well.  He has filed a brief in support of the Director\'s request for a writ of certiorari, and a brief addressing the merits of his claim, in which he presents the same arguments presented by the Director.  But, for some reason that is not entirely clear, Churchill has not elected to seek review as a petitioner, and by virtue of the Rules of this Court, he is considered a party </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 459 U. S. 304</a></p><p> respondent. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  It is in this procedural context that Perini\'s challenge to Art. III standing must be considered.  Perini concedes that the Director was a proper party respondent before the Court of Appeals in this litigation. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  As party respondent below, the Director is entitled under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(1) to petition for a writ of certiorari.  Although the Director has statutory authority to seek review in this Court, he <em>may</em> not have Art. III standing to argue the merits of Churchill\'s claim, because the Director\'s presence does not guarantee the existence of a justiciable controversy with respect to the merits of Churchill\'s coverage under the LHWCA.  However, the Director\'s petition makes Churchill an automatic respondent under our Rule 19.6, and, in that capacity, Churchill "may seek reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals on any ground urged in that court."  <em>O\'Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/773/case.html">447 U. S. 773</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/773/case.html#783">447 U. S. 783</a></span>-784, n. 14 (1980).  The Director\'s petition, filed under 28 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 459 U. S. 305</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(1), brings Churchill before this Court, and there is no doubt that Churchill, as the injured employee, has a sufficient interest in this question to give him standing to urge our consideration of the merits of the Second Circuit decision.</p>\n<p>The constitutional dimension of standing theory requires, at the very least, that there be an "actual injury redressable by the court."  <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html">426 U. S. 26</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html#39">426 U. S. 39</a></span> (1976).  This requirement is meant</p>\n<p>"to assure that the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action,"</p>\n<p>as well as to assure "an actual factual setting in which the litigant asserts a claim of injury in fact."  <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. American United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html">454 U. S. 464</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/case.html#472">454 U. S. 472</a></span> (1982).  The presence of Churchill as a party respondent arguing for his coverage under the Act assures that an admittedly justiciable controversy is now before the Court.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The question of Churchill\'s coverage is an issue of statutory construction and legislative intent.  For reasons that we explain below, there is no doubt that Churchill, as a marine construction worker injured upon actual navigable waters in the course of his employment upon those waters, would have been covered by the LHWCA before Congress amended it in 1972.  In deciding whether Congress intended to restrict the scope of coverage by adding the 2(3) status requirement, we must consider the scope of coverage under the pre-1972 Act and our cases construing the relevant portions of that Act.  We must then focus on the legislative history and purposes of the 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA to determine their effect on preexisting coverage. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 459 U. S. 306</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Beginning with our decision in <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/244/205/case.html">244 U. S. 205</a></span> (1917), we held that there were certain circumstances in which States could not, consistently with Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution, provide compensation to injured maritime workers. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  If the employment of an injured worker was determined to have no "direct relation" to navigation or commerce, and "the application of local law [would not] materially affect" the uniformity of maritime law, then the employment would be characterized as "maritime but local," and the State could provide a compensation remedy.  <em>Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/469/case.html">257 U. S. 469</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/469/case.html#477">257 U. S. 477</a></span> (1922).  <em>See also Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/233/case.html">257 U. S. 233</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/233/case.html#242">257 U. S. 242</a></span> (1921).  If the employment could not be characterized as "maritime but local," then the injured employee would be left without a compensation remedy.</p>\n<p>After several unsuccessful attempts to permit state compensation remedies to apply to injured maritime workers whose employment was not local, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] Congress passed the LHWCA in 1927, 44 Stat. (part 2) 1424.  Under the original statutory scheme, a worker had to satisfy five primary conditions in order to be covered under the Act.  First, the worker had to satisfy the "negative" definition of "employee" contained in \xc2\xa7 2(3) of the 1927 Act in that he could not be a "master or member of a crew of any vessel, nor any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net."  <em>Id.</em> at 1425. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Second, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 459 U. S. 307</a></p><p> worker had to suffer an "injury" defined by \xc2\xa7 2(2) as "accidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Third, the worker had to be employed by a statutory "employer," defined by \xc2\xa7 2(4) as</p>\n<p>"an employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment, in whole or in part, upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock)."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Fourth, the worker had to meet a "situs" requirement contained in \xc2\xa7 3(a) of the Act that limited coverage to workers whose "disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock)."  <em>Id.</em> at 1426.  Fifth, \xc2\xa7 3(a) precluded federal compensation unless "recovery for the disability or death through workmen\'s compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Federal compensation under the LHWCA did not initially extend to all maritime employees injured on the navigable waters in the course of their employment.  As mentioned, \xc2\xa7 3(a) of the 1927 Act permitted federal compensation only if compensation "may not validly be provided by State law."  <em>Ibid.</em>  This language was interpreted to exclude from LHWCA coverage those employees whose employment was "maritime but local."  <em>See, e.g., Crowell v. Benson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html">285 U. S. 22</a></span> (1932).  Application of the "maritime but local" doctrine required case-by-case determinations, and a worker was often required to make a perilous jurisdictional "guess" as to which of two mutually exclusive compensation schemes was applicable to cover his injury.  Employers faced uncertainty as to whether their contributions to a state insurance fund would be sufficient to protect them from liability.</p>\n<p>In <em>Davis v. Department of Labor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/249/case.html">317 U. S. 249</a></span> (1942), this Court recognized that, despite its many cases involving the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 459 U.

In <em>Parker,</em> the injured worker, hired as a janitor, was drowned while riding in one of his employer\'s motorboats keeping lookout for hidden objects under the water.  When the employee\'s beneficiary sought LHWCA compensation, the employer argued that the employment was "<em>so local in character\'" that the State could validly have provided a remedy, and the \xc2\xa7 3(a) language ("if recovery . . . may not validly be provided by State law") precluded federal relief.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/314/244/case.html#246">314 U.

Indeed, the consistent interpretation given to the LHWCA before 1972 by the Director, the Deputy Commissioners, the courts, and the commentators was that (except for those workers specifically excepted in the statute), <em>any</em> worker injured upon navigable waters in the course of employment was "covered . . . without any inquiry into what he was doing (or supposed to be doing) at the time of his injury."

The purposes of the 1972 Amendments were to raise the amount of compensation available under the LHWCA, to extend coverage of the Act to include certain contiguous land areas, to eliminate the longshoremen\'s strict liability seaworthiness remedy against shipowners, to eliminate shipowner\'s claims for indemnification from stevedores, and to promulgate certain administrative reforms.  <em>See</em> S.Rep.

In expanding the covered situs in \xc2\xa7 3(a), Congress also removed the requirement, present in \xc2\xa7 3(a) of the 1927 Act, that federal compensation would be available only if recovery "may not validly be provided by State law."  The definition of "injury" remained the same, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] and the definition of "employer" was changed to reflect the new definition of "employee" in \xc2\xa7 2(3).

Perini\'s theory, adopted by the court below, is that all coverage under the amended LHWCA requires employment having a "significant relationship to navigation or to commerce on navigable waters." [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Perini argues further that Churchill cannot meet the status test because he was injured while working on the construction of a foundation for a sewage treatment plant -- an activity not typically associated with navigation or commerce on navigable waters.</p>\n<p>We agree with the Director and Churchill.

Despite the fact that <em>Calbeck</em> extended protection of the LHWCA to all employees injured upon navigable waters in the course of their employment, LHWCA coverage still stopped at the water\'s edge -- a line of demarcation established by <em>Jensen.</em>  In <em>Nacirema Operating Co. v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/212/case.html">396 U.

We recognized that there was much to be said for the uniform treatment of longshoremen irrespective of whether they were performing their duties upon the navigable waters (in which case they would be covered under <em>Calbeck</em>), or whether they were performing those same duties on a pier.  We concluded, however, that, although Congress could exercise its authority to cover land-based maritime activity, "[t]he invitation to move that [<em>Jensen</em>] line landward must be addressed to Congress, not to this Court."  396 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/212/case.html#224">396 U.

The 1972 Amendments were enacted after Committees in both the House and Senate prepared full Reports that summarized the general purposes of the legislation and contained an analysis of the changes proposed for each section.  <em>See</em> S.Rep., <em>supra;</em> H.R.Rep., <em>supra.</em>  These legislative Reports indicate clearly that Congress intended to "<em>extend</em> coverage to protect <em>additional</em> workers."  S.Rep. at 1 (emphasis </p><p><a class="page-number" name="317">Page 459 U. S. 317</a></p><p> added). [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Although the legislative history surrounding the addition of the status requirement is not as clear as that concerning the reasons for the extended situs, it is clear that,</p>\n<p>"with the definition of \'navigable waters\' expanded by the 1972 Amendments to include such a large geographical area, it became necessary to describe affirmatively the class of workers Congress desired to compensate."</p>\n<p><em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/249/case.html#264">432 U.

This necessity gave rise to the status requirement:</p>\n<p>"The Committee does not intend to cover employees who are not engaged in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel, just because they are injured in an area adjoining navigable waters used for such activity."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. at 13; H.R.Rep. at 11.  This comment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 459 U. S. 318</a></p><p> indicates that Congress intended the status requirement to define the scope of the extended landward coverage. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>There is nothing in these comments, or anywhere else in the legislative Reports, to suggest, as Perini claims, that Congress intended the status language to require that an employee injured upon the navigable waters in the course of his employment had to show that his employment possessed a direct (or substantial) relation to navigation or commerce in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="319">Page 459 U. S. 319</a></p><p> order to be covered.  Congress was concerned with injuries on land, and assumed that injuries occurring on the actual navigable waters were covered, and would remain covered. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  In discussing the added status requirement, the Senate Report states explicitly that the "maritime employment" requirement in \xc2\xa7 3(a) was not meant to "exclude other employees traditionally covered."  S.Rep. at 16.  We may presume "that our elected representatives, like other citizens, know the law," <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U. S. 677</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#696">441 U.

Congress removed from \xc2\xa7 3(a) the requirement that, as a prerequisite to federal coverage, there can be no valid recovery under state law. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  As we noted in our discussion in Part </p><p><a class="page-number" name="321">Page 459 U. S. 321</a></p><p> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/297/case.html#306">459 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> the continued use of the "maritime but local" doctrine occurred after passage of the 1927 Act, because the original coverage section contained this requirement that Congress explicitly deleted in 1972.  Surely, if Congress wished to repeal <em>Calbeck</em> and other cases legislatively, it would do so by clear language, and not by removing from the statute the exact phrase that <em>Calbeck</em> found was responsible for continued emphasis on the "maritime but local" doctrine. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>Congressional intent to adhere to <em>Calbeck</em> is also indicated by the fact that the legislative Reports clearly identified those decisions that Congress wished to overrule by the 1972 Amendments.  As mentioned above, the 1972 Amendments had other purposes apart from an expansion of coverage to shoreside areas.  Two other purposes involved the elimination of a strict liability unseaworthiness remedy against a vessel owner afforded to longshoremen by <em>Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/85/case.html">328 U. S. 85</a></span> (1946), and an indemnity claim against the stevedore by the vessel owner afforded by <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/124/case.html">Ryan</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="322">Page 459 U. S. 322</a></p><p> <em>Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S.S. Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/124/case.html">350 U. S. 124</a></span> (1956).  The legislative Reports explicitly identified these decisions as intended to be overruled legislatively by the 1972 Amendments.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. at 8-12; H.R.Rep. at 4-8.  It is, therefore, highly unlikely that Congress would have intended to return to the "jurisdictional monstrosity" that <em>Calbeck</em> sought to lay to rest without at least some indication of its intent to do so.</p>\n<p>In considering the scope of the status test as applied to land-based employees in <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co.,</em> we rejected the "point of rest" theory proposed by the employer, under which landward coverage under the 1972 Amendments would include only the portion of the unloading process that takes place before longshoremen place the cargo onto the dock.  We reasoned that the "point of rest" concept is</p>\n<p>"[a] theory that nowhere appears in the Act, that was never mentioned by Congress during the legislative process, that does not comport with Congress\' intent, and that restricts the coverage of a remedial Act designed to extend coverage. . . ."</p>\n<p>The absence of the concept, "claimed to be so well known in the industry is both conspicuous and telling."  432 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/249/case.html#278">432 U. S. 278</a></span>-279,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/249/case.html#275">432 U. S. 275</a></span>.  In the same sense, the absence of even the slightest congressional allusion to the "maritime but local" doctrine, a concept that plagued maritime compensation law for over 40 years and that would have the effect of restricting coverage in the face of congressional intent not to "exclude other employees traditionally covered," is equally conspicuous and telling.</p>\n<p>Finally, we note that our conclusion concerning the continued coverage of employees injured on actual navigable waters in the course of their employment is consistent with, and supported by, our recent decision in <em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/715/case.html">447 U. S. 715</a></span> (1980).  In <em>Sun Ship,</em> the issue before the Court was whether extended shoreside coverage under the 1972 Amendments had the effect of displacing concurrent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="323">Page 459 U. S. 323</a></p><p> state remedies for landward injuries.  After a review of the development of the "maritime but local" doctrine, and review of certain portions of the legislative history of the 1972 Amendments, we concluded that those Amendments were not intended to resurrect the dilemma, created by mutually exclusive spheres of jurisdiction, that <em>Calbeck</em> and <em>Davis</em> eliminated.  Our reasoning was based, in part, on the removal by Congress of the language in the 1927 Act that made federal compensation available if recovery could not validly be provided by state law:  "[T]he deletion of that language in 1972 -- if it indicates anything -- may logically only imply acquiescence in Calbec[k]. . . ."  447 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/715/case.html#721">447 U. S. 721</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>Sun Ship</em> held that, with respect to land-based injuries, "the . . . extension of federal jurisdiction supplements, rather than supplants, state compensation law."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/715/case.html#720">447 U. S. 720</a></span>.  If we were to hold that the addition of the status requirement was meant to exclude from coverage some employees injured on the actual navigable waters in the course of their employment, a most peculiar result would follow.  Concurrent jurisdiction will exist with respect to the class of employees to whom Congress extended protection in 1972, while employees "traditionally covered" before 1972 would be faced with a hazardous pre-<em>Davis</em> choice of two exclusive jurisdictions from which to seek compensation.  Such an anomalous result could not have been intended by Congress.  We also note that a return to exclusive spheres of jurisdiction for workers injured upon the actual navigable waters would be inconsistent with express congressional desire to extend LHWCA jurisdiction landward in light of the inadequacy of most state compensation systems.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. at 12; H.R.Rep. at 10.</p>\n<p>In holding that we can find no congressional intent to affect adversely the pre-1972 coverage afforded to workers injured upon the actual navigable waters in the course of their employment, we emphasize that we in no way hold that Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="324">Page 459 U. S. 324</a></p><p> meant for such employees to receive LHWCA coverage merely by meeting the situs test, and without any regard to the "maritime employment" language. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  We hold only that, when a worker is injured on the actual navigable waters in the course of his employment on those waters, he satisfies the status requirement in \xc2\xa7 2(3), and is covered under the LHWCA, providing, of course, that he is the employee of a statutory "employer," and is not excluded by any other provision of the Act. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  We consider these employees to be "engaged in maritime employment" not simply because they are injured in a historically maritime locale, but because they are required to perform their employment duties upon navigable waters. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="325">Page 459 U. S. 325</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>In conclusion, we are unable to find anything in the legislative history or in the 1972 Amendments themselves that indicate that Congress intended to withdraw coverage from employees injured on the navigable waters in the course of their employment as that coverage existed before the 1972 Amendments.  On the contrary, the legislative history indicates that Congress did not intend to "exclude other employees traditionally covered."  Moreover, Congress explicitly deleted the language from \xc2\xa7 3(a) that we found in <em>Calbeck</em> to be responsible for the "jurisdictional dilemma" caused by two mutually exclusive spheres of jurisdiction over maritime injuries.  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby reversed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 2(3) of the Act, 86 Stat. 1251, 33 U.S.C.  902(3), provides:</p>\n<p>"The term \'employee\' means any person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harborworker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker, but such term does not include a master or member of a crew of any vessel, or any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>We use the expression "actual navigable waters" to describe the covered situs as it existed in the 1927 LHWCA, 44 Stat.

S. 114</a></span> (1962), by making it clear to employers that, if they required their employees to work upon actual navigable waters, those employees would be covered by the LHWCA.  The dissent takes this certainty in favor of LHWCA coverage to mean that, in 1972, Congress wanted to ensure that employers like Perini would have only to pay for <em>state</em> compensation benefits, and would not have to obtain more costly LHWCA protection.</p>\n<p>The dissent\'s concern about duplicative insurance seems exaggerated for two reasons.  First, even under the dissent\'s view of coverage, both state and federal remedies are available to injured workers, and employers with employees working on the shore would have to contribute to state compensation funds in the event that an employee covered by the LHWCA\'s shoreside extension sought state compensation, or an employee was deemed for whatever reason not to be eligible for LHWCA relief.  "[T]he 1972 extension of federal jurisdiction supplements, rather than supplants, state compensation law."  <em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania,</em> 447 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/715/case.html#720">447 U. S. 720</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We also note that the dissent argues that, before 1972, the financial burden of duplicative coverage was not heavy, because LHWCA benefits were lower than they now are, and insurance carriers would cover LHWCA operations for a nominal addition to state compensation program premiums.  There is nothing in the record in this case, in the legislative history, or, for that matter, in the dissent, concerning whether the relative spread between state and federal insurance premiums is higher now than before 1972.</p>\n<p>Second, the dissent\'s view clearly does not result in any certainty whatsoever for employers like Perini with respect to whether those employers have to pay for LHWCA coverage.  If any Perini employee (including Churchill) were to engage in loading, unloading, or repairing of the barge on which Churchill was working, the employee would be covered.  Indeed, if Churchill himself had to make some minor mechanical adjustment on the barge and was injured while doing so, he would be covered, under the dissent\'s view.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>We noted in <em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, supra,</em> that, in extending LHWCA coverage into the "maritime but local" zone, <em>Calbeck</em> did not overturn <em>Davis</em> "by treating the federal statute as exclusive."  447 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/715/case.html#718">447 U.

Rather, <em>Calbeck</em> eliminated the "jurisdictional dilemma" that resulted from the existence of two spheres of exclusive jurisdiction, by making injuries within the "maritime but local" sphere compensable under either state or federal law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority opinion in <em>Davis</em> assumed that, if the claimant in that case sought federal relief, and such relief was awarded at the administrative stage of the proceedings, the Court would have sustained the award under <em>Parker.</em>  In his dissent in <em>Davis,</em> Chief Justice Stone argued that the federal Act applied to give exclusive relief in that case:</p>\n<p>"after our decision in <em>Parker v.

D. Robertson, Admiralty and Federalism 210 (1970).  Professor Robertson also states that, if the claimant in <em>Davis</em> had sought federal, rather than state, compensation, "the <em>Parker</em> case would certainly have said that [the claimant] could get it."  <em>Id.</em> at 211.\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent attempts to carve a new "maritime but local" area in which the exclusive remedy is state compensation.  The dissent argues that Congress meant to exclude from LHWCA coverage all employees who are not longshoremen or harbor workers, and that only longshoremen and harbor workers possess the "direct link to maritime commerce" necessary for LHWCA coverage.  According to the dissent, the pre-1972 case law, with the exception of <em>Parker,</em> supports its position.  The dissent\'s view rests on a misreading of our decisions in <em>Davis</em> and <em>Calbeck,</em> and a failure to consider the impact of <em>Parker, Davis,</em> and <em>Calbeck</em> on the scope of pre-1972 coverage.</p>\n<p>The dissent points out that <em>Davis</em> involved an employee who sought state compensation, and it concludes that <em>Davis</em> says nothing about LHWCA coverage.  The employee in <em>Davis</em> was standing on a barge and assisting in the dismantling of a bridge, an activity that would clearly not have the "direct link to maritime commerce" that the dissent suggests is required.  Although the <em>Davis</em> employee sought state compensation, both the <em>Davis</em> majority and the <em>Davis</em> dissent assumed that, <em>if</em> the <em>Davis</em> employee sought LHWCA coverage, <em>Parker</em> would require that he get it.  In <em>Calbeck,</em> the claimants were welders performing work on vessels, but our holding in <em>Calbeck</em> was clearly predicated on <em>Parker</em> and <em>Davis,</em> and cannot properly be characterized as a case where LHWCA coverage was predicated on the existence of some "direct link to maritime commerce" or "traditional" LHWCA employment.  The dissent claims that, since Churchill could be covered by a state compensation remedy, it is consistent with <em>Calbeck</em> to deny LHWCA coverage.  This, of course, neglects the fact that <em>Calbeck</em> made clear that</p>\n<p>"Congress brought under the coverage of the Act all such injuries [suffered by employees working on the navigable waters] whether or not a particular one was also within the constitutional reach of a state workmen\'s compensation law."</p>\n<p>370 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/114/case.html#126">370 U. S. 126</a></span>-127.</p>\n<p><em>Parker, Davis,</em> and <em>Calbeck</em> were read by the lower federal and state courts not to limit LHWCA coverage only to "traditional" maritime activities, but to cover injuries that occurred on the navigable waters in the course of employment.  <em>See, e.g., Nalco Chemical Corp. v. Shea,</em> 419 F.2d 572 (CA5 1969) (a pilot salesman traveling to offshore platform); <em>Interlake S.S. Co. v.

This list is by no means exhaustive, and does not include various administrative decisions.</p>\n<p>In another case, <em>Pennsylvania R. Co. v. O\'Rourke,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/334/case.html">344 U. S. 334</a></span> (1953), we held that a statutory "employer" existed as long as the employer had <em>any</em> employee engaged in "maritime employment," and that it was not necessary that the injured employee be the <em>one</em> employee that made his employer a statutory "employer."  However, we also held in that case that the injured employee was, in fact, engaged in maritime employment when he was working as a railway brakeman, removing railroad cars from a car float by the use of an ordinary switch engine.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/334/case.html#340">344 U.

Section 2(4) defines an "employer" to be the employer of any employee engaged in maritime employment on the "navigable waters" as defined by the 1972 Amendments to include the expanded landward situs.

The result is a disparity in benefits payable for death or disability for the same type of injury depending on which side of the water\'s edge and in which State the accident occurs."</p>\n<p>"To make matters worse, most State Workmen\'s Compensation laws provide benefits which are inadequate. . . . "</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>"The Committee believes that the compensation payable to a longshoreman or a ship repairman or builder should not depend on the fortuitous circumstance of whether the injury occurred on land or over water.  Accordingly, the bill would amend the Act to provide coverage of longshoremen, harbor workers, ship repairmen, ship builders, shipbreakers, and other employees engaged in maritime employment (excluding masters and members of the crew of a vessel) if the injury occurred either upon the navigable waters of the United States or any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other area adjoining such navigable waters customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel."</p>\n<p>"The intent of the Committee is to permit a uniform compensation system to apply to employees who would otherwise be covered by this Act for part of their activity. . . ."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. at 12-13; H.R.Rep. at 10-11.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T27" name="F27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>Perini argues that Congress\' intent to eliminate the problem associated with movement from covered to noncovered areas will be frustrated by our holding, because some employees may be deemed to satisfy the status test while working upon the navigable waters, but be deemed not to satisfy the status test when performing the same activity on land.</p>\n<p>We have had two opportunities to examine the scope of landward coverage under the 1972 Amendments.  <em>See Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v.

In neither case did we interpret the "maritime employment" status provision to require an examination into whether the employment had a "direct" or "significant relationship to navigation or commerce."  Rather, in both cases, we decided that the employees were covered because they were "engaged in longshoring operations," and thus fit one of the categories explicitly enumerated by Congress as part of "maritime employment."  <em>See</em> 432 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/249/case.html#271">432 U.

Although we do not maintain that landward coverage could never be determined by reference to anything but the explicitly enumerated categories of activities in the \xc2\xa7 2(3) definition of "employee," we note that our cases to date have focused on these explicit categories because the legislative history indicates that Congress intended to extend landward coverage to those specifically included occupations.  <em>See</em> S.

Regardless of the potential difficulties that may arise in the future in applying the status test to land-based injuries, it is clear that, in extending coverage landward, Congress sought to make available LHWCA compensation to those who, before the 1972 Amendments, regularly <em>did</em> move from covered to noncovered areas, but did not intend to withdraw coverage from those employees, traditionally covered by the Act, who were injured in the course of their employment on navigable waters as previously defined.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T28" name="F28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>Ignoring the references in the Committee Reports to the fact that in 1972 Congress merely sought to extend benefits landward, the dissent focuses instead on passages in the legislative history which indicate that Congress wanted to extend benefits to certain employees who regularly <em>did</em> (in Congress\' view) walk in and out of coverage, and who performed the same tasks on land as they performed over the actual navigable waters.  The dissent concludes from this that Congress sought to withdraw coverage from those employees injured over the actual navigable waters in the course of employment who would have been covered before 1972, and who we now hold are "engaged in maritime employment" for purposes of the amended LHWCA.  The fact that Congress desired to extend coverage landward for a certain group of employees does not tend to prove that Congress sought to withdraw coverage from another group of employees who were customarily covered before the 1972 Amendments.  The dissent\'s view would relegate a number of employees to state compensation remedies in the face of express and extensive congressional findings that "most State Workmen\'s Compensation laws provide benefits which are inadequate."  S.Rep. at 12-13; H.R.Rep. at 10.</p>\n<p>The dissent claims that it "cannot find a single word" in the legislative history to support LHWCA coverage of any employee who is not a longshoreman or harbor worker.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/297/case.html#330">459 U. S. 330</a></span>.  The word that the dissent overlooks is "maritime" in \xc2\xa7 2(3) of the Act.  Before 1972, employees such as Churchill were considered to be engaged in "maritime" employment.  In order to withdraw coverage from employees, such as Churchill, who are maritime employees injured in the course of their employment upon the actual navigable waters, Congress would have had to ignore the consistent interpretation given the Act before 1972 by the Director, the Deputy Commissioners, the courts, and the commentators.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F21" name="T21">n</a> 21, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T29" name="F29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>Perini cites our decision in <em>Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v.

Perini\'s reliance on <em>Executive Jet</em> is misplaced.

Rather, our holding is simply a recognition that a worker\'s performance of his duties upon actual navigable waters is necessarily a very important factor in determining whether he is engaged in "maritime employment."</p>\n<p>Contrary to the suggestion by the dissent,<em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/297/case.html#342">459 U.

This work is very much like the work of longshoremen, who typically load and unload vessels.

Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Neither the legislative history nor the judicial history on which the Court relies today justifies a departure from the language of the statute defining the post-1972 coverage of the Longshoremen\'s and Harbor Workers\' Compensation Act (LHWCA).  Indeed, when the issue is viewed in its proper historical perspective, it becomes even more clear that a literal reading of the Act will avoid anomalies that troubled Congress in 1972, as well as unnecessary litigation and duplicate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="326">Page 459 U. S. 326</a></p><p> insurance coverage in the post-1972 period.  I shall first comment on the statutory language, and then discuss its history.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The principal focus of the statute is identified by its title, as well as its text.  It provides workers\' compensation benefits for injuries to longshoremen and harbor workers. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The coverage of the statute is defined by two basic tests -- a <em>situs</em> test, focusing on the place where the injury occurred, and a <em>status</em> test, focusing on the character of the injured employee\'s occupation.  An injured person is entitled to compensation under the Act only if he satisfied both tests at the time of the injury.  The two tests work together to provide comprehensive coverage for a large class of workers who perform hazardous longshore and ship repair work.</p>\n<p>The requisite occupational status is defined in \xc2\xa7 2(3) of the Act. It provides: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="327">Page 459 U. S. 327</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"The term \'employee\' means any person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harborworker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker, but such term does not include a master or member of a crew of any vessel, or any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net."</p>\n<p>33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 902(3).</p>\n<p>The term "maritime employment" expressly includes two important subcategories, both of which are defined with reasonable clarity.  The question of construction that is presented is what, if any, additional categories of employment are included within the term "maritime employment."  There are several independent reasons for not giving the term an expansive, essentially open-ended reading.</p>\n<p>First, one of the oldest and most respected rules of statutory construction teaches us that general terms should be construed in the light of the specific examples that are expressly identified as included therein.  In this statute, the subcategories -- longshoremen and harbor workers -- are both described in detail, and no other subcategory is even mentioned, giving rise to an especially strong inference that Congress intended a snug fit between "maritime employment" and the two subcategories. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>This inference is corroborated by the fact that Congress took the trouble to add language making it clear that the statutory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="328">Page 459 U. S. 328</a></p><p> concept of "maritime employment" was not intended to describe either the master or a member of the crew of any vessel. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  In short, the ordinary meaning of the words "maritime employment" is actually excluded from the description of the occupational categories that Congress intended the LHWCA to cover.</p>\n<p>It is also clear that the definition of "employee" is entirely unaffected by where he may be injured; if a worker is not an "employee" when ashore, he is not an "employee" when afloat.  Therefore, it is critically significant that the definition of where "employees" are covered -- the situs provision -- reveals the same limited concern for the same key occupations as the status provision.  An "employee" is covered only while on navigable waters and on</p>\n<p>"any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area <em>customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel.</em>"</p>\n<p>33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 903(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>If we ignore history and merely concentrate on the text of this statute, the conclusion is inescapable that it merely provides coverage for people who do the work of longshoremen and harbor workers -- amphibious persons who are directly involved in moving freight onto and off ships or in building, repairing, or destroying ships.  A "checker" is such a worker. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  So are "terminal laborers," <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/249/case.html">432 U. S. 249</a></span> (1977), "cotton headers," <em>P.C. Pfeiffer Co. v.

I cannot find a single word [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] in the Committee hearings, the Committee Reports, or the legislative debates that even suggests that any Congressman or Senator believed that the statute provided coverage for anyone other than longshoremen, harbor workers, and persons in the entirely separate categories that had been included by special statutory enactment. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 459 U. S. 331</a></p><p></p>\n<p>At the opening of the House Subcommittee hearings, Congressman Daniels explained his understanding of the existing scope of the LHWCA [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] and the need for amendments:</p>\n<p>"This Act provides workmen\'s compensation protection to longshoremen, ship repairmen, harbor workers at U.S. defense bases outside the United States, and workers employed in private industry in the District of Columbia."</p>\n<p>"Amendments to the Longshoremen\'s and Harbor Workers\' Compensation Act are long overdue.  Benefits under this act have not been increased for 12 years, and the cost to the injured workers of inadequate benefits has become a serious matter."</p>\n<p>"For example, the law now allows a totally disabled worker to receive two-thirds of his average weekly wages at the time of his injury.  However, since 1961, there has been a limitation of $70 per week as the maximum payment for a permanent disability.  This statutory maximum results in a substantially lower payment than two-thirds of the weekly wage for most longshoremen and District of Columbia workers covered by this statute."</p>\n<p>"More than 270,000 longshoremen and ship repairmen are covered by this statute.  In addition, another 300,000 employees of private employers within the District of Columbia are protected by this law, as well as an additional 200,000 workers in defense bases and work on Outer Continental Shelf projects. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 459 U. S. 332</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"Last year, there were more than 109,000 injuries under this statute; 240 of them fatal, 68,000 of them related to longshore work, and another 27,000 involved District of Columbia workers."</p>\n<p>Hearings on H.R. 247 <em>et al.</em> before the Select Subcommittee on Labor of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 46 (1972) (hereinafter House Hearings).  Throughout the hearings, the legislators were told over and over again how important it was to increase the Act\'s benefits for workers in the categories identified by Congressman Daniels. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  It seems plain that these were the categories of employment that were understood by Congress to define the traditional coverage of the Act.</p>\n<p>When the House and Senate Committees reported out their respective bills, they had granted the sought-after increase in benefits.  They had also amended the provisions defining the scope of coverage, including the language of "status" and "situs" discussed in the previous section.  They had done so in response to a problem in the scope of prior coverage.  Before 1972, longshoremen\'s and harbor workers\' federal coverage had stopped at the water\'s edge.  Because their duties regularly took them off the vessel and onto the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="333">Page 459 U. S. 333</a></p><p> pier, they were constantly "walking in and out of coverage."  On the House side, Joseph Leonard, the international safety director of the International Longshoremen\'s Association, spoke about the hardship this system imposed:</p>\n<p>"Federal compensation law stops at the gangplank to the pier.  When you come off of the gangplank, you come under a different law; you come under the State.  Thirty-six States cover these docks, and maybe more now with the inland waterways."</p>\n<p>"The longshoremen are the only workers in the United States who must worry about their injury to determine the compensation. . . .  It is time for a Federal law for compensation for all longshoremen."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 297.  And on the Senate side, the Minority Counsel brought this problem to the Senators\' attention. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 459 U. S. 334</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Committee amendments responded to this problem by defining the protected situs to encompass the entire area in which members of the protected class customarily perform their regular duties.  This definition of situs clearly precludes coverage for a construction worker standing on a sewage treatment plant or a bridge.  Yet if one accepts the view of the claimant in this case, the statute grants him coverage while aboard a floating vessel and therefore expects him to walk in and out of coverage during a typical workday.  Such a view is flatly inconsistent with the explicit intent of Congress to</p>\n<p>"permit a uniform compensation system to apply to employees who would otherwise be covered by this Act for [only] part of their activity."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 92-1441, pp. 10-11 (1972); S.Rep. No. 92-1125, p. 13 (1972). [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Only if </p><p><a class="page-number" name="335">Page 459 U. S. 335</a></p><p> we adhere to the language used by Congress to define the relevant status harmoniously with the relevant situs can the congressional purpose be achieved.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The pre-1972 judicial history of the LHWCA confirms my construction of the 1972 Amendments, and also explains why the work of longshoremen and harbor workers is described as "maritime employment" in the statute.  Only once during the 45-year interval between the enactment of the LHWCA in 1927 and its amendment in 1972, in <em>Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/314/244/case.html">314 U. S. 244</a></span> (1941), did this Court uphold an award of benefits under the LHWCA for a worker who was neither a longshoreman nor a harbor worker. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  That lonely decision rested on a concern that is no longer significant, and surely provides an insufficient predicate for the Court\'s all-inclusive interpretation of "maritime employment."  Before commenting specifically on the <em>Parker</em> case, however, I shall briefly identify the two principal chapters in the pre-1972 history of the LHWCA.</p>\n<p>The first chapter (which covers the period from 1917 to 1927) explains why there was a need for federal legislation to provide compensation for injured longshoremen and harbor workers.  Prior to 1917, it was assumed that these workers were adequately protected by whatever state legislation existed.  In that year, however, this Court held that the national </p><p><a class="page-number" name="336">Page 459 U. S. 336</a></p><p> interest in the uniform regulation of maritime commerce precluded state jurisdiction over injuries occurring on navigable waters.  <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/244/205/case.html">244 U. S. 205</a></span> (1917). [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p>Over the classic dissents of two of our greatest Justices, the Court adhered to that view even though Congress twice attempted to authorize the exercise of state jurisdiction over these "maritime" injuries. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  The so-called "<em>Jensen</em> line" thus developed as a constitutional limit on the exercise of state power over maritime employment.</p>\n<p>The reasoning of the <em>Jensen</em> case originally appeared to foreclose the application of state workmen\'s compensation schemes to any injury occurring on navigable waters.  The Court soon made it clear, however, that there was a somewhat vaguely defined area -- an area that became known as the "maritime but local" area -- in which state jurisdiction survived.  Thus, in 1922, five years before the enactment of the LHWCA, the Court held that a carpenter injured at work aboard an uncompleted ship that had been launched in the Willamette River could recover under the Oregon Workmen\'s Compensation Law.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/469/case.html">Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="337">Page 459 U. S. 337</a></p><p> <em>Rohde,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/469/case.html">257 U. S. 469</a></span> (1922).  The national interest in uniformity that had been considered paramount in <em>Jensen</em> was not thought to be materially prejudiced by Oregon\'s regulation of "certain local matters." [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>Unlike the work of the carpenter in <em>Rohde,</em> the work of the longshoreman was considered by the Court to have a character that required regulation by a uniform federal scheme.  That much was made clear by the Court\'s opinion in <em>Northern Coal and Dock Co. v. Strand,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/278/142/case.html">278 U. S. 142</a></span> (1928), [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>] a case involving a fatal shipboard injury to a longshoreman.</p>\n<p>"The unloading of a ship is not a matter of purely local concern.  It has direct relation to commerce and navigation, and uniform rules in respect thereto are essential.  The fact that Strand worked for the major portion of the time upon land is unimportant.  He was upon the water in pursuit of his maritime duties when the accident occurred."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/278/142/case.html#144">278 U. S. 144</a></span>.  The LHWCA was enacted in 1927 to remedy this inability of the States to provide adequate protection for longshoremen injured on navigable waters.  The fact that these workers had been characterized as "maritime" in the cases that had denied them adequate state protection explains why Congress later used the same term in the LHWCA.</p>\n<p>The second chapter (which covers the period from 1927 to 1972) explains why it was necessary for Congress to limit the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="338">Page 459 U. S. 338</a></p><p> coverage of the LHWCA to a defined category of employees.  As originally enacted in 1927, the LHWCA was merely intended to fill the gap in state coverage that had been created by <em>Jensen</em> and its progeny. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  The provision that defined the scope of coverage, \xc2\xa7 903(a) (which remained unchanged until 1972), purported to exclude federal coverage if recovery may "validly be provided by State law."  At first, the statutory language was taken literally, and state and federal coverage were thought to be purely complementary and mutually exclusive.  <em>See Crowell v. Benson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html">285 U. S. 22</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html#39">285 U. S. 39</a></span>, and n. 3 (1932).  But given the imprecision of the <em>Jensen-Rohde</em> line, that system risked serious unfairness:  if an injured employee asked for state benefits and was seaward of the line, a literalist interpretation of the LHWCA would bar recovery.  An employee close to the line might easily misguess, miss the statute of limitations, and end up with no benefits at all.</p>\n<p>This Court responded to this potential for injustice in two ways.  Notwithstanding the plain language of the statute, which purported to describe mutually exclusive spheres of state and federal jurisdiction, [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] the Court first upheld a state award in a case in which it was assumed that the federal statute would also apply, <em>Davis v. Department of Labor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/249/case.html">317 U. S. 249</a></span> (1942), and then upheld a federal award in a case in which the Court assumed that recovery could "validly be provided </p><p><a class="page-number" name="339">Page 459 U.

[<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  But the Court\'s mechanism for ensuring that no employee would go entirely unprotected created a twilight zone of overlapping jurisdiction in which many employers were required to obtain duplicate insurance coverage. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  Moreover, the practice of defining coverage entirely by reference to the place where an accident occurred gave rise to the anomalous circumstance that longshoremen regularly walked in and out of coverage during the performance of their routine duties.</p>\n<p>Whatever force the <em>Jensen</em> rule may once have had, it is now perfectly clear that a shore-based worker who is normally covered by a state compensation program may still recover state benefits even though he is injured over navigable waters.  Surely no Member of this Court would question the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="340">Page 459 U. S. 340</a></p><p> fact that the construction worker injured in this case could have received a state award even though he was on a barge in the Hudson River when he was injured.  The concern about the inability of the States to protect land-based workers who may temporarily cross the <em>Jensen</em> line is no longer significant -- surely that concern provided no motivation whatsoever for the action Congress took in 1972 when it amended the LHWCA.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the 1972 Congress clearly did have reason to be concerned about the cost of duplicate insurance coverage and the unpredictability of coverage that depends entirely on the happenstance of where an accident occurs.  As I have mentioned above, [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>] the unpredictability of coverage was mentioned explicitly in the legislative history.  And the burdens of duplicate insurance for employees who might occasionally walk into federal coverage became substantially more onerous as a result of the 1972 changes that made federal LHWCA benefits significantly higher than state workers\' compensation benefits. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  Both of these concerns are alleviated by defining the scope of the statutory coverage in terms of the <em>status</em> of the covered employee.  And both of these concerns can only be aggravated by indiscriminately </p><p><a class="page-number" name="341">Page 459 U. S. 341</a></p><p> extending coverage to an undefined group of workers who plainly do not "load, unload, build, or repair ships."</p>\n<p>All that remains to support the Court\'s rewriting of the statute is the absence of an expressed intent to withdraw pre-1972 coverage.  As I have already noted, that intent is adequately demonstrated by the changes in the text of the statute itself. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  Even if that were not sufficient, however, the Court is really objecting to nothing more than a failure to mention a single case decided in 1942 -- <em>Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, Inc.</em> -- during the hearings or the debates.  But when one considers the highly unusual facts of that case, it is unlikely that any Member of Congress had it in mind, and virtually inconceivable that Congress would have wanted to provide federal coverage for similar future cases.  The employee in the <em>Parker</em> case -- a janitor for a small boat concern located on the James River -- was not protected by a state workmen\'s compensation program for a reason that had nothing to do with the character of his employment or the place of his injury.  The employer did not have the minimum number of employees to bring it under the Virginia statute.  <em>See Motor Boat Sales, Inc. v. Parker,</em> 116 F.2d 789, 793 (CA4 1941).  The happenstance that the janitor was riding in a motorboat at the time of his injury enabled the Court to find a basis for sustaining an award under the LHWCA as it was then written. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]  Even if the presumption that Congress understands the legal context in which it legislates justifies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="342">Page 459 U. S. 342</a></p><p> the inference that it remembered this isolated case decided three decades earlier, it by no means follows that Congress had a duty to disavow the case explicitly in order to give effect to its otherwise plainly expressed purpose. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p>This case presents us with a straightforward problem of statutory construction.  The Court should begin its analysis with the language of the statute itself.  "Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive."  <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/102/case.html">447 U.

In this case, the statutory language plainly encompasses longshoremen and harbor workers; there is no affirmative evidence of a legislative intent to provide coverage for any other type of occupation.  Surely there is no evidence of an intent to classify the work of a janitor or a builder of sewage treatment plants as "maritime employment."

Before the Amendments, it read:</p>\n<p>"Compensation shall be payable under this Act in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) and if recovery for the disability or death through workmen\'s compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.

LHWCA benefits were low, and insurance carriers offered to cover operations subject to the LHWCA for only a nominal addition to the state workers\' compensation premiums.  <em>See</em> Note, 50 Calif.L.Rev. 342, 347 (1962); Comment, 30 NACCA L.J. 200, 203, 206 (1964); Gardner, Remedies for Personal Injuries to Seamen, Railroadmen, and Longshoremen, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 438, 449-450, and n. 34 (1958).</p>\n<p>Today, of course, things are quite different.  In 1981, LHWCA premiums averaged 252 percent higher than California construction worker premiums, and 160 percent higher than Florida premiums.  <em>See</em> Testimony of the Associated General Contractors of America, Hearings on S. 1182 before the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resource, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., 924-936 (1981).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/23" name="F2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]</p>\n<p>The "status" provision replaced the "unless recovery may validly be provided by state law" language that was being construed in <em>Parker</em> and <em>Calbeck.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/24" name="F2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1942, as it does today, the LHWCA expressly excluded coverage of injuries to members of the crew of any vessel and to persons who load or unload small boats.  <em>See</em> <l=|459 297fn2="" 5|="" u.s.="">n. 5, <em>supra.</em>  Thus, a janitor could not recover on the theory that he was a member of the crew of the motorboat, or that he helped to load or unload the motorboat.

It uses these cases to support its argument that it would have been a radical and unsettling change for the 1972 Congress to limit post-1972 coverage to people who perform the work of longshoremen and harbor workers.  I would draw a somewhat different inference.  It is hard to believe that Congress had in mind such a light sprinkling of cases during the 45-year interval between 1927 and 1972 when it spoke of the traditional coverage of the Act, especially given Congressman Daniels\' reminder that, in 1970, there were 68,000 injuries to longshoremen.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/297/case.html#332">459 U.

On the one hand, the Court states:</p>\n<p>"Before 1972 . . . <em>any</em> worker injured upon navigable waters in the course of employment was \'covered . . . without any inquiry into what he was doing (or supposed to be doing) at the time of his injury. . . .\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/297/case.html#311">459 U.

"Congress . . . assumed that injuries occurring on the actual navigable waters were covered, and would remain covered."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/297/case.html#319">459 U. S. 319</a></span>.  On the other hand, it concludes:</p>\n<p>"Our holding, of course, extends only to those persons \'traditionally covered\' before the 1972 Amendments.  We express no opinion whether such coverage extends to a worker injured while transiently or fortuitously upon actual navigable waters. . . .  Our decision today should not be read as exempting water-based workers from the new status test.  Rather, our holding is simply a recognition that a worker\'s performance of his duties upon actual navigable waters is necessarily a very important factor. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/297/case.html#324">459 U.

S. 312</a></span>, n. 21.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the post-1972 Act provides coverage for "traditional" maritime activities.
