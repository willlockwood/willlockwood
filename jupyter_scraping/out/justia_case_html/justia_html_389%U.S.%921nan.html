[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="923">Page 389 U.S. 921 , 923</a></p><p> There is another important issue here. Although the prosecutor used the offer to plead guilty as he would have used a confession, there was no separate hearing on the question of voluntariness. Nor did the trial judge make a specific finding that the statement was voluntary. I think we should consider whether the proceeding outlined in Jackson v. Denno, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/368/case.html">378 U.S. 368</a> (1964), and Sims v. State of Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/538/case.html">385 U.S. 538</a> (1967), were required in this case. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Petitioner was charged with two counts of murder. At his first trial he was sentenced to death on both counts. The California Supreme Court reversed the conviction. People v. Hamilton, 55 Cal.2d 881, 13 Cal. Rptr. 649, 362 P.2d 473 (1961). At his second trial he was found guilty on both counts again and sentenced to death on one and life imprisonment on the other. The California Supreme Court upheld the convictions and the life sentence but reversed the death penalty. People v. Hamilton, 60 Cal. 2d 105, 32 Cal.Rptr. 4, 383 P.2d 412 (1963). Subsequently, petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment on both counts. He filed two petitions for habeas corpus in the California Supreme Court. Both were denied without opinion. This petition for certiorari seeks review of the second denial. </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> At a subsequent point in the trial, petitioner\'s counsel read to the jury a transcript of an interrogation of defendant by the police, conducted on the night he was apprehended. In his statement petitioner said he was going to \'plead guilt\' but that he \'never intended to kill neither one of them.\' The California Supreme Court did not refer to this statement or rely upon it in determining that the admission of petitioner\'s offer to plead guilty made to the inspector almost three months later was harmless error. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a> 4 Wigmore, Evidence 1061-1062 (3d ed. 1940). See also Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 68 and 7 Moore, Federal Practice 68.01-68.06 (1966). </p><p><a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a> The California Supreme Court agreed that petitioner\'s offer to plead guilty was inadmissible by analogy with a provision of the California Code making inadmissible evidence of guilty pleas which were withdrawn. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court held that this was \'harmless error\' because it thought a different result would not have been \'reasonably probable\' without the error. Therefore the conviction was not reversed. People v. Hamilton, 60 Cal.2d at 112-114, 119-121, 32 Cal.Rptr., at 7-8, 12-13, 383 P.2d, at 415-416, 420-421. The admission of the evidence here in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment would be critically important to the trial, and the error could not be considered harmless under the standards announced by the Court in Chapman v. State of California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/case.html">386 U.S. 18</a> (1967). </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
