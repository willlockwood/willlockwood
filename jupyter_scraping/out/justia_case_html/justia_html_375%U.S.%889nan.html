Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purpose. Therefore, a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true of constitutions. They are not ephemeral enactments, designed to meeting passing occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall, \'designed to approach immortailty as nearly as human institutions can approach it.\' The future is their care and provision for events of good and bad tendencies of which no prophecy can be made. In the application of a constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been but of what may be. Under any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and power. Its gene al principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas. Rights declared in words might be lost in reality.\' Also see Ex parte Wilson, <a href="/cases/federal/us/114/417/case.html#427">114 U.S. 417, 427</a>-428:</ul><ul>\'What punishments may be considered as infamous may be affected by the changes of opinion from one age to another. In former times, being put in the stocks was not considered as necessarily infamous .... But at the present day [it] might be thought an infamous punishment.\' </ul> <p> </p><p><a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a> Weems v.
