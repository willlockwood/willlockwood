This Court has held that Congress generally does not violate Article III when it strips federal jurisdiction over a class of cases, see <i>Ex parte McCardle</i>, 7 Wall. 506, 514, and has reaffirmed these principles on many occasions, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n\xe2\x80\x9395.

With <i>Patchak I</i> in mind, Congress acted effectively to displace the Administrative Procedure Act\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of immunity for suits against the United States\xe2\x80\x94which enabled Patchak to launch this litigation\xe2\x80\x94with a contrary command applicable to the Bradley Property.

While his suit was pending in the District Court, Congress enacted the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act (Gun Lake Act or Act), Pub. L. 113\xe2\x80\x93179,\n\n128Stat.\n1913, which provides that suits relating to the land \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be filed or maintained in a Federal court and shall be promptly dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Patchak contends that, in enacting this statute, Congress impermissibly infringed the judicial power that Article III of the Constitution vests exclusively in the Judicial Branch.  Because we disagree, we affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians (Band) resides in southwestern Michigan, near the township of Wayland.  The Band traces its relationship with the United States back hundreds of years, pointing to treaties it negotiated with the Federal Government as early as 1795.  But the Secretary of the Interior did not formally recognize the Band until 1999.  See 63 Fed. Reg. 56936 (1998); 65 Fed. Reg. 13298 (2000).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After obtaining formal recognition, the Band identified a 147-acre parcel of land in Wayland, known as the Bradley Property, where it wanted to build a casino.  The Band asked the Secretary to invoke the Indian Reorganization Act, \xc2\xa75,\n\n48Stat.\n985,\n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75108, and take the Bradley Property into trust.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  In 2005, the Secretary agreed and posted a notice informing the public that the Bradley Property would be taken into trust for the Band.  See 70 Fed. Reg. 25596 (2005).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Michigan Gambling Opposition (MichGO) sued, alleging that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision violated federal environmental and gaming laws.  After several years of litigation, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal of MichGo\xe2\x80\x99s claims, and this Court denied certiorari.  <i>Michigan Gambling Opposition</i> v. <i>Kempthorne</i>, 525 F.\xc2\xa03d 23 (2008), cert. denied,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1137 (2009)\n.  In January 2009, the Secretary formally took the Bradley Property into trust.  And in February 2011, the Band opened its casino.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before the Secretary formally took the land into trust, a nearby landowner, David Patchak, filed another lawsuit challenging the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Invoking the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7702, 706(2), Patchak alleged that the Secretary lacked statutory authority to take the Bradley Property into trust for the Band.  The Indian Reorganization Act does not allow the Secretary to take land into trust for tribes that were not under federal jurisdiction when the statute was enacted in 1934.  See <i>Carcieri</i> v. <i>Salazar</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 379\n\xe2\x80\x93383 (2009).  The Band was not federally recognized until 1999, which Patchak argued was more than 65 years too late.  Based on this alleged statutory violation, Patchak sought to reverse the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take the Bradley Property into trust.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Secretary raised preliminary objections to Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit, contending that it was barred by sovereign immunity and that Patchak lacked prudential standing to bring it.  The District Court granted the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, but the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit reversed.  <i>Patchak </i>v. <i>Salazar</i>, 646 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 72 (DC 2009), rev\xe2\x80\x99d, 632 F.\xc2\xa03d 702 (2011).  This Court granted certiorari and affirmed the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit.  <i>Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians</i> v. <i>Patchak</i>,\n\n567 U.\xc2\xa0S. 209 (2012)\n (<i>Patchak I\xc2\xa0</i>).  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Patchak\xc2\xa0I</i> held that Congress had waived the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity from suits like Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s.  <i>Id.,</i> at 215\xe2\x80\x93224.  It also held that Patchak had prudential standing because his suit arguably fell within the \xe2\x80\x9czone of interests\xe2\x80\x9d protected by the Indian Reorganization Act.  <i>Id.,</i> at 224\xe2\x80\x93228.  Because Patchak had standing and the Secretary lacked immunity, this Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cPatchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit may proceed,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 212, and remanded for further proceedings, <i>id.,</i> at 228.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In September 2014, while Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit was back in the District Court, Congress enacted the Gun Lake Act,\n\n128Stat.\n1913.  Section 2(a) of the Act states that the Bradley Property \xe2\x80\x9cis reaffirmed as trust land, and the actions of the Secretary of the Interior in taking that land into trust are ratified and confirmed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 2(b) then provides the following:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cNo Claims.\xe2\x80\x94Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an action (including an action pending in a Federal court as of the date of enactment of this Act) relating to the land described in subsection (a) shall not be filed or maintained in a Federal court and shall be promptly dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Based on \xc2\xa72(b), the District Court entered summary judgment against Patchak and dismissed his suit for lack of jurisdiction.  109 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d 152 (DC 2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit affirmed.  <i>Patchak </i>v. <i>Jewell</i>, 828 F.\xc2\xa03d 995 (2016).  It held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he language of the Gun Lake Act makes plain that Congress has stripped federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over suits, like Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s, that relate to the Bradley Property.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1001.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit rejected Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa72(b) violates Article III of the Constitution.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1001\xe2\x80\x931003.  Article III prohibits Congress from \xe2\x80\x9cdirect[ing] the result of pending litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit reasoned, but it does not prohibit Congress from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98supply[ing] new law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1002 (quoting <i>Robertson</i> v. <i>Seattle Audubon Soc.</i>,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 429,\n439 (1992)\n).  Section 2(b) supplies new law: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f an action relates to the Bradley Property, it must promptly be dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d  828 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1003.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari to review whether \xc2\xa72(b) violates Article III of the Constitution.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  See 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).  Because it does not, we now affirm.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Constitution creates three branches of Government and vests each branch with a different type of power.  See Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa71; Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa71, cl.\xc2\xa01; Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa71.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo the legislative department has been committed the duty of making laws; to the executive the duty of executing them; and to the judiciary the duty of interpreting and applying them in cases properly brought before the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Mellon</i>,\n\n262 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447,\n488 (1923)\n; see also <i>Wayman</i> v. <i>Southard</i>, 10 Wheat. 1, 46 (1825) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he legislature makes, the executive executes, and the judiciary construes the law\xe2\x80\x9d).  By vesting each branch with an exclusive form of power, the Framers kept those powers separate.  See <i>INS</i> v. <i>Chadha</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919,\n946 (1983)\n.  Each branch \xe2\x80\x9cexercise[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the powers appropriate to its own department,\xe2\x80\x9d and no branch can \xe2\x80\x9cencroach upon the powers confided to the others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kilbourn</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>,\n\n103 U.\xc2\xa0S. 168,\n191 (1881)\n.  This system prevents \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands,\xe2\x80\x9d The Federalist No.\xc2\xa047, p.\xc2\xa0301 (C.

See <i>Plaut</i> v. <i>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211,\n218 (1995)\n.  One way that Congress can cross the line from legislative power to judicial power is by \xe2\x80\x9cusurp[ing] a court\xe2\x80\x99s power to interpret and apply the law to the [circumstances] before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bank Markazi</i> v. <i>Peterson</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 12).  The simplest example would be a statute that says, \xe2\x80\x9cIn <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Jones</i>, Smith wins.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___, n.\xc2\xa017 (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, n.\xc2\xa017).  At the same time, the legislative power is the power to make law, and Congress can make laws that apply retroactively to pending lawsuits, even when it effectively ensures that one side wins.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 15\xe2\x80\x9319).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To distinguish between permissible exercises of the legislative power and impermissible infringements of the judicial power, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents establish the following rule: Congress violates Article III when it \xe2\x80\x9ccompel[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. findings or results under old law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Seattle Audubon</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 438.

Specifically, it strips federal courts of jurisdiction over actions \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d the Bradley Property.  Before the Gun Lake Act, federal courts had jurisdiction to hear these actions.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  Now they do not.  This kind of legal change is well within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority and does not violate Article III.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 2(b) strips federal jurisdiction over suits relating to the Bradley Property.  The statute uses jurisdictional language.  It states that an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d relating to the Bradley Property \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be filed or maintained in a Federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  It imposes jurisdictional consequences: Actions relating to the Bradley Property \xe2\x80\x9cshall be promptly dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Ex parte McCardle</i>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen [jurisdiction] ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 2(b) has no exceptions.  Cf. <i>Reed Elsevier, Inc.</i> v. <i>Muchnick</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 154,\n165 (2010)\n.  And it applies \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d including the general grant of federal-question jurisdiction,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  Although \xc2\xa72(b) does not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court does not require jurisdictional statutes to \xe2\x80\x9cincant magic words.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sebelius</i> v. <i>Auburn Regional Medical Center</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 145,\n153 (2013)\n.  Indeed, \xc2\xa72(b) uses language similar to other statutes that this Court has deemed jurisdictional.

Section 2(b) is not one of the nonjurisdictional rules that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have identified as \xe2\x80\x9cimportant and mandatory\xe2\x80\x9d but not governing \xe2\x80\x9ca court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Shinseki</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 428,\n435 (2011)\n.

Article I permits Congress \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa78, and Article III vests the judicial power \xe2\x80\x9cin one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71.  These provisions reflect the so-called Madison- ian Compromise, which resolved the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 disagreement about creating lower federal courts by leaving that decision to Congress.  See <i>Printz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 898,\n907 (1997)\n; 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 125 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 greater power to create lower federal courts includes its lesser power to \xe2\x80\x9climit the jurisdiction of those Courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hudson</i>, 7 Cranch 32, 33 (1812); accord, <i>Lockerty</i> v. <i>Phillips</i>,\n\n319 U.\xc2\xa0S. 182,\n187 (1943)\n.  So long as Congress does not violate other constitutional provisions, its \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol over the jurisdiction of the federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cplenary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Trainmen</i> v. <i>Toledo, P. &amp; W.

Thus, when Congress strips federal courts of jurisdic- tion, it exercises a valid legislative power no less than when it lays taxes, coins money, declares war, or invokes any other power that the Constitution grants it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, this Court has held that Congress generally does not violate Article III when it strips federal jurisdiction over a class of cases.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Shortly after the Civil War, for example, Congress repealed this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction over certain habeas corpus cases.  See Act of Mar. 27, 1868, ch.\xc2\xa034, \xc2\xa72,\n\n15Stat.\n44; see also U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa72 (permitting Congress to make \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction).  William McCardle, a military prisoner whose appeal was pending at the time, argued that the repealing statute was \xe2\x80\x9can exercise by the Congress of judicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Wall., at 510.  This Court disagreed.  Jurisdiction-stripping statutes, the Court explained, do not involve \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of judicial power\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clegislative interference with courts in the exercising of continuing jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 514.  Because jurisdiction is the \xe2\x80\x9cpower to declare the law\xe2\x80\x9d in the first place, \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial duty is not less fitly performed by declining ungranted jurisdiction than in exercising firmly that which the Constitution and the laws confer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 514\xe2\x80\x93515.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has reaffirmed these principles on many occasions.  Congress generally does not infringe the judicial power when it strips jurisdiction because, with limited exceptions, a congressional grant of jurisdiction is a <i>prerequisite</i> to the exercise of judicial power.  See <i>Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n\xe2\x80\x9395 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter \xe2\x80\x98spring[s] from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Swan</i>,\n\n111 U.\xc2\xa0S. 379,\n382 (1884)\n)); <i>Cary</i> v. <i>Curtis</i>, 3 How. 236, 245 (1845) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he judicial power of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is (except in enumerated instances, applicable exclusively to this court) dependent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. entirely upon the action of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Hudson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 33 (similar).  \xe2\x80\x9cTo deny this position\xe2\x80\x9d would undermine the separation of powers by \xe2\x80\x9celevat[ing] the judicial over the legislative branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cary</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 245.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power over federal jurisdiction is \xe2\x80\x9can essential ingredient of separation and equilibration of powers, restraining the courts from acting at certain times, and even restraining them from acting permanently regarding certain subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Steel Co.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 101.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, \xc2\xa72(b) strips jurisdiction over suits relating to the Bradley Property.  It is a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 legislative power.  And because it changes the law, it  does not infringe the judicial power.  The constitutionality of jurisdiction-stripping statutes like this one is well  established.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Patchak does not dispute Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to withdraw jurisdiction from the federal courts.  He instead raises two arguments why \xc2\xa72(b) violates Article III, even if it strips jurisdiction.  First, relying on <i>United States</i> v. <i>Klein</i>, 13 Wall. 128 (1872), Patchak argues that \xc2\xa72(b) flatly directs federal courts to dismiss lawsuits without allowing them to interpret or apply any new law.  Second, relying on <i>Plaut</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211\n, Patchak argues that \xc2\xa72(b) attempts to interfere with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Patchak I</i>\xe2\x80\x94specifically, its conclusion that his suit \xe2\x80\x9cmay proceed,\xe2\x80\x9d 567 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 212.  We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 2(b) does not flatly direct federal courts to dismiss lawsuits under old law.  It creates new law for suits relating to the Bradley Property, and the District Court interpreted and applied that new law in Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit. Section 2(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d standard effectively guaranteed that Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit would be dismissed.  But \xe2\x80\x9ca statute does not impinge on judicial power when it directs courts to apply a new legal standard to undisputed facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bank Markazi</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is not any the less a case or controversy upon which a court possessing the federal judicial power may rightly give judgment\xe2\x80\x9d when the arguments before the court are \xe2\x80\x9cuncontested or incontestable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pope</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n323 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n11 (1944)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Patchak argues that the last four words of \xc2\xa72(b)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshall be promptly dismissed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94direct courts to reach a particular outcome.  But a statute does not violate Article III merely because it uses mandatory language.  See <i>Seattle Audubon</i>, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 439.  Instead of directing outcomes, the mandatory language in \xc2\xa72(b) \xe2\x80\x9csimply imposes the consequences\xe2\x80\x9d of a court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that it lacks jurisdiction because a suit relates to the Bradley Property.  <i>Miller</i> v. <i>French</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 327,\n349 (2000)\n; see <i>McCardle</i>, 7 Wall., at 514.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Patchak compares \xc2\xa72(b) to the statute this Court held unconstitutional in <i>Klein</i>.  In that case, the administrator of the estate of V.\xc2\xa0F. Wilson, a former Confederate soldier, sued to recover the value of some cotton that the Government had seized during the war.  13 Wall., at 132.  The relevant statute required claimants to prove their loyalty in order to reclaim their property.  Ch. 120, \xc2\xa73,\n\n12Stat.\n820.  Wilson had received a pardon before he died, 13 Wall., at 132, and this Court had held that pardons conclusively prove loyalty under the statute, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Padelford</i>, 9 Wall. 531, 543 (1870).  But after Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s administrator secured a judgment in his favor, 13 Wall., at 132, Congress passed a statute making pardons proof of disloyalty and declaring that, if a claimant had accepted one, \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdiction of the court in the case shall cease, and the court shall forthwith dismiss the suit of such claimant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of July 12, 1870,\n\n16Stat.\n235.  If the court had already entered judgment in favor of a pardoned claimant and the Government had appealed, the statute instructed this Court to dismiss the whole suit for lack of jurisdiction.  See <i>ibid.</i> <i>Klein</i> held that this statute infringed the executive power by attempting to \xe2\x80\x9cchange the effect of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 148.  <i>Klein</i> also held that the statute infringed the judicial power, see <i>id.,</i> at 147, although its reasons for this latter holding were not entirely clear.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has since explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute in <i>Klein</i> infringed the judicial power, not because it left too little for courts to do, but because it attempted to direct the result without altering the legal standards governing the effect of a pardon\xe2\x80\x94standards Congress was powerless to prescribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bank Markazi</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Congress had no authority to declare that pardons are not evidence of loyalty, so it could not achieve the same result by stripping jurisdiction whenever claimants cited pardons as evidence of loyalty.  See <i>Klein</i>, 13 Wall., at 147\xe2\x80\x93148.  Nor could Congress confer jurisdiction to a federal court but then strip jurisdiction from that same court once the court concluded that a pardoned claimant should prevail under the statute.  See <i>id.,</i> at 146\xe2\x80\x93147.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to compare \xc2\xa72(b) to the statute in <i>Klein</i> are unpersuasive.  Section 2(b) does not attempt to exercise a power that the Constitution vests in another branch.  And unlike the selective jurisdiction-stripping statute in <i>Klein</i>, \xc2\xa72(b) strips jurisdiction over every suit relating to the Bradley Property.  Indeed, <i>Klein</i> itself explained that statutes that do \xe2\x80\x9cnothing more\xe2\x80\x9d than strip jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9ca particular class of cases\xe2\x80\x9d are constitutional.  <i>Id</i>., at 145.  That is precisely what \xc2\xa72(b) does.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 2(b) does not unconstitutionally interfere with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Patchak\xc2\xa0I</i>.  Article III, this Court explained in <i>Plaut</i>, prohibits Congress from \xe2\x80\x9cretroactively commanding the federal courts to reopen final judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 219.  But <i>Patchak\xc2\xa0I</i> did not finally conclude Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s case.  See <i>Bradley</i> v. <i>School Bd. of Richmond</i>,\n\n416 U.\xc2\xa0S. 696\n, n.\xc2\xa014 (1974).  When this Court said that his suit \xe2\x80\x9cmay proceed,\xe2\x80\x9d 567 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 212, it meant that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary defenses lacked merit and that Patchak could return to the District Court for further proceedings.  It did not mean that Congress was powerless to change the law that governs his case.  As this Court emphasized in <i>Plaut</i>, Article III does not prohibit Congress from enacting new laws that apply to pending civil cases.  See 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 226\xe2\x80\x93227.  When a new law clearly governs pending cases, Article III does not prevent courts from applying it because \xe2\x80\x9ceach court, at every level, must \xe2\x80\x98decide according to existing laws.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Schooner Peggy</i>, 1 Cranch 103, 109 (1801)).  This principle applies equally to statutes that strip jurisdiction.  See <i>Landgraf</i> v. <i>USI Film Products</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244,\n274 (1994)\n; <i>Kline</i> v. <i>Burke Constr. Co.</i>,\n\n260 U.\xc2\xa0S. 226,\n234 (1922)\n;<i> Hallowell</i> v. <i>Commons</i>,\n\n239 U.\xc2\xa0S. 506,\n509 (1916)\n.  Because \xc2\xa72(b) expressly references \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d cases, it applies to Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  And because Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit is not final, applying \xc2\xa72(b) here does not offend Article III.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, we recognize that the Gun Lake Act was a response to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Patchak\xc2\xa0I</i>.  The text of the Act, after all, cites both the administrative decision and the property at issue in that case.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  And we understand why Patchak would view the Gun Lake Act as unfair.  By all accounts, the Band exercised its political influence to persuade Congress to enact a narrow jurisdiction-stripping provision that effectively ends all lawsuits threatening its casino, including Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the question in this case is \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ot favoritism, nor even corruption, but <i>power</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Plaut</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 228; see also <i>McCardle</i>, 7 Wall., at 514 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature.

For example, this Court has upheld narrow statutes that identified specific cases by caption and docket number in their text.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 19); <i>Seattle Audubon</i>, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 440.  And this Court has approvingly cited a D.\xc2\xa0C.

A statute impermissibly exercises the judicial power, the dissent contends, when it \xe2\x80\x9ctargets\xe2\x80\x9d a particular suit and \xe2\x80\x9cmanipulates\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction to direct the outcome, \xe2\x80\x9cpractical[ly] operat[es]\xe2\x80\x9d to affect only one suit, and announces a legal standard that does not \xe2\x80\x9cimply some measure of generality\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpreserv[e] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an adjudicative role for the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 8, 11.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We doubt that the constitutional line separating the legislative and judicial powers turns on factors such as a court\xe2\x80\x99s doubts about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 unexpressed motives, the number of \xe2\x80\x9ccases [that] were pending when the provision was enacted,\xe2\x80\x9d or the time left on the statute of limitations.  <i>Post</i>, at 8.  But even if it did, we disagree with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of \xc2\xa72(b).  Nothing on the face of \xc2\xa72(b) is limited to Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s case, or even to his challenge under the Indian Reorganization Act.  Instead, the text extends to all suits \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d the Bradley Property.  Thus, \xc2\xa72(b) survives even under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s theory: It \xe2\x80\x9cprospectively govern[s] an open-ended class of disputes,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post,</i> at 6, and its \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d standard \xe2\x80\x9cpreserv[es] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an adjudicative role for the courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post</i>, at 11.

The second part, the jurisdictional part, perhaps gilds the lily, perhaps simplifies judicial decisionmaking (the judge need only determine whether a lawsuit relates to the Bradley Property), but, read in context, it does no more than provide an alternative legal standard for courts to apply that seeks the same real-world result as does the first part: The Bradley Property shall remain in trust.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The petitioner does not argue that Congress acted unconstitutionally by ratifying the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s actions and the land\xe2\x80\x99s trust status, and I am aware of no substantial argument to that effect.

Article III, in other words, sets out not only what the Judiciary can do, but also what Congress cannot.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress violates this arrangement when it arrogates the judicial power to itself and decides a particular case.  We first enforced that rule in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Klein</i>, 13 Wall. 128 (1872), when the Radical Republican Congress passed a law targeting suits by pardoned Confederates.  Although this Court had held that a pardon was proof of loyalty and entitled claimants to damages for property seized by the Union, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Padelford</i>, 9 Wall. 531, 543 (1870), Congress sought to block Confederate supporters from receiving such compensation.  It therefore enacted a statute barring rebels from using a pardon as evidence of loyalty, instead requiring the courts to dismiss for want of jurisdiction any suit based on a pardon.  This Court declared the law unconstitutional.  Congress, in addition to impairing the President\xe2\x80\x99s pardon power, had \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe[d] rules of decision to the Judicial Department .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in cases pending before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Klein</i>, 13 Wall., at 146.

In <i>Pope</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n323 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1944)\n, the Court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cchanging the rules of decision for the determination of a pending case\xe2\x80\x9d would impermissibly interfere with judicial independence, but held that such concerns were absent when Congress consented to a claims settlement pursuant to its broad power \xe2\x80\x9cto provide for the payment of debts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 9; see <i>Chadha</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 966, n.\xc2\xa09 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Congress grants particular individuals relief or benefits under its spending power, the danger of oppressive action that the separation of powers was designed to avoid is not implicated.\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we also explained in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sioux Nation</i>,\n\n448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371,\n398 (1980)\n, because Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cno judicial powers\xe2\x80\x9d to render judgment \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly,\xe2\x80\x9d it likewise cannot do so indirectly, by \xe2\x80\x9cdirect[ing] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a court to find a judgment in a certain way.\xe2\x80\x9d  That sort of legislative intervention constitutes an exercise of the judicial power, leaving \xe2\x80\x9cthe court no adjudicatory function to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 392.

Yet none is as brazen as \xc2\xa72(b), either in terms of dictating a particular outcome or in singling out a particular party.  Indeed, the bulk of those cases involved statutes that prospectively governed an open-ended class of disputes and left the courts to apply any new legal standard in the first instance.  In <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co.</i>, 18 How. 421 (1856), for example, we addressed an enactment that permanently altered the legal status of a public bridge going forward by reclassifying it as a postal road.  That provision, we later said, did not prescribe an \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary rule of decision\xe2\x80\x9d but instead \xe2\x80\x9cleft [the court] to apply its ordinary rules\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether the redesignation of the structure meant that it was an obstruction of interstate commerce.  <i>Klein</i>, 13 Wall., at 146\xe2\x80\x93147.

There, Congress inserted itself into a long-running dispute over whether terrorist victims could satisfy their judgments against Iran\xe2\x80\x99s central bank, enacting a statute that eliminated certain legal impediments to obtaining the bank\xe2\x80\x99s assets.  We upheld the law because it \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ed] new substantive standards\xe2\x80\x9d and entrusted \xe2\x80\x9capplication of those standards\xe2\x80\x9d to the court.  578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the Court in <i>Bank Markazi</i> did not have before it anything like \xc2\xa72(b), which prevents the court from applying any new legal standards and explicitly dictates the dismissal of a pending proceeding.  The Court instead stressed that the judicial findings contemplated by the statute in <i>Bank Markazi </i>left \xe2\x80\x9cplenty\xe2\x80\x9d for the court \xe2\x80\x9cto adjudicate\xe2\x80\x9d before ruling that the bank was liable.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___, n.\xc2\xa020 (slip op., at 17, n.\xc2\xa020).

Nor did it decide whether the assets were owned by the bank.  That issue was also assigned to the court.  And lastly, the statute did not settle whether the assets were held in New York or Luxembourg.  The court had to sort that out too.  See <i>ibid.</i>[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Section 2(b) goes much further than the statute in <i>Bank Markazi </i>by disposing of the case outright, wresting any adjudicative responsibility from the courts.

The law instead governed a category of postjudgment execution claims filed by over a thousand plaintiffs who, in 16 different actions, had obtained judgments against Iran in excess of $1.75 billion\xe2\x80\x94facts suggesting more generality than is true of many Acts of Congress.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By contrast, \xc2\xa72(b) targets a single pending case.

The text and operation of the provision instead make clear that the range of potential applications is a class of one.

It instead focuses on general tenets of jurisdiction stripping.  In its view, \xc2\xa72(b) falls comfortably within Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts, and accordingly does not constitute an exercise of judicial power.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But nothing in \xc2\xa72(b) specifies that the statute is jurisdictional.

That background principle is undoubtedly correct\xe2\x80\x94and undoubtedly irrelevant for the purposes of evaluating \xc2\xa72(b).  For while the greater power to create inferior federal courts generally includes the power to strip those courts of jurisdiction, at a certain point that lesser exercise of authority invades the judicial function.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has the power (within limits) to tell the courts what <i>classes </i>of cases they may decide, but not to prescribe or superintend how they decide those cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arlington</i> v. <i>FCC</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 290,\n297 (2013)\n (majority opinion of Scalia, J.)

In other words, Congress cannot, under the guise of altering federal jurisdiction, dictate the result of a pending proceeding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Klein</i>, after all, drew precisely the same distinction when it considered the provision stripping jurisdiction over any suit based on a pardon.  Chief Justice Chase\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court explained that if the statute had \xe2\x80\x9csimply\xe2\x80\x9d removed jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9ca particular class of cases,\xe2\x80\x9d it would be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9can exercise of the acknowledged power of Congress to make exceptions and prescribe regulations to the appellate power.\xe2\x80\x9d  13 Wall., at 145, 146.  But because the withdrawal of jurisdiction was a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans to an end,\xe2\x80\x9d founded \xe2\x80\x9csolely on the application of a rule of decision,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held that the law violated the separation of powers.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see R.

Because the Legislature has no authority to direct entry of judgment for a party, it cannot achieve the same result by stripping jurisdiction over a particular proceeding.  Does the plurality really believe that there is a material difference between a law stating \xe2\x80\x9cThe court lacks jurisdiction over Jones\xe2\x80\x99s pending suit against Smith\xe2\x80\x9d and one stating \xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Jones</i>, Smith wins\xe2\x80\x9d?  In both instances, Congress has resolved the specific case in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s favor.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Over and over, the plurality intones that \xc2\xa72(b) does not impinge on the judicial power because the provision \xe2\x80\x9cchanges the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, 10\xe2\x80\x9314.  But all that \xc2\xa72(b) does is deprive the court of jurisdiction in a single proceeding.  If that is sufficient to change the law, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s rule \xe2\x80\x9cprovides no limiting principle\xe2\x80\x9d on Congress\xe2\x80\x99s ability to assume the role of judge and decide the outcome of pending cases.  <i>Northern Pipeline</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 73.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In my view, the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cchanging the law\xe2\x80\x9d must imply some measure of generality or preservation of an adjudicative role for the courts.  The weight of our jurisdiction stripping precedent bears this out.  Almost all of the examples the plurality cites, see <i>ante</i>, at 10, 13, contemplated the wholesale repeal of a generally applicable jurisdictional provision.  See <i>Hallowell</i> v. <i>Commons</i>,\n\n239 U.\xc2\xa0S. 506,\n508 (1916)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe [provision] applies with the same force to all cases and was embodied in a statute that no doubt was intended to apply to all.\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Cary</i> v. <i>Curtis</i>, 3 How. 236, 245 (1845); see also <i>Landgraf</i> v. <i>USI Film Products</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244,\n274 (1994)\n; <i>Kline</i> v. <i>Burke Constr. Co.</i>,\n\n260 U.\xc2\xa0S. 226,\n234 (1922)\n.  The Court, to date, has never sustained a law that withdraws jurisdiction over a particular lawsuit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The closest analogue is of course <i>Ex parte McCardle</i>, 7 Wall. 506 (1869), which the plurality nonchalantly cites as one of its leading authorities.  <i>McCardle</i> arose amid a pitched national debate over Reconstruction of the former Confederacy. William McCardle, an unreconstructed newspaper editor, was being held in military custody for inciting insurrection.  After unsuccessfully applying for federal habeas relief in the circuit court, McCardle appealed to the Supreme Court, raising a broad challenge to the constitutionality of Reconstruction.  The Court heard argument on his habeas appeal over the course of four days in March 1868.  Before the Court could render its decision, however, the Radical Republican Congress\xe2\x80\x94 in an acknowledged effort to sweep the case from the docket\xe2\x80\x94enacted a statute withdrawing the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction in habeas cases.  Van Alstyne, A Critical Guide to Ex parte McCardle, 15 Ariz. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 229, 239\xe2\x80\x93241 (1973).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court unanimously dismissed McCardle\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  In a brief opinion, Chief Justice Chase sidestepped any consideration of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to preclude a decision in the case.  Faced with a \xe2\x80\x9cplain[ ] instance of positive exception,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held that it lacked power to review McCardle\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  7 Wall., at 514.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>McCardle</i> has been alternatively described as \xe2\x80\x9ccaving to the political dominance\xe2\x80\x9d of the Radical Republicans or \xe2\x80\x9cacceding to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s effort to silence the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Meltzer, The Story of <i>Ex parte McCardle</i>, in Federal Courts Stories 73 (V. Jackson &amp; J. Resnick eds. 2010).  Read for all it is worth, the decision is also inconsistent with the approach the Court took just three years later in <i>Klein</i>, where Chief Justice Chase (a dominant character in this drama) stressed that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is of vital importance\xe2\x80\x9d that the legislative and judicial powers \xe2\x80\x9cbe kept distinct.\xe2\x80\x9d  13 Wall., at 147.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The facts of <i>McCardle</i>, however, can support a more limited understanding of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to divest the courts of jurisdiction.  For starters, the repealer provision covered more than a single pending dispute; it applied to a class of cases, barring anyone from invoking the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction in habeas cases for the next two decades.  In addition, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision did not foreclose all avenues for judicial review of McCardle\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  As Chase made clear in the penultimate paragraph of the opinion\xe2\x80\x94and confirmed later that year in his opinion for the Court in <i>Ex parte Yerger</i>, 8 Wall. 85 (1869)\xe2\x80\x94the statute did not deny \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole appellate power of the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Wall., at 515.  McCardle, by taking a different procedural route and filing an original habeas action, could have had his case heard on the merits.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 2(b), on the other hand, has neither saving grace.  It ends Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit for good.  His federal case is dismissed, and he has no alternative means of review anywhere else.  See\n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71322(a) (providing that state courts, absent the consent of the tribe, may not exercise civil jurisdiction over trust land).  Section 2(b) thus reaches further than the typical jurisdictional repeal, which \xe2\x80\x9ctakes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Landgraf</i>, 511  U.\xc2\xa0S., at 274.  Because \xc2\xa72(b) singles out Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit, specifies how it must be resolved, and deprives him of any judicial forum for his claim, the decision to uphold that provision surpasses even <i>McCardle</i> as the highwater mark of legislative encroachment on Article III.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, although the stakes of this particular dispute may seem insignificant, the principle that the plurality would enshrine is of historic consequence.  In no uncertain terms, the plurality disavows any limitations on Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to determine judicial results, conferring on the Legislature a colonial-era authority to pick winners and losers in pending litigation as it pleases.  The Court in <i>Bank Markazi</i> said it was holding the line against this sort of legislative usurpation.  See 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___, and n.\xc2\xa017, ___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, and n.\xc2\xa017, 18).  The plurality would yield even that last ditch.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">While the plurality reaches to read the Gun Lake Act as stripping jurisdiction, Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, joined by Justice Sotomayor, strains further to construe \xc2\xa72(b) as restoring the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity from suit.  To reinstate sovereign immunity after it has been waived, Congress must express \xe2\x80\x9can unambiguous intention to withdraw\xe2\x80\x9d a remedy.  <i>Ruckelshaus</i> v. <i>Monsanto Co.</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 986,\n1019 (1984)\n.  Congress has not made that showing here.  Section 2(b)\xe2\x80\x94which provides that \xe2\x80\x9can action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. relating to the [Bradley Property] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be promptly dismissed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94bears none of the unmistakable hallmarks of a provision withdrawing the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s consent to suit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The concurrence first relies on a hunch, based on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier determination that Patchak\xe2\x80\x99s suit was not barred by sovereign immunity.  See <i>Patchak I</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 224.  But hunches do not make for an unambiguous expression of intent.  Nor, of course, does one lone reference to \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity\xe2\x80\x9d in the legislative history.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nordic Village, Inc.</i>,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30,\n37 (1992)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he \xe2\x80\x98unequivocal expression\xe2\x80\x99 of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cannot be supplied by a committee report.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Saving the text for last, the concurrence fails to identify a single instance where the Court has treated a statute that does not mention \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconsent to be sued,\xe2\x80\x9d or even the \xe2\x80\x9cUnited States\xe2\x80\x9d as restoring sovereign immunity.  The only basis for its interpretation is the purported similarity between the language of the Gun Lake Act and the waiver of immunity in the Administrative Procedure Act.  In drawing this comparison, however, Justice Ginsburg leaves out the critical element of that waiver.  See <i>ante</i>, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment).  In full, the APA provision states that a suit \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be dismissed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>on the ground that it is against the United States</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702 (emphasis added).  Section 2(b), as noted, contains no such reference to the sovereign.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As for Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, \xe2\x80\x9cdot[ting] all the i\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csimplif[ying] judicial decisionmaking,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9celiminat[ing] the cost of litigating a lawsuit\xe2\x80\x9d are nothing but cavalier euphemisms for exercising the judicial power.  <i>Ante</i>, at 2.

And if that is so, \xc2\xa72(b) does not simply supplement \xc2\xa72(a)\xe2\x80\x94it short-circuits the requisite adjudicative process and decides the suit outright.  The proper allocation of authority under the Constitution is very much part of the \xe2\x80\x9creal world.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pursuant to that basic equilibrium, Congress cannot \xe2\x80\x9cgild the lily\xe2\x80\x9d by relieving the Judiciary of its job\xe2\x80\x94applying the law to the case before it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Framers saw this case coming.

He expected to have his case decided by judges whose independence from political pressure was ensured by the safeguards of Article III\xe2\x80\x94life tenure and salary protection.  It was instead decided by Congress, in favor of the litigant it preferred, under a law adopted just for the occasion.
