LETT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">RENICO, WARDEN <em>v</em>. LETT</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x93338.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 29, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 3, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">From jury selection to jury instructions in a Michigan court, respondent Lett\xe2\x80\x99s first trial for, <em>inter alia, </em>first-degree murder took less than nine hours.  During approximately four hours of deliberations, the jury sent the trial court seven notes, including one asking what would happen if the jury could not agree.  The judge called the jury and the attorneys into the courtroom and questioned the foreperson, who said that the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict.  The judge then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury, and scheduled a new trial.  At Lett\xe2\x80\x99s second trial, after deliberating for only 3 hours and 15 minutes, a new jury found him guilty of second-degree murder.  On appeal, Lett argued that because the judge in his first trial had announced a mistrial without any manifest necessity to do so, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from trying him a second time.  Agreeing, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.  The Michigan Supreme Court reversed.  It concluded that, under <em>United States</em> v. <em>Perez</em>, 9 Wheat. 579, 580, a defendant may be retried following the discharge of a deadlocked jury so long as the trial court exercised its \xe2\x80\x9csound discretion\xe2\x80\x9d in concluding that the jury was deadlocked and thus that there was a \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest necessity\xe2\x80\x9d for a mistrial;<em> </em>and that, under <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/index.html">434 U. S. 497</a>, 506\xe2\x80\x93510, an appellate court must generally defer to a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination that a deadlock has been reached.  It then found that the judge at Lett\xe2\x80\x99s first trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mistrial, observing that the jury had deliberated a sufficient amount of time following a short, noncomplex trial; that the jury had sent several notes, including one appearing to indicate heated discussions; and that the foreperson had stated that the jury could not reach a verdict.  In Lett\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition, he contended that the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of his double jeopardy claim was \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), and thus that he was not barred by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) from obtaining federal habeas relief.  The District Court granted the writ, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this case was not unreasonable under AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting Lett habeas relief.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The question under AEDPA is whether the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination was \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), not whether it was an incorrect application of that law, see <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 410.  AEDPA imposes a \xe2\x80\x9chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 333, n.\xc2\xa07, and \xe2\x80\x9cdemands that [they] be given the benefit of the doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Visciotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/19/index.html">537 U. S. 19</a>, 24 (<em>per curiam</em>).  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b) Here, the \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d is largely undisputed.  When a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a new trial for the defendant before a new jury, <em>Perez</em>, 9 Wheat., at 579\xe2\x80\x93580.  Trial judges may declare a mistrial when, \xe2\x80\x9cin their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity\xe2\x80\x9d for doing so, <em>id.</em>, at 580, <em>i.e., </em>a \xe2\x80\x9chigh degree\xe2\x80\x9d of necessity, <em>Washington</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 506.  The decision whether to grant a mistrial is reserved to the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad discretion\xe2\x80\x9d of the trial judge, <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Somerville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/458/index.html">410 U. S. 458</a>, 462, and the discretion \xe2\x80\x9cto declare a mistrial [for a deadlocked jury] is \xe2\x80\xa6 accorded great deference by a reviewing court,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 510, although this deference is not absolute.  This Court has expressly declined to require the \xe2\x80\x9cmechanical application\xe2\x80\x9d of any \xe2\x80\x9crigid formula,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wade</em> v. <em>Hunter</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/684/index.html">336 U. S. 684</a>, 690\xe2\x80\x93691, when a trial judge decides to declare a mistrial due to jury deadlock, and it has explicitly held that the judge is not required to make explicit findings of \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest necessity\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9carticulate on the record all the factors\xe2\x80\x9d informing his discretion, <em>Washington</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 517.  The Court has never required a judge in these circumstances to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of time, to question the jurors individually, to consult with counsel, to issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to consider any other means of breaking the impasse.  Moreover, the legal standard applied by the Michigan Supreme Court is a general one\xe2\x80\x94whether there was an abuse of the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad discretion\xe2\x80\x9d reserved to the trial judge, <em>Somerville</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 462.  Because AEDPA authorizes a federal court to grant relief only when a state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of federal law was unreasonable, it follows that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he more general the rule\xe2\x80\x9d at issue\xe2\x80\x94and thus the greater the potential for reasoned disagreement among fair-minded judges\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe more leeway [state] courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Yarborough</em> v. <em>Alvarado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/652/index.html">541 U. S. 652</a>, 664.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication involved a straightforward application of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding precedents to the facts of Lett\xe2\x80\x99s case.  The state court cited this Court\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy cases\xe2\x80\x94from <em>Perez</em> to <em>Washington</em>\xe2\x80\x94applying those precedents to the particular facts before it and finding no abuse of discretion in light of the length of deliberations following a short, uncomplicated trial, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s notes to the judge, and the fact that the foreperson stated that the jury could not reach a verdict.  It was thus reasonable for the court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.  The Sixth Circuit concluded otherwise because it disagreed with the inferences that the Michigan Supreme Court had drawn from the facts.  The Circuit Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is not implausible, but other reasonable interpretations of the record are also possible.  It was not objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court to conclude that the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion was sound, both in light of what happened at trial and the fact that the relevant legal standard is a general one, to which there is no \xe2\x80\x9cplainly correct or incorrect\xe2\x80\x9d answer in this case.  <em>Yarborough</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 664.  The Sixth Circuit failed to grant the Michigan courts the dual layers of deference required by AEDPA and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy precedents.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d) The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on its own <em>Fulton</em> v. <em>Moore</em> decision for the proposition that <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Washington</em> sets forth three specific factors that determine whether a judge has exercised sound discretion.  Because <em>Fulton</em> does not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), failure to apply it does not independently authorize habeas relief under AEDPA.  Nor can <em>Fulton</em> be understood merely to illuminate this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Washington</em>, as <em>Washington</em> did not set forth any such test to determine whether a trial judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)  The Court does not deny that the trial judge in this case could have been more thorough before declaring a mistrial.  Nonetheless, the steps that the Sixth Circuit thought she should have taken were not required\xe2\x80\x94either under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy precedents or, by extension, under AEDPA.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).  The District Court in this case issued the writ to respondent Reginald Lett on the ground that his Michigan murder conviction violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution, and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  In doing so, however, these courts misapplied AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review.  Because we conclude that the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of federal law was not unreasonable, we reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 29, 1996, an argument broke out in a Detroit liquor store.  The antagonists included Adesoji Latona, a taxi driver; Charles Jones, a passenger who claimed he had been wrongfully ejected from Latona\xe2\x80\x99s cab; and Reginald Lett, a friend of Jones\xe2\x80\x99s.  After the argument began, Lett left the liquor store, retrieved a handgun from another friend outside in the parking lot, and returned to the store.  He shot Latona twice, once in the head and once in the chest.  Latona died from his wounds shortly thereafter.  See <em>People</em> v. <em>Lett</em>, 466 Mich. 206, 208\xe2\x80\x93209, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 743, 745 (2002).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan prosecutors charged Lett with first-degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.  His trial took place in June 1997.  From jury selection to jury instructions the trial took less than nine hours, spread over six different days.  <em>Id.,</em> at 209, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 745.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations began on June 12, 1997, at 3:24 p.m., and ran that day until 4 p.m.  <em>Id.</em>, at 209, n.\xc2\xa01, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 745, n.\xc2\xa01.  After resuming its work the next morning, the jury sent the trial court a note\xe2\x80\x94one of seven it sent out in its two days of deliberations\xe2\x80\x94stating that the jurors had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a concern about our voice levels disturbing any other proceedings that might be going on.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 209, n.\xc2\xa02, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 745, n.\xc2\xa02.  Later, the jury sent out another note, asking \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98What if we can\xe2\x80\x99t agree?  [M]istrial?  [R]etrial?  [W]hat?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 209, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 745.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial transcript does not reveal whether the judge discussed the jury\xe2\x80\x99s query with counsel, off the record, upon receiving this last communication.  <em>Id.</em>, at 209, n.\xc2\xa03, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 745, n.\xc2\xa03.  What is clear is that at 12:45 p.m. the judge called the jury back into the courtroom, along with the prosecutor and defense counsel.  Once the jury was seated, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: I received your note asking me what if you can\xe2\x80\x99t agree?

All right.  I need to ask you if the jury is deadlocked; in other words, is there a disagreement as to the verdict?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE FOREPERSON: Yes, there is.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: All right.  Do you believe that it is hopelessly deadlocked?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE FOREPERSON: The majority of us don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: (Interposing) Don\xe2\x80\x99t say what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say, okay?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE FOREPERSON: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know what your verdict might be, or how the split is, or any of that.  Thank you.  Okay?  Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict, or not?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE FOREPERSON: (No response)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: Yes or no?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE FOREPERSON: No, Judge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. in No. 96\xe2\x80\x9308252 (Recorder\xe2\x80\x99s Court, Detroit, Mich.), pp. 319\xe2\x80\x93320.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury, and scheduled a new trial for later that year.  Neither the prosecutor nor Lett\xe2\x80\x99s attorney made any objection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lett\xe2\x80\x99s second trial was held before a different judge and jury in November 1997.  This time, the jury was able to reach a unanimous verdict\xe2\x80\x94that Lett was guilty of second-degree murder\xe2\x80\x94after deliberating for only 3 hours and 15 minutes.  <em>Lett</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 210, and n.\xc2\xa04, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 746, and n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lett appealed his conviction to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  He argued that the judge in his first trial had announced a mistrial without any manifest necessity for doing so.  Because the mistrial was an error, Lett maintained, the State was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U. S. Constitution from trying him a second time.  The Michigan Court of Appeals agreed with Lett and reversed his conviction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court, which reversed the Court of Appeals.  The court explained that under our decision in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Perez</em>, 9 Wheat. 579 (1824), a defendant may be retried following the discharge of a deadlocked jury, even if the discharge occurs without the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s consent. <em>Lett</em>, 466 Mich., at 216\xe2\x80\x93217, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 749.  There is no Double Jeopardy Clause violation in such circumstances, it noted, so long as the trial court exercised its \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sound discretion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in concluding that the jury was deadlocked and thus that there was a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98manifest necessity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for a mistrial.  <em>Ibid. </em> (quoting <em>Perez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 580; emphasis deleted).  The court further observed that, under our decision in <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/index.html">434 U. S. 497</a>, 506\xe2\x80\x93510 (1978), an appellate court must generally defer to a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination that a deadlock has been reached.  466 Mich., at 218\xe2\x80\x93222, 644 N. W. 2d, at 750\xe2\x80\x93752.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After setting forth the applicable law, the Michigan Supreme Court determined that the judge at Lett\xe2\x80\x99s first trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mistrial.  <em>Id</em>., at 223, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 753.  The court cited the facts that the jury \xe2\x80\x9chad deliberated for at least four hours following a relatively short, and far from complex, trial,\xe2\x80\x9d that the jury had sent out several notes, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding one that appears to indicate that its discussions may have been particularly heated,\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost important\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat the jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lett petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus.  Again he argued that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of a mistrial constituted an abuse of discretion because there was no manifest necessity to cut short the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations.  He further contended that the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of his double jeopardy claim amounted to \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus that he was not barred by AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), from obtaining federal habeas relief.  The District Court agreed and granted the writ.  507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 777 (ED Mich. 2007).  On appeal, a divided panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  316 Fed. Appx. 421 (2009).  The State petitioned for review in our Court, and we granted certiorari.  558 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important at the outset to define the question before us.  That question is not whether the trial judge should have declared a mistrial.  It is not even whether it was an abuse of discretion for her to have done so\xe2\x80\x94the applicable standard on direct review.  The question under AEDPA is instead whether the determination of the Michigan Supreme Court that there was no abuse of discretion was \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have explained that \xe2\x80\x9can <em>unreasonable</em> application of federal law is different from an <em>incorrect</em> application of federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U.

In 1981, then-Justice Rehnquist noted that this Court had never \xe2\x80\x9coverturned a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of a mistrial after a jury was unable to reach a verdict on the ground that the \xe2\x80\x98manifest necessity\xe2\x80\x99 standard had not been met.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Winston</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/944/index.html">452 U.

This type of general standard triggers another consideration under AEDPA.  When assessing whether a state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of federal law is unreasonable, \xe2\x80\x9cthe range of reasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the relevant rule\xe2\x80\x9d that the state court must apply.  <em>Yarborough</em> v. <em>Alvarado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/652/index.html">541 U.

It then applied those precedents to the particular facts before it and found no abuse of discretion, especially in light of the length of deliberations after a short and uncomplicated trial, the jury notes suggesting heated discussions and asking what would happen \xe2\x80\x9cif we can\xe2\x80\x99t agree,\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost important\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that the jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 223, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 753.  In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded otherwise.  It did not contest the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of the objective facts, but disagreed with the inferences to be drawn from them.  For example, it speculated that the trial judge may have misinterpreted the jury\xe2\x80\x99s notes as signs of discord and deadlock when, read literally, they expressly stated no such thing.  316 Fed. Appx., at 427.  It further determined that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s brief colloquy with the foreperson may have wrongly implied a false equivalence between \xe2\x80\x9cmere disagreement\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine deadlock,\xe2\x80\x9d and may have given rise to \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate pressure\xe2\x80\x9d on her to say that the jury would be unable to reach a verdict.  <em>Id</em>., at 426\xe2\x80\x93427.  The trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes were so egregious, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, that the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion finding no abuse of discretion was not only wrong but objectively unreasonable.  <em>Id.</em>, at 427.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the trial record is not implausible.  Nor, for that matter, is the more inventive (surely not \xe2\x80\x9ccrude\xe2\x80\x9d) speculation of the dissent.  <em>Post</em>, at 10.  After all, the jury only deliberated for four hours, its notes were arguably ambiguous, the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial question to the foreperson was imprecise, and the judge neither asked for elaboration of the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s answers nor took any other measures to confirm the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s prediction that a unanimous verdict would not be reached.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But other reasonable interpretations of the record are also possible.  Lett\xe2\x80\x99s trial was not complex, and there is no reason that the jury would necessarily have needed more than a few hours to deliberate over his guilt.  The notes the jury sent to the judge certainly could be read as reflecting substantial disagreement, even if they did not say so outright.  Most important, the foreperson expressly told the judge\xe2\x80\x94in response to her unambiguous question \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to reach a unanimous verdict, or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that the jury would be unable to agree.  <em>Lett</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 210, 644\nN.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 745.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the foregoing facts, the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision upholding the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion\xe2\x80\x94while not necessarily correct\xe2\x80\x94was not objectively unreasonable.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Not only are there a number of plausible ways to interpret the record of Lett\xe2\x80\x99s trial, but the standard applied by the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x94whether the judge exercised sound discretion\xe2\x80\x94is a general one, to which there is no \xe2\x80\x9cplainly correct or incorrect\xe2\x80\x9d answer in this case.  <em>Yarborough</em>, 541 U.

S., at 689; and we have therefore carved out exceptions to the common-law rule.  But the exceptions are narrow.  For a mistrial to be granted at the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s request, \xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar.  His burden is a heavy one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington</em>, 434 U. S., at 505.  A judge who acts <em>sU.

The record suggests that she discharged the jury without considering any less extreme courses of action, and the record makes quite clear that she did not fully appreciate the scope or significance of the ancient right at stake.  The Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rejecting Reginald Lett\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy claim was just as clearly in error.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No one disputes that a \xe2\x80\x9cgenuinely deadlocked jury\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthe classic basis\xe2\x80\x9d for declaring a mistrial or that such declaration, under our doctrine, does not preclude reprosecution, <em>id.,</em> at 509; what is disputed in this case is whether the trial judge took adequate care to ensure the jury was genuinely deadlocked.

They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere.  To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes; and, in capital cases especially, Courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life, in favour of the prisoner.  But, after all, they have the right to order the discharge; and the security which the public have for the faithful, sound, and conscientious exercise of this discretion, rests, in this, as in other cases, upon the responsibility of the Judges, under their oaths of office.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Perez</em>, 9 Wheat. 579, 580 (1824).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This passage, too, is worthy of repetition, because in it the <em>Perez </em>Court struck a careful balance.  The Court established the authority of trial judges to discharge the jury prior to verdict, but in recognition of the novelty and potential injustice of the practice, the Court subjected that authority to several constraints: The judge may not declare a mistrial unless \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a manifest necessity for the act\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe ends of public justice\xe2\x80\x9d so require; and in determining whether such conditions exist, the judge must exercise \xe2\x80\x9csound discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconscientious[ness],\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest caution,\xe2\x80\x9d reserving the discharge power for \xe2\x80\x9curgent circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvery plain and obvious causes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  What exact circumstances and causes would meet that bar, the Court declined to specify.  Recognizing that trial proceedings may raise innumerable complications, so that \xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible to define\xe2\x80\x9d in advance all of the possible grounds for \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere[nce],\xe2\x80\x9d the Court set forth general standards for judicial conduct rather than categorical rules for specific classes of situations.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The seeds of our entire jurisprudence on the permissibility of retrial following an initial mistrial are packed into this one passage.

And while trial judges need not follow any precise regimen to facilitate appellate review, they must at least take care to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he basis for [a] mistrial order is adequately disclosed by the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 517.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our precedents contain examples of judicial action on both sides of the line.  We have, for instance, allowed a second trial when the jurors in the first trial, after 40 hours of deliberation, \xe2\x80\x9cannounced in open court that they were unable to agree,\xe2\x80\x9d and no \xe2\x80\x9cspecific and traversable fact[s]\xe2\x80\x9d called their deadlock into question.  <em>Logan</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/144/263/index.html">144 U.

We have likewise permitted reprosecution when the initial judge heard \xe2\x80\x9cextended argument\xe2\x80\x9d from both parties on the mistrial motion, acted with evident \xe2\x80\x9cconcern for the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous ruling,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caccorded careful consideration to [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] interest in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington</em>, 434 U.

Lett was charged with the most serious of crimes, first-degree murder, as well as possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.  He faced a potential sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.  Seventeen witnesses provided testimony over the course of 10 calendar days.  See 507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 777, 779, 785\xe2\x80\x93786 (ED Mich. 2007); see also <em>id.,</em> at 785 (discussing \xe2\x80\x9cpiecemeal fashion\xe2\x80\x9d in which evidence was presented to the jury).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury\xe2\x80\x99s first period of deliberation on Thursday afternoon lasted less than 40 minutes.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe jury likely spent\xe2\x80\x9d that brief session \xe2\x80\x9cdoing little more than electing a foreperson.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>People</em> v. <em>Lett</em>, 466 Mich. 206, 227, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 743, 755 (2002) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).  The jury deliberated a few more hours on Friday morning prior to discharge.  During that time, it sent the trial court seven notes.  Most were inconsequential, routine queries.  The first note on Friday morning raised \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a concern about [the jurors\xe2\x80\x99] voice levels,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Letter from M. McCowan to Clerk of Court (Mar. 4, 2010), p.\xc2\xa02, but nothing in the record relates this concern to the substance or tenor of their discussion.  At 12:27 p.m., the jury sent the fateful missive, asking: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98What if we can\xe2\x80\x99t agree?  [M]istrial?  [R]etrial?  [W]hat?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Seconds later, still at 12:27 p.m., the jury sent another note: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98What about lunch?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At 12:45 p.m., the trial judge initiated a colloquy with the foreperson that concluded in the mistrial declaration.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (reproducing transcript of colloquy).  Even accounting for the imprecision of oral communication, the judge made an inordinate number of logical and legal missteps during this short exchange.  Cf. <em>Somerville</em>, 410 U. S., at 469 (critiquing \xe2\x80\x9cerratic\xe2\x80\x9d mistrial inquiry).  It does not take much exegetical skill to spot them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge began by stating: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I received your note asking me what if you can\xe2\x80\x99t agree?  And I have to conclude from that that that is your situation at this time.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  This \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conclu[sion]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was a non sequitur.  The note asked what would happen <em>if </em>the jury could not agree; it gave no indication that the jury had <em>already </em>reached an irrevocable impasse.  The judge ignored the request for information that the note actually contained.  Instead, she announced that deadlock was the jury\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98situation at this time,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d thereby prejudging the question she had ostensibly summoned the foreperson to probe: namely, whether the jury was in fact deadlocked.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The judge continued: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I need to ask you if the jury is deadlocked; in other words, is there a disagreement as to the verdict?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  As the Federal Court of Appeals observed, this question \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly conflated deadlock with mere disagreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  316 Fed. Appx. 421, 426 (CA6 2009).  Deadlock is a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition or situation in which it is impossible to proceed or act; a complete standstill.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Oxford English Dictionary 290 (2d ed. 1989).  Disagreement among jurors is perfectly normal and does not come close to approaching the \xe2\x80\x9cimperious necessity\xe2\x80\x9d we have required for their discharge.  <em>Downum</em>, 372 U. S., at 736.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial judge then modulated her inquiry: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Do you believe [the jury] is hopelessly deadlocked?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  The foreperson was in the midst of replying, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The majority of us don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d when the judge appears to have cut her off.  <em>Ibid.</em>  One cannot \xe2\x80\x9cfault the trial judge\xe2\x80\x9d for wanting \xe2\x80\x9cto preserve the secrecy of jury deliberations,\xe2\x80\x9d 507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 787, but two aspects of the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s truncated reply are notable.  First, it \xe2\x80\x9ctends to show that the foreperson did not feel prepared to declare definitively that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  If she had been so prepared, then it is hard to see why she would begin her response with a descriptive account of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98majority\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d viewpoint.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s reply suggests the jury may have been leaning toward acquittal.  Admittedly, this is crude speculation, but it is entirely possible that the foreperson was in the process of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe majority of us don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he\xe2\x80\x99s guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Or: \xe2\x80\x9cThe majority of us don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that there is sufficient evidence to prove one of the counts.\xe2\x80\x9d  (On retrial, Lett was convicted on both counts.)  These possibilities are, I submit, linguistically more probable than something like the following: \xe2\x80\x9cThe majority of us don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Lett is guilty, whereas a minority of us believe that he is\xe2\x80\x94<em>and we are hopelessly deadlocked on the matter</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  And they are logically far more probable than something along the lines of, \xe2\x80\x9cThe majority of us don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we will ever be able to reach a verdict,\xe2\x80\x9d as the foreperson had been given no opportunity to poll her colleagues on this point.  Yet only such implausible endings could have supported a conclusion that it was manifestly necessary to discharge the jury.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge then steered the conversation back to the issue of deadlock, asking: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict, or not?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  After the foreperson hesitated, the judge persisted: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Yes or no?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The foreperson replied: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98No, Judge.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Two aspects of this interchange are also notable.  First, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s question, though \xe2\x80\x9cvery direct,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cactually rather ambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d because it gave the foreperson no temporal or legal context within which to understand what was being asked.  507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 787.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe foreperson could have easily thought the judge meant, \xe2\x80\x98Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict in the next hour?\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98before the lunch recess?\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98by the end of the day?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis deleted).  Even if the foreperson assumed no time constraint, she could have easily thought the judge meant, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you, in your estimation, <em>more likely than not</em> to reach a unanimous verdict?\xe2\x80\x9d  An affirmative answer to that question would likewise fall far short of manifest necessity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation suggests a lack of confidence in her position.  That alone ought to have called into question the propriety of a mistrial order.  But the judge bore down and demanded an unqualified answer, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Yes or no.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Most of the time when we worry about judicial coercion of juries, we worry about judges pressuring them, in the common-law manner, to keep deliberating until they return a verdict they may not otherwise have chosen.  This judge exerted pressure so as to prevent the jury from reaching any verdict at all.  In so doing, she cut off deliberations well before the point when it was clear they would no longer be fruitful.  Recall that prior to summoning the foreperson for their colloquy, the trial judge gave her no opportunity to consult with the other jurors on the matter that would be discussed.  So, the foreperson had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood of deadlock.  Recall, as well, that almost immediately after sending the judge a note asking what would happen if they disagreed, the jury sent a note asking about lunch.  Plainly, this was a group that was prepared to go on with its work.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge then declared a mistrial on the spot.  Her entire exchange with the foreperson took three minutes, from 12:45 p.m. to 12:48 p.m.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 93a\xe2\x80\x9394a.  The entire jury deliberations took roughly four hours.  The judge gave the parties no opportunity to comment on the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, much less on the question of mistrial.  Cf. <em>Washington</em>, 434 U.

Appx., at 428, with which she acted, it is remarkable what the trial judge did not do.  \xe2\x80\x9cNever did the trial judge consider alternatives or otherwise provide evidence that she exercised sound discretion.  For example, the judge did not poll the jurors, give an instruction ordering further deliberations, query defense counsel about his thoughts on continued deliberations, or indicate on the record why a mistrial declaration was necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lett</em>,<em> </em>466 Mich., at 227\xe2\x80\x93228, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 755 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).  Nor did the judge invite any argument or input from the prosecutor, make any findings of fact or provide any statements illuminating her thought process, follow up on the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s final response, or give any evident consideration to the ends of public justice or the balance between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rights and the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests.  The manner in which this discharge decision was made contravened standard trial-court guidelines.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The judge may not have had a constitutional obligation to take any one of the aforementioned measures, but she did have an obligation to exercise sound discretion and thus to \xe2\x80\x9cassure h[er]self that the situation warrant[ed] action on h[er] part foreclosing the defendant from a potentially favorable judgment by the tribunal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jorn</em>, 400 U. S., at 486 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Add all these factors up, and I fail to see how the trial judge exercised anything resembling \xe2\x80\x9csound discretion\xe2\x80\x9d in declaring a mistrial, as we have defined that term.  Indeed, I fail to see how a record could disclose much less evidence of sound decisionmaking.  Within the realm of realistic, nonpretextual possibilities, this mistrial declaration was about as precipitate as one is liable to find.  Despite the multitude of cases involving hung-jury mistrials that have arisen over the years, neither petitioner nor the Court has been able to identify any in which such abrupt judicial action has been upheld.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\xe2\x80\x9315.  Even the prosecutor felt compelled to acknowledge that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to discharge the jury \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clearly was error.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  316 Fed. Appx., at 427 (quoting postconviction hearing transcript).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.  The court suggested that an abuse of discretion should only be found \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98when the result is \xe2\x80\x9cso palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lett</em>,<em> </em>466 Mich., at 221, n.\xc2\xa012, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 751, n.\xc2\xa012 (quoting <em>Alken-Ziegler, Inc.</em> v. <em>Waterbury Headers Corp.</em>, 461 Mich. 219, 227, 600 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 638, 642 (1999)).  Finding that the record in this case \xe2\x80\x9cprovides sufficient justification for the mistrial declaration,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lett</em>,<em> </em>466 Mich., at 218, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 750, the court concluded that the declaration constituted a permissible exercise of judicial discretion, <em>id.,</em> at 223, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 753.  The court listed, without explaining, several reasons for this conclusion.  The jury \xe2\x80\x9chad deliberated for at least four hours following a relatively short, and far from complex, trial\xe2\x80\x9d; it \xe2\x80\x9chad sent out several notes over the course of its deliberations, including one that appears to indicate that its discussions may have been particularly heated\xe2\x80\x9d; the parties did not object to the mistrial order; and, \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost important,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.; </em>see <em>ante</em>, at 10 (reprising this list).[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These reasons do not suffice to justify the mistrial order.  Four hours is not a long time for jury deliberations, particularly in a first-degree murder case.  Indeed, it would have been \xe2\x80\x9cremarkable\xe2\x80\x9d if the jurors \xe2\x80\x9ccould review the testimony of all [the] witnesses in the time they were given, let alone conclude that they were deadlocked.\xe2\x80\x9d  507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 786.  The jury\xe2\x80\x99s note pertaining to its volume level does not necessarily indicate anything about the \xe2\x80\x9cheated[ness],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lett</em>,<em> </em>466 Mich., at 223, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 753, of its discussion.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no other suggestion in the record that such was the case, and the trial judge did not draw that conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 786.  Although it would have been preferable if Lett had tried to lodge an objection, defense counsel was given no meaningful opportunity to do so\xe2\x80\x94the judge discharged the jury simultaneously with her mistrial order, counsel received no advance notice of either action, and he may not even have been informed of the content of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s notes.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2; 316 Fed. Appx., at 428 (\xe2\x80\x9cAt no point before the actual declaration of the mistrial was it even mentioned on the record as a potential course of action by the court.  The summary nature of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s actions \xe2\x80\xa6 rendered an objection both unlikely and meaningless\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to object is therefore legally irrelevant.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  And, as detailed above, the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s remarks were far more equivocal and ambiguous, in context, than the Michigan Supreme Court allowed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s defense of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s actions is thus weak on its own terms.  It collapses entirely under the weight of the many defects in the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s process, virtually all of which the court either overlooked or discounted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The unreasonableness of the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is highlighted by the decisions of the three other courts that have addressed Lett\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy claim, each of which ruled in his favor, as well as the dissent filed by two Michigan Supreme Court Justices and the opinion of the State\xe2\x80\x99s own prosecutor.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision unfortunately compounds the deleterious consequences of the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision is entitled to great deference, it is not the place of a reviewing court to extract factoids from the record in an attempt to salvage a bad decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 787.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not really try to vindicate the Michigan Supreme Court on the merits, but instead ascribes today\xe2\x80\x99s outcome to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  The foregoing analysis shows why the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling cannot be saved by 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), however construed.  That ruling was not only incorrect but also unreasonable by any fair measure.  Three particular facets of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s AEDPA analysis require a brief comment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the fact that the substantive legal standard applied by the state court \xe2\x80\x9cis a general one\xe2\x80\x9d has no bearing on the standard of review.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  We have said that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Yarborough</em> v. <em>Alvarado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/652/index.html">541 U. S. 652</a>, 664 (2004).  But this statement stands only for the unremarkable proposition that more broadly framed rules will tend to encompass a broader set of conforming applications.  Regardless of the nature of the legal principle at issue, the task of a federal court remains the same under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1): to determine whether the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  General standards are no less binding law than discrete rules.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, I do not agree that the Federal Court of Appeals \xe2\x80\x9cerred\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9crel[ying] upon its own decision\xe2\x80\x9d applying <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Washington</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  The Sixth Circuit was well aware that its own decision \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not constitute \xe2\x80\x98clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (quoting \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)).  The panel expressly stated that it \xe2\x80\x9creview[ed] the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to determine only<em> </em>whether it was objectively unreasonable in light of the holdings of the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  316 Fed. Appx., at 425.  The panel examined its own precedents not as the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d under AEDPA, but as a tool for illuminating the precise contours of that law.  Lower courts routinely look to circuit cases to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide evidence that Supreme Court precedents ha[ve] clearly established a rule as of a particular time or [to] shed light on the \xe2\x80\x98reasonableness\xe2\x80\x99 of the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 application of existing Supreme Court precedents.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa732.3, p.\xc2\xa01585, n.\xc2\xa010 (5th ed. 2005) (hereinafter Hertz &amp; Liebman).  This is a healthy practice\xe2\x80\x94indeed, a vital practice, considering how few cases this Court decides\xe2\x80\x94and we have never disapproved it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I do not agree that AEDPA authorizes \xe2\x80\x9cthe dual layers of deference\xe2\x80\x9d the Court has utilized in this case.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  There is little doubt that AEDPA \xe2\x80\x9cdirects federal courts to attend to every state-court judgment with utmost care.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 389 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  But the statute never uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cdeference,\xe2\x80\x9d and the legislative history makes clear that Congress meant to preserve robust federal-court review.  <em>Id.,</em> at 386\xe2\x80\x93387; see also Hertz &amp; Liebman \xc2\xa732.3, at\xc2\xa01587\xe2\x80\x931589, n.\xc2\xa013 (summarizing congressional record and noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he aspect of prior practice that most troubled AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s supporters was the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s inattention to, and lack of respect for, state court decisions that the federal court, if it only looked, would find to be legally correct\xe2\x80\x9d).  Any attempt to prevent federal courts from exercising independent review of habeas applications would have been a radical reform of dubious constitutionality, and Congress \xe2\x80\x9cwould have spoken with much greater clarity\xe2\x80\x9d if that had been its intent.  <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 379 (opinion of Stevens, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So on two levels, it is absolutely \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary for us to decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\xa6 was right or wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa03.  If a federal judge were firmly convinced that such a decision were wrong, then in my view not only would he have no statutory duty to uphold it, but he might also have a constitutional obligation to reverse it.  And regardless of how one conceptualizes the distinction between an incorrect and an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d state-court ruling under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), one must always determine whether the ruling was wrong to be able to test the magnitude of any error.  Substantive and methodological considerations compel federal courts to give habeas claims a full, independent review\xe2\x80\x94and then to decide for themselves.  Even under AEDPA, there is no escaping the burden of judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, Reginald Lett\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights were violated when the trial court terminated his first trial without adequate justification and he was subsequently prosecuted for the same offense.  The majority does not appear to dispute this point, but it nevertheless denies Lett relief by applying a level of deference to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that effectively effaces the role of the federal courts.

She \xe2\x80\x9cnever even found on the record that the jury was genuinely deadlocked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>People</em> v. <em>Lett</em>, No. 209513, 2000 WL 33423221, *4 (Apr. 21, 2000) <em>(per curiam);</em> see also <em>People</em> v. <em>Lett</em>, 466 Mich. 206, 225, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 743, 754 (2002) (trial court did not \xe2\x80\x9carticulate a rationale on the record\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Michigan Supreme Court expressly declined to commit to the position that the jury really was deadlocked or that manifest necessity really did exist.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 220, 644 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 751 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe issue is not whether this Court would have found manifest necessity\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, even if 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(e)(1) were to apply to this appeal, there were no \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination[s] of a factual issue made by a State court\xe2\x80\x9d that we would have to \xe2\x80\x9cpresum[e] to be correct.\xe2\x80\x9d  In any event, none of the relevant facts in the case are disputed, and no argument concerning \xc2\xa72254(e)(1) was properly raised in this Court or passed upon below.</p>\n<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>Jorn</em>, 400 U. S., at 487 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]ndeed, the trial judge acted so abruptly in discharging the jury that, had the \xe2\x80\xa6 defendant [been disposed] to object to the discharge of the jury, there would have been no opportunity to do so\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Lett</em>, 2000 WL 33423221, *2 (noting that failure to object to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s discharge does not constitute consent under Michigan law).  While a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative request for or consent to a mistrial may be relevant to the double jeopardy inquiry, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Jorn</em>, 400 U. S., at 485 (plurality opinion), we have never suggested that defendants must object to such orders to preserve a claim, much less object to an order issued <em>sU. S.onte </em>and without any advance notice.</p>\n<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In recognition of this basic insight, our precedents \xe2\x80\x9chave made clear\xe2\x80\x9d that a state-court decision may be \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) when the \xe2\x80\x9cstate court has misapplied a \xe2\x80\x98governing legal principle\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98a set of facts different from those of the case in which the principle was announced.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U.

This is a critical feature of our AEDPA jurisprudence.  Federal habeas review would be meaningless if, for relief to be granted, we required a perfect congruence between the facts that gave rise to our governing precedents and the facts that confronted the state court in any particular case.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
