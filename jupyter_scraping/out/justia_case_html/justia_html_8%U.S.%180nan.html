After the expiration of the term, it was void.  The execution of a writ of error is the sending up the record according to its command, and to send the record up at another term is no execution of the writ. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 8 U.

But if served while in force, a return afterwards will be good.</p>\n<p>The service or a writ of error is the lodging a copy thereof for the adverse party in the office of the clerk of the court where the judgment was rendered.  1 Laws U.S. 63, s. 23</p>\n<p>If it be so served before the return day, the service is good.</p>\n<p>In the case cited from 4 Dallas, it does not appear which party made the motion nor whether there was an appearance for the opposite party.</p>\n<p>In the present case, the writ of error having been served when in full force and the writ of error returned, although not at the first term, the appearance of the defendant in error has waived all objection to the irregularity of the return.</p>\n<p>The judgment was</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>Note.
