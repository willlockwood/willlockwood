S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71231(b)(2) prescribes the procedure for selecting the country to which an alien ineligible to remain in the United States will be removed.  Petitioner had his refugee status in the United States terminated for a criminal conviction.  When he declined to designate a country to which he preferred to be removed, the Immigration Judge ordered him removed to Somalia, his country of birth, pursuant to \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(E)(iv).  Petitioner filed a habeas petition to challenge the designation, claiming that Somalia had no functioning government and thus could not consent in advance to his removal, and that the Government was barred from removing him there absent such advance consent.  The District Court agreed, but the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(E)(iv) does not require advance acceptance by the destination country.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section 1231(b)(2)(E)(iv) permits an alien to be removed to a country without the advance consent of that country\xe2\x80\x99s government.

Here, the question is whether the Attorney General was precluded from removing petitioner to Somalia under subparagraph (E), clause (iv), because Somalia had not consented.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0In all of subparagraph (E), an acceptance requirement appears only in clause (vii), the fourth step of the process, which the Attorney General may invoke only after finding the third step \xe2\x80\x9cimpracticable, inadvisable, or impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clauses (i) through (vi) contain not a word about acceptance by the destination country.  Including the word \xe2\x80\x9canother\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (vii) does not import the acceptance requirement into clauses (i)\xe2\x80\x93(vi).  Such a reading stretches the modifier too far, contrary to \xe2\x80\x9cthe grammatical \xe2\x80\x98rule of the last antecedent,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/540/20/index.html">540 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Nor is an acceptance requirement manifest in \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s structure.  First, the overlap between subparagraphs (D) and (E) is not so complete as to justify imposing an acceptance requirement at the third step in the name of preventing the Attorney General from \xe2\x80\x9ccircumventing\xe2\x80\x9d the second step.  Second, the statute expressly countenances removal to a country notwithstanding its objections.  Subparagraph (C) provides that at the first step of the country-selection process, the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d refrain from removing an alien to the country of his choice if that country does not accept the alien; the Attorney General thus has discretion to override any lack of acceptance.  Finally, the existence of an acceptance requirement at the fourth step does not imply that such a requirement must exist at the third.  To infer an absolute rule of acceptance where Congress has not clearly set it forth would run counter to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s customary policy of deference to the President in foreign affairs, and would not be necessary to ensure appropriate consideration to conditions in the country of removal, since aliens facing persecution or other mistreatment have a number of available remedies.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71231(b)(2).  The question in this case is whether this provision prohibits removing an alien to a country without the explicit, advance consent of that country\xe2\x80\x99s government.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Keyse Jama was born in Somalia and remains a citizen of that nation.  He was admitted to the United States as a refugee, but his refugee status was terminated in 2000 by reason of a criminal conviction.  See <em>Jama</em> v. <em>INS,</em> 329 F.\xc2\xa03d 630, 631 (CA8 2003).  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) brought an action to remove petitioner from the United States for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude.  <em>Ibid.; </em>see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 1229a(e)(2)(A).  In the administrative hearing, petitioner conceded that he was subject to removal, although he sought various forms of relief from that determination (adjustment of status, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture, and asylum).  He declined to designate a country to which he preferred to be removed.  The Immigration Judge ordered petitioner removed to Somalia, his country of birth and citizenship.  The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed that determination, and petitioner did not seek review in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, petitioner instituted collateral proceedings under the habeas statute, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241, to challenge the designation of Somalia as his destination.  He filed his petition in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, alleging that Somalia has no functioning government, that Somalia therefore could not consent in advance to his removal, and that the Government was barred from removing him to Somalia absent such advance consent.  The District Court agreed that petitioner could not be removed to a country that had not consented in advance to receive him, <em>Jama</em> v. <em>INS</em>, Civ.

or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) if the recognized government of the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject is not in exile, to a country, or a political or territorial subdivision of a country, that is very near the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject, or, with the consent of the government of the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject, to another country.\xe2\x80\x9d  Immigration and Nationality Act, \xc2\xa7241(b)(2), as added by Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), \xc2\xa7305(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93600 to 3009\xe2\x80\x93607.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe statute thus provides four consecutive removal commands.  (1) An alien shall be removed to the country of his choice (subparagraphs (A) to (C)), unless one of the conditions eliminating that command is satisfied; (2) otherwise he shall be removed to the country of which he is a citizen (subparagraph (D)), unless one of the conditions eliminating that command is satisfied; (3) otherwise he shall be removed to one of the countries with which he has a lesser connection (clauses (i) to (vi) of subparagraph (E)); or (4) if that is \xe2\x80\x9cimpracticable, inadvisable or impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he shall be removed to \xe2\x80\x9canother country whose government will accept the alien into that country\xe2\x80\x9d (clause (vii) of subparagraph (E)).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Petitioner declined to designate a country of choice, so the first step was inapplicable.  Petitioner is a citizen of Somalia, which has not informed the Attorney General of its willingness to receive him (clause (i) of subparagraph (D)), so the Attorney General was not obliged to remove petitioner to Somalia under the second step.  The question is whether the Attorney General was precluded from removing petitioner to Somalia under the third step (clause (iv) of subparagraph (E)) because Somalia had not given its consent.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply, and our reluctance is even greater when Congress has shown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows how to make such a requirement manifest.  In all of subparagraph (E), an acceptance requirement appears only in the terminal clause (vii), a clause that the Attorney General may invoke only after he finds that the removal options presented in the other six are \xe2\x80\x9cimpracticable, inadvisable, or impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clauses (i) through (vi) come first\xe2\x80\x94in the statute and in the process of selecting a country.  And those six clauses contain not a word about acceptance by the destination country; they merely direct that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General shall remove the alien\xe2\x80\x9d to any one of them.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Effects are attached to nonacceptance throughout the rest of paragraph (2), making the failure to specify any such effect in most of subparagraph (E) conspicuous\xe2\x80\x94and more likely intentional.  Subparagraph (C) prescribes the consequence of nonacceptance in the first step of the selection process; subparagraph (D) does the same for the second step; and clause (vii) of subparagraph (E) does the same for the fourth step.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  With respect to the third step, however, the Attorney General is directed to move on to the fourth step only if it is \xe2\x80\x9cimpracticable, inadvisable, or impossible to remove the alien to each country described in\xe2\x80\x9d the third step.  Nonacceptance may surely be one of the factors considered in determining whether removal to a given country is impracticable or inadvisable, but the statute does not give it the dispositive effect petitioner wishes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner seizes upon the word \xe2\x80\x9canother\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (vii) as a means of importing the acceptance requirement into clauses (i) through (vi).  He argues that if the last-resort country is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>another </em>country whose government will accept the alien,\xe2\x80\x9d then the countries enumerated in clauses (i) through (vi) must <em>also</em> be \xe2\x80\x9ccountries whose governments will accept the alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  That stretches the modifier too far.  Just last Term, we rejected an argument much like petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s, noting that it ran contrary to \xe2\x80\x9cthe grammatical \xe2\x80\x98rule of the last antecedent,\xe2\x80\x99 according to which a limiting clause or phrase \xe2\x80\xa6 should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/540/20/index.html">540 U. S. 20</a>, 26 (2003).  There, a statute referred first to a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprevious work\xe2\x80\x9d and then to \xe2\x80\x9cany other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy\xe2\x80\x9d; under the rule of the last antecedent, we declined to read the limiting clause \xe2\x80\x9cwhich exists in the national economy\xe2\x80\x9d into the term \xe2\x80\x9cprevious work.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9328 (emphasis deleted); accord, <em>FTC</em> v. <em>Mandel Brothers, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/359/385/index.html">359 U. S. 385</a>, 389\xe2\x80\x93390 (1959).  We thus did not treat \xe2\x80\x9cany other\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9capparently connecting modifier\xe2\x80\x9d that the dissent here thinks \xe2\x80\x9canother\xe2\x80\x9d to be, <em>post,</em> at 4.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the structure of subparagraph (E) refute the inference derived from the last-antecedent rule.  Each clause is distinct and ends with a period, strongly suggesting that each may be understood completely without reading any further.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And as we have already noted, it is not necessary to turn to the acceptance language of clause (vii) to find the conditions under which the Attorney General is to abandon the third step and move to the fourth, the last-resort option of any willing country.   The Attorney General must do so if in his judgment it would be \xe2\x80\x9cimpracticable, inadvisable, or impossible to remove the alien to each country described in\xe2\x80\x9d clauses (i) to (vi).  This allows the Attorney General to take both practical and geopolitical concerns into account when selecting a destination country (and accords with the similar flexibility to pass over inappropriate countries that the statute gives the Attorney General at the other steps, see <em>infra,</em> at 13).  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reading would abridge that exercise of Executive judgment, effectively deeming the removal of an alien to any country to be <em>per se</em> \xe2\x80\x9cimpracticable, inadvisable, or impossible\xe2\x80\x9d absent that country\xe2\x80\x99s advance acceptance, even though in many cases\xe2\x80\x94such as this one\xe2\x80\x94it is nothing of the sort.  (Removing an alien to Somalia apparently involves no more than putting the alien on one of the regularly scheduled flights from Dubai or Nairobi, and has been accomplished a number of times since petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s removal proceeding began.  App. 36\xe2\x80\x9340 (declaration of detention enforcement officer Eric O\xe2\x80\x99Denius).)  Even without advance <em>consultation</em>, a country with a functioning government may well accept a removed alien when he is presented at the border or a port of entry; the absence of advance <em>consent</em> is hardly synonymous with impracticability or impossibility.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner contends that even if no acceptance requirement is explicit in the text, one is manifest in the entire structure of \xc2\xa71231(b)(2).  The Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country under subparagraph (A) or (D) without that country\xe2\x80\x99s consent, petitioner reasons, so he must be barred from circumventing that limitation by removing the same alien to the same country under subparagraph (E).  The dissent rests its argument only on the existence of an acceptance requirement in step two (subparagraph (D)) and not in step one (subparagraphs (A) through (C)).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note initially a point that applies to both petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s positions: the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumvention\xe2\x80\x9d argument requires that the country the Attorney General selects at step three\xe2\x80\x94here, the country of birth under clause (iv)\xe2\x80\x94 also be the country of citizenship that was disqualified at step two for failure to accept the alien.  That will sometimes be true, yet the reason step three exists at all is that it will not <em>always</em> be true.  (Indeed, in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case, several of the clauses of subparagraph (E) describe Kenya, not Somalia.)  Despite this imperfect overlap, petitioner and the dissent seek to impose an acceptance requirement on <em>all</em> removals under step three, in the name of preventing the Attorney General from \xe2\x80\x9ccircumventing\xe2\x80\x9d step two in the cases where a step-three country is also the country of citizenship.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The more fundamental defect in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument, which appeals to a presumed uniformity of acceptance requirement throughout \xc2\xa71231(b)(2), is that its premise is false.  It is simply not true that the Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country under subparagraph (A) or (D) without that country\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  Subparagraph (C) specifies that the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cmay disregard\xe2\x80\x9d the alien\xe2\x80\x99s subparagraph (A) designation if the designated country\xe2\x80\x99s government proves unwilling to accept the alien or fails to respond within 30 days.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d customarily connotes discretion.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Haig</em> v. <em>Agee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/280/index.html">453 U. S. 280</a>, 294, n. 26 (1981).  That connotation is particularly apt where, as here, \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d is used in contraposition to the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d: the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cshall remove\xe2\x80\x9d an alien to the designated country, except that the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d disregard the designation if any one of four potentially countervailing circumstances arises.  And examining those four circumstances reinforces the inappropriateness of reading \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d in subparagraph (C): Would Congress really have wanted to preclude the Attorney General from removing an alien to his country of choice, merely because that country took 31 days rather than 30 to manifest its acceptance?  (Subparagraph (C), unlike subparagraph (D), offers no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable time\xe2\x80\x9d exception to the 30-day rule.)  Petitioner insists that a lack of advance acceptance is an absolute bar to removal, but offers no plausible way of squaring that insistence with the text of subparagraph (C).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the existence of an acceptance requirement at the fourth and final step create any structural inference that such a requirement must exist at the third.  It would be a stretch to conclude that merely because Congress expressly directed the Attorney General to obtain consent when removing an alien to a country with which the alien lacks the ties of citizenship, nativity, previous presence, and so on, Congress must also have <em>implicitly</em> required him to obtain advance acceptance from countries with which the alien <em>does</em> have such ties.  Moreover, if the Attorney General is unable to secure an alien\xe2\x80\x99s removal at the third step, all that is left is the last-resort provision allowing removal to a country with which the alien has little or no connection\xe2\x80\x94if a country can be found that will take him.  If none exists, the alien is left in the same removable-but-unremovable limbo as the aliens in <em>Zadvydas</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/678/index.html">533 U. S. 678</a> (2001), and <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Martinez, post</em>, p. __, and under the rule announced in those cases must presumptively be released into American society after six months.  If this is the result that obtains when the country-selection process fails, there is every reason to refrain from reading restrictions into that process that do not clearly appear\xe2\x80\x94particularly restrictions upon the third step, which will often afford the Attorney General his last realistic option for removal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To infer an absolute rule of acceptance where Congress has not clearly set it forth would run counter to our customary policy of deference to the President in matters of foreign affairs.  Removal decisions, including the selection of a removed alien\xe2\x80\x99s destination, \xe2\x80\x9cmay implicate our relations with foreign powers\xe2\x80\x9d and require consideration of \xe2\x80\x9cchanging political and economic circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mathews</em> v. <em>Diaz,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/67/index.html">426 U. S. 67</a>, 81 (1976).  Congress has already provided a way for the Attorney General to avoid removals that are likely to ruffle diplomatic feathers, or simply to prove futile.  At each step in the selection process, he is <em>empowered</em> to skip over a country that resists accepting the alien, or a country that has declined to provide assurances that its border guards will allow the alien entry.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is it necessary to infer an acceptance requirement in order to ensure that the Attorney General will give appropriate consideration to conditions in the country of removal.  If aliens would face persecution or other mistreatment in the country designated under \xc2\xa71231(b)(2), they have a number of available remedies: asylum, \xc2\xa71158(b)(1); withholding of removal, \xc2\xa71231(b)(3)(A); relief under an international agreement prohibiting torture, see 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7208.16(c)(4), 208.17(a) (2004); and temporary protected status, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71254a(a)(1).  These individualized determinations strike a better balance between securing the removal of inadmissible aliens and ensuring their humane treatment than does petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that silence from Mogadishu inevitably portends future mistreatment and justifies declining to remove <em>anyone</em> to Somalia.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner points to what he describes as the \xe2\x80\x9csettled construction\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71231(b)(2), and asserts that Congress, in its most recent re-enactment of the provision, should be deemed to have incorporated that construction into law.  We think not.

Paragraph (1) of that subsection governs aliens found excludable from the United States in the first place, whereas paragraph (2), which is at issue in this case, governs those once admitted for residence but since ordered to be deported (for criminal conduct while here, for example).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  As to the latter, paragraph (2) sets out three options or successive steps for picking the recipient country.  At step one, the alien himself designates the country, \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(A), subject to conditions set out in subparagraphs (B) and (C).  If no removal to a step-one choice occurs, the Secretary of Homeland Security at step two designates the country of which the alien \xe2\x80\x9cis a subject, national, or citizen\xe2\x80\x9d as the place to send him.  \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(D).  If no such removal occurs, the Secretary at step three names a country with which the alien has some prior connection, or (as a last resort) one with which he has no connection at all.  \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(E).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The provision for step three describes six countries with various connections to an alien (\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he country in which the alien was born,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(E)(iv)), as well as the choice of last resort, \xe2\x80\x9canother country whose government will accept the alien into that country,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(E)(vii).  The question is whether not only the seventh, last-resort country but also the prior six are subject to the condition that the \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment will accept the alien into that country.\xe2\x80\x9d  In my judgment, the acceptance requirement applies to all seven; the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion is at war with the text, structure, history, and legislative history of the statute, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court remarks that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  Indeed we do not, but the question in this case is whether Congress really has left out an acceptance requirement covering the entire \xe2\x80\x9cadopted text,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, the provision governing all seven choices at step three.  Jama says that the text contains just that requirement, in the seventh and final clause of \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(E).  As noted, that clause provides a last possible destination for aliens who cannot (or, in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, should not) be removed under subparagraphs (A) through (D) or the first six clauses of subparagraph (E); it does so by authorizing removal to \xe2\x80\x9canother country whose government will accept the alien,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(E)(vii).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jama contends that the description of \xe2\x80\x9canother\xe2\x80\x9d willing country applies an acceptance requirement to clauses (i) through (vi) of the same subparagraph, (E).  If Congress had not intended this, it would have written clause (vii) differently, as by saying, for example, \xe2\x80\x9ca country whose government will accept the alien\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cany country whose government will accept the alien\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9canother country, if that country will accept the alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress, in other words, had some simple drafting alternatives that would not have indicated any intent to attach an acceptance requirement to clauses (i) through (vi), but instead used language naturally read as alluding to a common characteristic of all the countries in the series, a willingness to take the alien.  Jama would therefore have us draw the straightforward conclusion that all step-three designations are subject to acceptance by the country selected, just as we have reasoned before when construing comparable statutory language.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Standard Brewery, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/251/210/index.html">251 U. S. 210</a>, 218 (1920) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe prohibitions extend to the use of food products for making \xe2\x80\x98beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor for beverage purposes.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 It is elementary that all of the words used in a legislative act are to be given force and meaning, and of course the qualifying words \xe2\x80\x98other intoxicating\xe2\x80\x99 in this act cannot be rejected.  It is not to be assumed that Congress had no purpose in inserting them or that it did so without intending that they should be given due force and effect.  The Government insists that the intention was to include beer and wine whether intoxicating or not.  If so the use of this phraseology was quite superfluous, and it would have been enough to have written the act without the qualifying words\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court dodges the thrust of the congressional language by invoking the last antecedent rule as a grammatical reason for confining the requirement of a receiving country\xe2\x80\x99s willingness strictly to the seventh third-step option, where it is expressly set out.  Under the last antecedent rule, \xe2\x80\x9ca limiting clause or phrase \xe2\x80\xa6 should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/20/index.html">540 U. S. 20</a>, 26 (2003), quoted <em>ante</em>, at 7.  If the rule applied here, it would mean that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwhose government will accept \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d modified only the last-choice \xe2\x80\x9ccountry\xe2\x80\x9d in clause (vii), to the exclusion of each \xe2\x80\x9ccountry\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned in the immediately preceding six clauses, notwithstanding the apparently connecting modifier, \xe2\x80\x9canother.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the last antecedent rule fails to confine the willing-government reference to clause (vii).  The rule governs interpretation only \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily,\xe2\x80\x9d and it \xe2\x80\x9ccan assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 26.  Over the years, such indicia have counseled us against invoking the rule (often unanimously) at least as many times as we have relied on it.  See <em>Nobelman</em> v. <em>American Savings Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/324/index.html">508 U. S. 324</a>, 330\xe2\x80\x93331 (1993); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bass</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/index.html">404 U. S. 336</a>, 340, n.\xc2\xa06 (1971); <em>Standard Brewery</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 218 (citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>United Verde Copper Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/196/207/index.html">196 U. S. 207</a> (1905)).  And here, the other indicia of meaning point with one accord to applying the acceptance requirement to each third-step option.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first of these indicia is the contrast between the text of clause (vii), which is the last resort for \xe2\x80\x9cdeportation,\xe2\x80\x9d and the wording of the corresponding provision in the adjacent and cognate paragraph of the same subsection that deals with \xe2\x80\x9cexclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the Court explains, <em>ante</em>, at 14, the 1996 amendments addressing removal of aliens gathered into one statute prior provisions dealing with the two different varieties of removal: what the earlier law called exclusion, that is, the removal of an excludable alien \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to whom [removal] proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 were initiated at the time of such alien\xe2\x80\x99s arrival,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71231(b)(1), and what the earlier law called deportation, that is, the removal of all other aliens.  Exclusion is the sole subject of paragraph (1) of the current statute, while deportation is the sole subject of paragraph (2), the one at issue here.  See <em>supra</em>, at 1.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The separate attention to the two classes of removable aliens includes separate provisions for selecting the country to which an alien may be removed.  Paragraph (1) sets out several options for excludable aliens, much as paragraph (2) does for those who are deportable.  And just like the final clause of the final subparagraph of paragraph (2) (clause (vii)), the final clause of the final subparagraph of paragraph (1) provides a last resort that is available when removal of an excludable alien to any of the previously described countries \xe2\x80\x9cis impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71231(b)(1)(C)(iv).  The two last-resort provisions differ in one important way, however.  The provision for deportable aliens in paragraph (2) speaks of \xe2\x80\x9canother country whose government will accept the alien into that country,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(E)(vii), while the one for excludable aliens in paragraph (1) reads, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] country with a government that will accept the alien into the country\xe2\x80\x99s territory,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71231(b)(1)(C)(iv).  Congress thus used two different words (\xe2\x80\x9canother\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d) in parallel provisions of two immediately adjacent and otherwise similar paragraphs.  Whereas \xe2\x80\x9canother country\xe2\x80\x9d with a willing government is readily read to imply that the country described is like one or more other countries already identified, \xe2\x80\x9ca country\xe2\x80\x9d with a willing government carries no such implication.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although this textual difference between simultaneously enacted provisions that address the same subject makes no sense unless Congress meant different things by its different usage, the Court treats the \xe2\x80\x9ca country\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9canother country\xe2\x80\x9d provisions as if they were exactly the same.  In doing so, it \xe2\x80\x9cruns afoul of the usual rule that \xe2\x80\x98when the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sosa</em> v. <em>Alvarez-Machain</em>, 542 U. S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa09 (2004) (slip op., at 16, n.\xc2\xa09) (quoting 2A N.

S. 1</a>, 5 (1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe refrain from concluding here that the differing language in the two subsections has the same meaning in each.  We would not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship\xe2\x80\x9d).  Jama\xe2\x80\x99s contrasting interpretation, which I would adopt, is consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s distinct choices of words.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our long-held view that distinct words have distinct meanings is, if anything, all the stronger here because the choice to use \xe2\x80\x9canother\xe2\x80\x9d was unmistakably deliberate.  The prior statute governing deportable aliens like Jama described the country of last resort with a neutral modifier, providing that if no other suitable destination could be found then deportation had to be \xe2\x80\x9cto any country which is willing to accept such alien into its territory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, \xc2\xa7243(a)(7), 66 Stat. 213 (codified from 1952 to 1996 at 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253(a)); see also Internal Security Act of 1950, \xc2\xa723, 64 Stat. 1010 (nearly identical text).  But in 1996 Congress went to the trouble of changing \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9canother,\xe2\x80\x9d legislative action that can neither be dismissed as inadvertent nor discounted as a waste of time and effort in merely exchanging two interchangeable modifiers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court cannot be right in reducing the 1996 amendment to this level of whimsy.  And if there were any doubt about what Congress was getting at when it changed \xe2\x80\x9cany country\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9canother country,\xe2\x80\x9d legislative history and prior case law combine to show what Congress had in mind.  At least one House of Congress intended various 1996 amendments (including \xe2\x80\x9cany country\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9canother country\xe2\x80\x9d) to make no substantive change in the law.

No. 104\xe2\x80\x93469, pt 1, p. 234 (1995) (Judiciary Committee Report) (both describing the relevant section as merely \xe2\x80\x9crestat[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the earlier provision).  Accordingly, the change from \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9canother\xe2\x80\x9d makes most sense as a way to bring the text more obviously into line with an understanding on the part of Congress that an acceptance requirement applied to all options for deporting all aliens at step three.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is also the understanding that fits with what we know about the view of the law outside of Congress.  In an early decision by Judge Learned Hand, the Second Circuit squarely held that the pre-1996 designations of receiving countries were all subject to the country\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance.  <em>United States ex rel. Tom Man</em> v. <em>Murff</em>, 264 F.\xc2\xa02d 926 (CA2 1959).  Other Circuit opinions took the same position in dicta.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Amanullah</em> v. <em>Cobb</em>, 862 F.\xc2\xa02d 362, 365\xe2\x80\x93366 (CA1 1988) (opinion of Pettine, J.); <em>id.,</em> at 369 (Aldrich, J., concurring) (both citing <em>Tom Man</em>, <em>supra</em>); <em>Chi Sheng Liu</em> v. <em>Holton</em>, 297 F.\xc2\xa02d 740, 743 (CA9 1961) (citing <em>Tom Man</em> and describing the predecessor to \xc2\xa71231(b)(2) as \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] that an alien cannot be deported to any country unless its government is willing to accept him into its territory\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Nor was the consensus confined to the courts, for the Board of Immigration Appeals read the predecessor to subparagraph (E)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(vi) as having an acceptance requirement.  <em>Matter of Linnas</em>, 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 302, 307 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he language of that section expressly requires, or has been construed to require, that the \xe2\x80\x98government\xe2\x80\x99 of a country selected under any of the three steps must indicate it is willing to accept a deported alien into its \xe2\x80\x98territory\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); but cf. <em>Matter of Niesel</em>, 10 I. &amp; N. Dec. 57, 59 (BIA 1962).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  And even within the Government, this understanding seems to have survived right up to the time this case began to draw attention, for just last year the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Legal Counsel rendered an opinion (albeit one not directly addressing \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)) stating that an acceptance requirement attaches to clauses (i) through (vi).  Memorandum Opinion for the Deputy Attorney General: Limitations on the Detention Authority of the Immigration and Naturalization Service 27, n.\xc2\xa011 (Feb. 20, 2003), available at http://www.usdoj.gov/olc/ INSDetention.htm (as visited Dec. 7, 2004, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, like today\xe2\x80\x99s Court, is fighting uphill when it tries to show that these authorities failed to express the consensus view of the law at the time Congress rearranged the statutes, and neither Government nor Court cites a single judicial ruling, prior to the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision here, that held or stated in dicta or even implied that the acceptance requirement did not apply throughout the third step.  The District Court in this case, echoing the Magistrate Judge, stressed this very point, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cin fifty pages of briefing, the government has not cited a single case in which a federal court has sanctioned the removal of a legally admitted alien to a country that has not agreed to accept him.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court similarly cites \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\xa6 a single case.\xe2\x80\x9d  The fair conclusion is that when Congress amended the statute, it understood the law to require a country\xe2\x80\x99s consent and chose language suited to that understanding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to undercut this evidence founders on a mistake of fact.  The Court describes the 1996 amendment as creating the current removal scheme \xe2\x80\x9cthrough the fusion of two previously distinct expulsion proceedings, \xe2\x80\x98deportation\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98exclusion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  According to the Court, this fusion neutralizes Jama\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the settled understanding of the prior law, expressed in consistent judicial treatment, was meant to be carried forward into subparagraph (E)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(vi).  Because the current statute was \xe2\x80\x9cforged \xe2\x80\xa6 out of two provisions [one on exclusion and one on deportation], only one of which [on deportation] had been construed as petitioner wishes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, the Court says it is unsound to argue that Congress meant to preserve an acceptance requirement when the statute merged the old exclusion and deportation laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court goes wrong here, and we have already seen how.  It is true that the 1996 law uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cremoval\xe2\x80\x9d to cover both exclusion and deportation, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Calcano-Martinez</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/348/index.html">533 U. S. 348</a>, 350, n.\xc2\xa01 (2001), and places the former exclusion and deportation provisions in a single section (indeed, a single subsection) of the U. S. Code.  The statutory provision now before us, however, in no way resulted from a textual merger of two former provisions.  As noted, the language of the prior exclusion provision appears (with very few changes from its predecessor) in one paragraph, compare \xc2\xa71231(b)(1)[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] with 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a) (1994 ed.), while the language on deportation appears in a separate paragraph, \xc2\xa71231(b)(2), which tracks almost exactly the text of the former deportation provision, compare \xc2\xa71231(b)(2) with 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253(a) (1994 ed.).  The provision to be construed, then, is not a \xe2\x80\x9cfusion\xe2\x80\x9d of old fragments on different subjects, but language unchanged in any way helpful to the Government from the text of the prior law, with its settled judicial and administrative construction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court responds that \xc2\xa71232(b)(2) must descend from the prior exclusion provision because the old exclusion provision would have been used to send an alien in Jama\xe2\x80\x99s situation out of the country, whereas now \xc2\xa71232(b)(2) is used.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16, n.\xc2\xa011.  But this is beside the point.  The issue before us concerns the process (laid out in \xc2\xa71232(b)(2)) by which certain aliens are sent out of the country.  We are considering what that process requires.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s observation, by contrast, involves the separate issue of who is covered by that process.  Put simply, whether or not changes to other sections of the Act or to the implementing regulations enlarged the class of aliens subject to the process is irrelevant to the question of what the process is, that is, the question of what \xc2\xa71232(b)(2) provides.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we are considering text derived from earlier law understood to require a receiving country\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of any alien deported to it at step three.  The only significant textual change helps to express that understanding of the law\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, and two House Reports stated that the amending legislation was not meant to change substantive law.  Text, statutory history, and legislative history support reading the clause (vii) language, \xe2\x80\x9canother country whose government will accept the alien,\xe2\x80\x9d as providing that any \xe2\x80\x9ccountry\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned in the six preceding clauses, (i) through (vi), must also be willing to accept the alien before deportation thence may be ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I mentioned how reference to \xc2\xa71231(b)(1), governing exclusion, illuminates the choice to speak of \xe2\x80\x9canother country\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71231(b)(2).  A different cross-reference within the statute confirms the reading that all step-three choices are subject to an acceptance requirement.  Jama argues that subparagraph (D), laying out step two, contains an acceptance requirement that in most cases the Government will be able to circumvent under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of subparagraph (E)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(vi) as lacking any such requirement.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The point is well taken.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subparagraph (D) provides that if an alien is not removed to the country designated at step one, the Secretary \xe2\x80\x9cshall [at step two] remove the alien to a country of which the alien is a subject, national, or citizen unless the government of the country\xe2\x80\x9d is unwilling to accept the alien or fails to inform the Secretary within a certain time that it is willing.  \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(D).  On the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of subparagraph (E), however, anytime an alien\xe2\x80\x99s country of citizenship (the designee at step two) is the same as his country of birth (a possible designee at step three, under subparagraph (E)(iv)), the country\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to accept the alien, precluding removal at step two, will be made irrelevant as the Government goes to step three and removes to that country under subparagraph (E)(iv).  This route to circumvention will likewise be open to the Government whenever, as will almost always be the case, an alien\xe2\x80\x99s country of citizenship is also described in one of the other clauses of subparagraph (E).  If an alien, for example, resided in his country of citizenship at any time prior to his arrival in the United States (as is undoubtedly true in virtually every case), the Government could get around the acceptance requirement of subparagraph (D) by removing him at step three: under clause (i) if he came directly from his country of citizenship or clause (iii) if he came by way of another country or countries.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to deflect this objection, like its attempt to deflect the pre-1996 consensus, runs into a mistake.  As the Court inaccurately characterizes Jama\xe2\x80\x99s argument, he contends that reading a general acceptance requirement out of subparagraph (E) would permit circumvention of the acceptance requirement in \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph (A) or (D).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  The Court then goes on to answer the argument as thus restated by (correctly) pointing out that there is no unconditional acceptance requirement at every stage before step three; this is so because subparagraph (A) imposes no absolute acceptance requirement at step one.  Instead, subparagraph (C) provides that the Government \xe2\x80\x9cmay,\xe2\x80\x9d but need not, refrain from deporting an alien to his country designated at step one if that country is unwilling to accept him.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the acceptance provision governing subparagraph (A) (step one) is beside the point.  Jama\xe2\x80\x99s argument rests not on some common feature of \xe2\x80\x9csubparagraph[s] (A) [and] (D),\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, but on the text of subparagraph (D), that is, on step two alone.  He argues that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s power under that step is subject to an acceptance requirement, which the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading would allow it to skirt.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the argument that Jama actually makes about the step-two acceptance requirement, the Court says only that it \xe2\x80\x9cneed not resolve whether subparagraph (D)\xe2\x80\x9d contains such a requirement.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa07.  But that is precisely what we do need to resolve, for if step two does contain an acceptance requirement, then the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation allows the Government to evade it in nearly if not actually all cases, simply by proceeding to step three.  All the Court can muster in response to Jama\xe2\x80\x99s actual argument (an argument it ascribes to me) is the statement that \xe2\x80\x9cother [unnamed] factors suffice to refute the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s more-limited contention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government at least joins issue with Jama, when it claims step two has no acceptance requirement to evade.  The Government says that subparagraph (D) imposes the acceptance condition only on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s mandate to remove to the country of citizenship; it does not so condition the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary authority.  When acceptance is not forthcoming, the Government insists, the Secretary still has discretion to do what is merely no longer obligatory.  But for at least two reasons, this reading is unsound.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first is the textual contrast between steps one and two.  As noted, subparagraph (C) can be read to give the Government express permission to ignore at step one a country\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to accept an alien: \xe2\x80\x9cThe [Secretary] may disregard [an alien\xe2\x80\x99s] designation [of a country] if \xe2\x80\xa6 the government of the country is not willing to accept the alien \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(C).  No such express grant of discretion appears in subparagraph (D), which provides that at step two, \xe2\x80\x9cthe [Secretary] shall remove the alien to a country of [citizenship] unless the government of the country \xe2\x80\xa6 is not willing to accept the alien \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71231(b)(2)(D).  The first of these ostensibly gives authority supplemented with discretion in the event that the acceptance condition is not satisfied; the second gives authority only if the acceptance condition is satisfied.  The discretionary sounding language governing step one tends to show that Congress knew how to preserve the discretion to act in disregard of a country\xe2\x80\x99s nonacceptance; since it omitted any such provision suggesting discretion just a few lines later in subparagraph (D), the better inference is that Congress had no intent to allow the Government to ignore at step two a failure to accept by an alien\xe2\x80\x99s country of citizenship.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Once again in this case, then, drafting differences between provisions that address a similar subject may fairly be read to express differences in congressional intent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second reason to reject the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position follows from the text of the predecessor statute, which clearly provided that when acceptance was not forthcoming at step two, the Government had to move on to step three.  The relevant language of the prior version (a version that consisted of one paragraph instead of the current five subparagraphs) read:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIf the government of [the] country [of citizenship] fails finally to advise the Attorney General or the alien within three months \xe2\x80\xa6 whether that government will or will not accept such alien into its territory, then such deportation shall be directed by the Attorney General within his discretion and without necessarily giving any priority or preference because of their order as herein set forth [to one of the countries now listed in subparagraph (E)].\xe2\x80\x9d  Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, \xc2\xa7243(a), 66 Stat. 212.</p>\n<p align="left">\nUnder this statute, the Government obviously lacked the discretion it now claims, of removing an alien at step two without the consent of the country of citizenship.  This is significant for our purposes because, as already mentioned, two House Reports on the bill that transformed the old law into the new one indicate that no substantive changes were intended.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7.  Given this documented intent, together with the absence of any contrary indication in the text or legislative history, the current version should be read as its predecessor was.  See <em>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</em> v. <em>Nigh</em>, 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 11) (rejecting an asserted substantive change because of \xe2\x80\x9cscant indication\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended it).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, subparagraph (D) provides no authority to remove at step two without the consent of the country of citizenship.  Jama is consequently correct that unless all of the options at step three are read as being subject to the same consent requirement, the requirement at step two will be nullified.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the last ditch, the Court asserts that Jama\xe2\x80\x99s position would \xe2\x80\x9cabridge th[e] exercise of Executive judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9, and \xe2\x80\x9crun counter to our customary policy of deference to the President in matters of foreign affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  The Government similarly contends (throughout its brief) that Jama\xe2\x80\x99s approach would improperly limit the discretion of the Executive Branch.  <em>E.g.</em>, Brief for Respondent 13 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]onstruing Section 1232(b)(2)(E)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(vi) not to require acceptance preserves the traditional authority of the Executive Branch to make case-by-case judgments in matters involving foreign relations\xe2\x80\x9d).  But here Congress itself has significantly limited Executive discretion by establishing a detailed scheme that the Executive must follow in removing aliens.  This of course is entirely appropriate, since it is to Congress that the Constitution gives authority over aliens.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa04; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>INS</em> v. <em>Chadha</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/index.html">462 U. S. 919</a>, 940 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe plenary authority of Congress over aliens under Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa04, is not open to question\xe2\x80\x9d).  Talk of judicial deference to the Executive in matters of foreign affairs, then, obscures the nature of our task here, which is to say not how much discretion we think the Executive ought to have, but how much discretion Congress has chosen to give it.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">APPENDIX TO OPINION OF SOUTER, J.</f></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\nParagraph (1) of 8 U.

As the district court observed, \xe2\x80\x98a removable alien will almost invariably be a \xe2\x80\x9csubject, national, or citizen\xe2\x80\x9d of the country in which he was born.
