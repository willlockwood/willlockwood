It is doubtless an interesting question how far the action of the insured can affect or bind the beneficiaries in a life-insurance policy. If the answer in this case contained simply the allegation in respect to the insured\'s agreement with the company, we should be compelled to enter into an examination of that question; but it is alleged, not only that the insured and the company agreed to abandon the contract, but also that the beneficiary, his wife, and the plaintiffs, their children, \'failed, neglected, and refused\' to pay the premium. So we have a case in which, not only did the insured and the company abandon the contract, but also the beneficiaries neglected and refused to do that which was essential to keep the policy in life. The allegation in the answer does not disclose a mere omission, for it is \'neglected and refused,\' and, of course, there can be no refusal unless with knowledge of the opportunity or duty. A party cannot be said to refuse to do a thing of which he knows nothing. Refusal implies demand, knowledge, or notice. The case, therefore, is one in which the beneficiaries refused to continue the policy, while the insured and the company abandoned it. </p><p> Under those circumstances we think the case falls within the same rule as the preceding; and the judgments of the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit and of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Washington are reversed, and the case remanded to the latter court, with instructions to overrule the demurrer to defendant\'s answer. </p><p> Mr. Justice Peckham did not sit at the hearing, and took no part in the decision of this case.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
