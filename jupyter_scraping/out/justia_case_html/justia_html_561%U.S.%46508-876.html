(Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company\xe2\x80\x94were indicted for mail fraud, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71341, 1346, and other federal crimes.  At trial, the Government pursued alternative mail-fraud theories, charging that (1) Defendants stole millions from Hollinger by fraudulently paying themselves bogus \xe2\x80\x9cnoncompetition fees\xe2\x80\x9d; and (2) by failing to disclose those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger of their honest services.  Before jury deliberations began, the Government proposed special-verdict forms that would reveal, in the event that the jury voted to convict on a mail-fraud count, the particular theory or theories accounting for the verdict.  Defendants resisted, preferring an unelaborated general verdict.  The Government ultimately acquiesced.  The District Court instructed the jury on each of the alternative theories.  As to honest-services fraud, the court informed the jury, over Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 timely objection, that a person commits that offense if he misuses his position for private gain for himself and/or a co-schemer and knowingly and intentionally breaches his duty of loyalty.  The jury returned general verdicts of \xe2\x80\x9cguilty\xe2\x80\x9d on the mail-fraud counts, found that one Defendant was also guilty of obstruction of justice, and acquitted Defendants on all other charges.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the honest-services-fraud jury instructions.  Seeking reversal of their mail-fraud convictions, Defendants relied on <em>Yates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/298/index.html">354 U. S. 298</a>, 312, which held that a general verdict may be set aside \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Seventh Circuit found no infirmity in the honest-services instructions, but further determined that even if those instructions were wrong, Defendants could not prevail.  By opposing the Government-proposed special-verdict forms, the Court of Appeals declared, defendants had forfeited their objection to the instructions.  Their challenge would have become moot, the court observed, had the jury received special-verdict forms separating the alternative fraud theories, and reported on the forms that Defendants were not guilty of honest-services fraud.  Defendants, the Court of Appeals therefore reasoned, bore responsibility for the obscurity of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0In <em>Skilling</em> v. <em>United States</em>, decided today, <em>ante</em>, p. __, this Court vacated a conviction on the ground that the honest-services component of the federal mail-fraud statute, \xc2\xa71346, criminalizes only schemes to defraud that involve bribes or kickbacks.  That holding renders the honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect.  P. 5.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0By properly objecting to the honest-services jury instructions at trial, Defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions on appeal.  They did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in the Government-proposed special-verdict forms.  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not provide for submission of special questions to the jury.  In contrast, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 49 provides for jury interrogatories of two kinds:\xc2\xa0special verdicts, Rule 49(a); and general verdicts with answers to written questions, Rule 49(b).  While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts, they are informative on objections to instructions.  Criminal Rule 30(d) provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cparty who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Defendants here, it is undisputed, complied with that requirement.  The Seventh Circuit, in essence, added a further requirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to jury instructions.  It devised a forfeiture sanction unmoored to any federal statute or criminal rule.  And it placed in the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s hands authority to trigger the sanction simply by requesting a special verdict.  To boot, the appeals court applied the sanction to Defendants, although they lacked any notice that forfeiture would attend their resistance to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s special-verdict request.  Criminal Rule 57(b) is designed to ward off such judicial invention.  It provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNo sanction \xe2\x80\xa6 may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law [or] federal rules \xe2\x80\xa6 unless the alleged violator was furnished with actual notice of the requirement before the noncompliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0As in <em>Skilling,</em> the Court expresses no opinion on whether the honest-services instructional error was ultimately harmless, but leaves that matter for consideration on remand.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71341, 1346.  A similar infirmity is present in this case.  Here, too, the Government and trial court advanced an interpretation of \xc2\xa71346 rejected by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Skilling</em>.  Nevertheless, the Government urges, the convictions of the defendants below, petitioners here, should be affirmed for an independent reason.  At trial, the Government pursued alternative theories: (1) money-or-property fraud; and (2) honest-services fraud.  To pinpoint whether the jury based its verdict on money-or-property fraud, or honest-services fraud, or both, the Government proposed special interrogatories to accompany the verdict.  The defendants resisted, preferring an unelaborated general verdict, and the Government ultimately acquiesced in that standard form of submission.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held that the defendants, by opposing the Government-suggested special interrogatories, forfeited their objection to the honest-services-fraud instructions given to the jury.  530 F.\xc2\xa03d 596, 603 (CA7 2008).  We reverse that ruling.  A criminal defendant, we hold, need not request special interrogatories, nor need he acquiesce in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request for discrete findings by the jury, in order to preserve in full a timely raised objection to jury instructions on an alternative theory of guilt.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners Conrad Black, John Boultbee, and Mark Kipnis, as well as Peter Atkinson,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] (collectively, Defendants) were leading executives of Hollinger International, Inc. (Hollinger), a publicly held U. S. company that, through subsidiaries, owned newspapers here and abroad.  In 2005, the Government indicted Defendants on multiple counts, of prime concern here, three counts of mail fraud in violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71341 and 1346.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Two theories were pursued by the Government on each mail-fraud count.  The Government charged that (1) Defendants stole millions from Hollinger by fraudulently paying themselves bogus \xe2\x80\x9cnoncompetition fees\xe2\x80\x9d; and that (2) by failing to disclose their receipt of those fees, Defendants deprived Hollinger of their honest services as managers of the company.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a\xe2\x80\x9354a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the close of the four-month trial, the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois instructed the jury, discretely, on the theft-of-money-or-property and honest-services deprivation theories advanced by the Government.  <em>Id.,</em> at 235a.  As to the latter, the District Court informed the jury, over Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 objection, that a person commits honest-services fraud if he \xe2\x80\x9cmisuse[s] his position for private gain for himself and/or a co-schemer\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and intentionally breache[s] his duty of loyalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 235a\xe2\x80\x93236a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before jury deliberations began, the Government asked the District Court to employ a special-verdict form, which would reveal, in the event that the jury voted to convict on a mail-fraud count, the theory or theories accounting for the verdict\xe2\x80\x94money-or-property fraud, honest-services fraud, or both.  See App. 430a.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Defendants opposed the Government-proposed special interrogatories and urged, instead, standard general-verdict forms.  <em>Id.,</em> at 432a.  Comprehending, however, that in the event of a guilty verdict, \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury\xe2\x80\x99s specification of the [mail-]fraud theory might [aid] appellate review,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, Defendants proposed an accommodation: Upon return of a guilty verdict on any mail-fraud count, jurors could be asked to specify the theory on which they relied, <em>id.,</em> at 433a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government objected to special interrogatories presented to the jury postverdict, App. to Pet. for Cert. 222a, and the District Court declined to adopt that procedure, <em>id.,</em> at 225a.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  When the court rejected postverdict interrogatories, the Government represented that it would not object to submission of the mail-fraud counts for jury decision by general verdict.  <em>Id.,</em> at 228a.  The jury returned general verdicts of \xe2\x80\x9cguilty\xe2\x80\x9d on the three mail-fraud counts;[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] it also found defendant Black guilty of obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512(c)(1), and it acquitted Defendants on all other charges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Defendants urged the invalidity of the jury instructions on honest-services fraud.  Under the rule declared by this Court in <em>Yates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/298/index.html">354 U. S. 298</a>, 312 (1957), a general verdict may be set aside \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.\xe2\x80\x9d  Relying on that rule, Defendants urged reversal of their mail-fraud convictions.  The Court of Appeals found no infirmity in the honest-services instructions, 530 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 600\xe2\x80\x93602, but further determined that Defendants could not prevail even if those instructions were wrong, <em>id.,</em> at 602\xe2\x80\x93603.  For this determination, the court homed in on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s special-verdict proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The challenge to the honest-services instructions would have become moot, the court observed, had the jury received special-verdict forms separating money-or-property fraud from honest-services fraud, and reported on the forms that Defendants were not guilty of honest-services fraud.  Defendants, the Court of Appeals reasoned, bore responsibility for the obscurity of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.  True, the court acknowledged, it was not incumbent on Defendants to request special verdicts.  But by resisting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for separate findings on money-or-property fraud and on honest-services fraud, and requesting general verdicts instead, the Seventh Circuit concluded, Defendants had \xe2\x80\x9cforfeited their objection to the [honest-services] instruction[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 603.  Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion of postverdict interrogatories did not, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, overcome the forfeiture, for \xe2\x80\x9c[q]uestioning the jurors after they have handed down their verdict is not a good procedure and certainly not one that a district judge is <em>required </em>to employ.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari in this case, 556 U.

See <em>ante</em>, p. __.  That holding renders the honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and brings squarely before us the question presented by the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s forfeiture ruling: Did Defendants, by failing to acquiesce in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request for special verdicts, forfeit their objection, timely made at trial, to the honest-services instructions?</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addressing this issue, we note first the absence of any provision in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for submission of special questions to the jury.  See <em>Stein</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/156/index.html">346 U. S. 156</a>, 178 (1953) (\xe2\x80\x9cOur own Rules of Criminal Procedure make no provision for anything but a general verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d), overruled on other grounds, <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Denno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/368/index.html">378 U. S. 368</a> (1964).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The sole call for special findings in the Criminal Rules concerns nonjury trials.  Rule 23(c) provides: \xe2\x80\x9cIf a party [in a case tried without a jury] requests before the finding of guilty or not guilty, the court must state its specific findings of fact in open court or in a written decision or opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide for jury interrogatories of two kinds: special verdicts, which instruct the jury to return \xe2\x80\x9ca special written finding on each issue of fact,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 49(a); and general verdicts with answers to \xe2\x80\x9cwritten questions on one or more issues of fact,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 49(b).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Although not dispositive,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] the absence of a Criminal Rule authorizing special verdicts counsels caution.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Criminal Rules are silent on special verdicts, they are informative on objections to instructions.

Rule Crim. Proc. 30(d), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 915.  The Rule provides: \xe2\x80\x9cA party who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Defendants here, it is undisputed, complied with that requirement.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, in essence, added a further requirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to jury instructions.  It devised a forfeiture sanction unmoored to any federal statute or criminal rule.  And it placed in the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s hands authority to trigger the sanction simply by requesting a special verdict.  See 530 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 603.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  To boot, the Court of Appeals applied the sanction to Defendants, although they lacked any notice that forfeiture would attend their resistance to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s special-verdict request.  There is a Rule designed to ward off judicial invention of the kind present here.  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b) admonishes: \xe2\x80\x9cNo sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law [or] federal rules \xe2\x80\xa6 unless the alleged violator was furnished with actual notice of the requirement before the noncompliance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold, in short, that, by properly objecting to the honest-services jury instructions at trial, Defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions on appeal.  They did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in the Government-proposed special-verdict forms.  Our decision in <em>Skilling</em> makes it plain that the honest-services instructions in this case were indeed incorrect.  As in <em>Skilling</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9341, we express no opinion on the question whether the error was ultimately harmless, but leave that matter for consideration on\nremand.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Peter Atkinson is a respondent in support of petitioners who qualifies for relief under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 12.6.

First, I do not join in its reliance, <em>ante</em>, at 7, on the Notes of the Advisory Committee in determining the meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(d).  The Committee\xe2\x80\x99s view is not authoritative.  See <em>Krupski</em> v. <em>Costa Crociere S.\xc2\xa0p. A.</em>, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  The Court accurately quotes the text of the Rule, see <em>ante</em>, at 7, the meaning of which is obvious.  No more should be said.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, I agree with the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 5, 8, that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s honest-services-fraud instructions to the jury were erroneous, but for a quite different reason.  In my view, the error lay not in instructing inconsistently with the theory of honest-services fraud set forth in <em>Skilling</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <em>ante</em>, p. ___, but in instructing the jury on honest-services fraud <em>at all.</em>  For the reasons set forth in my opinion in that case, 18 U.
