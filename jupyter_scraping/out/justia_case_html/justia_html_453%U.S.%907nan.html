The Rule\'s import is that absent exceptional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="909">Page 453 U.S. 907 , 909</a></p><p> circumstances, an attorney suspended by a state will be disbarred by this Court. </p><p> The policy expressed in Rule 8 is consistent with the role this Court should play in monitoring professional misconduct. In light of the inadequacies that pervade this country\'s attorney discipline systems,* membership in the Bar of the country\'s highest Court should remain a privilege and a responsibility. Thus to be admitted to this Court\'s Bar, an applicant must show not only that he has been admitted to the practice of law for three years, but also that he "appears . . . to be of good moral and professional character." This Court\'s Rule 5.1. </p><p> Strickland, having admittedly violated his oath and having been suspended from the practice of law for five years, seeks to remain a member of this Bar simply because his suspension has run its course and he has been reinstated to the practice of law in New Jersey. In my opinion, a 5-year suspension is a per se basis for disbarment by this Court. With deference to the Supreme Court of New Jersey\'s decisions, this Court is not, and must never be, bound by a state court\'s decision as it relates to our decision based on a record such as we find in this case. A state court, when disciplining an attorney, deals directly with the attorney\'s livelihood. Membership in this Court\'s Bar is not shown to be critical to Strickland\'s livelihood except as he may seek to use it as "evidence" that his misconduct somehow has been excused by this Court or that he has been " vindicated" by this Court. The quality of this Court\'s Bar and the public\'s confidence in the Bar is compromised by the retention, as well as the admission, of attorneys found guilty of unethical professional conduct. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="910">Page 453 U.S. 907 , 910</a></p><p> Retention of Strickland as a member of this Court\'s Bar reflects unfairly on all attorneys who are members in good standing. The procedural novelty of the New Jersey disciplinary proceedings should not excuse Strickland from proving that he is worthy of admission to this Court\'s Bar, which on this record he has not demonstrated. </p><p> The hard fact remains that when Strickland last practiced law in New Jersey, he violated his oath of office by embezzling clients\' funds; accordingly, he should be stricken from the rolls of this Court. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] See the Report of the American Bar Association Special Committee on Evaluation of Disciplinary Enforcement, entitled Problems and Recommendations in Disciplinary Enforcement (1970, chaired by Justice Tom C.
