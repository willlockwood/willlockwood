But Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) provides an exception, permitting \xe2\x80\x9c[a] plain error that affects substantial rights [to] be considered even though it was not brought to the [trial] court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, the District Court increased the length of petitioner Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s sentence so he could participate in a prison drug rehabilitation program.  Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel did not object to the sentence, but, on appeal, Henderson claimed that the District Court plainly erred in increasing his sentence solely for rehabilitative purposes.  While the appeal was pending, this Court decided in Tapia v. United States, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, that it is error for a court to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  While this meant that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was erroneous, the Fifth Circuit determined that Rule 52(b) did not give it authority to correct the error.  In doing so, it concluded that an error is \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d under the Rule only if it was clear under current law at the time of trial, but that, in this case, Circuit law was unsettled until Tapia was decided.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Regardless of whether a legal question was settled or unsettled at the time of trial, an error is \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of Rule 52(b) so long as the error was plain at the time of appellate review.

The principle that a right may be forfeited in a case if it is not timely asserted before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it favors limiting the assessment of plainness to the time of the error\xe2\x80\x99s commission.  See Olano, supra, at 731.  And the rule that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision favors assessing plainness at the time of review.  See Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, \n\n393 U.\xc2\xa0S. 268\n.  Because neither principle is absolute, the conflict cannot be decided by looking to one rather than the other.  The text of Rule 52(b) also leaves open the temporal question.  And relevant precedent does not directly answer the question.  In Olano, this Court said that Rule 52(b) authorizes an appeals court to correct a forfeited error only if (1) there is an \xe2\x80\x9cerror,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) that is \xe2\x80\x9cplain,\xe2\x80\x9d (3) that \xe2\x80\x9caffect[s] substantial rights,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 732\n, and (4) that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 736.  In Johnson v. United States, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461\n, the Court concluded that, where a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was clearly correct under circuit law when made but becomes \xe2\x80\x9cclearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal[,] it is enough that an error be \xe2\x80\x98plain\xe2\x80\x99 at the time of appellate consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  However, neither case addressed what rule should apply where the law is unsettled at the time of the error but plain at the time of review.  507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 734, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S, at 467\xe2\x88\x92468.  Pp. 3\xe2\x88\x926.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0This precedent, when read in light of the underlying background principles, leads to the conclusion that Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d phrase applies at the time of review.  If \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d covers trial court decisions that were plainly correct when made and those that were plainly incorrect when made, it should cover cases in the middle\xe2\x80\x95i.e., where the law was neither clearly correct nor incorrect, but unsettled, at the time of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  To hold to the contrary would lead to unjustifiably different treatment of similarly situated individuals, for there is no practical reason to treat a defendant more harshly simply because his circuit\xe2\x80\x99s law was unclear at the time of trial.  Even if a \xe2\x80\x9ctime of error\xe2\x80\x9d rule would provide an added incentive to counsel to call a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the matter so the judge could quickly consider remedial action, such incentive has little, if any, practical importance since counsel normally has good reasons for calling a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s attention to potential error, e.g., the advantage to counsel and client of having an error speedily corrected.  In sum, in contrast to a \xe2\x80\x9ctime of error\xe2\x80\x9d rule, a \xe2\x80\x9ctime of review\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation furthers the basic principle that \xe2\x80\x9can appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,\xe2\x80\x9d Thorpe, supra, at 281; works little, if any, practical harm upon the competing administrative principle that insists that counsel call a potential error to the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s attention; and is consistent with Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose of creating a fairness-based exception to the general requirement that an objection be made at trial to preserve a claim of error.  Pp. 6\xe2\x88\x929.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  Its claim that appellate courts should consider only errors that counsel called to the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s attention and errors that the court should have independently recognized overlooks the way in which Rule 52(b) restricts the appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to correct an error to those errors that would, in fact, seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  The Government also fears that the holding here will lead to too many \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d claims.  But, a new rule of law set by an appellate court cannot automatically lead that court to consider all contrary determinations by trial courts plainly erroneous, given that lower court decisions that are questionable but not plainly wrong fall outside the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s scope, and given that any error must have affected the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights and affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  Finally, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s textual argument that Rule 52(b) is written mostly in the past tense, whatever its merits, is foreclosed by Johnson.

But Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), creating an exception to the normal rule, says that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the [trial] court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The Rule does not say explicitly, however, as of just what time the error must be \xe2\x80\x9cplain.\xe2\x80\x9d  Must the lower court ruling be plainly erroneous as of the time the lower court made the error?  Or can an error still count as \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d if the erroneous nature of that ruling is not \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d until the time of appellate review?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe case before us concerns a District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on a substantive legal question that was unsettled at the time the trial court acted, thus foreclosing the possibility that any error could have been \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d then.  Before the case was final and at the time of direct appellate review, however, the question had become settled in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s favor, making the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but not until that later time.

The District Judge accepted the plea and, in June 2010, he sentenced Henderson to an above-Guidelines prison term of 60 months.  Ibid.  The judge entered the longer sentence to \xe2\x80\x9ctry to help\xe2\x80\x9d Henderson by qualifying him for an in-prison drug rehabilitation program, a program that would provide \xe2\x80\x9cthe treatment and the counse[l]ing that this defendant needs right now.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a, 40a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHenderson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel did not object.  Indeed, the judge asked counsel if there was \xe2\x80\x9cany reason why that sentence as stated should not be imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 41a.  And counsel replied, \xe2\x80\x9cProcedurally, no.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Subsequently, Henderson appealed, claiming, among other things, that the District Court had \xe2\x80\x9cplain[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d erred in sentencing him to an above-Guidelines prison term solely for rehabilitative purposes.  646 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 224.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2011, after Henderson was sentenced but before Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was heard, this Court decided Tapia v. United States, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.  There, we held that it is error for a court to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Given Tapia, Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was unlawful, and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose that sentence was erroneous.  But, since Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had not objected in the trial court, the Court of Appeals could not correct the error unless Rule 52(b) applied.  The Rule, however, applies only if the error was \xe2\x80\x9cplain.\xe2\x80\x9d  The error was not plain before Tapia; it was plain after Tapia.  Thus, the Fifth Circuit had to determine the temporal scope of Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cplain error.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe appeals court decided that Rule 52(b) did not give it the authority to correct the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error.  646 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 225.  The appellate panel pointed out that, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]efore Tapia, there was a circuit split on whether a District Court can consider a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitative needs to lengthen a sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The panel added that the Fifth Circuit had \xe2\x80\x9cnot pronounced on the question\xe2\x80\x9d before Henderson was sentenced.  Ibid.  Thus, at the time when the District Court reached its decision, the law in that Circuit was unsettled.  The Court of Appeals concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cHenderson cannot show that the error in his case was plain, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because an error is plain only if it was clear under current law at the time of trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

The question reflects a conflict between two important, here competing, legal principles.  On the one hand, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[n]o procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right,\xe2\x80\x99 or a right of any other sort, \xe2\x80\x98may be for- feited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal hav- ing jurisdiction to determine it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Olano, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 731 (quoting Yakus v.

Even where a new rule of law is at issue, Rule 52(b) does not give a court of appeals authority to overlook a failure to object unless an error not only \xe2\x80\x9caffect[s] substantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Olano, supra, at 732 (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original).

We there considered a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that was clearly correct under Circuit law when made but which, by the time of review, had become plainly erroneous due to an intervening authoritative legal decision.  We concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal[,] it is enough that an error be \xe2\x80\x98plain\xe2\x80\x99 at the time of appellate consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 468.  As in Olano, however, we declined to decide whether that same rule should apply where the law is unsettled at the time of error but plain at the time of review.  520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 467\xe2\x80\x93468.

Given Johnson, a \xe2\x80\x9ctime of error\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation would prove highly, and unfairly, anomalous.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider the lay of the post-Johnson legal land: No one doubts that an (un-objected to) error by a trial judge will ordinarily fall within Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s word \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d as long as the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was plainly incorrect at the time it was made.  E.g., Olano, supra, at 734.  That much is common ground.  Johnson then adds that, at least in one circumstance, an (un-objected to) error by a trial judge will also fall within Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s word \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d even if the judge was not plainly incorrect at the time it was made.  That is the circumstance where an error is \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d even if the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision was plainly correct at the time when it was made but subsequently becomes incorrect based on a change in law.  520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 468.  And, since by definition the trial judge did not commit plain error at the time of the ruling, Johnson explicitly rejects applying the words \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d as of the time when the trial judge acted.  Instead, Johnson deems it \xe2\x80\x9cenough that an error be \xe2\x80\x98plain\xe2\x80\x99 at the time of appellate consideration\xe2\x80\x9d for that error to fall within Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s category of \xe2\x80\x9cplain error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut if the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d cover both (1) trial court decisions that were plainly correct at the time when the judge made the decision and (2) trial court decisions that were plainly incorrect at the time when the judge made the decision, then why should they not also cover (3)\xc2\xa0cases in the middle\xe2\x80\x94i.e., where the law at the time of the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision was neither clearly correct nor incorrect, but unsettled?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo hold to the contrary would bring about unjustifi- ably different treatment of similarly situated individuals.  Imagine three virtually identical defendants, each from a different circuit, each sentenced in January to identical long prison terms, and each given those long sentences for the same reason, namely to obtain rehabilitative treatment.  Imagine that none of them raises an objection.  In June, the Supreme Court holds this form of sentencing unlawful.  And, in December, each of the three different circuits considers the claim that the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s January-imposed prison term constituted a legal error.  Imagine further that in the first circuit the law in January made the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision clearly lawful as of the time when the judge made it; in the second circuit, the law in January made the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision clearly unlawful as of the time when the judge made it; and in the third circuit, the law in January was unsettled.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo apply Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d as of the time of appellate review would treat all three defendants alike.  It would permit all three to go on to argue to the appellate court that the trial court error affected their \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Olano, supra, at 732 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To interpret \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d differently, however, would treat these three virtually identical defendants differently, allowing only the first two defendants, but not the third defendant, po- tentially to qualify for Rule 52(b) relief.  All three defen- dants suffered from legal error; all three failed to object; and all three would benefit from the new legal interpre- tation.  What reason is there to give two of these three defendants the benefits of a new rule of law, but not the third?  Cf. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch, at 110.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is no practical ground for making this distinction. To the contrary, to distinguish and treat more harshly cases where a circuit\xe2\x80\x99s law was unclear would simply promote arguments about whether the law of the circuit initially was unclear (rather than clearly settled one way or the other).  And these arguments are likely to be particularly difficult to resolve where what is at issue is a matter of legal degree, not kind.  To what extent, for example, did a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument go too far down the road of prejudice?  A \xe2\x80\x9ctime of error\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation also would require courts of appeals to play a kind of temporal ping-pong, looking at the law that now is to decide whether \xe2\x80\x9cerror\xe2\x80\x9d exists, looking at the law that then was to decide whether the error was \xe2\x80\x9cplain,\xe2\x80\x9d and looking at the circumstances that now are to decide whether the defendant has satisfied Olano\xe2\x80\x99s third and fourth criteria.  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9ctime of error\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation would make the appellate process yet more complex and time consuming.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe recognize, as the Solicitor General points out, that a \xe2\x80\x9ctime of error\xe2\x80\x9d rule, even if confined to instances in which the law is uncertain, would in such cases provide an added incentive to counsel to call the lower court judge\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the matter at a time when that judge could quickly take remedial action.  And, even if no remedy is offered, the lower court judge\xe2\x80\x99s analysis may help the court of appeals to decide the legal question.  See Brief for United States 30\xe2\x80\x9332.  See also Mouling, 557 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 664.  We disagree with the Solicitor General, however, in that we also believe that, in the present context, any added incentive has little, if any, practical importance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is because counsel normally has other good reasons for calling a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s attention to potential error\xe2\x80\x94for example, it is normally to the advantage of counsel and his client to get the error speedily corrected.  And, even where that is not so, counsel cannot rely upon the \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d rule to make up for a failure to object at trial.  After all, that rule will help only if (1) the law changes in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s favor, (2)\xc2\xa0the change comes after trial but before the appeal is decided, (3) the error affected the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial rights,\xe2\x80\x9d and (4) the error \xe2\x80\x9cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial pro- ceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Olano, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 732 (internal quotation marks omitted).  If there is a lawyer who would deliberately forgo objection now because he perceives some slightly expanded chance to argue for \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d later, we suspect that, like the unicorn, he finds his home in the imagination, not the courtroom.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe upshot is that a \xe2\x80\x9ctime of review\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation furthers the basic Schooner Peggy principle that \xe2\x80\x9can appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thorpe, 393 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 281.  It works little, if any, practical harm upon the competing administrative principle that insists that counsel call a potential error to the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.  And, it is consistent with the basic purpose of Rule 52(b), namely the creation of a fairness-based exception to the general requirement that an objection be made at trial.  See supra, at 4.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time, the competing \xe2\x80\x9ctime of error\xe2\x80\x9d rule is out of step with our precedents, creates unfair and anomalous results, and works practical administrative harm.  Thus, in the direct appeals of cases that are not yet final, we consider the \xe2\x80\x9ctime of review\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation the better reading of Rule 52\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cplain error.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Solicitor General makes several other important arguments, but they fail to lead us to a different conclusion.  First, the Government argues that the purpose of plain-error review is to ensure \xe2\x80\x9cthe integrity of the [trial] proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  In turn, the argument goes, appellate courts should consider only (1)\xc2\xa0errors that counsel called to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention and (2)\xc2\xa0errors that the trial court should have known about regardless, namely those that then were plain.  Expanding on this theme, one Court of Appeals described plain error as \xe2\x80\x9cerror that is so clear-cut, so obvious, a competent district judge should be able to avoid it without benefit of objection.  When the state of the law is unclear at trial and only becomes clear as a result of later authority, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s error is perforce not plain; we expect district judges to be knowledgeable, not clairvoyant.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Turman, 122 F.\xc2\xa03d 1167, 1170 (CA9 1997) (citation omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis approach, however, overlooks the way in which the plain-error rule\xe2\x80\x94Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x94restricts the appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to correct an error to those errors that would, in fact, seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  Cf. United States v. Farrell, 672 F.\xc2\xa03d 27, 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (CA1 2012) (considering the issue from this perspective).  And the approach runs headlong into Johnson.  The error in Johnson was not an error that the District Court should have known about at the time.  It was the very opposite: The District Judge should have known that his ruling (at the time he made it) was not error; and perhaps not even clairvoyance could have led him to hold to the contrary.  Cf. Khan v. State Oil Co., 93 F.\xc2\xa03d 1358, 1362\xe2\x80\x931364 (CA7 1996) (registering disagreement with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent while following it nonetheless); State Oil Co. v.

It has broader purposes, including in part allowing courts of appeals better to identify those instances in which the application of a new rule of law to cases on appeal will meet the demands of fairness and judicial integrity.  See Johnson, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 467\xe2\x80\x93468; Olano, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 732.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Government fears that our holding will lead to too many claims of \xe2\x80\x9cplain error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 26\xe2\x80\x9328.  After all, courts of appeals, not just the Supreme Court, clarify the law through their opinions.  When a court of appeals does so, will not all defendants, including many who never objected in the court below, insist that the court of appeals now judge their cases according to the new rule?  And will \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d in such cases not then disappear, leaving only simple \xe2\x80\x9cerror\xe2\x80\x9d in its stead?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe answer to this claim is that a new rule of law, set forth by an appellate court, cannot automatically lead that court to consider all contrary determinations by trial courts plainly erroneous.  Many such new rules, as we have pointed out, concern matters of degree, not kind.  And a lower court ruling about such matters (say, the nature of a closing argument), even if now wrong (in light of the new appellate holding), is not necessarily plainly wrong.  The Rule\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that an error be \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d means that lower court decisions that are questionable but not plainly wrong (at time of trial or at time of appeal) fall outside the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s scope.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd there are other reasons for concluding that our holding will not open any \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d floodgates.  As we have said, the Rule itself contains other screening criteria.  The error must have affected the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights and it must have seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  Olano, supra, at 732.  When courts apply these latter criteria, the fact that a defendant did not object, despite unsettled law, may well count against the grant of Rule 52(b) relief.  Moreover, the problem here arises only when there is a new rule of law, when the law was previously unsettled, and when the District Court reached a decision contrary to the subsequent rule.  These limitations may well explain the absence of any account before us of \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d inundation in those Circuits that already follow the interpretation we now adopt.  See, e.g., Farrell, supra, at 36\xe2\x80\x9337; Cordery, 656 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1107; United States v. Garcia, 587 F.\xc2\xa03d 509, 519\xe2\x80\x93520 (CA2 2009); United States v.

And second, our task in this case is not the exalted philosophical one of deciding where justice lies.  It is presumed (rightly or not) that Congress has taken that into consideration in approving the Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Ours, alas, is the more mundane and lawyerly task of deciding whether the Rules of Criminal Procedure make the failure of timely objection an exception to the rule that an appellate court applies the law in effect at the time of its judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHaving addressed itself to the wrong question, the Court unsurprisingly gives the wrong answer.  The correct answer must be sought in the text of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, beginning with Rule 51(b), which provides: \xe2\x80\x9cA party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court\xe2\x80\x94when the court ruling or order is made or sought\xe2\x80\x94of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party\xe2\x80\x99s objection to the court\xe2\x80\x99s action and the grounds for that objection.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added).  Surely this means that a party does not preserve a claim of error\xe2\x80\x94cannot assert that on appeal, whatever the law on the point may be\xe2\x80\x94unless he informs the court or objects to the court\xe2\x80\x99s action when the ruling or order is made or sought.  If it does not mean that, it means nothing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe move then to Rule 52(b), which says: \xe2\x80\x9cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the [trial] court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xe2\x80\x9d The meaning of that is not difficult to grasp.  It is an exception to Rule 51(b)\xe2\x80\x99s rule of forfeiture\xe2\x80\x94an exception that applies only to \xe2\x80\x9cplain error.\xe2\x80\x9d  The question before us is whether plainness means plainness at the time \xe2\x80\x9cthe [trial] court ruling or order is made or sought\xe2\x80\x9d or plainness when the case reaches the Court of Appeals.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe answer to that question seems to me entirely clear.  A rudimentary principle of textual interpretation\xe2\x80\x94so commonsensical that it scarcely needs citation\xe2\x80\x94is that if one interpretation of an ambiguous provision causes it to serve a purpose consistent with the entire text, and the other interpretation renders it pointless, the former prevails.  Limiting review of forfeited errors to those that were \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d when the objection should have been made serves a purpose consistent with Rule 51: It permits reviewing courts to correct error where doing so will not thwart the objective of causing objections to be made when they can do some good.  Objection is not so much needed when the error ought to be plain to the court and to the prosecution.   And the fault in overlooking such an error is not solely the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s, but must be shared equally by the court and the prosecutor.  We have affirmed this principle, and have affirmed the proposition that plainness is to be determined at the trial stage, in our prior opinions.  \xe2\x80\x9cBy its terms, recourse may be had to [Rule 52(b)] only on appeal from a trial infected with error so \xe2\x80\x98plain\xe2\x80\x99 the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s timely assistance in detecting it.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Frady, \n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 152, \n163 (1982)\n.  Where error at trial is plain, the rationale for penalizing forfeiture is at its weakest and the injustice to the defendant correspondingly strong.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court, on the other hand, is unable to provide any purpose served by a plainness requirement applied when the case reaches the Court of Appeals.  Consider two de- fendants in the same circuit who fail to object to an identical error committed by the trial court under unsettled law.  By happenstance, Defendant A\xe2\x80\x99s appeal is considered first.  The court of appeals recognizes that there was error, but denies relief because the law was unclear up to the time of the court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion.  Defendant B\xe2\x80\x99s appeal is heard later, and he reaps the benefit of the opinion in Defendant A\xe2\x80\x99s case settling the law in his favor.  What possible purpose is served by distinguishing between these two appellants?  \xe2\x80\x9cThe negligence in not raising the error is equivalent regardless of what happens by the time of appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Escalante-Reyes, 689 F.\xc2\xa03d 415, 429 (CA5 2012) (en banc) (Smith, J., dissenting).  Since a plain-error doctrine of this sort cannot possibly induce counsel to make contemporaneous objection, it seemingly has no purpose whatever except to create the above described anomaly.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNo, that is not quite true.  It does serve the purpose of enabling today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to say that the plain-error rule has been \xe2\x80\x9cpreserved,\xe2\x80\x9d and has not been entirely converted to a simple-error rule.   Of course a simple-error rule\xe2\x80\x94all trial-court mistakes affecting substantial rights can be corrected on appeal\xe2\x80\x94would better serve the Court\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken understanding that the only purpose of Rule 52(b) is fairness, ante, at 9,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t combined with its erroneous perception that all defendants who fail to make a timely objection to misapplication of the law stand in the same boat, see ante, at 7.  But a simple-error rule would be contrary to the clear text of Rule 52(b), which tempers Rule 51(b) with \xe2\x80\x9cfairness\xe2\x80\x9d only when the error is plain. The Court must find some application for the plainness requirement, even if it be one that is utterly pointless.  It has done so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court contends that evaluating plainness at the trial-court level \xe2\x80\x9cruns headlong into Johnson [v. United States, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461 (1997)\n].\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  The error there, it points out, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not an error that the District Court should have known about at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Johnson would have been decided the same way at whatever stage the plainness requirement was evaluated, since the Court found that the error did \xe2\x80\x9cnot meet the final requirement of Olano,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe forfeited error \xe2\x80\x98seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 469.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  I accept, how- ever, that the Court said in Johnson, and will presumably hold in future cases, that in the situation presented by that case, plainness at the time of appeal will suffice.  That was a situation in which the law was settled against the defendant at trial but became plain in his favor by the time of appeal.  As to that narrow class of cases, a time-of-appeal rule promotes both the fairness and efficiency concerns of Rule 51(b).  When the law is settled against a defendant at trial he is not remiss for failing to bring his claim of error to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.  It would be futile.  An objection would therefore disserve efficiency, and a time-of-trial rule \xe2\x80\x9cwould result in counsel\xe2\x80\x99s inevitably making a long and virtually useless laundry list of objections to rulings that were plainly supported by existing precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 468.  In that unique context, a time-of-appeal approach actually \xe2\x80\x9cfurthers the substantial interest in the orderly administration of justice that underlies the contemporaneous objection rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. David, 83 F.\xc2\xa03d 638, 644 (CA4 1996).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court wrote in Johnson a circumspect opinion that took pains to exclude from the time-of-appeal method it articulated the case before us now.  After agreeing with the petitioner that in the situation before the Court a time-of-trial rule would impede rather than assist fairness and efficiency, the opinion said that \xe2\x80\x9cin a case such as this\xe2\x80\x94where the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\xe2\x80\x94it is enough that an error be \xe2\x80\x98plain\xe2\x80\x99 at the time of appellate consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 468.  The limitation of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is clear.  The concerns that justified evaluating plainness at the time of appeal in Johnson cut against such a rule here, where the law was not clear but uncertain at the time of trial.  In the difficult and often hectic process of conducting a trial, a judge depends on the parties\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cofficers of the court\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to flag less-than-obvious issues that might otherwise escape his notice.  A prompt claim of error in those circumstances is not futile but eminently useful.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court hypothesizes three defendants failing to object at trial to a ruling that later (before the case reaches the court of appeals) is shown by a Supreme Court opinion to have been error: one tried in a circuit whose law at the time clearly accorded with the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, one tried in a circuit whose law clearly contradicted that holding, and one tried in a circuit whose law on the point was uncertain.  Ante, at 7.  These defendants, the Court asserts, are \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated,\xe2\x80\x9d and the plain-error-at-time-of-appeal rule appropriately treats them alike.  But they are not \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as the purposes of Rules 51(b) and 52(b) are concerned, and treating them alike frustrates those purposes.  Where the circuit law clearly accorded with the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s later opinion, the trial court should have known that law, and hence the raising of the point by counsel should not have been needed; this is the classic case for plain-error reversal on appeal.  Where the circuit law clearly contradicted the later Supreme Court opinion, again the trial court should have known that law, and counsel\xe2\x80\x99s raising the point would be futile and wasteful rather than sparing of judicial resources; this is the classic case for Johnson reversal on appeal.  Where the circuit law was unsettled, the trial court was most in need of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, and the failure to provide it has no excuse; this is the clas- sic case for normal application of the contemporaneous-objection requirement of Rule 51(b).  To be sure, these litigants are alike in that all three \xe2\x80\x9csuffered from legal error,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 8; and if the sole, unqualified objective of appellate review were to correct trial-court error that would suffice to entitle them to equal treatment.  Until today, however, the objective of correcting trial-court error has been qualified by the objective of inducing counsel to bring forward claims of error when they can be remedied without overturning a verdict and setting the convicted criminal defendant free.  To overlook counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to object, spend judicial resources to conduct plain-error review, and set aside a criminal conviction where retrial may be difficult if not impossible, is exactly the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98extravagant protection\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that this Court has up until now disavowed.  United States v. Young, \n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n16 (1985)\n (quoting Henderson v. Kibbe, \n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 145\n, n.\xc2\xa012 (1977), in turn quoting Namet v. United States, \n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 179, \n190 (1963)\n).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court sees no harm in its evisceration of the contemporaneous-objection rule, disbelieving that a lawyer would \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately forgo objection now because he perceives some slightly expanded chance to argue for \xe2\x80\x98plain error\xe2\x80\x99 later,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9.  It is hard to say whether this conclusion springs from a touching faith in the good sportsmanship of criminal defense counsel or an unkind disparagement of their intelligence.  Where a criminal case always has been, or has at trial been shown to be, a sure loser with the jury, it makes entire sense to stand silent while the court makes a mistake that may be the basis for undoing the conviction.  The happy-happy thought that counsel will not \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately forgo objection\xe2\x80\x9d is not a delusion that this Court has hitherto indulged, worrying as it has (in an opinion joined by the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion) about counsel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sandbagging the court\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cremaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising the error only if the case does not conclude in his favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Puckett v. United States, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129, \n134 (2009)\n.  In any event, sandbagging is not the only evil to be feared.  What is to be feared even more is a lessening of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s diligent efforts to identify uncertain points of law and bring them (or rather the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s version of them) to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention, so that error will never occur.  It is remarkably na\xc3\xafve to disbelieve the proposition that lessening the costs of noncompliance with Rule 51(b) diminishes the incentives to be diligent in objecting.  See Meltzer, State Court Forfeitures of Federal Rights, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1128, 1135 (1986).  Meant to apply only in \xe2\x80\x9cex- ceptional circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. Atkinson, \n\n297 U.\xc2\xa0S. 157, \n160 (1936)\n, Rule 52(b) today has been transformed into an end-run around the consequences of claim forfeiture.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s final argument, that a time-of-error rule would \xe2\x80\x9cwor[k] practical administrative harm,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9, is even more peculiar than the rest of its opinion.  Whatever administrative ease may flow from a time-of-appeal rule (and more on that in a moment) it is outweighed by \xe2\x80\x9clower[ing] the bar for plain-error review, which will undoubtedly result in more remands and new trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  Escalante-Reyes, 689 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 431 (Smith, J., dissenting).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s Pollyannaish rejoinder is that few reversals will occur anyway because a defendant must still show that the error affected his substantial rights (Olano prong 3) and seriously affected the fairness of judicial proceedings (Olano prong 4), ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  I doubt that.  Many hitherto forfeited claims may incorrectly be found to meet those vague requirements.  And all claims\xe2\x80\x94whether found to meet them or not\xe2\x80\x94will have to be evaluated under those vague standards, requiring intensive consideration and producing a judgment whose correctness is often difficult to assess.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s belief that it is difficult to assess whether error was plain at the time of trial: it is really not that hard.  Appellate courts regularly conduct that type of inquiry in other areas of law.  For example, in the context of federal habeas corpus review under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) relief may not be granted to a state prisoner based on a legal error unless that error was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the time the state court render[ed] its decision,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10).  Similarly, we determine whether public officials have immunity based on what law was clearly established at the time of their acts.  See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, \n\n457 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800\n\xe2\x80\x93819 (1982).  The Court offers us no reason to believe the inquiry would be any more difficult in this context.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, a time-of-appeal rule for assessing plainness does not eliminate the need to assess plainness.  And contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s belief, that need will not arise only \xe2\x80\x9cwhen there is a new rule of law, when the law was previously unsettled, and when the District Court reached a decision contrary to the subsequent rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12 (emphasis added).  That easy situation, which exists in the present case, may well be the exception rather than the rule for claims that failure to object to plain error should be excused.  For a trial-court error is plain not only when it becomes so in retrospect, after the law has subsequently been clarified; but also when the court disregards the pre-existing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clarity of a statutory provision or court rule.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Perry, 479 F.\xc2\xa03d 885, 893, n.\xc2\xa08 (CADC 2007).  This Court recognized as much in United States v. Olano, \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 725 (1993)\n, where the Government \xe2\x80\x9cessentially concede[d],\xe2\x80\x9d and this Court accepted, that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c) was plainly erroneous, even though the appellate court had yet to say so, because the text of the rule was so clear.  Id., at 737.  For that and other reasons, the question whether the law was \xe2\x80\x9cunsettled\xe2\x80\x9d will often not admit of an easy answer, and our Courts of Appeals will have to resolve lots of claims that it was not.  The practical difficulties the Court professes to avoid will not be avoided.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday\xe2\x80\x99s opinion converts the \xe2\x80\x9cplain error\xe2\x80\x9d limitation of Rule 52(b), a limitation designed to induce trial objections that will assist the court, into a limitation designed to serve no conceivable purpose at all.  Fair trial will suffer from the ensuing disregard of the now unenforceable contemporaneous-objection rule.

It asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plain-error rule\xe2\x80\x94Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x94restricts the appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to correct an error to those errors that would, in fact, seriously affect the fairness, integ-rity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.
