It appeared that the defendant had paid the principal and all the interest, except for seven years and a half, which he now contended ought to be deducted, as the plaintiffs were British subjects, and not resident within the American lines during the war. The defendant\'s counsel insisted, that the point had been fully settled in the case of Osborn versus Mifflin\'s Executors; and also, in that of Hoare versus Allen.* But the plaintiff\'s counsel endeavoured to distinguish this case, by proving that the parties had an intercourse: That Galloway was with the enemy while they were in Philadelphia, and that Naglee the defendant, then lived within three miles of the city; and might have come in and gone out at pleasure. They cited the case of the Executors of Mease versus Rhodes.

An abatement of interest was claimed; but the Court held, that as long as the person in whom the legal interest was vested was here, the interest must run.

It is provided that they shall recover their just debts: but what are their just debts, is a question for the Court here to determine. Now, in a war, all intercourse between enemies is forbidden.
