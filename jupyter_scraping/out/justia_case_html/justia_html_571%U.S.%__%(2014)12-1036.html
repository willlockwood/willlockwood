Petitioner Mississippi sued respondent liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturers in state court, alleging violations of state law and seeking, inter alia, restitution for LCD purchases made by itself and its citizens.  Respondents sought to remove the case to federal court.  The District Court held that the suit qualified as a mass action under \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i), but remanded the suit to state court on the ground that it fell within CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral public\xe2\x80\x9d exception, \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III).  The Fifth Circuit reversed, agreeing with the District Court that the suit was a mass action but finding the general public exception inapplicable.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0Because Mississippi is the only named plaintiff, this suit does not constitute a mass action under CAFA.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (a)\xc2\xa0Contrary to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument, CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c100 or more persons\xe2\x80\x9d phrase does not encompass unnamed persons who are real parties in interest to claims brought by named plaintiffs.  Congress knew how to draft language to that effect when it intended such a meaning, see, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(d)(5)(B), 1332(d)(1)(D).  That it did not do so in the mass action provision indicates that Congress did not want the provision\xe2\x80\x99s numerosity requirement to be satisfied by counting unnamed individuals who possess an interest in the suit.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 understanding also cannot be reconciled with the fact that the \xe2\x80\x9c100 or more persons\xe2\x80\x9d are not unspecified individuals with no participation in the suit but are the \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d subsequently referred to in the provision, i.e., the very parties proposing to join their claims in a single trial.  This is evident in two key ways.  First, CAFA uses \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d the same way they are used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, which refers to \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d as individuals who are proposing to join as \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d in a single action.  Second, it is difficult to imagine how the \xe2\x80\x9cclaims of 100 or more\xe2\x80\x9d unnamed individuals could be \xe2\x80\x9cproposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. claims\xe2\x80\x9d of some completely different group of named plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve common questions of law or fact.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Construing \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d to include both named and unnamed real parties in interest would stretch the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d beyond recognition.  A \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d is commonly understood to be a party who brings a civil suit in a court of law, not anyone, named or unnamed, whom a suit may benefit.  Moreover, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 definition would also have to apply to the mass action provision\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent reference to \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims [exceed $75,000],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i).  See Brown v. Gardner,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115\n.  This would result in an administrative nightmare that Congress could not possibly have intended, see Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc.,\n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 564\n, where district courts would have to identify hundreds (or in this case, hundreds of thousands) of unnamed parties whose claims are for less than $75,000 and then decide how to dispose of their claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (b)\xc2\xa0Statutory context reinforces this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the mass action provision.  CAFA provides that once removal occurs, a case shall not be transferred to another court \xe2\x80\x9cunless a majority of the plaintiffs in the action request transfer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(C)(i).  If \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d included unnamed parties, it would be surpassingly difficult for a court to poll the enormous number of real parties in interest to decide whether an action may be transferred.  Moreover, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position that the action here should be removed because it is similar to a class action fails to recognize that the mass action provision functions largely as a backstop to ensure that CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s relaxed class action jurisdictional rules cannot be evaded by a suit that names a host of plaintiffs rather than using the class device.  Had Congress wanted CAFA to authorize removal of representative actions brought by States as sole plaintiffs on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory, it would have done so through the class action provision, not the mass action provision.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (c)\xc2\xa0This Court has interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to require courts in certain contexts to look behind the pleadings to ensure that parties are not improperly creating or destroying diversity jurisdiction, see, e.g., Wecker v. National Enameling &amp; Stamping Co.,\n\n204 U.\xc2\xa0S. 176\n\xe2\x80\x93186, but Congress did not intend this background inquiry to apply to the mass action provision.  First, it could make sense to incorporate the background inquiry into the mass action provision if the inquiry had previously been applied in a similar manner.  That is not the case here, however, and so any presumption that Congress wanted to incorporate the inquiry, if it exists at all, would be comparatively weak.  Second, even if the background principle had previously been applied in this manner, Congress expressly indicated that it did not want the principle to apply to the mass action provision both through the textual indicators described above and by prohibiting defendants from joining unnamed individuals to a lawsuit in order to turn it into a mass action, \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(II).  Requiring district courts to identify unnamed persons interested in the suit would run afoul of that intent.

CAFA defines a \xe2\x80\x9cmass action\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims involve common questions of law or fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i).  The question presented is whether a suit filed by a State as the sole plaintiff constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cmass action\xe2\x80\x9d under CAFA where it includes a claim for restitution based on injuries suffered by the State\xe2\x80\x99s citizens.  We hold that it does not.  According to CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s plain text, a \xe2\x80\x9cmass action\xe2\x80\x9d must involve monetary claims brought by 100 or more persons who propose to try those claims jointly as named plaintiffs.  Because the State of Mississippi is the only named plaintiff in the instant action, the case must be remanded to state court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress enacted CAFA in order to \xe2\x80\x9camend the procedures that apply to consideration of interstate class actions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n119Stat.\n4.  In doing so, Congress recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]lass action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal system.\xe2\x80\x9d  CAFA \xc2\xa72.  It was concerned, however, that certain requirements of federal diversity jurisdic-tion,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332, had functioned to \xe2\x80\x9ckee[p] cases of national importance\xe2\x80\x9d in state courts rather than federal courts.  CAFA \xc2\xa72.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        CAFA accordingly loosened the requirements for diversity jurisdiction for two types of cases\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cclass actions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmass actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cclass action\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action filed under rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or similar State statute or rule of judicial procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(d)(1)(B).  And it defines \xe2\x80\x9cmass action\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposedto be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99claims involve common questions of law or fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For class and mass actions, CAFA expanded diversity jurisdiction in two key ways.  First, it replaced the ordinary requirement of complete diversity of citizenship among all plaintiffs and defendants, see State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Tashire,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 523\n\xe2\x80\x93531 (1967), with a requirement of minimal diversity.  Under that re-quirement, a federal court may exercise jurisdiction over a class action if \xe2\x80\x9cany member of a class of plaintiffs isa citizen of a State different from any defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(d)(2)(A).  The same rule applies to mass actions.  See \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] mass action shall be deemed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. removable under [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(d)(2) through (d)(10)]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, whereas \xc2\xa71332(a) ordinarily requires each plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim to exceed the sum or value of $75,000, see Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 546\n\xe2\x80\x93555 (2005), CAFA grants federal jurisdiction over class and mass actions in which the aggregate amount in contro-versy exceeds $5 million.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(d)(2), (d)(6), (d)(11)(A).  Class and mass actions filed in state court that satisfy CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements may be removed to federal court,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71453, but federal jurisdiction in a mass action, unlike a class action, \xe2\x80\x9cshall exist only over those plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d whose claims individually satisfy the $75,000 amount in controversy requirement, \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondents manufacture liquid crystal displays, or LCDs.  In March 2011, the State of Mississippi sued them in state court, alleging that they had formed an international cartel to restrict competition and raise prices inthe LCD market.  The State claimed that these actions vio-lated two Mississippi statutes: the Mississippi Antitrust Act, Miss. Code Ann. \xc2\xa775\xe2\x80\x9321\xe2\x80\x931 et\xc2\xa0seq. (2009), and the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act, \xc2\xa775\xe2\x80\x9324\xe2\x80\x931 et\xc2\xa0seq. (2009 and Cum. Supp. 2013).  The State sought injunctive relief and civil penalties under both statutes, along with punitive damages, costs, and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  It also sought restitution for its own purchases \xe2\x80\x9cof LCD products and the purchases of its citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Brief in Opposition 65a; \xc2\xa775\xe2\x80\x9324\xe2\x80\x9311.   </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondents filed a notice to remove the case from state to federal court, arguing that the case was removable under CAFA as either a \xe2\x80\x9cclass action\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cmass action.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court ruled that the suit did not qualify asa \xe2\x80\x9cclass action\xe2\x80\x9d because it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or a \xe2\x80\x98similar State statute or rule of judicial procedure.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  876 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 758, 769 (SD Miss. 2012).  But it held that the suit did qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cmass action,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is a civil action \xe2\x80\x98in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims involve common questions of law or fact.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 771.  The District Court reached that conclusion on the basis of Fifth Circuit precedent in Louisiana ex\xc2\xa0rel. Caldwell v. Allstate Ins. Co., 536 F.\xc2\xa03d 418 (CA5 2008), which it understood to \xe2\x80\x9cstan[d] for the proposition that the words \xe2\x80\x98persons\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 in [the mass action definition] are to be defined as \xe2\x80\x98real parties in interest.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  876 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 771.  Applying that rule, the court found that 100 or more unidentified Mississippi consumers had purchased LCD screens and were therefore real parties in interest to the State\xe2\x80\x99s restitution claim.  Ibid.  The court noted the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility that a \xe2\x80\x98mass action\xe2\x80\x99 should be thought of as a \xe2\x80\x98mass joinder,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, as a suit involving 100 or more \xe2\x80\x9cnamed plaintiffs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid., n.\xc2\xa09.  But it deemed that interpretation to be foreclosed by Caldwell.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court nonetheless remanded the case to state court on the basis of CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral public exception,\xe2\x80\x9d which excludes from the \xe2\x80\x9cmass action\xe2\x80\x9d definition \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action in which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. all of the claims in the action are asserted on behalf of the general public (and not on behalf of individual claimants or members of a purported class) pursuant to a State statute specifically authorizing such action.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals reversed.  701 F.\xc2\xa03d 796 (CA5 2012).  It agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s suit is not a \xe2\x80\x9cclass action\xe2\x80\x9d under CAFA.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Id., at 799.  It also agreed that, under Caldwell, the suit qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cmass action\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he real parties in interest in Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s suit are those more than 100 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. individual citizens who purchased the [LCD] products within Mississippi.\xe2\x80\x9d  701 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 800.

Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6).  The statute provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term mass action means any civil action (except a [class action]) in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly onthe ground that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims involve common questions of law or fact, except that jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements under subsection (a).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The parties do not dispute that this provision encompasses suits that are brought jointly by 100 or more named plaintiffs who propose to try their claims together.  The question is whether the provision also includes suits brought by fewer than 100 named plaintiffs on the theory that there may be 100 or more unnamed persons who are real parties in interest as beneficiaries to any of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  Respondents argue that the provision covers such suits because \xe2\x80\x9cclaims of 100 or more persons\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe persons to whom the claim belongs, i.e., the real parties in interest to the claims,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of whether those persons are named or unnamed.  Brief for Respondents 19 (emphasis in original).  We disagree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        To start, the statute says \xe2\x80\x9c100 or more persons,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9c100 or more named or unnamed real parties in interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Had Congress intended the latter, it easily could have drafted language to that effect.  Indeed, when Congress wanted a numerosity requirement in CAFA to be satisfied by counting unnamed parties in interest in addition to named plaintiffs, it explicitly said so: CAFA provides that in order for a class action to be removable, \xe2\x80\x9cthe numberof members of all proposed plaintiff classes\xe2\x80\x9d must be 100 or greater, \xc2\xa71332(d)(5)(B), and it defines \xe2\x80\x9cclass members\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe persons (named or unnamed) who fall within the definition of the proposed or certified class,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71332(d)(1)(D).  Congress chose not to use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnamed or unnamed\xe2\x80\x9d in CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s mass action provision, a decision we understand to be intentional.  See Dean v.

Congress made this understanding evident in two key ways.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, we presume that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Hall v. United States, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 9).  Here, Congress used the terms \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d just as they are used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, governing party joinder.  Where \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i) requires that the \xe2\x80\x9cclaims of 100 or more persons [must be] proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims involve common questions of law or fact,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 20 provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ersons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, just as it is used in Rule 20, the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i) refers to the individuals who are proposing to join as plaintiffs in a single action.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d cannot square with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the claims of the \xe2\x80\x9c100 or more persons\xe2\x80\x9d must be proposed for joint trial \xe2\x80\x9con the ground that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims involve common questions of law or fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i).  It is difficult to imagine how the claims of one set of unnamed individ-uals could be proposed for joint trial on the ground that the claims of some completely different group of named plaintiffs share common questions.  The better understanding is that Congress meant for the \xe2\x80\x9c100 or more persons\xe2\x80\x9d and the proposed \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d to be one and the same.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Recognizing that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d could be a reference to proposed plaintiffs, respondents assert that \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs,\xe2\x80\x9d like \xe2\x80\x9cpersons,\xe2\x80\x9d should be construed to \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[e] both named and unnamed real parties in in-terest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 24.  But that stretchesthe meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d beyond recognition.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d is among the most commonly understood of legal terms of art: It means a \xe2\x80\x9cparty who brings a civil suit in a court of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1267 (9th ed. 2009); see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1729 (1961) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cone who commences a personal action or lawsuit,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe complaining party in any litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  It certainly does not mean \xe2\x80\x9canyone, named or unnamed, whom a suit may benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d as respondents suggest.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d twice in the mass action provision.  The provision encompasses actions in which monetary \xe2\x80\x9cclaims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims involve common questions,\xe2\x80\x9d and it then provides that \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requiremen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d of $75,000.  \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i).  If respondents are correct that \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d means unnamed parties in interest where it is used the first time, then so too the second.  After all, the \xe2\x80\x9cpre-sumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cat its most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brown v. Gardner,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115,\n118 (1994)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Yet if the term \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d is stretched to include all unnamed individuals with an interest in the suit, then \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims [exceed $75,000]\xe2\x80\x9d becomes an administrative nightmare that Congress could not possibly have intended, see Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc.,\n\n458 U. S. 564,\n575 (1982)\n.  How is a district court to identify the unnamed parties whose claims in a given case are for less than $75,000?  Would the court in this case, for instance, have to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the identity of each of the hundreds of thousands of unnamed Mississippi citizens who purchased one of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 LCD products between 1996 and 2006 (the period alleged in the complaint)?  Even if it could identify every such person, how would it ascertain the amount in controversy for each individual claim?  Respondents suggest that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n some circumstances, defendants may be able to identify from their payment records any persons who may have claims for overpayments,\xe2\x80\x9d but they stop notably short of claiming to possess such decades-old records themselves.  Brief for Respondents 25.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Furthermore, what would happen with individuals whose claims were valued at less than $75,000?  The District Court in this case suggested that if the suit were deemed a mass action, it would sever the claim for \xe2\x80\x9crestitution for losses incurred by individuals claiming less than or equal to $75,000 each\xe2\x80\x9d and remand that claim back to state court, while allowing the other claims (including the restitution claims exceeding $75,000) to proceed in federal court.  876 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 775.  Even respondents do not defend that outcome, presumably because it would mean that much of the State\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit could proceed in state court after all, simultaneously with the newly severed parallel federal action.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We think it unlikely that Congress intended that federal district courts engage in these unwieldy inquiries.  By contrast, interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d in accordance with its usual meaning\xe2\x80\x94to refer to the actual named parties who bring an action\xe2\x80\x94leads to a straightforward, easy to administer rule under which a court would examine whether the plaintiffs have pleaded in good faith the requisite amount.  See Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,\n\n367 U.\xc2\xa0S. 348,\n353 (1961)\n.  Our decision thus comports with the commonsense observation that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen judges must decide jurisdictional matters, simplicity is a virtue.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Standard Fire Ins. Co. v.

See Mohamad v.

That provision, \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(C)(i), provides that once a mass action has been removed to federal court, it \xe2\x80\x9cshall not thereafter be transferred to any other court .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unless a majority of the plaintiffs in the action request transfer.\xe2\x80\x9d  If respondents are correct that \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cunnamed parties in interest,\xe2\x80\x9d it will be surpassingly difficult for a court to decide in a case like this one whether an action may be transferred.  The District Court itself acknowledged this problem, noting that it would have to identify and communicate with \xe2\x80\x9chundreds of thousands if not millions of real parties in interest\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cpol[l] [them] about their preferred forum\xe2\x80\x9d if respondents\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation were correct.  876 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 777.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The context in which the mass action provision was enacted lends further support to our conclusion.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 overriding concern in enacting CAFA was with class actions.  See Preamble,\n\n119Stat.\n4 (describing CAFA as an \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ct to amend the procedures that apply to consideration of interstate class actions\xe2\x80\x9d); CAFA \xc2\xa72 (Congress\xe2\x80\x99 findings with respect to class actions).  The mass action provision thus functions largely as a backstop to ensure that CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s relaxed jurisdictional rules for class actions cannot be evaded by a suit that names a host of plaintiffs rather than using the class device.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument fails to recognize this key distinction.  Their position is ultimately that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his action is similar to a class action,\xe2\x80\x9d such that it should be removed.  Brief for Respondents 27.  But if Congress had wanted representative actions brought by States as sole plaintiffs to be removable under CAFA on the theory that they are in substance no different from class actions, it would have done so through the class action provision, not the one governing mass actions.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Rather than relying on the text of CAFA as the source of its real party in interest inquiry, the Court of Appeals appeared to find such an inquiry necessary on the basis of what it understood to be a background principle: that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal courts look to the substance of the action and not only at the labels that the parties may attach.\xe2\x80\x9d  Caldwell, 536 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 424.  This was error.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We have interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to require courts in certain contexts to look behind the pleadings to ensure that parties are not improperly creating or destroying diversity jurisdiction.  We have held, for example, that a plaintiff may not keep a case out of federal court by fraudulently naming a nondiverse defendant.  Wecker v. National Enameling &amp; Stamping Co.,\n\n204 U.\xc2\xa0S. 176\n\xe2\x80\x93186 (1907).  Nor may a plaintiff create diversity by collusively assigning his interest in an action.  Kramer v. Caribbean Mills, Inc.,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 823\n\xe2\x80\x93830 (1969); see also\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71359.  And in cases involving a State or state official, we have inquired into the real party in interest because a State\xe2\x80\x99s presence as a party will destroy complete diversity.  Missouri, K. &amp; T. R. Co. v. Missouri Railroad and Warehouse Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs,\n\n183 U.\xc2\xa0S. 53\n\xe2\x80\x9359 (1901).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But the question in this case is not simply whether there exists some background principle of analyzing the real parties in interest to a suit; the question is whether Congress intended that courts engage in that analysis when deciding whether a suit is a mass action.  Recognizing this fact, respondents do not argue that the real party in interest inquiry employed in the above cases somehow supersedes the text of CAFA; they instead argue that we should read CAFA in light of those cases because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 19 (quoting United States v. Wells,\n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 482,\n495 (1997)\n).  For two reasons, however, we conclude that Congress did not intend the background inquiry to apply to the mass action provision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, it makes sense to infer Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to incorporate a background principle into a new statute where the principle has previously been applied in a similar manner.  But that is not the case here.  The background real party in interest inquiry identifies what party\xe2\x80\x99s (or parties\xe2\x80\x99) citizenship should be considered in determining diversity.  The inquiry that respondents urge is quite dif-ferent: It is an attempt to count up additional unnamed parties in order to satisfy the mass action provision\xe2\x80\x99s numerosity requirement.  Respondents offer no reason to believe that Congress intended to extend the real party inquiry to this new circumstance, and so any presumption that Congress wanted to incorporate the inquiry, if it exists in this case at all, would be comparatively weak.  Cf. Meyer v. Holley,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280,\n286 (2003)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 silence, while permitting an inference that Congress intended to apply ordinary background tort principles, cannot show that it intended to apply an unusual modification of those rules\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, even if the background principle had previously been applied in the manner sought by respondents, Congress provided express indications that it did not want the principle to apply to the mass action provision.  It specified that \xe2\x80\x9cthe term \xe2\x80\x98mass action\xe2\x80\x99 shall not include any civil action in which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the claims are joined upon motion of a defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(II).  By prohibiting defendants from joining unnamed individuals to a lawsuit in order to turn it into a mass action, Congress demonstrated its focus on the persons who are actually proposing to join together as named plaintiffs in the suit.  Requiring district courts to pierce the pleadings to identify unnamed persons interested in the suit would run afoul of that intent.  Moreover, as already discussed, Congress repeatedly used the word \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the 100 or more persons whose claims must be proposed for a joint trial.  That word refers to actual, named parties\xe2\x80\x94a concept inherently at odds with the background inquiry into unnamed real parties in interest, who by definition are never plaintiffs.  Congress thus clearly displaced a background real party in interest inquiry, even assuming one might otherwise apply.  Cf. Barnhart v.
