The case, after being heard, was submitted to that court on the 26th of May, 1882, and was by it dismissed on the 29th of May, 1882.  On the 6th of April, 1895, the judgment was vacated, and a new trial granted by virtue of the act of February 13, 1895.  31 Ct.Cl. 399.</p>\n<p>The difference between the contract price and the board-rate price was claimed, and Dickson, as assignee, was allowed to recover $1,386.30 for such difference, belonging to him by virtue of the assignment, and which sum the court held to have "been due and payable June 2, 1873, within the meaning and intent of the Act of February 13, 1895, and the Act of June 16, 1880." </p><p><a class="page-number" name="342">Page 165 U.
