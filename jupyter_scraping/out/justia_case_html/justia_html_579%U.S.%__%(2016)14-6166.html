The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d broadly as interstate commerce \xe2\x80\x9cand all other commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71951(b)(3).  This case requires us to decide what the Government must prove to satisfy the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element when a defendant commits a robbery that targets a marijuana dealer\xe2\x80\x99s drugs or drug proceeds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The answer to this question is straightforward and dictated by our precedent.  We held in <i>Gonzales </i>v. <i>Raich</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2005)\n, that the Commerce Clause gives Congress authority to regulate the national market for marijuana, including the authority to proscribe the purely intrastate production, possession, and sale of this controlled substance.  Because Congress may regulate these intrastate activities based on their aggregate effect on interstate commerce, it follows that Congress may also regulate intrastate drug <i>theft</i>.  And since the Hobbs Act criminalizes robberies and attempted robberies that affect any commerce \xe2\x80\x9cover which the United States has jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71951(b)(3), the prosecution in a Hobbs Act robbery case satisfies the Act\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element if it shows that the defendant robbed or attempted to rob a drug dealer of drugs or drug proceeds.  By targeting a drug dealer in this way, a robber necessarily affects or attempts to affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, petitioner Anthony Taylor was convicted on two Hobbs Act counts based on proof that he attempted to rob marijuana dealers of their drugs and drug money.  We hold that this evidence was sufficient to satisfy the Act\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element.</p>\n<p style="p-H1"><b>I</b></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Beginning as early as 2009, an outlaw gang called the \xe2\x80\x9cSouthwest Goonz\xe2\x80\x9d committed a series of home invasion robberies targeting drug dealers in the area of Roanoke, Virginia.  754 F.\xc2\xa03d 217, 220 (CA4 2014).  For obvious reasons, drug dealers are more likely than ordinary citizens to keep large quantities of cash and illegal drugs in their homes and are less likely to report robberies to the police.  For participating in two such home invasions, Taylor was convicted of two counts of Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of \xc2\xa71951(a), and one count of using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of \xc2\xa7924(c).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first attempted drug robbery for which Taylor was convicted occurred in August 2009.  <i>Id</i>., at 220.  Taylor and others targeted the home of Josh Whorley, having obtained information that Whorley dealt \xe2\x80\x9cexotic and high grade\xe2\x80\x9d marijuana.  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9cThe robbers expected to find both drugs and money\xe2\x80\x9d in Whorley\xe2\x80\x99s home.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Taylor and the others broke into the home, searched it, and assaulted Whorley and his girlfriend.  They demanded to be told the location of money and drugs but, not locating any, left with only jewelry, $40, two cell phones, and a marijuana cigarette.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second attempted drug robbery occurred two months later in October 2009 at the home of William Lynch.  <i>Ibid.</i>  A source informed the leader of the gang that, on a prior occasion, the source had robbed Lynch of 20 pounds of marijuana in front of Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s home.  The gang also received information that Lynch continued to deal drugs.  Taylor and others broke into Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s home, held his wife and young children at gunpoint, assaulted his wife, and demanded to know the location of his drugs and money.  Again largely unsuccessful, the robbers made off with only a cell phone.  <i>Id.,</i> at 221.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For his participation in these two home invasions, Taylor was indicted under the Hobbs Act on two counts of affecting commerce or attempting to do so through robbery.  App. 11a\xe2\x80\x9313a.  His first trial resulted in a hung jury.  On retrial, at the urging of the Government, the District Court precluded Taylor from introducing evidence that the drug dealers he targeted might be dealing in only locally grown marijuana.  <i>Id.,</i> at 60a; see 754 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 221.  During the second trial, Taylor twice moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the prosecution had failed to meet its burden on the commerce element, Tr. 445\xe2\x80\x93447, 532\xe2\x80\x93533; see 754 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 221, but the District Court denied those motions, holding that the proof that Taylor attempted to rob drug dealers was sufficient as a matter of law to satisfy that element.  Tr. 446, 532\xe2\x80\x93533.  The jury found Taylor guilty on both of the Hobbs Act counts and one of the firearms counts.  App. 67a\xe2\x80\x9369a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On appeal, Taylor challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the commerce element of the Hobbs Act, but the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  \xe2\x80\x9cBecause drug dealing in the aggregate necessarily affects interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d the court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cthe government was simply required to prove that Taylor depleted or attempted to deplete the assets of such an operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  754 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 224.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Circuits regarding the demands of the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element in cases involving the theft of drugs and drug proceeds from drug dealers.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Hobbs Act provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or attemptsor conspires so to do .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\xe2\x80\x9d  18U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Act then defines the term \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d to mean</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9ccommerce within the District of Columbia, or any Territory or Possession of the United States; all commerce between any point in a State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia and any point outside thereof; all commerce between points within the same State through any place outside such State; and all other commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71951(b)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The language of the Hobbs Act is unmistakably broad.  It reaches any obstruction, delay, or other effect on commerce, even if small, and the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of commerce encompasses \xe2\x80\x9call .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  We have noted the sweep of the Act in past cases.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Culbert</i>,\n\n435 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371,\n373 (1978)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThese words do not lend themselves to restrictive interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Stirone</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n361 U.\xc2\xa0S. 212,\n215 (1960)\n (The Hobbs Act \xe2\x80\x9cspeaks in broad language, manifesting a purpose to use all the constitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To determine how far this commerce element extends\xe2\x80\x94and what the Government must prove to meet it\xe2\x80\x94we look to our Commerce Clause cases.  We have said that there are three categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of the channels of interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cthe instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cthose activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>i.\xc2\xa0e.,</i> those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Lopez</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 549\n\xe2\x80\x93559 (1995).  We have held that activities in this third category\xe2\x80\x94those that \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially affect\xe2\x80\x9d commerce\xe2\x80\x94may be regulated so long as they substantially affect interstate commerce in the aggregate, even if their individual impact on interstate commerce is minimal.  See <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn</i>,\n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 111,\n125 (1942)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven if appellee\xe2\x80\x99s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While this final category is broad, \xe2\x80\x9cthus far in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Morrison</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598,\n613 (2000)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, the activity at issue, the sale of marijuana, is unquestionably an economic activity.  It is, to be sure, a form of business that is illegal under federal law and the laws of most States.  But there can be no question that marijuana trafficking is a moneymaking endeavor\xe2\x80\x94and a potentially lucrative one at that.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Raich</i>, the Court addressed Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority to regulate the marijuana market.  The Court reaffirmed \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic \xe2\x80\x98class of activities\xe2\x80\x99 that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 17.  The production, possession, and distribution of controlled substances constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cclass of activities\xe2\x80\x9d that in the aggregate substantially affect interstate commerce, and therefore, the Court held, Congress possesses the authority to regulate (and to criminalize) the production, possession, and distribution of controlled substances even when those activities occur entirely within the boundaries of a single State.  Any other outcome, we warned, would leave a gaping enforcement hole in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory scheme.  <i>Id.</i>, at 22.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The case now before us requires no more than that we graft our holding in <i>Raich</i> onto the commerce element of the Hobbs Act.  The Hobbs Act criminalizes robberies affecting \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71951(b)(3).  Under <i>Raich</i>, the market for marijuana, including its intrastate aspects, is \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  It therefore follows as a simple matter of logic that a robberwho affects or attempts to affect even the intrastate saleof marijuana grown within the State affects or attemptsto affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Rejecting this logic, Taylor takes the position that the robbery or attempted robbery of a drug dealer\xe2\x80\x99s inventory violates the Hobbs Act only if the Government proves something more.  This argument rests in part on the fact that <i>Raich</i> concerned the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the criminal provisions of which lack a jurisdictional element.  See 21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a), 844.  The Hobbs Act, by contrast, contains such an element\xe2\x80\x94namely, the conduct criminalized must affect or attempt to affect commerce in some way or degree.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(a).  Therefore, Taylor reasons, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt either (1) that the particular drugs in question originated or were destined for sale out of State or (2) that the particular drug dealer targeted in the robbery operated an interstate business.  See Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9327; Reply Brief 8.  The Second and Seventh Circuits have adopted this same argument.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Needham</i>, 604 F.\xc2\xa03d 673, 681 (CA2 2010); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Peterson</i>, 236 F.\xc2\xa03d 848, 855 (CA7 2001).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument is flawed.  It confuses the standard of proof with the meaning of the element that must be proved.  There is no question that the Government in a Hobbs Act prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant engaged in conduct that satisfies the Act\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element, but the meaning of that element is a question of law.  And, as noted, <i>Raich</i> established that the purely intrastate production and sale of marijuana is commerce over which the Federal Government has jurisdiction.  Therefore, if the Government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that a robber targeted a marijuana dealer\xe2\x80\x99s drugs or illegal proceeds, the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction was affected.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The only way to escape that conclusion would be to hold that the Hobbs Act does not exercise the full measure of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s commerce power.  But we reached the opposite conclusion more than 50 years ago, see <i>Stirone</i>, 361 U.\xc2\xa0S.,<i> </i>at 215, and it is not easy to see how the expansive language of the Act could be interpreted in any other way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> This conclusion does not make the commerce provision of the Hobbs Act superfluous.  That statute, unlike the criminal provisions of the CSA, applies to forms of conduct that, even in the aggregate, may not substantially affect commerce.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element ensures that applications of the Act do not exceed Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  But in a case like this one, where the target of a robbery is a drug dealer, proof that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in and of itself affected or threatened commerce is not needed.  All that is needed is proof that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct fell within a category of conduct that, in the aggregate, had the requisite effect.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Contrary to the dissent, see <i>post,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion of Thomas, J.), today\xe2\x80\x99s holding merely applies\xe2\x80\x94it in no way expands\xe2\x80\x94<i>Raich</i>\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power under the Commerce Clause.  The dissent resists the substantial-effects approach and the aggregation principle on which <i>Raich</i> is based, see <i>post</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  But we have not been asked to reconsider <i>Raich</i>.  So our decision in <i>Raich</i> controls the outcome here.  As long as Congress may regulate the purely intrastate possession and sale of illegal drugs, Congress may criminalize the theft or attempted theft of those same drugs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We reiterate what this means.  In order to obtain a conviction under the Hobbs Act for the robbery or attempted robbery of a drug dealer, the Government need not show that the drugs that a defendant stole or attempted to steal either traveled or were destined for transport across state lines.  Rather, to satisfy the Act\xe2\x80\x99s commerce element, it is enough that a defendant knowingly stole or attempted to steal drugs or drug proceeds, for, as a matter of law, the market for illegal drugs is \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it makes no difference under our cases that any actual or threatened effect on commerce in a particular case is minimal.  See <i>Perez </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146,\n154 (1971)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power \xe2\x80\x98to excise, as trivial, individual instances\xe2\x80\x99 of the class\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">E</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In the present case, the Government met its burden by introducing evidence that Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s gang intentionally targeted drug dealers to obtain drugs and drug proceeds.  One of the victims had been robbed of substantial quantities of drugs at his residence in the past, and the other was thought to possess high-grade marijuana.  The robbers also made explicit statements in the course of the robberies revealing that they believed that the victims possessed drugs and drug proceeds.  Tr. 359 (asking Lynch \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the weed at\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 93 (asking Whorley \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the money was at, where the weed was at\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (asking Whorley, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your money and where is your weed at?\xe2\x80\x9d).  Both robberies were committed with the express intent to obtain illegal drugs and the proceeds from the sale of illegal drugs.

Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today, the Government can obtain a Hobbs Act conviction without proving that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s robbery in fact affected interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x94or any commerce.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x939.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding creates serious constitutional problems and extends our already expansive, flawed commerce-power precedents.  I would construe the Hobbs Act in accordance with constitutional limits and hold that the Act punishes a robbery only when the Government proves that the robbery itself affected interstate commerce.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In making it a federal crime to commit a robbery that \xe2\x80\x9caffects commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71951(a), the Hobbs Act invokes the full reach of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power: The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d to embrace \xe2\x80\x9call .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71951(b)(3).  To determine the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s reach, I start by examining the limitations on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to punish robbery under its commerce power.  In light of those limitations and in accordance with the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s text, I would hold that the Government in a Hobbs Act case may obtain a conviction for robbery only if it proves, beyond a reason-able doubt, that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s robbery itself affected interstate commerce.  The Government may not obtain a conviction by proving only that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s robbery affected intrastate commerce or other intrastate activity.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Congress possesses only limited authority to prohibit and punish robbery.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution creates a Federal Government of enumerated powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Lopez</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 549,\n552 (1995)\n; see Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78;<i> Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe powers of the legislature are defined, and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written\xe2\x80\x9d).  As with its powers generally, Congress has only limited authority over crime.  The Government possesses broad general authority in territories and fed-eral enclaves.  See Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 17 (conferring power of \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive Legislation\xe2\x80\x9d over the District of Columbia); Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa73, cl.\xc2\xa02 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  But its power over crimes committed in the States is very different.  The Constitution expressly delegates to Congress authority over only four specific crimes: counterfeiting securities and coin of the United States, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa06; piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa010; offenses against the law of nations, <i>ibid.</i>; and treason, Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa73, cl. 2.  Given these limited grants of federal power, it is \xe2\x80\x9cclea[r] that Congress cannot punish felonies generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>, 6 Wheat. 264, 428 (1821) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cno general right to punish murder committed within any of the States,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, and no general right to punish the many crimes that fall outside of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express grants of criminal authority.  <i>Id.</i>, at 426.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d in short, \xe2\x80\x9cwithhold[s] from Congress a plenary police power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lopez</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 566; see Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78; Amdt. 10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Beyond the four express grants of federal criminal authority, then, Congress may validly enact criminal laws only to the extent that doing so is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d its enumerated powers or other powers that the Constitution vests in the Federal Government.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa018.  As Chief Justice Marshall explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe [federal] government may, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws\xe2\x80\x9d as a necessary and proper means for carrying into execution Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated powers.  <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, 4 Wheat. 316, 416 (1819); see <i>id.,</i> at 416\xe2\x80\x93421.  But if these limitations are not respected, Congress will accumulate the general police power that the Constitution withholds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to punish robbery in the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x94or in any federal statute\xe2\x80\x94must be assessed in light of these principles.  The Commerce Clause\xe2\x80\x94the constitutional provision that the Hobbs Act most clearly invokes\xe2\x80\x94does not authorize Congress to punish robbery.  That Clause authorizes Congress to regulate \xe2\x80\x9cCommerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. among the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03.  Robbery is not \xe2\x80\x9cCommerce\xe2\x80\x9d under that Clause.  At the founding, \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconsisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lopez</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 585 (Thomas, J., concurring).  The Commerce Clause, as originally understood, thus \xe2\x80\x9cempowers Congress to regulate the buying and selling of goods and services trafficked across state lines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Raich</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n58 (2005)\n (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Robbery is not buying, it is not selling, and it cannot plausibly be described as a commercial transaction (\xe2\x80\x9ctrade or exchange for value\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Id.</i>, at 59.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because Congress has no freestanding power to punish robbery and because robbery is not itself \xe2\x80\x9cCommerce,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress may prohibit and punish robbery only to the extent that doing so is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate commerce.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa018.  To be \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99 prohibition of robbery must be \xe2\x80\x9cplainly adapted\xe2\x80\x9d to regulating interstate commerce.  <i>McCulloch</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 421.  This means that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 robbery prohibition must have an \xe2\x80\x9cobvious, simple, and direct relation\xe2\x80\x9d with the regulation of interstate commerce.  <i>Raich</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 61 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And for Congress\xe2\x80\x99 robbery prohibition to be \xe2\x80\x9cproper,\xe2\x80\x9d it cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited\xe2\x80\x9d by the Constitution or inconsistent with its \xe2\x80\x9cletter and spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCulloch</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 421; see <i>United States </i>v. <i>Comstock</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 126,\n161 (2010)\n (Thomas, J., dissenting) (same).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With those principles in mind, I turn to the Hobbs Act.  The Act provides,</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be [punished].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71951(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In keeping with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to regulate certain commerce\xe2\x80\x94but not robbery generally\xe2\x80\x94the central feature of a Hobbs Act crime is an effect on commerce.  The Act begins by focusing on commerce and then carefully describes the required relationship between the proscribed conduct and commerce: The Act uses active verbs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cobstructs,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdelays,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9caffects\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to describe how a robbery must relate to commerce, making clear that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s robbery must affect commerce.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Act\xe2\x80\x99s reach depends on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce,\xe2\x80\x9d which the Act defines as</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9ccommerce within the District of Columbia, or any Territory or Possession of the United States; all commerce between any point in a State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia and any point outside thereof; all commerce between points within the same State through any place outside such State; and all other commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71951(b)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As noted above, this provision is comprehensive and appears to invoke all of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power.  The first clause of the definition invokes Congress\xe2\x80\x99 broad police power, including power over internal commerce, in the District of Columbia and the Territories.  See Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa017 (District of Columbia); Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa73, cl.\xc2\xa02 (territories).  The second and third clauses most clearly invoke those broad powers as well as Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o regulate Commerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. among the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03.  The final clause invokes all federal commerce power not covered in the previous clauses.  It invokes (to the extent that the second and third clauses do not already do so) Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and with the Indian Tribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The critical question in this case is whether the commerce definition\xe2\x80\x99s final clause extends further, to some intrastate activity.  Given the limitations imposed by the Constitution, I would construe this clause not to reach such activity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As explained above, for the Hobbs Act to constitutionally prohibit robberies that interfere with intrastate activity, that prohibition would need to be \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate interstate commerce, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cls.\xc2\xa03, 18.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93A, <i>supra</i>.  Punishing a local robbery\xe2\x80\x94one that affects only intrastate commerce or other intrastate activity\xe2\x80\x94cannot satisfy that standard.  Punishing a local robbery does not bear a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect relation\xe2\x80\x9d to the regulation of interstate commerce, so it would not be \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Raich</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>, </i>at 61 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor would punishing such a robbery be \xe2\x80\x9cproper.\xe2\x80\x9d  Permitting Congress to criminalize such robberies would confer on Congress a general police power over the Nation\xe2\x80\x94even though the Constitution confers no such power on Congress.  <i>Lopez</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 566; see <i>Raich</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 65 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Allowing the Federal Government to reach a simple home robbery, for example, would \xe2\x80\x9cencroac[h] on States\xe2\x80\x99 traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to protect .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. their citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 66.  This would \xe2\x80\x9csubvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 65, and would be inconsistent with the \xe2\x80\x9cletter and spirit\xe2\x80\x9d of the Constitution, <i>McCulloch</i>, 4 Wheat., at 421.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, the Hobbs Act reaches a local robbery only when that particular robbery \xe2\x80\x9cobstructs, delays, or affects\xe2\x80\x9d <i>interstate</i> commerce.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71951(a), 1951(b)(3).  So construed, the Hobbs Act validly punishes robbery.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o regulate Commerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. among the several States,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03, \xe2\x80\x9cwould lack force or practical effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact criminal laws\xe2\x80\x9d prohibiting interference with interstate commerce or the movement of articles or goods in interstate commerce, <i>Comstock</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 169 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  The Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on such interferences thus helps to \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[y] into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated power to regulate interstate commerce.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cls.\xc2\xa03, 18.  A prohibition on such interference by robbery bears an \xe2\x80\x9cobvious, simple, and direct relation\xe2\x80\x9d to regulating interstate commerce: it allows commerce to flow between States unobstructed.  <i>Raich</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 61 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is therefore \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  And such a prohibition accords with the limited nature of the powers that the Constitution confers on Congress, by adhering to the categories of commerce that the Constitution authorizes Congress to regulate and by keeping Congress from exercising a general police power.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Lopez</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 566.  It is accordingly \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d to that extent.  If construed to reach a robbery that does not affect interstate commerce, however, the Hobbs Act exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority because it is no longer \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d to the execution of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o regulate Commerce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. among the several States,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cls.\xc2\xa03, 18.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93A, <i>supra</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Robberies that might satisfy these principles would be those that affect the channels of interstate commerce or instrumentalities of interstate commerce.  A robbery that forces an interstate freeway to shut down thus may form the basis for a valid Hobbs Act conviction.  So too might a robbery of a truckdriver who is in the course of transporting commercial goods across state lines.  But if the Government cannot prove that a robbery in a State affected interstate commerce, then the robbery is not punishable under the Hobbs Act.  Sweeping in robberies that do not affect interstate commerce comes too close to conferring on Congress a general police power over the Nation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s text and relevant constitutional principles, the Government in a Hobbs Act robbery case (at least one that involves only intrastate robbery) must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s robbery itself affected interstate commerce.  See <i>Alleyne</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 3) (the\n \nSixth Amendment right to a trial \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98by an impartial jury,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in conjunction with our due process precedents, \xe2\x80\x9crequires that each element of a crime be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>In re Winship</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 358,\n364 (1970)\n (requiring reasonable-doubt showing on each element of a crime).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">On this interpretation of the Hobbs Act, petitioner David Anthony Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s convictions cannot stand.  The Government cites no evidence that Taylor actually obstructed, delayed, or affected interstate commerce when he committed the two intrastate robberies here.  The Government did not prove that Taylor affected any channel of interstate commerce, instrumentality of commerce, or person or thing in interstate commerce.  See <i>Lopez</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 558\xe2\x80\x93559 (describing these core areas of commerce regulation).  Nor did the Government prove that Taylor affected an actual commercial transaction\xe2\x80\x94let alone an interstate commercial transaction.  At most, the Government proved instead that Taylor robbed two drug dealers in their homes in Virginia; that the marijuana that Taylor expected to (but did not) find in these robberies might possibly at some point have crossed state lines; and that Taylor expected to find large amounts of marijuana.  See Brief for United States 35\xe2\x80\x9337; Tr. 63\xe2\x80\x9369, 354, 420\xe2\x80\x93421.  Under the principles set forth above, that is not sufficient to bring Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s robberies within the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  We should reverse Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s Hobbs Act convictions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Upholding Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s convictions, the Court reads the Hobbs Act differently.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x939.  The Court concludes that the \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce over which the United States has jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71951(b)(3), includes intrastate activity.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Under our modern precedents, as the Court notes, Congress may regulate not just the channels of interstate commerce, instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things moving in interstate commerce, but may also regulate \xe2\x80\x9cthose activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>i.\xc2\xa0e.,</i> those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lopez</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 558\xe2\x80\x93559; see <i>Wickard</i> v. <i>Filburn</i>,\n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 111,\n125 (1942)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven if appellee\xe2\x80\x99s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d).  The substantial-effects approach is broad, in part because of its \xe2\x80\x9caggregation principle\xe2\x80\x9d: Congress can regulate an activity\xe2\x80\x94even an intrastate, noncommercial activity\xe2\x80\x94if that activity falls within a \xe2\x80\x9cclass of activities\xe2\x80\x9d that, \xe2\x80\x9cas a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially affects interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d even if \xe2\x80\x9cany specific activity within the class\xe2\x80\x9d has no such effects \xe2\x80\x9cwhen considered in isolation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lopez</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600 (Thomas, J., concurring) (emphasis deleted).  According to the Court, the final clause of the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of commerce embraces this category of activities that, in the aggregate, substantially affect commerce.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Any robbery that targets a marijuana dealer, the Court then holds, affects the type of intrastate activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x939.  For at least three reasons, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is in error.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although our modern precedents (such as <i>Wickard</i>) embrace the substantial-effects approach, applying that approach to the Hobbs Act is tantamount to abandoning any limits on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power\xe2\x80\x94even the slight limits recognized by our expansive modern precedents.  As I have explained, if the Hobbs Act is construed to punish a robbery that by itself affects only intrastate activity, then the Act defies the constitutional design.  See Part I, <i>supra</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is true even under our modern precedents.  Even those precedents emphasize that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598\n\xe2\x80\x93618 (2000); see <i>Lopez</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 567\xe2\x80\x93568.  The substantial-effects approach is at war with that principle.  To avoid giving Congress a general police power, there must be some limit to what Congress can regulate.  But the substantial-effects approach\xe2\x80\x99s aggregation principle \xe2\x80\x9chas no stopping point.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 600 (Thomas, J., concurring).  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne <i>always</i> can draw the circle broadly enough to cover an activity that, when taken in isolation, would not have substantial effects on commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Under the substantial-effects approach, Congress could, under its commerce power, regulate <i>any</i> robbery: In the aggregate, any type of robbery could be deemed to substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By applying the substantial-effects test to the criminal prohibition before us, the Court effectively gives Congress a police power.  That is why the Court cannot identify any true limit on its understanding of the commerce power.  Although the Court maintains that its holding \xe2\x80\x9cis limited to cases in which the defendant targets drug dealers for the purpose of stealing drugs or drug proceeds,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 9, its reasoning allows for unbounded regulation.  Given that the Hobbs Act can be read in a way that does not give Congress a general police power, see Part I, <i>supra</i>, we should not construe the statute as the Court does today.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Applying the substantial-effects approach is especially unsound here because it effectively relieves the Government of its central burden in a criminal case\xe2\x80\x94the burden to prove every element beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x94and because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding does not follow from even our broad precedents.  The Court reasons that, under <i>Gonzalez</i> v. <i>Raich</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x94a case that rests on substantial-effects reasoning, see <i>id.,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9322\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe market for marijuana, including its intrastate aspects, is \xe2\x80\x98commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6 (quoting \xc2\xa71951(b)(3)).  Therefore, \xe2\x80\x9ca robber who affects or attempts to affect even the intrastate sale of marijuana grown within the State affects or attempts to affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.  As the Court later states, \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here the target of a robbery is a drug dealer, proof that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in and of itself affected or threatened commerce is not needed.  All that is needed is proof that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct fell within a category of conduct that, in the aggregate, had the requisite effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 8.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Raich </i>is too thin a reed to support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  <i>Raich </i>upheld the federal Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of \xe2\x80\x9cthe intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana\xe2\x80\x9d for personal medical use, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 15, on the view that Congress \xe2\x80\x9chad a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana\xe2\x80\x9d would undercut federal regulation of the broader interstate marijuana market, <i>id.,</i> at 22.  The Court \xe2\x80\x9cstress[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d that it did not \xe2\x80\x9cneed [to] determine whether [local cultivation and possession of marijuana], taken in the aggregate, substantially affect[ed] interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a \xe2\x80\x98rational basis\xe2\x80\x99 exist[ed] for so concluding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As an initial matter, <i>Raich</i> did not, as the Court suggests, hold that \xe2\x80\x9cthe market for marijuana, including its intrastate aspects, is \xe2\x80\x98<i>commerce</i> over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6 (emphasis added).  <i>Raich</i> held at most that the market for marijuana comprises <i>activities</i> that may substantially affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Raich</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  Those activities are not necessarily \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce,\xe2\x80\x9d so <i>Raich</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding does not establish what the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s text requires.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But even if <i>Raich</i> established that the intrastate aspects of the marijuana market are \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce over which the United States has jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71951(b)(3), <i>Raich</i> still would not establish the further point that the Court needs for its conclusion.  Specifically, <i>Raich </i>would not establish that a robbery affecting a drug dealer establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the robber actually \xe2\x80\x9cobstructs, delays, or affects\xe2\x80\x9d the marijuana market.  \xc2\xa71951(a).  <i>Raich</i> did not hold that any activity relating to the marijuana market <i>in fact</i> affects commerce.  <i>Raich</i> instead disclaimed the need to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine whether\xe2\x80\x9d activities relating to the marijuana market\xe2\x80\x94even \xe2\x80\x9ctaken in the aggregate\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csubstantially affect interstate commerce in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 22.  <i>Raich</i> decided only that Congress had a rational basis\xe2\x80\x94a merely \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conceivable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d basis, <i>FCC</i> v. <i>Beach Communications, Inc.</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 307,\n315 (1993)\n\xe2\x80\x94for thinking that it needed to regulate that activity as part of an effective regulatory regime.  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 22.  That is far from a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a particular robbery relating to marijuana is an activity that affects interstate commerce.  Grafting <i>Raich</i>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cholding .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. onto the commerce element of the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x9d thus does not lead to the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9ca robber who affects or attempts to affect .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the intrastate sale of marijuana grown within [a] State affects or attempts to affect\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccommerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis thus provides no assurance that the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that a Hobbs Act robbery defendant in fact affected commerce.  And it unnecessarily extends our already broad precedents.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision weakens longstanding protections for criminal defendants.  The criminal law imposes especially high burdens on the Government in order to protect the rights of the accused.  The Government may obtain a conviction only \xe2\x80\x9cupon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which [the accused] is charged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Winship</i>, 397 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 364.  Those elements must be proved to a jury.  Amdt. 6; see <i>Alleyne</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 3).  Given the harshness of criminal penalties on \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights of individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court has long recognized that penal laws \xe2\x80\x9care to be construed strictly\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that Congress has indeed decided to make the conduct at issue criminal.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wiltberger</i>, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore a man can be punished as a criminal under the federal law his case must be plainly and unmistakably within the provisions of some statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Gradwell</i>,\n\n243 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476,\n485 (1917)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  When courts construe criminal statutes, then, they must be especially careful.  And when a broad reading of a criminal statute would upset federalism, courts must be more careful still.  \xe2\x80\x9c[U]nless Congress conveys its purposeclearly,\xe2\x80\x9d we do not deem it \xe2\x80\x9cto have significantly changed the federal-state balance in the prosecution of crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 848,\n858 (2000)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The substantial-effects test is in tension with these principles.  That test\xe2\x80\x94and the deferential, rational-basis review to which it is subjected, see <i>Raich</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 22\xe2\x80\x94puts virtually no burdens on the Government.  That should not come as a surprise because the substantial-effects test gained momentum not in the criminal context, but instead in the context in which courts most defer to the Government: the regulatory arena.  <i>E.g.,</i> <i>Wickard</i>, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 113, 122\xe2\x80\x93125, 128\xe2\x80\x93129 (relying on substantial-effects reasoning to uphold regulatory restrictions on wheat under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938).  Without adequate reflection, the Court later extended this approach to the criminal context.  In <i>Perez</i> v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146 (1971)\n, for example, the Court applied the substantial-effects approach to a criminal statute, holding that Congress could criminally punish loansharking under its commerce power because \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xtortionate credit transactions, though purely intrastate, may in the judgment of Congress affect interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d when judged as a \xe2\x80\x9cclass of activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 154 (emphasis deleted); see <i>id.,</i> at 151\xe2\x80\x93154, 156\xe2\x80\x93157.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even in extending the substantial-effects approach, however, the Court still tried to impose some of the recognized limits on the Government in the criminal context.  Just a year before it decided <i>Perez</i>, for example, the Court held that the Government must prove each charged element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  <i>Winship</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 364.<i> </i>And the Court shortly thereafter gave a potentially broad federal statute a narrow reading\xe2\x80\x94a reading that required a prohibited act to have a \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrated nexus with interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a lesser showing\xe2\x80\x94based on lenity and federalism.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bass</i>,\n\n404 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336,\n349 (1971)\n; see <i>id.,</i> at 339, 347\xe2\x80\x93350.  Indeed, the Court soon again invoked those same principles in rejecting a broad interpretation of the Hobbs Act itself.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Enmons</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 396\n\xe2\x80\x93412 (1973) (invoking principles of lenity and federalism in construing the Hobbs Act not to reach the use of violence to achieve legitimate union objectives).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today, however, the Court fails to apply even those limits.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision fails to hold the Government to its burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s robbery itself affected commerce.  It fails to identify language in the Hobbs Act that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conveys .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. clearly\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intention to reach the sorts of local, small-scale robberies that States traditionally prosecute.  <i>Jones</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 858.  And it fails to take our traditionally careful approach to construing criminal statutes.  Given the problems with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s expansive reading of the Hobbs Act, we cannot be sure that Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cplainly and unmistakably within the provisions of\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  <i>Gradwell</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 485 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It does not matter that Taylor committed a crime akin to the one that the Hobbs Act punishes.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d to punish someone for \xe2\x80\x9ca crime not enumerated in the statute\xe2\x80\x9d merely \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it is of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those which are enumerated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wiltberger</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 96.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court takes that \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous\xe2\x80\x9d step\xe2\x80\x94and other dangerous steps\xe2\x80\x94today.  It construes the Hobbs Act in a way that conflicts with the Constitution, with our precedents, and with longstanding protections for the accused.  I would interpret the Hobbs Act in a way that is consistent with its text and with the Constitution.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
