CALIFORNIA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">JOHNSON <em>v</em>. CALIFORNIA</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the court of appeal of california, first appellate district</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x936964.Argued April 18, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 13, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner Johnson, a black man, was convicted in a California state court of assaulting and murdering a white child.  During jury selection, a number of prospective jurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors remained, three of whom were black.  The prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the prospective black jurors, resulting in an all-white jury.  Defense counsel objected to those strikes on the ground that they were unconstitutionally based on race.  The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain his strikes, but instead simply found that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination under the governing state precedent, <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler</em>, which required a showing of a strong likelihood that the exercise of peremptory challenges was based on group bias.  The judge explained that, although the case was close, his review of the record convinced him that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons.  The California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction, but the State Supreme Court reinstated it, stressing that <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/index.html">476 U. S. 79</a>, permits state courts to establish the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency of prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination in jury selection.  Reviewing <em>Batson</em>, <em>Wheeler</em>, and their progeny, the court concluded that <em>Wheeler</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstrong likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d standard is entirely consistent with <em>Batson</em>.  Under <em>Batson</em>, the court held, a state court may require the objector to present not merely enough evidence to permit an inference that discrimination has occurred, but sufficiently strong evidence to establish that the challenges, if not explained, were more likely than not based on race.  Applying that standard, the court acknowledged that the exclusion of all three black prospective jurors looked suspicious, but deferred to the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em> California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmore likely than not\xe2\x80\x9d standard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a prima facie<em> </em>case of purposeful discrimination in jury selection.  This narrow but important issue concerns the scope of the first of three steps <em>Batson</em> enumerated: (1) Once the defendant has made out a prima facie<em> </em>case and (2) the State has satisfied its burden to offer permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes, <em>e.g., </em>476 U. S., at 94, then (3) the trial court must decide whether the defendant has proved purposeful racial discrimination, <em>Purkett</em> v. <em>Elem</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/765/index.html">514 U. S. 765</a>.  <em>Batson </em>does not permit California to require at step one that the objector show that it is more likely than not the other party\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias.  The <em>Batson</em> Court held that a prima facie case can be made out by offering a wide variety of evidence, so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives \xe2\x80\x9crise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U. S., at 94.  The Court explained that to establish a prima facie case, the defendant must show that his membership in a cognizable racial group, the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of peremptory challenges to remove members of that group, the indisputable fact that such challenges permit those inclined to discriminate to do so, and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor excluded venire members on account of race<em>.  Id.,</em> at 96.  The Court assumed that the trial judge would have the benefit of all relevant circumstances, including the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s explanation, before deciding whether it was more likely than not that the peremptory challenge was improperly motivated.  The Court did not intend the first step to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge\xe2\x80\x94on the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with certainty\xe2\x80\x94that the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful discrimination.  Instead, a defendant satisfies <em>Batson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first step requirements by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.  The facts of this case illustrate that California\xe2\x80\x99s standard is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by <em>Batson</em>.  The permissible inferences of discrimination, which caused the trial judge to comment that the case was close and the California Supreme Court to acknowledge that it was suspicious that all three black prospective jurors were removed, were sufficient to establish a prima facie case.

Because both of those courts regularly review the validity of convictions obtained in California criminal trials, respondent, the State of California, agreed to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request that we grant certiorari and resolve the conflict.  We agree with the Ninth Circuit that the question presented must be answered in the negative, and accordingly reverse the judgment of the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Jay Shawn Johnson, a black male, was convicted in a California trial court of second-degree murder and assault on a white 19-month-old child, resulting in death.  During jury selection, a number of prospective jurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors remained, 3 of whom were black.  The prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the black prospective jurors.  The resulting jury, including alternates, was all white.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the prosecutor exercised the second of his three peremptory challenges against the prospective black jurors, defense counsel objected on the ground that the challenge was unconstitutionally based on race under both the California and United States Constitutions.  <em>People</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, 30 Cal. 4th 1302, 1307, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d 270, 272\xe2\x80\x93273 (2003).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Defense counsel alleged that the prosecutor \xe2\x80\x9chad no apparent reason to challenge this prospective juror \xe2\x80\x98other than [her] racial identity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (alteration in original).  The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain the rationale for his strikes.  Instead, the judge simply found that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case under the governing state precedent, <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler</em>, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P.\xc2\xa02d 748 (1978), reasoning \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that there\xe2\x80\x99s not been shown a <em>strong likelihood</em> that the exercise of the peremptory challenges were based upon a group rather than an individual basis,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 272 (emphasis added).  The judge did, however, warn the prosecutor that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98we are very close.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>People</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727, 729 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Defense counsel made an additional motion the next day when the prosecutor struck the final remaining prospective black juror.  30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 272.  Counsel argued that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to challenge all of the prospective black jurors constituted a \xe2\x80\x9csystematic attempt to exclude African-Americans from the jury panel.\xe2\x80\x9d  105 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 729.  The trial judge still did not seek an explanation from the prosecutor.  Instead, he explained that his own examination of the record had convinced him that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons.  Specifically, the judge opined that the black venire members had offered equivocal or confused answers in their written questionnaires.  30 Cal. 4th, at 1307\xe2\x80\x931308, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 272\xe2\x80\x93273.  Despite the fact that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Court would not grant the challenges for cause, there were answers \xe2\x80\xa6 at least on the questionnaires themselves [such] that the Court felt that there was sufficient basis\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for the strikes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1308, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 273 (brackets added).  Therefore, even considering that all of the prospective black jurors had been stricken from the pool, the judge determined that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction.  <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001).  Over the dissent of one judge, the majority ruled that the trial judge had erred by requiring petitioner to establish a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d that the peremptory strikes had been impermissibly based on race.  Instead, the trial judge should have only required petitioner to proffer enough evidence to support an \xe2\x80\x9cinference\xe2\x80\x9d of discrimination.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s holding relied on decisions of this Court, prior California case law, and the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>Wade</em> v. <em>Terhune</em>, 202 F.\xc2\xa03d 1190 (2000).  Applying the proper \xe2\x80\x9creasonable inference\xe2\x80\x9d standard, the majority concluded that petitioner had produced sufficient evidence to support a prima facie<em> </em>case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent appealed, and the California Supreme Court reinstated petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction over the dissent of two justices.  The court stressed that <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/index.html"></a><a href="/us/476/79/index.html">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986), left to state courts the task of establishing the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency of defendants\xe2\x80\x99 prima facie cases.  30 Cal. 4th, at 1314, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 277.  The court then reviewed <em>Batson</em>, <em>Wheeler</em>, and those decisions\xe2\x80\x99 progeny, and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Wheeler\xe2\x80\x99</em>s terms \xe2\x80\x98strong likelihood\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98reasonable inference\xe2\x80\x99 state the same standard\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94one that is entirely consistent with <em>Batson</em>.  30 Cal. 4th, at 1313, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 277.  A prima facie<em> </em>case under <em>Batson </em>establishes a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d it does not merely constitute \xe2\x80\x9cenough evidence to <em>permit the inference</em>\xe2\x80\x9d that discrimination has occurred.  30 Cal. 4th, at 1315, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 278.  <em>Batson</em>, the court held, \xe2\x80\x9cpermits a court to require the objector to present, not merely \xe2\x80\x98some evidence\xe2\x80\x99 permitting the inference, but \xe2\x80\x98strong evidence\xe2\x80\x99 that makes discriminatory intent <em>more likely than not </em>if the challenges are not explained.\xe2\x80\x9d  30 Cal. 4th, at 1316, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 278.  The court opined that while this burden is \xe2\x80\x9cnot onerous,\xe2\x80\x9d it remains \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 279.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying that standard, the court acknowledged that the case involved the \xe2\x80\x9chighly relevant\xe2\x80\x9d circumstance that a black defendant was \xe2\x80\x9ccharged with killing \xe2\x80\x98his White girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s child,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cit certainly looks suspicious that all three African-American prospective jurors were removed from the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1326, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 286.  Yet petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Batson </em>showing, the court held, consisted \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily of the statistical disparity of peremptory challenges between African-Americans and others.\xe2\x80\x9d  30 Cal. 4th, at 1327, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 287.  Although those statistics were indeed \xe2\x80\x9ctroubling and, as the trial court stated, the question was close,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1328, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 287, the court decided to defer to the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully considered ruling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We granted certiorari, but dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction because the judgment was not yet final.  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/428/index.html">541 U.

It concerns the scope of the first of three steps this Court enumerated in <em>Batson</em>, which together guide trial courts\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional review of peremptory strikes.  Those three <em>Batson</em> steps should by now be familiar.  First, the defendant must make out a prima facie<em> </em>case \xe2\x80\x9cby showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U. S., at 93\xe2\x80\x9394 (citing <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/index.html">426 U. S. 229</a>, 239\xe2\x80\x93242 (1976)).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie<em> </em>case, the \xe2\x80\x9cburden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes.  476 U. S., at 94; see also <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/625/index.html">405 U. S. 625</a>, 632 (1972).  Third, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide \xe2\x80\xa6 whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Purkett</em> v. <em>Elem</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/765/index.html">514 U. S. 765</a>, 767 (1995) <em>(per curiam).</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us is whether Batson </em>permits California to require at step one that \xe2\x80\x9cthe objector must show that it is more likely than not the other party\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias.\xe2\x80\x9d  30 Cal. 4th, at 1318, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 280.  Although we recognize that States do have flexibility in formulating appropriate procedures to comply with <em>Batson</em>, we conclude that California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmore likely than not\xe2\x80\x9d standard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a prima facie<em> </em>case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with <em>Batson </em>itself, which on its own terms provides no support for California\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  There, we held that a prima facie case of discrimination can be made out by offering a wide variety of evidence,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives \xe2\x80\x9crise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U. S., at 94.  We explained that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9ca defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  To establish such a case, the defendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s race.  Second, the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact, as to which there can be no dispute, that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits \xe2\x80\x98those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\xe2\x80\x99  Finally, the defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 96 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/559/index.html">345 U. S. 559</a>, 562 (1953)).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, <em>Batson </em>held that because the petitioner had timely objected to the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to strike \xe2\x80\x9call black persons on the venire,\xe2\x80\x9d the trial court was in error when it \xe2\x80\x9cflatly rejected the objection without requiring the prosecutor to give an explanation for his action.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U. S., at 100.  We did not hold that the petitioner had proved discrimination<em>.</em>  Rather, we remanded the case for further proceedings because the trial court failed to demand an explanation from the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, to proceed to <em>Batson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s second step\xe2\x80\x94despite the fact that the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s evidence supported <em>an inference</em> of discrimination.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, in describing the burden-shifting framework, we assumed in <em>Batson</em> that the trial judge would have the benefit of all relevant circumstances, including the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s explanation, before deciding whether it was more likely than not that the challenge was improperly motivated.  We did not intend the first step to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge\xe2\x80\x94on the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with certainty\xe2\x80\x94that the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful discrimination.  Instead, a defendant satisfies the requirements of <em>Batson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first step by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent, however, focuses on <em>Batson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the trial court decides that the facts establish, prima facie, purposeful discrimination and the prosecutor does not come forward with a neutral explanation for his action, our precedents require that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction be reversed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  For this to be true, respondent contends, a <em>Batson </em>claim must prove the ultimate facts by a preponderance of the evidence in the prima facie case; otherwise, the argument goes, a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s failure to respond to a prima facie case would inexplicably entitle a defendant to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of nothing more than an inference that discrimination may have occurred.  Brief for Respondent 13\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument is misguided.  <em>Batson</em>, of course, explicitly stated that the defendant ultimately carries the \xe2\x80\x9cburden of persuasion\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prove the existence of purposeful discrimination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U.

This burden of persuasion \xe2\x80\x9crests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Purkett</em>, 514 U. S., at 768.  Thus, even if the State produces only a frivolous or utterly nonsensical justification for its strike, the case does not end\xe2\x80\x94it merely proceeds to step three.  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</em>  The first two <em>Batson </em>steps govern the production of evidence that allows the trial court to determine the persuasiveness of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claim.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not until the <em>third </em>step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant\xe2\x80\x94the step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Purkett, supra, </em>at 768.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Batson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s purposes further support our conclusion.  The constitutional interests <em>Batson </em>sought to vindicate are not limited to the rights possessed by the defendant on trial, see 476 U. S., at 87, nor to those citizens who desire to participate \xe2\x80\x9cin the administration of the law, as jurors,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strauder</em> v. <em>West Virginia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/100/303/index.html">100 U. S. 303</a>, 308 (1880).  Undoubtedly, the overriding interest in eradicating discrimination from our civic institutions suffers whenever an individual is excluded from making a significant contribution to governance on account of his race.  Yet the \xe2\x80\x9charm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community.  Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Batson</em>, 476 U. S., at 87; see also <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/311/128/index.html">311 U. S. 128</a>, 130 (1940) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor racial discrimination to result in the exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our Constitution and the laws enacted under it but it is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Batson </em>framework is designed to produce actual answers to suspicions and inferences that discrimination may have infected the jury selection process.  See 476 U. S., at 97\xe2\x80\x9398, and n.\xc2\xa020.  The inherent uncertainty present in inquiries of discriminatory purpose counsels against engaging in needless and imperfect speculation when a direct answer can be obtained by asking a simple question.  See <em>Paulino</em> v. <em>Castro</em>, 371 F.\xc2\xa03d 1083, 1090 (CA9 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t does not matter that the prosecutor might have had good reasons \xe2\x80\xa6 [w]hat matters is the real reason they were stricken\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)); <em>Holloway</em> v. <em>Horn</em>, 355 F.\xc2\xa03d 707, 725 (CA3 2004) (speculation \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not aid our inquiry into the reasons the prosecutor actually harbored\xe2\x80\x9d for a peremptory strike).  The three-step process thus simultaneously serves the public purposes <em>Batson </em>is designed to vindicate and encourages \xe2\x80\x9cprompt rulings on objections to peremptory challenges without substantial disruption of the jury selection process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hernandez</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/352/index.html">500 U. S. 352</a>, 358\xe2\x80\x93359 (1991) (opinion of Kennedy, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The disagreements among the state-court judges who reviewed the record in this case illustrate the imprecision of relying on judicial speculation to resolve plausible claims of discrimination.  In this case the inference of discrimination was sufficient to invoke a comment by the trial judge \xe2\x80\x9cthat \xe2\x80\x98we are very close,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and on review, the California Supreme acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cit certainly looks suspicious that all three African-American prospective jurors were removed from the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 1326, 71 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 273, 286.  Those inferences that discrimination may have occurred were sufficient to establish a prima facie case under <em>Batson</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The facts of this case well illustrate that California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmore likely than not\xe2\x80\x9d standard is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by <em>Batson</em>.
