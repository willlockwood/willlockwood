The District Court ruled in favor of the merchants, but the Court of Appeals vacated the judgment with instructions to dismiss.  The Court of Appeals concluded that in the context of single-sticker pricing\xe2\x80\x94where merchants post one price and would like to charge more to customers who pay by credit card\xe2\x80\x94the law required that the sticker price be the same as the price charged to credit card users.  In that context, the law regulated a relationship between two prices.  Relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent holding that price regulation alone regulates conduct, not speech, the Court of Appeals concluded that \xc2\xa7518 did not violate the\n \nFirst Amendment.

The Court of Appeals concluded that \xc2\xa7518 posed no\n \nFirst Amendment problem because price controls regulate conduct, not speech.  Section 518, however, is not like a typical price regulation, which simply regulates the amount a store can collect.  The law tells merchants nothing about the amount they are allowed to collect from a cash or credit card payer.  Instead, it regulates how sellers may communicate their prices.  In regulating the communication of prices rather than prices themselves, \xc2\xa7518 regulates speech.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Because the Court of Appeals concluded otherwise, it did not determine whether \xc2\xa7518 survives\n \nFirst Amendment scrutiny.

Some merchants balk at paying the fees and want to discourage the use of credit cards, or at least pass on the fees to customers who use them.  One method of achieving those ends is through differential pricing\xe2\x80\x94charging credit card users more than customers using cash.  Merchants who wish to employ differential pricing may do so in two ways relevant here: impose a surcharge for the use of a credit card, or offer a discount for the use of cash.  In N.\xc2\xa0Y. Gen. Bus. Law \xc2\xa7518, New York has banned the former practice.  The question presented is whether \xc2\xa7518 regulates merchants\xe2\x80\x99 speech and\xe2\x80\x94if so\xe2\x80\x94whether the statute violates the\n \nFirst Amendment.  We conclude that \xc2\xa7518 does regulate speech and remand for the Court of Appeals to determine in the first instance whether that regulation is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">When credit cards were first introduced, contracts between card issuers and merchants barred merchants from charging credit card users higher prices than cash customers.  Congress put a partial stop to this practice in the 1974 amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).  The amendments prohibited card issuers from contractually preventing merchants from giving discounts to customers who paid in cash.  See \xc2\xa7306,\n\n88Stat.\n1515.  The law, however, said nothing about surcharges for the use of credit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two years later, Congress refined its dissimilar treatment of discounts and surcharges.  First, the 1976 version of TILA barred merchants from imposing surcharges on customers who use credit cards.  Act of Feb. 27, 1976, \xc2\xa73(c)(1),\n\n90Stat.\n197.  Second, Congress added definitions of the two terms.  A discount was \xe2\x80\x9ca reduction made from the regular price,\xe2\x80\x9d while a surcharge was \xe2\x80\x9cany means of increasing the regular price to a cardholder which is not imposed upon customers paying by cash, check, or similar means.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73(a), <i>ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1981, Congress further delineated the distinction between discounts and surcharges by defining \xe2\x80\x9cregular price.\xe2\x80\x9d  Where a merchant \xe2\x80\x9ctagged or posted\xe2\x80\x9d a single price, the regular price was that single price.  Cash Discount Act, \xc2\xa7102(a),\n\n95Stat.\n144.  If no price was tagged or posted, or if a merchant employed a two-tag approach\xe2\x80\x94posting one price for credit and another for cash\xe2\x80\x94the regular price was whatever was charged to credit card users.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Because a surcharge was defined as an increase from the regular price, there could be no credit card surcharge where the regular price was the same as the amount charged to customers using credit cards.  The effect of all this was that a merchant could violate the surcharge ban only by posting a single price and charging credit card users more than that posted price.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The federal surcharge ban was short lived.  Congress allowed it to expire in 1984 and has not renewed the ban since.  See \xc2\xa7201, <i>ibid</i>.  The provision preventing credit card issuers from contractually barring discounts for cash, however, remained in place.  With the lapse of the federal surcharge ban, several States, New York among them, immediately enacted their own surcharge bans.  Passed in 1984, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Gen. Bus. Law \xc2\xa7518 adopted the operative language of the federal ban verbatim, providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.\xe2\x80\x9d  N.\xc2\xa0Y. Gen. Bus. Law Ann. \xc2\xa7518 (West 2012); see also\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71666f(a)(2) (1982 ed.).  Unlike the federal ban, the New York legislation included no definition of \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to these state legislative bans, credit card companies\xe2\x80\x94though barred from prohibiting discounts for cash\xe2\x80\x94included provisions in their contracts prohibiting merchants from imposing surcharges for credit card use.  For most of its history, the New York law was essentially coextensive with these contractual prohibitions.  In recent years, however, merchants have brought antitrust challenges to contractual no-surcharge provisions.  Those suits have created uncertainty about the legal validity of such contractual surcharge bans.  The result is that otherwise redundant legislative surcharge bans like \xc2\xa7518 have increasingly gained importance, and increasingly come under scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioners, five New York businesses and their owners, wish to impose surcharges on customers who use credit cards.  Each time one of their customers pays with a credit card, these merchants must pay some transaction fee to the company that issued the credit card.  The fee is generally two to three percent of the purchase price.  Those fees add up, and the merchants allege that they pay tens of thousands of dollars every year to credit card companies.  Rather than increase prices across the board to absorb those costs, the merchants want to pass the fees along only to their customers who choose to use credit cards.  They also want to make clear that they are not the bad guys\xe2\x80\x94that the credit card companies, not the merchants, are responsible for the higher prices.  The merchants believe that surcharges for credit are more effective than discounts for cash in accomplishing these goals.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2013, after several major credit card issuers agreed to drop their contractual surcharge prohibitions, the merchants filed suit against the New York Attorney General and three New York District Attorneys to challenge \xc2\xa7518\xe2\x80\x94the only remaining obstacle to their charging surcharges for credit card use.  As relevant here, they argued that the law violated the\n \nFirst Amendment by regulating how they communicated their prices, and that it was unconstitutionally vague because liability under the law \xe2\x80\x9cturn[ed] on the blurry difference\xe2\x80\x9d between surcharges and discounts.  App. 39, Complaint \xc2\xb651.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court ruled in favor of the merchants.  It read the statute as \xe2\x80\x9cdraw[ing a] line between prohibited \xe2\x80\x98surcharges\xe2\x80\x99 and permissible \xe2\x80\x98discounts\xe2\x80\x99 based on words and labels, rather than economic realities.\xe2\x80\x9d  975 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 430, 444 (SDNY 2013).  The court concluded that the law therefore regulated speech, and violated the\n \nFirst Amendment under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s commercial speech doctrine.  In addition, because the law turned on the \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually incomprehensible distinction between what a vendor can and cannot tell its customers,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court found that the law was unconstitutionally vague.  <i>Id.,</i> at 436.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the judgment of the District Court with instructions to dismiss the merchants\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  It began by considering single-sticker pricing, where merchants post one price and would like to charge more to customers who pay by credit card.  All the law did in this context, the Court of Appeals explained, was regulate a relationship between two prices\xe2\x80\x94the sticker price and the price charged to a credit card user\xe2\x80\x94by requiring that the two prices be equal.  Relying on our precedent holding that price regulation alone regulates conduct, not speech, the Court of Appeals concluded that \xc2\xa7518 did not violate the\n \nFirst Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court also considered other types of pricing regimes\xe2\x80\x94for example, posting separate cash and credit prices.  The Court of Appeals thought it \xe2\x80\x9cfar from clear\xe2\x80\x9d that \xc2\xa7518 prohibited such pricing schemes.  808 F.\xc2\xa03d 118, 137 (CA2 2015).  The federal surcharge ban on which \xc2\xa7518 was modeled did not apply outside the single-sticker context, and the merchants had not clearly shown that \xc2\xa7518 had a \xe2\x80\x9cbroader reach\xe2\x80\x9d than the federal law.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Deciding that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge in this regard \xe2\x80\x9cturn[ed] on an unsettled question of state law,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals abstained from reaching the merits of the constitutional question beyond the single-sticker context.  <i>Id.,</i> at 135 (citing <i>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Tex.</i> v. <i>Pullman Co.</i>,\n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 496 (1941)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari.  579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As a preliminary matter, we note that petitioners present us with a limited challenge.  Observing that the merchants were not always particularly clear about the scope of their suit, the Court of Appeals deemed them to be bringing a facial attack on \xc2\xa7518 as well as a challenge to the application of the statute to two particular pricing regimes: single-sticker pricing and two-sticker pricing.  Before us, however, the merchants have disclaimed a facial challenge, assuring us that theirs is an as-applied challenge only.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\xe2\x80\x935, 18.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There remains the question of what precise application of the law they seek to challenge.  Although the merchants have presented a wide array of hypothetical pricing regimes, they have expressly identified only one pricing scheme that they seek to employ: posting a cash price and an additional credit card surcharge, expressed either as a percentage surcharge or a \xe2\x80\x9cdollars-and-cents\xe2\x80\x9d additional amount.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, App. 101\xe2\x80\x93102, 104; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\xe2\x80\x935, 18.  Under this pricing approach, petitioner Expressions Hair Design might, for example, post a sign outside its salon reading \xe2\x80\x9cHaircuts $10 (we add a 3% surcharge if you pay by credit card).\xe2\x80\x9d  Or, petitioner Brooklyn Farmacy &amp; Soda Fountain might list one of the sundaes on its menu as costing \xe2\x80\x9c$10 (with a $0.30 surcharge for credit card users).\xe2\x80\x9d  We take petitioners at their word and limit our review to the question whether \xc2\xa7518 is unconstitutional as applied to this particular pricing practice.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The next question is whether \xc2\xa7518 prohibits the pricing regime petitioners wish to employ.  The Court of Appeals concluded that it does.  The court read \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7518 to mean \xe2\x80\x9can additional amount above the seller\xe2\x80\x99s regular price,\xe2\x80\x9d and found it \xe2\x80\x9cbasically self-evident\xe2\x80\x9d how \xc2\xa7518 applies to sellers who post a single sticker price: \xe2\x80\x9cthe sticker price is the \xe2\x80\x98regular\xe2\x80\x99 price, so sellers may not charge credit-card customers an additional amount above the sticker price that is not also charged to cash customers.\xe2\x80\x9d  808 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 128.  Under this interpretation, signs of the kind that the merchants wish to post\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c$10, with a $0.30 surcharge for credit card users\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94violate \xc2\xa7518 because they identify one sticker price\xe2\x80\x94$10\xe2\x80\x94and indicate that credit card users are charged more than that amount.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cWe generally accord great deference to the interpretation and application of state law by the courts of appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pembaur</i> v. <i>Cincinnati</i>,\n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 469\n, n.\xc2\xa013 (1986).  This deference is warranted to \xe2\x80\x9crender unnecessary review of their decisions in this respect\xe2\x80\x9d and because lower fed-eral courts \xe2\x80\x9care better schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Brockett</i> v. <i>Spokane Arcades, Inc.</i>,\n\n472 U.\xc2\xa0S. 491,\n500 (1985)\n (quoting <i>Cort</i> v. <i>Ash</i>,\n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 66\n, n.\xc2\xa06 (1975); internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e surely have the authority to differ with the lower federal courts as to the meaning of a state statute,\xe2\x80\x9d and have done so in instances where the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s construction was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly wrong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cplain error.\xe2\x80\x9d  472 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 500, and n.\xc2\xa09 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that is not the case here.  Section 518 does not define \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge,\xe2\x80\x9d but the Court of Appeals looked to the ordinary meaning of the term: \xe2\x80\x9ca charge in excess of the usual or normal amount.\xe2\x80\x9d  808 F. 3d, at 127 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2299 (2002); internal quotation marks omitted).  Where a seller posts a single sticker price, it is reasonable to treat that sticker price as the \xe2\x80\x9cusual or normal amount\xe2\x80\x9d and conclude, as the court below did, that a merchant imposes a surcharge when he charges a credit card user more than that sticker price.  In short, we cannot dismiss the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xc2\xa7518 as \xe2\x80\x9cclearly wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, consistent with our customary practice, we follow that interpretation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Having concluded that \xc2\xa7518 bars the pricing regime petitioners wish to employ, we turn to their constitutional arguments: that the law unconstitutionally regulates speech and is impermissibly vague.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court of Appeals concluded that \xc2\xa7518 posed no\n \nFirst Amendment problem because the law regulated conduct, not speech.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals began with the premise that price controls regulate conduct alone.  See <i>44 Liquormart, Inc.</i> v. <i>Rhode Island</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 484,\n507 (1996)\n (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 524 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 530 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  Section 518 regulates the relationship between\xe2\x80\x9c(1) the seller\xe2\x80\x99s sticker price and (2) the price the seller charges to credit card customers,\xe2\x80\x9d requiring that these two amounts be equal.  808 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 131.  A law regulating the relationship between two prices regulates speech nomore than a law regulating a single price.  The Court of Ap-peals concluded that \xc2\xa7518 was therefore simply a conduct regulation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But \xc2\xa7518 is not like a typical price regulation.  Such a regulation\xe2\x80\x94for example, a law requiring all New York delis to charge $10 for their sandwiches\xe2\x80\x94would simply regulate the amount that a store could collect.  In other words, it would regulate the sandwich seller\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  To be sure, in order to actually collect that money, a store would likely have to put \xe2\x80\x9c$10\xe2\x80\x9d on its menus or have its employees tell customers that price.  Those written or oral communications would be speech, and the law\xe2\x80\x94by determining the amount charged\xe2\x80\x94would indirectly dictate the content of that speech.  But the law\xe2\x80\x99s effect on speech would be only incidental to its primary effect on conduct, and \xe2\x80\x9cit has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rumsfeld</i> v. <i>Forum for Aca-demic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47,\n62 (2006)\n (quoting <i>Giboney</i> v. <i>Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co.</i>,\n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 490,\n502 (1949)\n; internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Sorrell</i> v. <i>IMS Health Inc.</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552,\n567 (2011)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 518 is different.  The law tells merchants nothing about the amount they are allowed to collect from a cash or credit card payer.  Sellers are free to charge $10 for cash and $9.70, $10, $10.30, or any other amount for credit.  What the law does regulate is how sellers may communicate their prices.  A merchant who wants to charge $10 for cash and $10.30 for credit may not convey that price any way he pleases.

Instead, if the merchant wishes to post a single sticker price, he must display $10.30 ashis sticker price.  Accordingly, while we agree with the Court of Appeals that \xc2\xa7518 regulates a relationship between a sticker price and the price charged to credit card users, we cannot accept its conclusion that \xc2\xa7518 is nothing more than a mine-run price regulation.  In regulating the communication of prices rather than prices themselves, \xc2\xa7518 regulates speech.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because it concluded otherwise, the Court of Appeals had no occasion to conduct a further inquiry into whether \xc2\xa7518, as a speech regulation, survived\n \nFirst Amendment scrutiny.  On that question, the parties dispute whether \xc2\xa7518 is a valid commercial speech regulation under <i>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.</i> v. <i>Public Serv.

Although the merchants argue that \xe2\x80\x9cno one can seem to put a finger on just how far the law sweeps,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners 51, it is at least clear that \xc2\xa7518 proscribes their intended speech.

But that is because virtually all government regulation affects speech.  Human relations take place through speech.  And human relations include community activities of all kinds\xe2\x80\x94commercial and otherwise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the government seeks to regulate those activities, it is often wiser not to try to distinguish between \xe2\x80\x9cspeech\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  See R. Post, Democracy, Expertise, and Academic Freedom 3\xe2\x80\x934 (2012).  Instead, we can, and normally do, simply ask whether, or how, a challenged statute, rule, or regulation affects an interest that the\n \nFirst Amendment protects.  If, for example, a challenged government regulation negatively affects the processes through which political discourse or public opinion is formed or expressed (interests close to the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protective core), courts normally scrutinize that regulation with great care.  See, <i>e.g., Boos</i> v. <i>Barry</i>,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 312,\n321 (1988)\n.  If the challenged regulation restricts the \xe2\x80\x9cinformational function\xe2\x80\x9d provided by truthful commercial speech, courts will apply a \xe2\x80\x9clesser\xe2\x80\x9d (but still elevated) form of scrutiny.  <i>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.</i> v. <i>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557\n\xe2\x80\x93564 (1980).  If, however, a challenged regulation simply requires a commercial speaker to disclose \xe2\x80\x9cpurely factual and uncontroversial information,\xe2\x80\x9d courts will apply a more permissive standard of review.  <i>Zauderer</i> v. <i>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 626,\n651 (1985)\n.  Because that kind of regulation normally has only a \xe2\x80\x9cminimal\xe2\x80\x9d effect on\n \nFirst Amendment interests, it normally need only be \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related to the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing deception of consumers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Courts apply a similarly permissive standard of review to \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Carolene Products Co.</i>,\n\n304 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144,\n152 (1938)\n.  Since that legislation normally does not significantly affect the interests that the\n \nFirst Amendment protects, we normally look only for assurance that the legislation \xe2\x80\x9crests upon some rational basis.\xe2\x80\x9d <i> Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I repeat these well-known general standards or judicial approaches both because I believe that determining the proper approach is typically more important than trying to distinguish \xe2\x80\x9cspeech\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d see <i>Sorrell</i> v. <i>IMS Health Inc.</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552,\n582 (2011)\n (Breyer, J., dissenting), and because the parties here differ as to which approach applies.  That difference reflects the fact that it is not clear just what New York\xe2\x80\x99s law does.  On its face, the law seems simply to tell merchants that they cannot charge higher prices to credit-card users.  If so, then it is an ordinary piece of commercial legislation subject to \xe2\x80\x9crational basis\xe2\x80\x9d review.  See <i>44 Liquormart, Inc.</i> v. <i>Rhode Island</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 484,\n507 (1996)\n (opinion of Stevens, J.).  It may, however, make more sense to interpret the statute as working like the expired federal law that it replaced.  If so, it would require a merchant, who posts prices and who wants to charge a higher credit-card price, simply to disclose that credit-card price.  See 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71602(q\xc2\xa0), (x), 1666f(a)(2) (1982 ed.); see also <i>post</i>,<i> </i>at 9 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment).  In that case, though affecting the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspeech,\xe2\x80\x9d it would not hinder the transmission of information to the public; the merchant would remain free to say whatever it wanted so long as it also revealed its credit-card price to customers.  Accordingly, the law would still receive a deferential form of review.  See <i>Zauderer</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 651.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nonetheless, petitioners suggest that the statute does more.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Brief for Petitioners 28 (arguing that the statute forbids \xe2\x80\x9c[f\xc2\xa0]raming the price difference .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as a credit surcharge\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the statute\xe2\x80\x99s operation is unclear and because its interpretation is a matter of state law, I agree with the majority that we should remand the case to the Second Circuit.  I also agree with Justice Sotomayor that on remand, it may well be helpful for the Second Circuit to ask the New York Court of Appeals to clarify the nature of the obligations the statute imposes.

Y. Gen. Bus. Law Ann. \xc2\xa7518 (West 2012).  A merchant who violates this prohibition commits a misdemeanor and risks \xe2\x80\x9ca fine not to exceed five hundred dollars or a term of imprisonment up to one year, or both.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 518 can be interpreted in several ways.  On first read, its prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[ing] a surcharge\xe2\x80\x9d on credit card customers appears to prohibit charging customers who pay with a credit card more than those who pay by other means.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1579 (9th ed. 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9csurcharge\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n additional tax, charge, or cost\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is, \xc2\xa7518 may require a merchant to charge all customers the same price, no matter the form of payment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An earlier federal law containing an almost identical prohibition muddies the path to this plain text reading.  A 1976 amendment to the Truth in Lending Act set out a temporary prohibition barring a \xe2\x80\x9cseller in any sales transaction\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[ing] a surcharge on a cardholder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73(c)(1),\n\n90Stat.\n197.  The amendment also defined a \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany means of increasing the regular price to a cardholder which is not imposed upon customers paying by cash, check, or similar means.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73(a), <i>ibid</i>.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]egular price\xe2\x80\x9d was later defined to mean the displayed price if a merchant displayed only one price or the credit card price if the merchant either did not display prices or displayed both cash and credit card prices.  \xc2\xa7102(a),\n\n95Stat.\n144.  Under that definition, a merchant violated the federal prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[ing] a surcharge\xe2\x80\x9d by displaying in dollars-and-cents form only one price\xe2\x80\x94the cash price\xe2\x80\x94and then charging credit card customers a higher price.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the federal law lapsed in 1984, New York enacted \xc2\xa7518, which sets out the same ban on \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[ing] a surcharge.\xe2\x80\x9d  New York borrowed the federal prohibition almost verbatim.  But it chose, without explanation, not to borrow the federal definitions or to enact clarifying definitions of its own.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The difference between the laws leaves \xc2\xa7518 open to at least three interpretations.  It could be read in line with its plain text to require that a merchant charge the same price to all his customers.  It could be read in line with the lapsed federal ban to permit a merchant to charge different prices to cash and credit card customers but to prohibit a merchant from displaying in dollars-and-cents form only the cash price and then charging credit card customers a higher price.  On this reading, \xc2\xa7518 would not apply where a merchant displays in dollars-and-cents form only the credit card price and then charges a lower price to cash customers, or where a merchant displays both the cash and credit card prices in dollars-and-cents form.  Or it could be read more broadly, based on the omission of the definitions that had limited the federal ban\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  On this reading, \xc2\xa7518 might prohibit a merchant from characterizing the difference between the cash and credit card prices as a \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge,\xe2\x80\x9d no matter how he displays his prices.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Confirming the elusive nature of \xc2\xa7518, New York has pressed almost all of these interpretations during this litigation.  Before the District Court, it viewed \xc2\xa7518 as mirroring the lapsed federal ban.  See 975 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 430, 442 (SDNY 2013).  Before the Second Circuit, it offered the lapsed federal ban as a narrowing interpretation, thus suggesting that \xc2\xa7518 applies more broadly than that provision.  See 808 F.\xc2\xa03d 118, 140, n.\xc2\xa013 (2015).  And before this Court, it explained that other prosecutorial entities in New York are not bound by its interpretation of \xc2\xa7518 (or the interpretations of the state district attorneys who are parties to this case), leaving open the possibility of still other interpretations.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioners here are five New York merchants.  When a customer pays with a credit card, petitioners (like all merchants) are charged a processing fee by the card issuer.  Petitioners want to pass that fee on to their credit card paying customers, but not their cash paying customers.  They want to charge cash customers one price and credit card customers a higher price that includes the processing fee.  One petitioner, Expressions Hair Design, currently does pass the costs of credit card processing fees on to its credit card paying customers.  The other four charge one price to all customers.  They set their prices to account for the processing fees they predict they will incur.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All five would prefer to use a different pricing system or display than the ones they use now.  Expressions Hair Design and Five Points Academy would like to charge cash and credit card customers two different prices and to display a dollars-and-cents cash price alongside the extra charge for credit card customers\xe2\x80\x94say, \xe2\x80\x9c$100 with a 3% credit card charge\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c$100 with a $3 credit card charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brooklyn Farmacy &amp; Soda Fountain, Brite Buy Wines &amp; Spirits, and Patio.com want to charge cash and credit card customers two different prices and to characterize the difference in prices as a \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge\xe2\x80\x9d when they display or convey their prices to customers.  App. 47\xe2\x80\x9348, 51, 57.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All five do not use their preferred pricing systems or displays for fear of violating \xc2\xa7518.  Expressions Hair Design and Five Points Academy believe \xc2\xa7518 prohibits their pricing display because it would convey the credit card processing costs impermissibly as a surcharge, rather than permissibly as a discount\xe2\x80\x94say, \xe2\x80\x9c$103 with a 3% discount for cash payment\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c$103 with a $3 discount for cash payment.\xe2\x80\x9d  The other three petitioners believe that \xc2\xa7518 regulates how they can describe the difference between cash and credit card prices.  Because \xc2\xa7518 does not, in their view, clearly state just how it regulates those descriptions, they have decided that the uncertainty counsels against a change.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners view \xc2\xa7518 as an unconstitutional restriction on their ability to display and describe their prices to their customers.  And so they sued and challenged the law on\n \nFirst Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Resolving petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to \xc2\xa7518 requires an accurate picture of how, exactly, the statute works.  That understanding is needed both to decide whether \xc2\xa7518 prohibits petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 preferred pricing systems and displays and, if so, whether that prohibition is consistent with the\n \nFirst Amendment.  See 808 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 141; <i>ante,</i> at 10, n.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the Second Circuit did not decide just how far \xc2\xa7518 extends.  It instead decided how \xc2\xa7518 applies to part of the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge\xe2\x80\x94the pricing display Expressions Hair Design and Five Points Academy wish to use\xe2\x80\x94and declined to decide how, or even if, \xc2\xa7518 applies to the rest of the challenge.  While \xc2\xa7518 evades easy interpretation, a partial decision was neither required nor right.  The court below erred by not asking the New York Court of Appeals for a definitive interpretation of \xc2\xa7518, and this Court errs by not correcting it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Given a constitutional challenge that turned on the interpretation of an ambiguous state statute not yet definitively interpreted by the state courts, the Second Circuit faced a problem.  Any interpretation it gave \xc2\xa7518 would not be authoritative since state courts, not federal courts, have the final word on the interpretation of state statutes.  But it had before it two routes\xe2\x80\x94abstention and certification\xe2\x80\x94to a solution.  Both would have allowed it to secure an authoritative interpretation of \xc2\xa7518 before resolving the constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this context, abstention and certification serve the same goals.  Both recognize that when the outcome of a constitutional challenge turns on the proper interpretation of state law, a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the constitutional question may turn out to be unnecessary.  The state courts could later interpret the state statute differently.  And the state court\xe2\x80\x99s different interpretation might result in a statute that implicates no constitutional question, or that renders the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional analysis irrelevant.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Arizonans for Official English</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43,\n79 (1997)\n; <i>Brockett</i> v. <i>Spokane Arcades, Inc.</i>,\n\n472 U.\xc2\xa0S. 491\n\xe2\x80\x93509 (1985) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).  Abstention and certification avoid this risk by deferring a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the constitutionality of the state statute until a state court has authoritatively resolved the antecedent state-law question.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Abstention is a blunt instrument. Under <i>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Tex.</i> v. <i>Pullman Co.</i>,\n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 496 (1941)\n, a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to abstain sends the plaintiff to state court.  Once the plaintiff obtains the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 views on the statute, he may return to federal court, state- court decision in hand, for resolution of the constitutional question.  <i>Pullman</i> abstention thus \xe2\x80\x9centail[s] a full round of litigation in the state court system before any resumption of proceedings in federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arizonans for Official English</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 76.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Certification offers a more precise tool.  In States that have authorized certification, a federal court may \xe2\x80\x9cput the [state-law] question directly to the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, reducing the delay, cutting the cost, and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative response.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The rule relevant here is typical of certification statutes.

As a result, \xe2\x80\x9cthe availability of certification greatly simplifies the analysis\xe2\x80\x9d of whether to abstain.  <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird</i>,\n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132,\n151 (1976)\n; see also <i>Arizonans for Official English</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75 (\xe2\x80\x9cCertification today covers territory once dominated by a deferral device called <i>Pullman</i> abstention\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And this Court has described abstention as particularly problematic where, as here, a challenge to a state statute rests on the\n \nFirst Amendment.  Cf. <i>Virginia</i> v. <i>American Booksellers Assn., Inc.</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383,\n396 (1988)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cCertification, in contrast to the more cumbersome and (in this context) problematic abstention doctrine, is a method by which we may expeditiously obtain that construction\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Houston</i> v. <i>Hill</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 451\n\xe2\x80\x93468 (1987).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court below chose a convoluted course: It rejected certification, abstained in part, and decided the question in part.  It did so by dividing petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge into two parts.  As to the first part, it held that \xc2\xa7518 did prohibit the pricing display that Expressions Hair Design and Five Points Academy prefer: displaying the cash price alongside the credit card charge.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  It found this application of \xc2\xa7518 consistent with the\n \nFirst Amendment.  See 808 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 130.  As to the second part, it declined to address whether \xc2\xa7518 speaks to, or unconstitutionally restricts, how petitioners who wish to display both the cash and credit card prices in dollars-and-cents form can describe the difference between those prices.  See <i>id.,</i> at 136.  It doubted whether \xc2\xa7518 did reach that broadly and assumed that, even if it did, the New York state courts would construe the statute more narrowly\xe2\x80\x94in line with the lapsed federal provision.  And so the court declined to certify the question and chose instead to abstain from deciding this part of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge.  See <i>id</i>., at 137\xe2\x80\x93139.  It did so even though New York, responsible for enforcing \xc2\xa7518, had \xe2\x80\x9cnever quite abandon[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d its position that \xc2\xa7518 might reach more broadly than the lapsed federal provision.  <i>Id.,</i> at 140, n.\xc2\xa013.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Second Circuit should have exercised its discretion to certify the antecedent state-law question here: What pricing schemes or pricing displays does \xc2\xa7518 prohibit?  Certification might have avoided the need for a constitutional ruling altogether.  If the state court reads \xc2\xa7518 only as a price regulation, no constitutional concerns are implicated.  Compare <i>44 Liquormart, Inc.</i> v. <i>Rhode Island</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 484,\n507 (1996)\n (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cdirect regulation\xe2\x80\x9d of prices does \xe2\x80\x9cnot involve any restriction on speech\xe2\x80\x9d), with <i>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy</i> v. <i>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.</i>,\n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 748,\n761 (1976)\n (price advertisements contain protected speech because they convey a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98idea\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I will sell you the X prescription drug at the Y price\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Or certification might have limited the scope of the constitutional challenge in the case.  If the state court reads \xc2\xa7518 to mirror the lapsed federal ban, that would eliminate the need for a constitutional ruling on the second part of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge (premised on a reading of \xc2\xa7518 that prohibits more than the lapsed federal ban).  At the very least, certification would have allowed the court to resolve petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 entire challenge in one go.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Second Circuit declined to exercise its discretion to certify because it viewed the \xe2\x80\x9cstate of the record\xe2\x80\x9d as too underdeveloped.  808 F. 3d, at 141.  It thought that the New York Court of Appeals could not interpret \xc2\xa7518, and that it could not resolve the challenge to \xc2\xa7518, basedon that record.  Both issues are pure questions of law: whether \xc2\xa7518 prohibits petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 preferred pricing sys-tems and displays (a statutory interpretation question for theNew York Court of Appeals) and whether \xc2\xa7518 survives petitioners\xe2\x80\x99\n \nFirst Amendment challenge (a constitutional question for the Second Circuit).  And both issues turn on only a limited set of facts\xe2\x80\x94the pricing systems and displays that petitioners wish to use.  As discussed above, the record contains those facts.  The \xe2\x80\x9cstate of the record\xe2\x80\x9d thus does not counsel against certification.  Given the significant benefits certification offered and given the absence of persuasive downsides identified by the Second Circuit, the decision not to certify was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The consequences of the decision not to certify reverberate throughout the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today.  For lack of a definitive interpretation of \xc2\xa7518, it chooses to address only the first part of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge and to defer to the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s partial interpretation of \xc2\xa7518.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  It then holds that \xc2\xa7518 does restrict constitutionally protected speech.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  But it does not decide whether \xc2\xa7518\xe2\x80\x99s restriction is constitutionally permissible because doing so would require it to answer the ever-present question in this case: \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the statute permits .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pricing schemes like the one .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Expressions currently uses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10, n.\xc2\xa03.  And so it sends this case back to the Second Circuit for further proceedings.  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\xe2\x80\x9cThe complexity\xe2\x80\x9d of this case \xe2\x80\x9cmight have been avoided,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Arizonans for Official English</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 79, had the Second Circuit certified the question of \xc2\xa7518\xe2\x80\x99s meaning when the case was first before it.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not foreclose the Second Circuit from choosing that route on remand.  But rather than contributing to the piecemeal resolution of this case, I would vacate the judgment below and remand with instructions to certify the case to the New York Court of Appeals to allow it to definitively interpret \xc2\xa7518.  I thus concur only in the judgment.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0This is the interpretation of the lapsed federal ban offered by the United States and accepted by the majority.

New York has pursued one \xc2\xa7518 prosecution, which resulted in a conviction later set aside on appeal.  The decision supports, but does not require, giving \xc2\xa7518 a broader reading than the lapsed federal ban.  See <i>People</i> v. <i>Fulvio</i>, 136 Misc. 2d 334, 344\xe2\x80\x93345, 517 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa02d 1008, 1015 (1987) (stating that \xc2\xa7518 permits a conviction for being \xe2\x80\x9ccareless enough to describe the higher price in terms which amount to the \xe2\x80\x98credit price\xe2\x80\x99 having been derived from adding a charge to the lower price\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).  A more recent enforcement spree is more opaque.  A group of merchants state that when a customer called asking for their prices, they would quote the cash price and tell the customers they charged, for example, \xe2\x80\x9ca $.05 surcharge\xe2\x80\x9d for payment with a credit card.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. 107.  They state that in 2009 the New York Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office told them that they had violated \xc2\xa7518, directed them to stop, and explained that they could comply with \xc2\xa7518 by quoting the credit card price and offering a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscoun[t]\xe2\x80\x9d for payment with cash.  <i>Ibid.</i>  While these merchants\xe2\x80\x99 acts would have violated the lapsed federal ban\xe2\x80\x94by stating a single cash price and then charging a higher price to credit card customers\xe2\x80\x94the recent enforcement actions do not demonstrate that \xc2\xa7518 prohibits only those acts and stretches no further.  And because the New York attorney general lacks the author-ity to adopt an interpretation of \xc2\xa7518 that binds other prosecutorial entities in the State, these enforcement actions speak only to how the attorney general may interpret \xc2\xa7518.
