[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] A writ of error was brought by the plaintiff in the partition on the judgment of the Common Pleas, but that judgment being affirmed by the Supreme Court, the cause was removed into this Court, by the same party. </p><p> For the plaintiff in error (who was also the plaintiff in the partition) Lewis made the following objections to the proceedings. </p><p> 1st. That the original writ, declaration, and judgment, only call for a partition of lands in Hellam township; but the judicial writ recites the original writ to have been for lands in Hellam and Windsor townships, and commands a division of them; and the return and final judgment are for lands in Hellam and Windsor townships. The declaration, judgment, and execution, must pursue the writ; and if the execution does not pursue the judgment it is a nullity. Execution is obtaining the actual possession of the thing recovered by law; but the lands in Windsor township never were recovered. 1 Inst. 154.a. Ibid. 289. 2 Bac. Abr. 329. It is evidently an error of the attorney; but can he correct his errors in this way? The authorities, both in criminal and civil cases, show the contrary; for, although it may not be necessary to name a township, town, street, &amp;c. in the process and pleadings, if they are named, they must be proved. 2 Hawk. P. C. ch. 46. s. 34. Salk. 661. Bull. N. P. 89. Hob. 37, 8. 2 Inst. 513. Is it possible, however, to maintain, that an execution can issue for a greater quantity of lands, or for different lands, than what is recovered by the judgment upon which it is founded? The law is incontestably established, that the slightest variance in the recital of a record, as between the count and the writ, so between the judgment and the execution, is fatal. Cro. E. 185. 329, 330. 829. 2 Lutw. 1179. 1181. 2 Vent. 153. Gilb. C. B. 50. 3. 239. Besides, the statutes of jeoffaille do not extend to judicial writs, when the party has no day in Court: and under the authority of the present judicial writ, any other lands might as well have been divided, as those demanded in the declaration and recovered by the judgment. </p><p> 2d. That the original writ, the declaration, and the judgment, are for a ferry, six messuages, &amp;c. but the judicial writ omits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 4 U.S. 67, 70</a></p><p> the ferry in the mandatory clause; and yet the ferry is divided by the inquest, who could only act to the extent of the command and authority in the writ of partition. This, too, is a mistake; but the consequences would be ruinous, indeed, if it could be arbitrarily corrected by the sheriff or the inquest. The sheriff must execute the command of the Court, doing neither more, nor less; as he was not commanded to divide the ferry, he had no authority to do so; and, of course, the division is a nullity. Hob. 37, 8. Moore 19. 3d. That the inquest have assigned a fishery to the plaintiffs, which never was put in demand; and the defendants sweep the same water. 2 Bl. Com. 190, 191. 2 Keb. 413. 580. 4th. That it does not appear, on the sheriff\'s return, that the parties attended, or were warned to attend, the execution of the writ of partition; though this was commanded by the writ, is required by the law, and is recognised by all the precedents. 5th. That the return to the writ of partition does not state that the premises were assigned and delivered to the respective parties, as the writ directs; but merely that they were allotted. These objections were answered by Ingersoll and Hopkins, for the defendant in error, substantially as follows: 1st. That every intendment will be made in favour of a judgment; 2 Keb. 413. and it is admitted, that all the proceedings are regular till the issuing of the judicial writ. In the execution of that writ, also, the Court will presume the sheriff has acted lawfully and faithfully till the contrary is shown. But it appears, on a connected view of the record, that the property demanded, is the same property that was divided, the words \'same\' and \'thereof\' applying relatively from the first to the last of the process, as designating the same specific property. It is true, that the name of Windsor township is first introduced in the judicial writ; but if the introduction is not tolerated as an amendment for the sake of greater certainty, it ought to be disregarded as surplusage. The writ of partition was issued by the plaintiffs, who cannot take advantage of their own error; Moore, 692. 5 Com. Dig. 301. 3 Bl. Com. 16. the judgment on the return, it will be presumed, was rendered at their instance, at least they appeared by an attorney on the record; and there has been a long acquiescence of the parties. 2d. That the ferry, though accidentally omitted in one clause of the judicial writ, is mentioned in other of its clauses, and is contemplated in every part of the record as an object of partition. It belongs to lot No. 1, and may be considered as appurtenant to it. 3d. That the fishery was appurtenant to lot No. 1. and was named in the inquest, merely as a matter of detail and specification. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="71">Page 4 U.S. 67, 71</a></p><p> 4th. That notice to the parties is proved on two grounds; first, because the writ commands it, and the sheriff returns, that he has executed the writ according to the command thereof; and, secondly, because the plaintiffs issued the writ, they were present by attorney when it was returned, and at that time never complained. But even if no notice had been given, there was another remedy; and the objection comes too late on a writ of error. 5 Com. 301. </p><p> 5th. That the writ of partition directs and premises to be divided, assigned and delivered; it is recited in the inquest; and the sheriff returns that he has obeyed the command of the writ. When, therefore, the inquest declare that they have allotted the moieties to the respective parties, it must be deemed an allotment according to the terms of the command and authority under which they acted. </p><p> On the last day of the session, the COURT mentioned, that some doubts had arisen, which would prevent a decision of the cause till the adjourned session; but that, in the meantime, for their own information, they should direct a certiorari to issue to the Court of Common Pleas of York county, to inquire whether any precept had been given, authorising the writ of execution, or judicial writ of partition, to issue; and if so, to return it. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p></p><p> Cur. adv. vult. </p><p> At an adjourned session, held on the 17th of January 1800, the COURT unanimously affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court. </p><p> Judgment affirmed. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Though there was no other description of the fishery, yet the defendant\'s counsel insisted, that both the ferry and the fishery were appurtenant to lot No. 1; and the assertion seemed to be supported, on an inspection of the draught to which the inquest referred. The ferry was kept on a part of lot No. 1; and the fishery, being located within the boundaries of the same lot, would be \'at or near the ferry.\' </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> Lewis suggested a doubt, whether a certiorari could issue, per saltem, to the Common Pleas, overleaping the Supreme Court, on whose judgment the writ of error was brought; but he agreed to give effect to any mode, that might be taken to ascertain the fact in question, and to consider any precept that issued, as regularly annexed to the record. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
