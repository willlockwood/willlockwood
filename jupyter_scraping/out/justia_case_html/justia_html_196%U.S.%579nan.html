Harrington, who directed the management of the affairs of the corporation, dictated its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="581">Page 196 U. S. 581</a></p><p> policy, and selected its directors; that, on January 26, 1898, the defendant John J. Harrington caused the defendant Sayles, Zahn Company to be organized for the purpose of taking over the business of the defendant Sol Sayles Company and of one Henry Zahn, and thereupon the property of the Sol Sayles Company and of Zahn were transferred to the Sayles, Zahn Company, which likewise was controlled by the defendant John J. Harrington; that the Sol Sayles Company received, in consideration of the transfer of its property, $50,000 of the capital stock of the Sayles, Zahn Company, and subsequently subscribed for $50,000 additional stock."</p>\n<p>"It is further alleged that, about February 1, 1899, the defendants Harrington, for the purpose of cheating and defrauding the Sol Sayles Company and the complainants of their interest in the assets of the Sayles, Zahn Company, fraudulently caused the Sol Sayles Company to execute and deliver to them, without any consideration whatsoever, its promissory notes, aggregating $23,700, which were utterly fictitious, and thereafter, and on October 3, 1902, the defendants Harrington, in furtherance of their fraudulent scheme, caused an action to be instituted, and a judgment to be recovered against the Sol Sayles Company for the amount of the said promissory notes and interest which was alleged to have accrued thereon, the Sol Sayles Company being in utter ignorance of the nature of the action, and omitting to interpose any defense thereto."</p>\n<p>"This scheme resulted in the recovery of a judgment against the defendant Sol Sayles Company on October 28, 1902, for $27,357.28, in favor of the defendants Harrington, who thereupon caused an execution to be issued to the Sheriff of the County of New York against the property and assets of the Sol Sayles Company, under which execution the said sheriff levied on the shares of stock in the Sayles, Zahn Company, and also two bonds of the New Jersey Steamboat Company, which belonged to the Sol Sayles Company, and sold all of the right, title, and interest of the Sol Sayles Company in the said certificates of stock and in the said bonds, the said defendants </p><p><a class="page-number" name="582">Page 196 U.

This suit is not a collusive one to confer upon a court of the United States jurisdiction of a case of which it would not otherwise have cognizance.  The complainants are unable to secure any corporate action on the part of the defendant Sol Sayles Company to redress the wrongs hereinbefore set forth, nor are they able to obtain any redress at the hands of the stockholders of the said defendant Sol Sayles Company.  The board of directors of said corporation is under the absolute control and domination of the defendant John J.

"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="585">Page 196 U. S. 585</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McKENNA, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>To sustain the action of the circuit court in dismissing the bill, the argument is as follows:  (1) by a conclusive presumption of law, the stockholders of a corporation are deemed to be citizens of the State of the corporation\'s domicil; (2) granting that the complainants are citizens of New Jersey, yet, as they are suing for the Sol Sayles Company, a New York corporation, that corporation, although in form a defendant, is, in legal effect, on the same side of the controversy as the complainants, and since it is a citizen of the same state as the other defendants, the circuit court had no jurisdiction, as the suit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="586">Page 196 U. S. 586</a></p><p> does not involve a controversy between citizens of different states.</p>\n<p>1. This is based on the assumption adopted by this Court, that stockholders of a corporation are citizens of the state which created the corporation -- an assumption physically possible, but hardly true in a single instance, and appellants here contend that it should be classed with the fictions of the law, and subject to one of their fundamental maxims, and cannot be carried beyond the reasons which caused its adoption necessarily require.  It is, however, more of a presumption than a fiction, but whether we regard it as either, it cannot be pushed to the end contended for by appellees.</p>\n<p>The reason of the presumption (we will so denominate it) was to establish the citizenship of the legal entity for the purpose of jurisdiction in the federal courts.  Before its adoption, difficulties had been encountered on account of the conditions under which jurisdiction was given to those courts.  A corporation is constituted, it is true, of all its stockholders, but it has a legal existence separate from them -- rights and obligations separate from them, and may have obligations to them.  It can sue and be sued.  At first this could be done in the circuit court of the United States only when the corporation was composed of citizens of the state which created it.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/61/case.html">Bank of United States v. Deveaux,</a></span></em> 5 Cranch 61; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/61/case.html">Hope Insurance Company v. Boardman,</a></span></em> 5 Cranch 57.  But the limitation came to be seen as almost a denial of jurisdiction to or against corporations in the federal courts, and in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/497/case.html">Louisville &amp;c. Railroad Company v. Letson,</a></span></em> 2 How. 497, prior cases were reviewed, and this doctrine laid down:</p>\n<p>"That a corporation created by and doing business in a particular state is to be deemed, to all intents and purposes, as a person, although an artificial person, . . . capable of being treated as a citizen of that state, as much as a natural person."</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>"when the corporation exercises its powers in the state which chartered it, that is its residence, and such an averment is sufficient to give the circuit courts jurisdiction. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="587">Page 196 U. S. 587</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The presumption that the citizenship of the corporators should be that of the domicil of the corporation was not then formulated.  That came afterwards, and overcame the difficulty and objection that the legal creation, the corporation, could not be a citizen within the meaning of the Constitution.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html">Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; O. Railroad Company,</a></span></em> 16 How. 314.  This, then, was its purpose, and to stretch beyond this is to stretch it to wrong.  It is one thing to give to a corporation a status, and another thing to take from a citizen the right given him by the Constitution of the United States.  Disregarding the purpose of the presumption, it is easy to represent it, as counsel does, as illogical if not extended to every stockholder, but as easy it would be to show its falseness if so applied.  But such charges and countercharges are aside from the question.  To the fact and place of incorporation the law attaches its presumption for a special purpose.  Perhaps, as intimated in <em>St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Ry. v. James,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/545/case.html">161 U. S. 545</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/545/case.html#563">161 U. S. 563</a></span>, this "went to the verge of judicial power."  Against the further step urged by appellees, we encounter the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p>2. The ninety-fourth rule in equity contemplates that there may be, and provides for, a suit brought by a stockholder in a corporation, founded on rights which may properly be asserted by the corporation.  And the decisions of this Court establish that such a suit, when between citizens of different states, involves a controversy cognizable in a circuit court of the United States.  The ultimate interest of the corporation made defendant may be the same as that of the stockholder made plaintiff, but the corporation may be under a control antagonistic to him, and made to act in a way detrimental to his rights.  In other words, his interests and the interests of the corporation may be made subservient to some illegal purpose.  If a controversy hence arise, and the other conditions of jurisdiction exist, it can be litigated in a federal court.</p>\n<p>In <em>Detroit v. Dean,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/537/case.html">106 U. S. 537</a></span>, Dean, who was a citizen </p><p><a class="page-number" name="588">Page 196 U. S. 588</a></p><p> of New York and a stockholder in the Mutual Gas Light Company, a Michigan corporation, in order to protect its right and property against the threatened action of a third party, brought suit against the latter and the corporation in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan.  This Court ordered the bill dismissed not because Dean and the corporation had identical interests, but because the refusal of the directors of the corporation to sue was collusive.  The right of a stockholder to sue a corporation for the protection of his rights was recognized, the condition only being the refusal of the directors to act, which refusal, it is said, must be real, not feigned.  <em>Hawes v. Oakland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/104/450/case.html">104 U. S. 450</a></span>, was cited, where a like right was decided to exist.  <em><span class="l-seealso">See also <a href="/cases/federal/us/59/331/case.html">Dodge v. Woolsey,</a></span></em> 18 How. 331; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/85/626/case.html">Davenport v. Dows,</a></span></em> 18 Wall. 626; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/64/case.html#73">Memphis v. Dean,</a></span></em> 8 Wall. 73; <em>Greenwood v.

Steel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/120/241/case.html">120 U. S. 241</a></span>.  It was said that in <em>Dodge v. Woolsey</em> that the refusal of the directors to sue caused them and Woolsey, who was a stockholder in a corporation of which they were directors, "to occupy antagonistic grounds in respect to the controversy, which their refusal to sue forced him to take in defense of his rights."  <em>Dodge v. Woolsey</em> was modified by <em>Hawes v. Oakland</em> as to what circumstances would justify a suit by a stockholder if the directors refuse to sue.  <em>See also Quincy v. Steel, supra.</em></p>\n<p>The case at bar is brought within the doctrine of those cases by the allegations of the bill.  The defendant corporations are alleged to be under the control of John J. and Dennis A. Harrington, and that complainants are unable to secure any corporate action on the part of the defendant, the Sol Sayles Company, to redress the wrongs complained of.  It is also alleged that the Harringtons control the action of the stockholders, and have declined to redress the wrongs complained of or give complainants any opportunity to lay before the board of directors or the stockholders of the Sol Sayles Company the facts alleged.  It is also alleged the suit is not collusive.  It is manifest that, if the matter alleged be true, complainants </p><p><a class="page-number" name="589">Page 196 U. S. 589</a></p><p> will suffer irremediable loss if not permitted to sue, and as they had a cause of action they rightly brought it in the circuit court of the United States.</p>\n<p><em>Decree reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
