CHIEF JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question for decision is whether a seaman injured on shore while in the service of his vessel is entitled to recover for his injuries in a suit brought against his employer </p><p><a class="page-number" name="38">Page 318 U. S. 38</a></p><p> under the Jones Act.  \xc2\xa7 33, Merchant Marine Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 688.</p>\n<p>Petitioner was a deckhand on respondent\'s vessel "Michigan," engaged in transporting sand from Indiana to Illinois over the navigable waters of Lake Michigan.  As her cargo was being discharged through a conduit passing from the hatch and connected at its outer end to a land pipe by means of a gasket, petitioner was ordered by the master to go ashore to assist in repair of the gasket connection.  While he was so engaged, the alleged negligence of a fellow employee caused a heavy counterweight, used to support the gasket, to fall on petitioner and cause the injuries of which he complains.  The district court dismissed the cause of action under the Jones Act and granted an award for wages.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit modified the judgment, 127 F.2d 901, by allowing an additional award for maintenance and cure, but held that no recovery could be had under the Jones Act for injury to a seaman not occurring on navigable waters.  We granted certiorari, 317 U.S. 611, the question being one of importance in the application of the Jones Act.</p>\n<p>The Jones Act, so far as presently relevant, provides:</p>\n<p>"Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and, in such action, all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply. . . ."</p>\n<p>The Act thus made applicable to seamen injured in the course of their employment the provisions of the Federal Employers\' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 51-60, which gives to railroad employees a right of recovery for injuries resulting from the negligence of their employer, its agents, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="39">Page 318 U. S. 39</a></p><p> or employees.  <em>Panama R. Co. Co. v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/264/375/case.html">264 U. S. 375</a></span>; <em>The Arizona v. Anelich,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/298/110/case.html">298 U. S. 110</a></span>.  The term "seamen" has been interpreted to embrace those employed on a vessel in rendering the services customarily performed by seamen, including stevedores while temporarily engaged in stowing cargo on the vessel.  <em>International Stevedore Co. v. Haverty,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/50/case.html">272 U. S. 50</a></span>; <em>Buzynski v. Luckenbach S.S. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/226/case.html">277 U. S. 226</a></span>.  There is nothing in the legislative history of the Jones Act to indicate that its words "in the course of his employment" do not mean what they say, or that they were intended to be restricted to injuries occurring on navigable waters.  On the contrary, it seems plain that, in taking over the principles of recovery already established for railroad employees and extending them in the new admiralty setting (<em>see The Arizona v. Anelich, supra</em>) to any seaman injured "in the course of his employment," Congress, in the absence of any indication of a different purpose, must be taken to have intended to make them applicable so far as the words and the Constitution permit, and to have given to them the full support of all the constitutional power it possessed.  Hence, the Act allows the recovery sought unless the Constitution forbids it.</p>\n<p>The constitutional authority of Congress to provide such a remedy for seamen derives from its authority to regulate commerce, <em>Second Employers\' Liability Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/223/1/case.html">223 U. S. 1</a></span>, and its power to make laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry into execution powers vested by the Constitution in the government or any department of it, Article I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 18, including the judicial power, which, by Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, extends "to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction."  By \xc2\xa7 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 76, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 371 (Third), Congress conferred on the district courts</p>\n<p>"exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction . . . saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common </p><p><a class="page-number" name="40">Page 318 U. S. 40</a></p><p> law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it. . . ."</p>\n<p>By the grant of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction in the Judiciary Article and \xc2\xa7 9 of the Judiciary Act, the national government took over the traditional body of rules, precepts, and practices known to lawyers and legislators as the maritime law so far as the courts invested with admiralty jurisdiction should accept and apply them.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/46/441/case.html">Waring v.

S. 577</a></span>, or that Congress could never change the status under the maritime law of seamen, who are peculiarly the wards of admiralty, or was powerless to enlarge or modify any remedy afforded to them within the scope of the admiralty jurisdiction.  There is nothing in that grant of jurisdiction -- which sanctioned our adoption of the system of maritime law -- to preclude Congress from modifying </p><p><a class="page-number" name="41">Page 318 U.

This is so at least with respect to those matters which traditionally have been within the cognizance of admiralty courts, either because they are events occurring on navigable waters, <em>see Waring v. Clarke, supra,</em> or because they are the subject matter of maritime contracts or relate to maritime services.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/1/case.html">New England Mutual Marine Insurance Company v.

It has altered and extended the maritime law of liens on vessels plying navigable waters.  <em>Detroit Trust Co. v. Barlum S.S. Co., supra,</em> and cases cited.  And the Jones Act itself has given seamen a right of recovery for injury or death, not previously recognized by the maritime law, which has been uniformly sustained by this Court in cases where the injury occurred on navigable waters.  <em>Panama R. Co. Co. v. Johnson, supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/264/375/case.html#385">264 U. S. 385</a></span>-387; <em>The Arizona v. Anelich, supra; Lindgren v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/281/38/case.html">281 U. S. 38</a></span>.</p>\n<p>As we have said, the maritime law, as recognized in the federal courts, has not in general allowed recovery for personal injuries occurring on land.  But there is an important exception to this generalization in the case of maintenance and cure.  From its dawn, the maritime law has recognized the seaman\'s right to maintenance and cure for injuries suffered in the course of his service to his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="42">Page 318 U. S. 42</a></p><p> vessel, whether occurring on sea or on land.  It is so stated in Article VI of the Laws of Oleron, twelfth century, 30 Fed.Cas. 1174, and in Article XVIII of the Laws of Wisbuy, thirteenth century, <em>id.,</em> p. 1191.  <em>And see</em> Article XXXIX of the Laws of the Hanse Towns, <em>id.,</em> p. 1200; Articles XI and XII of Title Fourth, Marine Ordinances of Louis XIV, <em>id.,</em> p. 1209.  Such is the accepted rule in this Court, <em>see The Osceola, supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/189/158/case.html#169">189 U. S. 169</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/189/158/case.html#175">189 U. S. 175</a></span>; <em>Calmar Steamship Corp. v.

S. 528</a></span>, and it is confirmed by Article 2 of the Shipowners\' Liability Convention of 1936, 54 Stat. 1695, proclaimed by the President to be effective as to the United States and its citizens as of October 29, 1939.  Article 12 of the Convention provides that it shall not affect any national law ensuring "more favourable conditions than those provided by this Convention."  54 Stat. 1700.</p>\n<p>Some of the grounds for recovery of maintenance and cure would, in modern terminology, be classified as torts.  But the seaman\'s right was firmly established in the maritime law long before recognition of the distinction between tort and contract.  In its origin, maintenance and cure must be taken as an incident to the status of the seaman in the employment of his ship.  <em>See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/367/case.html">287 U. S. 367</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/367/case.html#372">287 U. S. 372</a></span>.  That status has, from the beginning, been peculiarly within the province of the maritime law, <em>see Calmar Steamship Corp. v. Taylor, supra,</em> and, upon principles consistently followed by this Court, it is subject to the power of Congress to modify the conditions and extent of the remedy afforded by the maritime law to seamen injured while engaged in a maritime service.</p>\n<p>The right of recovery in the Jones Act is given to the seaman as such, and, as in the case of maintenance and cure, the admiralty jurisdiction over the suit depends not on the place where the injury is inflicted, but on the nature of the service and its relationship to the operation of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="43">Page 318 U. S. 43</a></p><p> vessel plying in navigable waters.  <em>See Waring v. Clarke, supra; New England Mut. Marine Insurance Co. v. Dunham, supra.</em></p>\n<p>It follows that the Jones Act, in extending a right of recovery to the seaman injured while in the service of his vessel by negligence, has done no more than supplement the remedy of maintenance and cure for injuries suffered by the seaman, whether on land or sea, by giving to him the indemnity which the maritime law afforded to a seaman injured in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the vessel or its tackle.  <em>Pacific S.S. Co. v. Peterson, supra.</em>  Since the subject matter, the seaman\'s right to compensation for injuries received in the course of his employment, is one traditionally cognizable in admiralty, the Jones Act, by enlarging the remedy, did not go beyond modification of substantive rules of the maritime law well within the scope of the admiralty jurisdiction whether the vessel, plying navigable waters, be engaged in interstate commerce or not.  <em>Cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/61/296/case.html">61 U.
