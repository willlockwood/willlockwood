On September 27, 1973, Stumes was arrested in Green Bay, Wis., on pending perjury and felony check charges.  He had not yet been charged with Hoff\'s death.  The following morning, he spoke by phone with his attorney in Sioux Falls, who told him not to make any statements before returning to South Dakota.  Three Sioux Falls police officers, Skadsen, Green, and Hendrick, went to Green Bay to bring Stumes back.  They first spoke with him on the morning of October 1.  After being read his <em>Miranda</em> rights, Stumes said that he understood them and did not object to speaking with police without his attorney present.  After an hour and a half of conversation about the homicide, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="640">Page 465 U. S. 640</a></p><p> Green asked Stumes if he would be willing to take a lie detector test.  Stumes answered that "that is a question I\'d rather not answer until I talk to [my attorney]."  At that point, the officers stopped questioning.</p>\n<p>The officers returned that afternoon and recommenced questioning without giving <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  Stumes admitted he had been in Hoff\'s apartment the night of the killing, and that they had had intercourse, but he denied having had anything to do with her death.  When asked if the death had been intentional or accidental, Stumes said that it had been accidental.  He then stated that</p>\n<p>"I would rather not talk about it any more at this time until I talk to my attorney, and after that I\'ll give you a full statement in regards to her death."</p>\n<p>Questioning thereupon ceased.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Stumes and the three officers set out, by car, on the 600-mile trip to Sioux Falls.  Stumes was given his <em>Miranda</em> warnings at the beginning of the trip, and was asked whether he would be willing to talk.  He shrugged and nodded affirmatively, and there was then some further questioning.  For most of the trip, the conversation was about unrelated matters, though occasionally the subject of Hoff\'s death came up.  Late in the afternoon, after a 10- or 15-minute silence in the car, respondent had what he referred to as "a little conflict with my emotions" and "made the statement that I couldn\'t understand why anybody would want to kill Joyce, and that the taking of a human life is so useless."  Green told him he would feel better if he "got it off his chest."  Stumes then recounted striking and strangling Hoff after she had said she would tell someone that she and Stumes had slept together.  Green asked if Stumes would give the police a statement when they reached Sioux Falls, noting that his attorney would undoubtedly advise him not to.  Stumes agreed to give a statement, stating:  "I don\'t give a damn what he says.  I\'m doing anything I feel like, and I\'ll talk to anybody I want to."  Stumes and the officers reached Sioux Falls at about 6:45 in the evening.  Shortly after being </p><p><a class="page-number" name="641">Page 465 U. S. 641</a></p><p> placed in a cell, Stumes called for Skadsen, asking him to "tell them that I didn\'t mean to kill her, that it was an accident -- that I\'m not a vicious killer."</p>\n<p>Stumes was charged with murder; the trial court refused to suppress any of his statements to the police; and the jury found him guilty of first-degree manslaughter and sentenced him to life imprisonment.  On direct appeal, the State Supreme Court remanded for a determination whether Stumes\' statements had been voluntary.  The trial court found that they had; the conviction was accordingly "automatically affirmed."  90 S.D. 382, 241 N.W.2d 587 (1976).</p>\n<p>Stumes then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota.  The District Court denied the writ after an evidentiary hearing.  It concluded that Stumes had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel.  <em>Miranda</em> did not require that all questioning must cease forever once a suspect has requested counsel.  511 F.Supp. 1312 (1981).  Given the totality of the circumstances, the questioning during the trip to South Dakota was proper. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>While Stumes\' appeal was pending, we held that once a suspect has invoked the right to counsel, any subsequent conversation must be initiated by him.  <em>Edwards v. Arizona, supra.</em>  Applying <em>Edwards</em> to this case, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that the police had acted unconstitutionally in twice renewing interrogation after Stumes had invoked his right to counsel.  671 F.2d 1150 (1982). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="642">Page 465 U. S. 642</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari on three questions:  whether the conduct of the police in this case violated <em>Edwards,</em> whether the District Court adequately deferred to the state court\'s factfinding, and whether <em>Edwards</em> should be applied retroactively.  We granted certiorari only as to the third.  463 U.S. 1228 (1983).  We therefore assume for present purposes that the conduct at issue here violated <em>Edwards.</em>  We need not decide whether the police also violated <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), a question not considered by the Court of Appeals.  Because we conclude that the court erred in applying <em>Edwards</em> to this case, we reverse and remand for reconsideration under pre-<em>Edwards</em> law.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>As a rule, judicial decisions apply "retroactively."  <em>Robinson v. Neil,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/505/case.html">409 U. S. 505</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/505/case.html#507">409 U. S. 507</a></span>-508 (1973).  Indeed, a legal system based on precedent has a built-in presumption of retroactivity.  Nonetheless, retroactive application is not compelled, constitutionally or otherwise.  <em>Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/358/case.html">287 U. S. 358</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/358/case.html#364">287 U. S. 364</a></span> (1932).  Since <em>Linkletter v. Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html">381 U. S. 618</a></span> (1965), which held that <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span> (1961), applied only to defendants whose convictions were not yet final when <em>Mapp</em> was decided, we have recognized that "the interest of justice" and "the exigencies of the situation" may argue against imposing a new constitutional decision retroactively.  381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#628">381 U. S. 628</a></span>.  The basic principles of retroactivity in criminal cases were established in <em>Linkletter v. Walker,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="643">Page 465 U.

Under these cases,</p>\n<p>"[t]he criteria guiding resolution of the [retroactivity] question implicate (a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards."</p>\n<p><em>Stovall v. Denno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html">388 U. S. 293</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html#297">388 U. S. 297</a></span> (1967). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Examining <em>Edwards</em> in light of these three factors, we conclude that it should not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Complete retroactive effect is most appropriate where a new constitutional principle is designed to enhance the accuracy of criminal trials.  <em>See Williams v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/646/case.html">401 U. S. 646</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/646/case.html#653">401 U. S. 653</a></span>, and n. 6 (1971) (plurality opinion) (citing cases).  The <em>Edwards</em> rule has only a tangential relation to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="644">Page 465 U. S. 644</a></p><p> truthfinding at trial.  As we have noted in the past,</p>\n<p>"the question whether a constitutional rule of criminal procedure does or does not enhance the reliability of the factfinding process at trial is necessarily a matter of degree."</p>\n<p><em>Johnson v. New Jersey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/case.html#728">384 U. S. 728</a></span>-729.  The application of the exclusionary rule pursuant to <em>Edwards</em> is perhaps not as entirely unrelated to the accuracy of the final result as it is in the Fourth Amendment context.  <em>See United States v. Peltier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html">422 U. S. 531</a></span> (1975); <em>Desist v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html">394 U. S. 244</a></span> (1969).  Yet the <em>Edwards</em> rule cannot be said to be a <em>sine qua non</em> of fair and accurate interrogation.  We faced a similar situation in <em>Stovall v. Denno, supra,</em> where we held that the newly established rule that counsel had to be present during lineups was not to be applied retroactively.  There we noted that, although excluding identifications made in the absence of counsel was</p>\n<p>"justified by the need to assure the integrity and reliability of our system of justice, [it] undoubtedly will affect cases in which no unfairness will be present."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/286/case.html#299">394 U. S. 299</a></span>.  The same is true of the <em>Edwards</em> rule.  The fact that a suspect has requested a lawyer does not mean that statements he makes in response to subsequent police questioning are likely to be inaccurate.  Most important, in those situations where renewed interrogation raises significant doubt as to the voluntariness and reliability of the statement and, therefore, the accuracy of the outcome at trial, it is likely that suppression could be achieved without reliance on the prophylactic rule adopted in <em>Edwards.</em> [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>We have frequently refused to give retroactive effect to decisions that bore at least as heavily on the truthfinding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="645">Page 465 U. S. 645</a></p><p> function.  The most notable of these is <em>Miranda</em> itself, which was held to apply only to trials taking place after it was decided.  <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, supra.</em> [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>See generally Williams v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/646/case.html#655">401 U. S. 655</a></span>, n. 7.  The <em>Edwards</em> rule is a far cry from the sort of decision that goes to the heart of the truthfinding function, which we have consistently held to be retroactive.  <em>E.g., Brown v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/323/case.html">447 U. S. 323</a></span> (1980); <em>Hankerson v. North Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/233/case.html">432 U. S. 233</a></span> (1977); <em>Arsenault v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/5/case.html">393 U. S. 5</a></span> (1968).  Rather, it is a prophylactic rule, designed to implement preexisting rights.  This Court has not applied such decisions retroactively.  <em>See Michigan v. Payne,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/47/case.html">412 U. S. 47</a></span> (1973); <em>Halliday v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/831/case.html">394 U. S. 831</a></span> (1969) (per curiam); <em>Stovall v. Denno, supra.</em></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In considering the reliance factor, this Court\'s cases have looked primarily to whether law enforcement authorities and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="646">Page 465 U. S. 646</a></p><p> state courts have justifiably relied on a prior rule of law said to be different from that announced by the decision whose retroactivity is at issue.  Unjustified "reliance" is no bar to retroactivity.  This inquiry is often phrased in terms of whether the new decision was foreshadowed by earlier cases or was a "clear break with the past." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  When the Court has explicitly overruled past precedent, disapproved a practice it has sanctioned in prior cases, or overturned a longstanding practice approved by near-unanimous lower court authority, the reliance and effect factors in themselves "have virtually compelled a finding of nonretroactivity."  <em>United States v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html">457 U. S. 537</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#549">457 U.

We have been less inclined to limit the effect of a decision that has been "distinctly foreshadowed."  <em>Brown v. Louisiana, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/323/case.html#336">447 U. S. 336</a></span>.  At just what point of predictability local authorities should be expected to anticipate a future decision has been unclear, however.</p>\n<p><em>Edwards</em> established a bright-1ine rule to safeguard preexisting rights, not a new substantive requirement.  Before and after <em>Edwards,</em> a suspect had a right to the presence of a lawyer, and could waive that right.  <em>Edwards</em> established a new test for when that waiver would be acceptable once the suspect had invoked his right to counsel:  the suspect had to initiate subsequent communication.  Prior to <em>Edwards,</em> the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="647">Page 465 U. S. 647</a></p><p> Court had "strongly indicated that additional safeguards are necessary when the accused asks for counsel," 451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html#484">451 U. S. 484</a></span>, and had several times referred to an accused\'s right to be free from further questioning once he invoked his right to counsel, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html#485">451 U. S. 485</a></span>.  <em>Edwards</em> did not overrule any prior decision or transform standard practice.  Thus, it is not the sort of "clear break" case that is almost automatically nonretroactive.</p>\n<p><em>Edwards</em> nonetheless did establish a new rule.  We do not think that the police can be faulted if they did not anticipate its <em>per se</em> approach.  <em>Cf. Adams v.

S. 648</a></p><p> in any way cast doubt on the legitimacy or necessity of <em>Edwards</em> to acknowledge that, in some cases, a waiver could be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent even though it occurred when the police recommenced questioning after an accused had invoked the right to counsel.  The Court had several times refused to adopt <em>per se</em> rules governing the waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights.  <em>Michigan v. Mosley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html">423 U. S. 96</a></span> (1975); <em>North Carolina v. Butler, supra.</em> <em>See also Brown v.

And, while <em>Mosley</em> did distinguish the right to counsel from the right to silence, 423 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html#104">423 U. S. 104</a></span>, n. 10, much of the logic and language of the opinion could be applied to the invocation of the former.  <em>Edwards</em> was not a necessary consequence of <em>Miranda.</em>  Thus, it could be justifiably believed that a waiver of the right to counsel following its invocation could be voluntary even if the police initiated the conversation.</p>\n<p>The state of the law in the lower courts prior to the <em>Edwards</em> decision bears out this reality.  <em>Cf. Michigan v. Payne,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/47/case.html#56">412 U. S. 56</a></span>.  Before <em>Edwards,</em> the question whether the authorities could resume questioning after a defendant has asked for an attorney was acknowledged to be unsettled.  <em>See United States v. Hernandez,</em> 574 F.2d 1362, 1370, n. 16 (CA5 1978); <em>United States v. Herman,</em> 544 F.2d 791, 796, n. 8 (CA5 1977).  Some courts prohibited resumption of questioning unless initiated by the suspect.  <em>E.g., United States v. Womack,</em> 542 F.2d 1047, 1050-1051 (CA9 1976); <em>United States v. Priest,</em> 409 F.2d 491, 493 (CA5 1969).  On the other hand, a number of courts allowed renewed interrogations after a request for counsel.  <em>E.g., Blasingame v. Estelle,</em> 604 F.2d 893 (CA5 1979); <em>White v. Finkbeiner,</em> 611 F.2d 186, 191 (CA7 1979), <em>vacated and remanded,</em> 451 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="649">Page 465 U.

Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/case.html">378 U.

The same logic argues against retroactive application of <em>Edwards,</em> which, in light of the disagreements among lower courts, laid down additional guidelines for the implementation of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p>In short, it cannot be said that our decision in <em>Edwards</em> had been "clearly" or "distinctly" foreshadowed.  <em>See Adams v. Illinois, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/278/case.html#283">405 U. S. 283</a></span>.  <em>Cf. Brown v.

In these circumstances, we consider the reliance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="650">Page 465 U. S. 650</a></p><p> interest compelling, even though <em>Edwards</em> did not overrule a specific decision.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The retroactive application of <em>Edwards</em> would have a disruptive effect on the administration of justice.  We can only guess at the number of cases where <em>Edwards</em> might make a difference in the admissibility of statements made to the police, but the number is surely significant.  In all of those, some inquiry would be required to assess the substantiality of any <em>Edwards</em> claim.  That investigation, and the possible retrial, would be hampered by problems of lost evidence, faulty memory, and missing witnesses.  <em>See Jenkins v. Delaware,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/213/case.html">395 U. S. 213</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/213/case.html#220">395 U.

It would be unreasonable to expect law enforcement authorities to have conducted themselves in accordance with its bright-line rule prior to its announcement; and retroactive application would disrupt the administration of justice.  Weighing these considerations, we conclude that <em>Edwards</em> should not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>At a minimum, nonretroactivity means that a decision is not to be applied in collateral review of final convictions.  For purposes of this case, that is all we need decide about <em>Edwards.</em> [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Our prior cases have drawn the nonretroactivity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="651">Page 465 U.

Just where the line should be drawn as to <em>Edwards</em> need not be decided today.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals erred by evaluating the constitutionality of the police conduct in this case under the standards set out in <em>Edwards.</em>  We express no opinion as to whether the conduct of the police in this case was acceptable under prior cases from this Court or the Eighth Circuit, and remand to the Court of Appeals for that determination.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court found that the morning questioning was not unconstitutional.  Stumes was informed of his rights, and questioning ceased when he requested a lawyer.  The court concluded that the afternoon session was unconstitutional because the officers had failed to reinform Stumes of his rights.  However, it considered the trial court\'s error in admitting statements made at that time harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The court thought that Stumes\' agreement to speak when the police resumed questioning was not a valid waiver.  Nor was his comment that taking a human life was useless the initiation of new conversation about the homicide, particularly as it came only after he had been questioned intermittently throughout the trip and the actual incriminating statement was prompted by the officer\'s invitation to "get it off his chest."  Finally, the statement to Skadsen at the jail was tainted by the previous, unconstitutionally obtained, incriminating statements.  One judge dissented on the ground that Stumes had initiated further communication and made a valid waiver.  The court did not consider whether <em>Edwards</em> should be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>A majority of the Court has recently adopted a slightly different approach in the Fourth Amendment area.  <em>United States v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html">457 U. S. 537</a></span> (1982).  Without considering the <em>Linkletter/Stovall</em> factors, <em>Johnson</em> held that a decision construing the Fourth Amendment that was not a "clear break with the past" is to be applied to all convictions not yet final when the decision was handed down.  The Court was careful to note the limits to its holding:</p>\n<p>"First, our decision today does not affect those cases that would be clearly controlled by our existing retroactivity precedents.  Second, because respondent\'s case arises on direct review, we need not address the retroactive reach of our Fourth Amendment decisions to those cases that still may raise Fourth Amendment issues on collateral attack.  Third, we express no view on the retroactive application of decisions construing any constitutional provision other than the Fourth Amendment."</p>\n<p>457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#562">457 U. S. 562</a></span> (footnotes and citation omitted).  These limitations make <em>Johnson</em> inapplicable to this case, which is controlled by prior precedent, arises on collateral review, and does not involve the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Like, for example, <em>Miranda</em> and <em>North Carolina v. Pearce,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/711/case.html">395 U. S. 711</a></span> (1969), <em>Edwards</em> did not confer a substantive constitutional right that had not existed before; it "created a protective umbrella serving to enhance a constitutional guarantee."  <em>See Michigan v. Payne,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/47/case.html">412 U. S. 47</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/47/case.html#54">412 U. S. 54</a></span> (1973).  Because the "foundational" right was, and remains, available to defendants in pre-<em>Edwards</em> cases, "a decision of nonretroactivity is less likely to result in the continued incarceration of those whose convictions . . . rest on unconstitutional acts."  412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/47/case.html#54">412 U.

They are designed in part to assure that the person who responds to interrogation while in custody does so with intelligent understanding of his right to remain silent and of the consequences which may flow from relinquishing it. . . .  [W]hile <em>Escobedo</em> and <em>Miranda</em> guard against the possibility of unreliable statements in every instance of in-custody interrogation, they encompass situations in which the danger is not necessarily as great as when the accused is subjected to overt and obvious coercion."</p>\n<p>"At the same time, our case law on coerced confessions is available for persons whose trials have already been completed, providing of course that the procedural prerequisites for direct or collateral attack are met. . . .  Prisoners may invoke a substantive test of voluntariness. . . .  Thus, while <em>Escobedo</em> and <em>Miranda</em> provide important new safeguards against the use of unreliable statements at trial, the nonretroactivity of these decisions will not preclude persons whose trials have already been completed from invoking the same safeguards as part of an involuntariness claim."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/case.html#729">384 U.

In holding that it was not retrospective, we stated:  "However clearly our holding in <em>Katz</em> may have been foreshadowed, it was a clear break with the past" because it expressly overruled prior decisions.  <em>Desist v.

As the very quotation on which JUSTICE STEVENS relies demonstrates, however, <em>Miranda\'s per se</em> rule extended no further than requiring that the now-famous warnings be given in every case, regardless of the individual circumstances.  <em>Miranda</em> did not adopt a <em>per se</em> rule with regard to waiver of the right to counsel.  <em>See</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#475">384 U.

That decision cannot be read as holding that <em>Edwards</em> should be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.  For the same reasons, of course, <em>Oregon v.

The questioning involved there occurred nine months before <em>Edwards</em> was decided.  On direct appeal, the Oregon Court of Appeals held that, in light of <em>Edwards,</em> the statements should have been suppressed.

I previously have urged the Court to adopt Justice Harlan\'s suggestion that a new rule of constitutional law should be applied only to review </p><p><a class="page-number" name="653">Page 465 U. S. 653</a></p><p> of criminal convictions not yet final when the rule is announced. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  <em>Hankerson v.

As Justice Harlan reasoned in <em>Mackey v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html">401 U. S. 667</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html#675">401 U. S. 675</a></span>-695 (1971) (concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part), that approach follows directly from a proper conception of the scope of the writ of habeas corpus, as contrasted to direct review.  A brief review of the reasons for that approach relevant to the present case will explain why I do not join the Court\'s opinion.</p>\n<p>Retroactive application on habeas corpus of constitutional rules governing criminal procedure is unnecessary to advance the purposes of habeas corpus, even under a regime that permits the federal courts on habeas to vacate a final conviction on any properly preserved ground of federal constitutional error.  Review on habeas to determine that the conviction rests upon correct application of the law in effect at the time of the conviction is all that is required to "forc[e] trial and appellate courts . . . to toe the constitutional mark." [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html#687">401 U. S. 687</a></span>.  Nor will fundamental fairness require complete retroactivity, except in rare instances. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Because retroactive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 465 U. S. 654</a></p><p> application of new rules of constitutional law generally does little to advance the purposes of collateral relief on habeas, it is particularly difficult in such cases to justify imposing upon the State the costs of collateral review.  These are not insubstantial.  They include "the burden on judicial and prosecutorial resources entailed in retrial" and "the miscarriage of justice that occurs when a guilty offender is set free only because effective retrial is impossible years after the offense."  <em>Hankerson v. North Carolina, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/233/case.html#247">432 U. S. 247</a></span>.  Retroactive application of constitutional rules frustrates the State\'s enforcement of its criminal law despite the State\'s careful adherence to the federal constitutional standards that governed at the time of the prisoner\'s conviction.</p>\n<p>The costs imposed upon the State by retroactive application of new rules of constitutional law on habeas corpus thus generally far outweigh the benefits of this application.  It is therefore unnecessary to consider the <em>Linkletter/Stovall</em> factors, as these were intended merely to guide the Court\'s balancing of the costs and benefits that accrue from retroactive application of a particular rule.</p>\n<p>Certainly the <em>per se</em> test adopted in <em>Edwards</em> is not a rule necessary to assure fundamental fairness.  As the Court\'s opinion states,</p>\n<p>"in those situations where renewed interrogation raises significant doubt as to the voluntariness and reliability of the statement and, therefore, the accuracy of the outcome at trial, it is likely that suppression could be achieved without reliance on the prophylactic rule adopted in <em>Edwards.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/case.html#644">465 U.

Releasing on habeas prisoners who have been convicted by fundamentally unfair procedures, or who have committed no constitutionally punishable offense at all, would give effect to our decisions in those rare cases where a conviction fully in accord with the law governing at the time of conviction is nonetheless plainly unjust.  <em>See Mackey v.

His confession, together with other evidence of his guilt, brands him as such.  Whether his incarceration for the past dozen or more years is adequate or insufficient punishment for his crime is a matter of no concern to this Court.  What is -- or should be -- of concern is the conduct of other lawbreakers.</p>\n<p>While respondent was in custody, and after he had requested the assistance of counsel, the police interrogated him on two separate occasions.  As the Court held in <em>Edwards v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html">451 U. S. 477</a></span> (1981), such interrogation is unlawful.  There is no dispute in this Court that respondent\'s constitutional rights were violated. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  Nevertheless, because the unlawful interrogation took place prior to May 18, 1981, the date <em>Edwards</em> was decided, the Court holds that respondent\'s statements are admissible in evidence even though they would have been inadmissible if they had been made after May 18, 1981.  In reaching this result, the Court states that the question is whether <em>Edwards</em> "should be applied retroactively," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/case.html#639">465 U.

The case therefore does not present any real "retroactivity" question.  It does, however, raise a serious question concerning this Court\'s use of its power to create new rules of law. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="656">Page 465 U.

If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.  At this point, he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.  Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked.  <em>If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.

It does mean, however, that, if police propose to interrogate a person, they must make known to him that he is entitled to a lawyer and that, if he cannot afford one, a lawyer will be provided for him prior to any interrogation.  If authorities conclude that they will not provide counsel during a reasonable period of time in which investigation in the field is carried out, they may refrain from doing so without violating the person\'s Fifth Amendment privilege so long as they do not question him during that time."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#473">384 U.

The police "must respect" an individual\'s request that he be permitted to consult with an attorney prior to custodial interrogation; interrogation "must cease until an attorney is present."  Indeed, this language forbids the police even to ask if the individual wishes to waive his rights, since "there can be no questioning."  Here respondent made a request to consult with counsel prior to questioning, but the police questioned him anyway, without affording him that opportunity.  There is simply nothing in the <em>Miranda</em> opinion that gave the police the slightest reason to believe such conduct was permissible. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  Even before <em>Edwards,</em> this Court had consistently read <em>Miranda</em> to impose an absolute obligation on the police to respect an individual\'s request for counsel.

Its reasoning for treating <em>Edwards</em> as having created a "new rule" is implicit, however, in its discussion of what it calls the "reliance factor" -- the authorities\' reliance on the "prior rule."  The Court states that the police could not be faulted for failing to anticipate <em>Edwards,</em> since prior law could have been understood to permit a case-by-case evaluation of whether a suspect\'s decision to speak with police despite an earlier invocation of the right to consult with counsel was a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of that right. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  The majority concludes that <em>Edwards</em> can be considered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="662">Page 465 U.

In neither case was there such an abrupt and fundamental shift in doctrine as to constitute an entirely new rule which in effect replaced an older one.  Whatever development in antitrust law was brought about was based to a great extent on existing authorities and was an extension of doctrines which had been growing and developing over the years.  These cases did not constitute a sharp break in the line of earlier authority or an avulsive change which caused the current of the law thereafter to flow between new banks.  We cannot say that, prior to those cases, potential antitrust defendants would have been justified in thinking that then-current antitrust doctrines permitted them to do all acts conducive to the creation or maintenance of a monopoly, so long as they avoided direct exclusion of competitors or other predatory acts."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/481/case.html#497">392 U.

It is for this reason that <em>Johnson</em> wisely rejected such a rule. [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  Nor does the majority purport to endorse such a rule today.  Yet that is the plain import of its holding, since nothing but law that already has been clearly established will ever be applied if, as the majority suggests, cases cannot qualify for "retroactive" application merely because they involve an "unsettled" question, even when this Court has already "strongly indicated," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/case.html#647">465 U.

That concern should not, however, divert its attention from the overriding importance of requiring strict obedience to the law by those officials who are entrusted with its enforcement -- and, indeed, with its interpretation.  For decisions of this kind have a corrosive effect in a society dedicated to the rule of law.  There is, after all, profound wisdom in Justice Brandeis\' observation:</p>\n<p>"Decency, security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen.  In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperilled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously.  Our Government is the potent, the onmipresent teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.  Crime is contagious.  If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.  To declare that, in the administration of the criminal law, the end justifies the means -- to declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal -- would bring terrible retribution.  Against that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face."</p>\n<p><em>Olmstead v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/438/case.html">277 U.

More to the point, the accused having expressed his own view that he is not competent to deal with the authorities without legal advice, a later decision at the authorities\' insistence to make a statement without counsel\'s presence may properly be viewed with skepticism."</p>\n<p>423 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html#110">423 U.

Whether it is a minor or an adult who stands accused, the lawyer is the one person to whom society as a whole looks as the protector of the legal rights of that person in his dealings with the police and the courts.  For this reason, the Court fashioned in <em>Miranda</em> the rigid rule that an accused\'s request for an attorney is <em>per se</em> an invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, requiring that all interrogation cease."</p>\n<p>442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/707/case.html#719">442 U.

If the accused indicates that he wishes to remain silent, \'the interrogation must cease.\'  If he requests counsel, \'the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\'  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/384/436/case.html#474">384 U.

Here, the critical facts as found by the Arizona Supreme Court are that <em>Edwards</em> asserted his right to counsel and his right to remain silent on January 19, but that the police, without furnishing him counsel, returned the next morning to confront him and as a result of the meeting secured incriminating oral admissions."</p>\n<p>451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html#481">451 U.

While the language of <em>Miranda</em> is mandatory, indicating that no interrogation can take place until the individual has conferred with a lawyer, <em>Edwards</em> makes it clear that this language does not extend to a conversation between the authorities and the individual initiated by the latter:</p>\n<p>"In concluding that the fruits of the interrogation initiated by the police on January 20 could not be used against Edwards, we do not hold or imply that Edwards was powerless to countermand his election or that the authorities could in no event use any incriminating statements made by Edwards prior to his having access to counsel.  Had Edwards initiated the meeting on January 20, nothing in the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments would prohibit the police from merely listening to his voluntary, volunteered statements and using them against him at the trial.  The Fifth Amendment right identified in <em>Miranda</em> is the right to have counsel present at any custodial interrogation.  Absent such interrogation, there would have been no infringement of the right that Edwards invoked, and there would be no occasion to determine whether there had been a valid waiver."</p>\n<p>451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html#485">451 U.

The Court cites only three of our cases as supporting a case-by-case approach.  The first, <em>Michigan v. Mosley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html">423 U.

S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> demonstrates.  The second is <em>Johnson v. Zerbst,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/458/case.html">304 U. S. 458</a></span> (1938).  Of course, <em>Zerbst</em> was decided long before <em>Miranda,</em> and hence places no gloss on it.  <em>Zerbst</em> was also a case decided under the Sixth Amendment, and the policies underlying the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are quite distinct, as this Court has often pointed out in rejecting reliance on Sixth Amendment precedent in Fifth Amendment contexts and vice versa.  <em>See Estelle v.

Moreover, <em>Miranda</em> itself was inconsistent with the case-by-case waiver inquiry of <em>Zerbst.</em>  In <em>Miranda,</em> the Court specifically rejected case-by-case inquiry into whether there was a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of Fifth Amendment rights, opting for a prophylactic rule that eschewed case-by-case inquiry:</p>\n<p>"The Fifth Amendment privilege is so fundamental to our system of constitutional rule and the expedient of giving an adequate warning as to the availability of the privilege so simple, we will not pause to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given.  Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to his age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation; a warning is a clear-cut fact.  More important, whatever the background of the person interrogated, a warning at the time of the interrogation is indispensable to overcome its pressures and to insure that the individual knows he is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#468">384 U.
