Slaton, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/49/case.html#113">413 U.S. 49, 113</a> (1973) (dissenting opinion). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, N.J.Stat. 2A:115- 2 is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#47">413 U.S. 15, 47</a> (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with my Paris Adult dissent. In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/483/case.html#494">413 U.S. 483, 494</a> (1973). </p><p> Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that state obscenity regulation is prohibited by the Fourteenth and First Amendments (see Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/49/case.html#70">413 U.S. 49, 70</a> ( Douglas, J., dissenting)), would grant certiorari in each of these cases and reverse the judgments of conviction.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
