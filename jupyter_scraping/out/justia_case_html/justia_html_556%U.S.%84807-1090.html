S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71604, with certain exceptions.  One exception, \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) (now repealed), stripped a foreign state of immunity in any suit arising from certain acts of terrorism that occurred when the state was designated as a sponsor of terrorism under \xc2\xa76(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 or \xc2\xa7620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Iraq was designated as a sponsor of terrorism in 1990, but in 2003, following the American-led invasion of Iraq, Congress enacted the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (EWSAA), \xc2\xa71503 of which included a proviso clause (the second in a series of eight) authorizing the President to \xe2\x80\x9cmake inapplicable with respect to Iraq [\xc2\xa7]620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although President Bush exercised that authority, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit held in its 2004 <em>Acree</em> decision that the EWSAA did not permit the President to waive \xc2\xa71605(a)(7), and thereby restore Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity, for claims arising from actions Iraq took while designated as a sponsor of terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thereafter, Congress repealed \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) in \xc2\xa71083(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA) and replaced it with a new, roughly similar exception, \xc2\xa71083(a).  The NDAA also declared that nothing in EWSAA \xe2\x80\x9cever authorized, directly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of any provision of [the FSIA] or the removal of the jurisdiction of any court\xe2\x80\x9d (thus purporting to ratify <em>Acree</em>), \xc2\xa71083(c)(4); and authorized the President to waive \xe2\x80\x9cany provision of this section with respect to Iraq\xe2\x80\x9d under certain conditions, \xc2\xa71083(d).  On the same day the President signed the NDAA into law he also waived all of \xc2\xa71083\xe2\x80\x99s provisions as to Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents filed these suits against Iraq in early 2003, alleging mistreatment by Iraqi officials during and after the 1991 Gulf War.  Under <em>Acree</em>, the courts below refused to dismiss either case on jurisdictional grounds.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit also rejected Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that even if \xc2\xa71605(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s application to it survived the President\xe2\x80\x99s EWSAA waiver, the provision was repealed by NDAA \xc2\xa71083(b)(1)(A)(iii); and that the President had waived NDAA \xc2\xa71083(a)\xe2\x80\x99s <em>new</em> exception with respect to Iraq under his \xc2\xa71083(d) authority.  The court held instead that it retained jurisdiction over cases pending against Iraq when the NDAA was enacted.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Iraq is no longer subject to suit in federal court.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The District Court lost jurisdiction over both suits in May 2003, when the President exercised his EWSAA authority to make \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable with respect to Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s (and the United States\xe2\x80\x99) reading of EWSAA \xc2\xa71503\xe2\x80\x99s second proviso as sweeping in \xc2\xa71605(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity is straightforward.  In the proviso\xe2\x80\x99s terms, the exception is a \xe2\x80\x9cprovision of law\xe2\x80\x9d (indisputably) that \xe2\x80\x9capplies to\xe2\x80\x9d (strips immunity from) \xe2\x80\x9ccountries that have supported terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d (as designated pursuant to certain statutory provisions).  Because he exercised his waiver authority with respect to \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d provisions of law encompassed by the second proviso, his actions made \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable\xe2\x80\x9d to Iraq.

S. 531</a>, 534, another recognized use is \xe2\x80\x9cto introduce independent legislation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 535, which was the function of the proviso here.  In any event, \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) falls within the scope of the proviso even accepting the narrower interpretation adopted by the <em>Acree</em> decision.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 other objections to the straightforward interpretation of EWSAA \xc2\xa71503\xe2\x80\x99s proviso are rejected.

Although NDAA \xc2\xa71083(c)(4) appears to ratify <em>Acree</em>, this Court need not decide whether such a ratification is effective because \xc2\xa71083(d)(1) authorized the President to \xe2\x80\x9cwaive any provision of this section with respect to Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d and he waived \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d such provisions, including \xc2\xa71083(c)(4).  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects the argument that \xc2\xa71605(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s inapplicability does not bar claims arising from Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s conduct <em>prior</em> to the President\xe2\x80\x99s waiver.  In order to exercise jurisdiction over these cases, the District Court had to \xe2\x80\x9capply\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) with respect to Iraq, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s waiver made that provision \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  No retroactivity problem is posed by this construction, if only because the primary conduct by Iraq that forms the basis for these suits actually occurred before \xc2\xa71605(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Respondents also argue that EWSAA \xc2\xa71503\xe2\x80\x99s sunset clause\xe2\x80\x94under which \xe2\x80\x9cthe authorities contained in [that] section\xe2\x80\x9d expired in 2005\xe2\x80\x94revived \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) and restored jurisdiction as of the sunset date.  But expiration of the \xc2\xa71503 <em>authorities</em> is not the same as cancellation of the <em>effect</em> of the prior valid exercise of those authorities.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71602 <em>et seq.</em>\xe2\x80\x94recognizes a number of exceptions; if any of these is applicable, the state is subject to suit, and federal district courts have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim.  \xc2\xa71330(a); <em>Verlinden B.

S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa72405(j), as \xe2\x80\x9ca country which has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d 55 Fed. Reg. 37793.  Over a decade later, in March 2003, the United States and a coalition of allies initiated military action against that country.  In a matter of weeks, the regime of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein collapsed and coalition forces occupied Baghdad.  American attention soon shifted from combat operations to the longer term project of rebuilding Iraq, with the ultimate goal of creating a stable ally in the region.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Toward that end, Congress enacted in April 2003 the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (EWSAA), 117 Stat. 559.  Section 1503 of that Act authorized the President to \xe2\x80\x9cmake inapplicable with respect to Iraq section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 579.  President George W. Bush exercised that authority to its fullest extent in May 2003, declaring \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable with respect to Iraq section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 . . . and any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d  68 Fed. Reg. 26459.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly thereafter, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had occasion to consider whether that Presidential action had the effect of rendering inapplicable to Iraq the terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity.  The Court concluded in a divided panel decision that the President\xe2\x80\x99s EWSAA authority did not permit him to waive \xc2\xa71605(a)(7), and thereby restore sovereign immunity to Iraq, for claims arising from acts it had taken while designated as a sponsor of terror.  <em>Acree</em> v. <em>Republic of Iraq</em>, 370 F.\xc2\xa03d 41, 48 (2004).  Because Iraq succeeded in having the claims against it dismissed on other grounds, <em>id.</em>, at 59\xe2\x80\x9360,<em> </em>it could not seek certiorari to challenge the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the EWSAA.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is yet another legislative enactment, and yet another corresponding executive waiver, that bear on the question presented.  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), 122 Stat. 3, was passed in January 2008.  That Act (1) repealed the FSIA\xe2\x80\x99s terrorism exception, \xc2\xa71083(b)(1)(A)(iii); (2) replaced it with a new, roughly similar exception, \xc2\xa71083(a); (3) declared that nothing in \xc2\xa71503 of the EWSAA had \xe2\x80\x9cever authorized, directly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of any provision of chapter 97 of title 28, United States Code, or the removal of the jurisdiction of any court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d (thus purporting to ratify the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Acree </em>decision), \xc2\xa71083(c)(4), 122 Stat. 343; and (4) authorized the President to waive \xe2\x80\x9cany provision of this section with respect to Iraq\xe2\x80\x9d so long as he made certain findings and so notified Congress within 30 days, \xc2\xa71083(d), <em>id.</em>, at 343\xe2\x80\x93344.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The last provision was added to the NDAA after the President vetoed an earlier version of the bill, which did not include the waiver authority.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s veto message said that the bill \xe2\x80\x9cwould imperil billions of dollars of Iraqi assets at a crucial juncture in that nation\xe2\x80\x99s reconstruction efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum to the House of Representatives Returning Without Approval the \xe2\x80\x9cNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008,\xe2\x80\x9d 43 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1641 (2007).  Only when Congress added the waiver authority to the NDAA did the President agree to approve it; and on the same day he signed it into law he also officially waived \xe2\x80\x9call provisions of section 1083 of the Act with respect to Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d 73 Fed. Reg. 6571 (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We consider today two cases that have been navigating their way through the lower courts against the backdrop of the above-described congressional, military, Presidential, and judicial actions.  Respondents in the <em>Simon</em> case are American nationals (and relatives of those nationals) who allege that they were captured and cruelly mistreated by Iraqi officials during the 1991 Gulf War.  The <em>Beaty </em>respondents are the children of two other Americans, Kenneth Beaty and William Barloon, who are alleged to have been similarly abused by the regime of Saddam Hussein in the aftermath of that war.  Each set of respondents filed suit in early 2003 against Iraq in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging violations of local, federal, and international law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents invoked the terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity, and given <em>Acree</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the President had not rendered that statutory provision inapplicable to Iraq, the District Court refused to dismiss either case on jurisdictional grounds.  In <em>Beaty</em>, after the District Court denied Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, 480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 60, 70 (2007), Iraq invoked the collateral order doctrine to support an interlocutory appeal.  See <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U. S. 511</a>, 524\xe2\x80\x93529 (1985).

The Court denied that request over the dissent of Judges Brown and Kavanaugh, and a panel then summarily affirmed in an unpublished order the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  No. 07\xe2\x80\x937057 (Nov. 21, 2007) <em>(per curiam)</em>, App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a\xe2\x80\x932a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the <em>Simon </em>appeal was still pending, Congress enacted the NDAA, and the Court of Appeals requested supplemental briefing addressing the impact of that legislation on the court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  Iraq contended, as an alternative argument to its position that <em>Acree</em> was wrongly decided, that even if 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s application to Iraq survived the President\xe2\x80\x99s EWSAA waiver, the provision was repealed by \xc2\xa71083(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the NDAA, 122 Stat. 341; and that the <em>new</em> terrorism exception to sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x94which was created by the NDAA and codified at 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa71605A (July 2008 Supp.)\xe2\x80\x94was waived by the President with respect to Iraq pursuant to his NDAA authority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, holding instead, based on a close reading of the statutory text, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe NDAA leaves intact our jurisdiction over cases . . . that were pending against Iraq when the Congress enacted the NDAA.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 F.\xc2\xa03d 1187, 1194 (2008).  The panel then reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the <em>Simon</em> respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims were untimely, <em>id.</em>, at 1195\xe2\x80\x931196, and rebuffed Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s request for dismissal under the political question doctrine, <em>id.</em>, at 1196\xe2\x80\x931198.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Iraq sought this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of both cases, asking us to determine whether under current law it remains subject to suit in the federal courts.

The principal clause and that proviso read:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe President may suspend the application of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990: \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>Provided further</em>, That the President may make inapplicable with respect to Iraq section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  117 Stat. 579.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIraq and the United States both read the quoted proviso\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause as sweeping in the terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s exception to sovereign immunity for state sponsors of terrorism stripped jurisdictional immunity from a country unless \xe2\x80\x9cthe foreign state was not designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is a \xe2\x80\x9cprovision of law\xe2\x80\x9d (indisputably) that \xe2\x80\x9capplies to\xe2\x80\x9d (strips immunity from) \xe2\x80\x9ccountries that have supported terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d (as designated pursuant to certain statutory provisions).  Of course the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d (in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other provision of law\xe2\x80\x9d) has an \xe2\x80\x9cexpansive meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, 5 (1997), giving us no warrant to limit the class of provisions of law that the President may waive.  Because the President exercised his authority with respect to \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d provisions of law encompassed by the second proviso, his actions made \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable\xe2\x80\x9d to Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To a layperson, the notion of the President\xe2\x80\x99s suspending the operation of a valid law might seem strange.  But the practice is well established, at least in the sphere of foreign affairs.  See<em> United States</em> v. <em>Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/304/index.html">299 U. S. 304</a>, 322\xe2\x80\x93324 (1936) (canvassing precedents from as early as the \xe2\x80\x9cinception of the national government\xe2\x80\x9d).  The granting of Presidential waiver authority is particularly apt with respect to congressional elimination of foreign sovereign immunity, since the granting or denial of that immunity was historically the case-by-case prerogative of the Executive Branch.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ex parte Peru</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/578/index.html">318 U. S. 578</a>, 586\xe2\x80\x93590 (1943).  It is entirely unremarkable that Congress, having taken upon itself in the FSIA to \xe2\x80\x9cfree the Government\xe2\x80\x9d from the diplomatic pressures engendered by the case-by-case approach, <em>Verlinden</em>, 461 U. S., at 488, would nonetheless think it prudent to afford the President some flexibility in unique circumstances such as these.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals in <em>Acree </em>resisted the above construction, primarily on the ground that the relevant text is found in a proviso.  We have said that, at least presumptively, the \xe2\x80\x9cgrammatical and logical scope [of a proviso] is confined to the subject-matter of the principal clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrow</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/266/531/index.html">266 U. S. 531</a>, 534\xe2\x80\x93535 (1925).  Using that proposition as a guide, the <em>Acree</em> panel strove mightily to construe the proviso as somehow restricting the principal clause of EWSAA \xc2\xa71503, which authorized the President to suspend \xe2\x80\x9cany provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990,\xe2\x80\x9d 117 Stat. 579.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, the second proviso related to that subsection of the Iraq Sanctions Act (referred to in the principal provision) which dictated that certain enumerated statutory provisions, including \xc2\xa7620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and \xe2\x80\x9call other provisions of law that <em>impose sanctions</em> against a country which has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d shall be fully enforced against Iraq.  \xc2\xa7586F(c), 104 Stat. 2051 (emphasis added).  The panel understood the second EWSAA proviso as doing nothing more than clarifying that the authority granted by the principal clause (to suspend any part of the Iraq Sanctions Act) included the power to make inapplicable to Iraq the various independent provisions of law that \xc2\xa7586F(c) of the Iraq Sanctions Act instructed to be enforced against Iraq\xe2\x80\x94which might otherwise continue to apply of their own force even without the Iraq Sanctions Act.  However, the residual clause of \xc2\xa7586F(c) encompasses only provisions that \xe2\x80\x9cimpose sanctions\xe2\x80\x9d; and, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, that excludes \xc2\xa71605(a)(7), which is a rule going instead to the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  Thus, the EWSAA proviso swept only as broadly as \xc2\xa7586F(c), and therefore did not permit the President to waive the FSIA terrorism exception.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a highly sophisticated effort to construe the proviso as a limitation upon the principal clause.  Ultimately, however, we think that effort neither necessary nor successful.  It is true that the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral office of a proviso is to except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify and restrain its generality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morrow</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 534.  But its general (and perhaps appropriate) office is not, alas, its exclusive use.  Use of a proviso \xe2\x80\x9cto state a general, independent rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alaska</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/75/index.html">545 U. S. 75</a>, 106 (2005), may be lazy drafting, but is hardly a novelty.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McDonald</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/279/12/index.html">279 U. S. 12</a>, 21 (1929).  <em>Morrow</em> itself came with the caveat that a proviso is sometimes used \xe2\x80\x9cto introduce independent legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  266 U. S., at 535.  We think that was its office here.  The principal clause granted the President a power; the second proviso purported to grant him an <em>additional</em> power.  It was not, on any fair reading, an exception to, qualification of, or restraint on the principal power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrasting the second EWSAA proviso to some of the other provisos illustrates the point.  For example, the first proviso cautioned that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in this section shall affect the applicability of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992,\xe2\x80\x9d 117 Stat. 579, and the third forbade the export of certain military equipment \xe2\x80\x9cunder the authority of this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Both of these plainly sought to define and limit the authority granted by the principal clause.  The fourth proviso, however, mandated that \xe2\x80\x9csection 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall not apply with respect to programs of international organizations for Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and it is impossible to see how that self-executing suspension of a distinct statute in any way cabined or clarified the principal clause\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to suspend the Iraq Sanctions Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are other indications that the second proviso\xe2\x80\x99s waiver authority was not limited to the statutory provisions embraced by \xc2\xa7586F(c) of the Iraq Sanctions Act.  If that is all it was meant to accomplish, why would Congress not simply have tracked \xc2\xa7586F(c)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause?  Instead of restricting the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to statutes that \xe2\x80\x9cimpose sanctions\xe2\x80\x9d on sponsors of terror, the EWSAA extended it to any statute that \xe2\x80\x9capplies\xe2\x80\x9d to such states.  That is undoubtedly a broader class.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the best reading of the EWSAA proviso were that it encompassed only statutes that impose sanctions or prohibit assistance to state sponsors of terrorism, see <em>Acree</em>, 370 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 54, we would disagree with the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that the FSIA exception is not such a law.  Allowing lawsuits to proceed certainly has the extra benefit of facilitating the compensation of injured victims, but the fact that \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) targeted only foreign states designated as sponsors of terrorism suggests that the law was intended as a sanction, to punish and deter undesirable conduct.  Stripping the immunity that foreign sovereigns ordinarily enjoy is as much a sanction as eliminating bilateral assistance or prohibiting export of munitions (both of which are explicitly mandated by \xc2\xa7586F(c) of the Iraq Sanctions Act).  The application of this sanction affects the jurisdiction of the federal courts, but that fact alone does not deprive it of its character as a sanction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It may well be that when Congress enacted the EWSAA it did not have specifically in mind the terrorism exception to sovereign immunity.  The Court of Appeals evidently found that to be of some importance.  <em>Id.</em>, at 56 (noting there is \xe2\x80\x9cno reference in the legislative history to the FSIA\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the whole value of a generally phrased residual clause, like the one used in the second proviso, is that it serves as a catchall for matters not specifically contemplated\xe2\x80\x94known unknowns, in the happy phrase coined by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.  Pieces of Intelligence: The Existential Poetry of Donald H. Rumsfeld 2 (H. Seely comp. 2003).  If Congress wanted to limit the waiver authority to particular statutes that it had in mind, it could have enumerated them individually.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot say with any certainty (for those who think this matters) whether the Congress that passed the EWSAA <em>would have wanted</em> the President to be permitted to waive \xc2\xa71605(a)(7).  Certainly the exposure of Iraq to billions of dollars in damages could be thought to jeopardize the statute\xe2\x80\x99s goal of speedy reconstruction of that country.  At least the President thought so.  And in the \xe2\x80\x9cvast external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and manifold problems,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.</em>, 299 U. S., at 319, courts ought to be especially wary of overriding apparent statutory text supported by executive interpretation in favor of speculation about a law\xe2\x80\x99s true purpose.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents advance two other objections to the straightforward interpretation of the EWSAA proviso.  First, in a less compelling variant of the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach, the <em>Simon</em> respondents argue that \xe2\x80\x9csection 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d means section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act or any other provision of law cited therein.  The provision would thus allow the President to make inapplicable to Iraq the statutes that \xc2\xa7620A precludes from being used to provide support to terror-sponsoring nations.  Not to put too fine a point upon it, that is an absurd reading, not only textually but in the result it produces: It would mean that the effect of the EWSAA was to permit the President to <em>exclude </em>Iraq from, rather than <em>include </em>it within, such beneficent legislation as the Food for Peace Act of 1966, 7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71691 <em>et seq.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both respondents also invoke the canon against implied repeals, TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/index.html">437 U. S. 153</a>, 190 (1978), but that canon has no force here.  Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the statute neither rests on implication nor effects a repeal.  The EWSAA proviso <em>expressly</em> allowed the President to render certain statutes inapplicable; the only question is its scope.  And it did not repeal anything, but merely granted the President authority to waive the application of particular statutes to a single foreign nation.  Cf. <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/417/index.html">524 U. S. 417</a>, 443\xe2\x80\x93445 (1998).</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must consider whether anything in the subsequent NDAA legislation changes the above analysis.  In particular, \xc2\xa71083(c)(4) of that statute specifically says that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in section 1503 of the [EWSAA] has ever authorized, directly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of any provision of chapter 97 of title 28, United States Code, or the removal of the jurisdiction of any court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  122 Stat. 343.  This looks like a ratification by Congress of the conclusion reached in the <em>Acree</em> decision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is such a ratification effective?  The NDAA is not subsequent legislative history, as Iraq claims, cf. <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Finkelstein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/617/index.html">496 U. S. 617</a>, 632 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part); rather, it is binding law, approved by the Legislature and signed by the President.  Subsequent legislation can of course alter the meaning of an existing law for the future; and it can even alter the past operation of an existing law (constitutional objections aside) if it makes that retroactive operation clear.  <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html">511 U. S. 244</a>, 267\xe2\x80\x93268 (1994).  To tell the truth, however, we are unaware of any case dealing with the retroactive amendment of a law that had already expired, as the EWSAA had here.  And it is doubtful whether Congress can retroactively claw back power it has given to the Executive, invalidating Presidential action that was valid when it was taken.  Thankfully, however, we need not explore these difficulties here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In \xc2\xa71083(d)(1) of the NDAA, the President was given authority to \xe2\x80\x9cwaive any provision of this section with respect to Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d  122 Stat. 343.  The President proceeded to waive \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d provisions of that section as to Iraq, including (presumably) \xc2\xa71083(c)(4).  73 Fed. Reg. 6571.  The Act can therefore add nothing to our analysis of the EWSAA.  Respondent Beaty objects that the President cannot waive a <em>fact</em>.  But neither can Congress legislate a fact.  Section 1083(c)(4) could change our interpretation of the disputed EWSAA language only if it has some <em>substantive</em> effect, changing what would otherwise be the law.  And if the President\xe2\x80\x99s waiver does anything, it eliminates any substantive effect that the NDAA would otherwise have on cases to which Iraq is a party.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded that the President did render 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable with respect to Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d and that such action was within his assigned powers, we consider respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the inapplicability of the provision does not bar their claims, since they arise from Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s conduct <em>prior</em> to the President\xe2\x80\x99s waiver.  Any other interpretation, they say, would cause the law to operate in a disfavored retroactive fashion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument proceeds as follows: The FSIA exception becomes \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d to a foreign state when that foreign state is designated as a sponsor of terrorism.  In parallel fashion, rendering the exception \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable\xe2\x80\x9d should be equivalent to <em>removing</em> the state\xe2\x80\x99s designation.  And under \xc2\xa71605(a)(7), jurisdiction turned on the foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s designation \xe2\x80\x9cat the time the act [giving rise to the claim] occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  On this reading, the President\xe2\x80\x99s waiver meant only that Iraq could not be sued pursuant to \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) for any <em>future</em> conduct, even though it technically remained designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents support this interpretation with a policy argument and a canon of construction.  First, why would Congress have sought to give Iraq <em>better</em> treatment than any other state that saw the error of its ways, reformed its behavior, and was accordingly removed from the list of terror-sponsoring regimes?  See <em>Acree</em>, 370 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 56 (calling such a result \xe2\x80\x9cperplexing\xe2\x80\x9d).  Providing immunity for future acts is one thing, but wiping the slate clean is quite another.  Second, this Court has often applied a presumption that, absent clear indication to the contrary, statutory amendments do not apply to pending cases.  <em>Landgraf</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 280.  A narrow reading of \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable\xe2\x80\x9d would better comport with that presumption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a textual matter, the proffered definition of \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable\xe2\x80\x9d is unpersuasive.  If a provision of law is \xe2\x80\x9cinapplicable\xe2\x80\x9d then it cannot be applied; to \xe2\x80\x9capply\xe2\x80\x9d a statute is \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o put [it] to use.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 131 (2d ed. 1954).  When the District Court exercised jurisdiction over these cases against Iraq, it surely was putting \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) to use with respect to that country.  Without the <em>application</em> of that provision, there was no basis for subject-matter jurisdiction.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71604, 1330(a).  If Congress had wanted to authorize the President merely to cancel Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, then Congress could have done so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a policy matter, moreover, we do not find that result particularly \xe2\x80\x9cperplexing.\xe2\x80\x9d  As then-Judge Roberts explained in his separate opinion in <em>Acree</em>, Congress in 2003 \xe2\x80\x9c<em>for the first time</em> confronted the prospect that a friendly successor government would, in its infancy, be vulnerable under Section 1605(a)(7) to crushing liability for the actions of its renounced predecessor.\xe2\x80\x9d  370 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 61 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original).  The Government was at the time spending considerable sums of money to rebuild Iraq, see Rogers, Congress Gives Initial Approval for War Funding, Airline Aid, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 4, 2003, p. A10.  What would seem perplexing is converting a billion-dollar reconstruction project into a compensation scheme for a few of Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s victims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the judicial presumption against retroactivity, that does not induce us to read the EWSAA proviso more narrowly.  Laws that merely alter the rules of foreign sovereign immunity, rather than modify substantive rights, are not operating retroactively when applied to pending cases.  Foreign sovereign immunity \xe2\x80\x9creflects current political realities and relationships,\xe2\x80\x9d and its availability (or lack thereof) generally is not something on which parties can rely \xe2\x80\x9cin shaping their primary conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/677/index.html">541 U. S. 677</a>, 696 (2004); see also <em>id.</em>, at 703 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the primary conduct by Iraq that forms the basis for these suits actually occurred prior to the enactment of the FSIA terrorism exception in 1996.  See <em>Saudi Arabia</em> v. <em>Nelson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/349/index.html">507 U. S. 349</a>, 351 (1993).  That is, Iraq was immune from suit at the time it is alleged to have harmed respondents.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s elimination of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s <em>later</em> subjection to suit could hardly have deprived respondents of any expectation they held at the time of their injury that they would be able to sue Iraq in United States courts.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the District Court lost jurisdiction over both suits in May 2003, when the President exercised his authority to make \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) inapplicable with respect to Iraq.  At that point, immunity kicked back in and the cases ought to have been dismissed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only function remaining to the court [being] that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view, that is not fatal to their claims.  They point to the eighth proviso in \xc2\xa71503 of the EWSAA:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Provided further</em>, That the authorities contained in this section shall expire on September 30, 2004, or on the date of enactment of a subsequent Act authorizing assistance for Iraq and that specifically amends, repeals or otherwise makes inapplicable the authorities of this section, whichever occurs first.\xe2\x80\x9d  117 Stat. 579.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe effect of this provision, they contend, is that the EWSAA waiver expired in 2005,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and that when it did so \xc2\xa71605(a)(7) was revived, immunity was again stripped, and jurisdiction was restored.  If that is true, then at the very least they ought to be permitted to refile their suits and claim equitable tolling for the period between 2005 and the present, during which time they understandably relied on <em>Acree</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The premise, however, is flawed.  It is true that the \xe2\x80\x9cauthorities contained in\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71503 of the EWSAA expired, but expiration of the <em>authorities</em> (viz., the President\xe2\x80\x99s powers to suspend and make inapplicable certain laws) is not the same as cancellation of the <em>effect</em> of the President\xe2\x80\x99s prior valid exercise of those authorities (viz., the restoration of sovereign immunity).  As Iraq points out, Congress has in other statutes provided explicitly that <em>both</em> the authorities granted <em>and</em> the effects of their exercise sunset on a particular date.  <em>E.g.</em>, 19 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72432(c)(3) (\xe2\x80\x9cA waiver with respect to any country shall terminate on the day after the waiver authority granted by this subsection ceases to be effective with respect to such country\xe2\x80\x9d).  The EWSAA contains no such language.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think the better reading of the eighth EWSAA proviso (the sunset clause) is that the powers granted by the section could be exercised only for a limited time, but that actions taken by the President pursuant to those powers (<em>e.g.</em>, suspension of the Iraq Sanctions Act) would not lapse on the sunset date.  If it were otherwise, then the Iraq Sanctions Act\xe2\x80\x94which has never been repealed, and which imposes a whole host of restrictions on relations with Iraq\xe2\x80\x94would have returned to force in September 2005.  Nobody believes that is so.</p>\n<p align="left">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*</f></f></f></f></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the President exercised his authority to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of law that apply to countries that have supported terrorism, the exception to foreign sovereign immunity for state sponsors of terrorism became inoperative as against Iraq.

The Court of Appeals expressed doubt that Congress would have wanted federal-court jurisdiction to disappear for a year and then suddenly return.  <em>Acree</em> v. <em>Republic of Iraq</em>, 370 F.\xc2\xa03d 41, 56\xe2\x80\x9357 (CADC 2004).  Our analysis of the sunset provision, see Part V, <em>infra</em>, disposes of that concern.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Respondents contend that the NDAA waiver is irrelevant because the President\xe2\x80\x99s veto of the <em>initial</em> version of the bill\xe2\x80\x94which did not include the waiver authority\xe2\x80\x94was defective.  We need not inquire into that point, since Congress (evidently thinking the veto effective) enacted a new bill that was identical in all material respects but for the addition of presidential waiver authority.  Since that authority would be nugatory, and the rest of the new law utterly redundant, if a law resulting from the former bill remained in effect, that law would have been effectively repealed.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The sunset date was extended by one year in a later bill.  108\xe2\x80\x93106, \xc2\xa72204(2), 117 Stat. 1230.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
