The general statutory provision governing the reviewability of remand orders is 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1447(d). That section provides:</p><blockquote><p>\n"An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise."</p></blockquote><p>As we explained in <i>Thermtron Products, Inc. </i>v. <i>Hermansdorfer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/336/case.html">423 U. S. 336</a> (1976), \xc2\xa7 1447(d) must be read <i>in pari materia </i>with \xc2\xa7 1447(c), so that only remands based on grounds specified in \xc2\xa7 1447(c) are immune from review under \xc2\xa7 1447(d). <i>Id., </i>at 345-346.

The parties and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit are in agreement that the District Court\'s order in this case was equivalent to a remand to state court.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="128">128</a></p><p>diction to entertain an appeal of the remand order under \xc2\xa7 1447(d).</p><p>Section 1447(d) bars appellate review of the remand order in this case. As noted, \xc2\xa7 1447(d) precludes appellate review of any order "remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed." The parties do not dispute that the District Court\'s order remanded this case to the Ohio state court from which it came. There is also no dispute that the District Court remanded this case on grounds of untimely removal, precisely the type of removal defect contemplated by \xc2\xa7 1447(c).3 Section 1447(d) thus compels the conclusion that the District Court\'s order is "not reviewable on appeal or otherwise." See <i>Gravitt </i>v. <i>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/723/case.html">430 U. S. 723</a> (1977) <i>(per curiam).</i></p><p>We reach the same conclusion regardless of whether removal was effected pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1441(a) or \xc2\xa7 1452(a). Section 1447(d) applies "not only to remand orders made in suits removed under [the general removal statute], but to orders of remand made in cases removed under <i>any other statutes, </i>as well." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Rice, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/742/case.html">327 U. S. 742</a>, 752 (1946) (emphasis added).4 Absent a clear statutory command to the contrary, we assume that Congress is "aware of the universality of thee] practice" of denying appellate review of remand orders when Congress creates a new ground for removal. <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>3 Section 1447(c) requires that a motion to remand for a defect in removal procedure be filed within 30 days of removal. Petitioner removed this case to federal court on September 25, 1992. Respondent filed motions to remand in the District Court on October 23, 1992, and in the Bankruptcy Court on November 25, 1992. Respondent\'s motion to remand filed in the District Court was sufficient to bring this case within the coverage of \xc2\xa7 1447(c).</p><p><i>4 </i><i>Rice </i>interpreted the predecessor statute to \xc2\xa7 1447(d). The current version of \xc2\xa7 1447(d) is a recodification of the provision reviewed in <i>Rice </i>and is "intended to restate the prior law with respect to remand orders and their reviewability." <i>Thermtron Products, Inc. </i>v. <i>Hermansdorfer, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/336/case.html">423 U.

Nor is there any reason to infer from \xc2\xa7 1447(d) that Congress intended to exclude bankruptcy cases from its coverage. The fact that \xc2\xa7 1452 contains its own provision governing certain types of remands in bankruptcy, see \xc2\xa7 1452(b) (authorizing remand on "any equitable ground" and precluding appellate review of any decision to remand or not to remand on this basis), does not change our conclusion. There is no reason \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1447(d) and 1452 cannot comfortably coexist in the bankruptcy context. We must, therefore, give effect to both. <i>Connecticut Nat.

Congress did so first in the prescription generally governing orders "remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed," 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1447(d); Congress did so again in \xc2\xa7 1452(b) when it authorized the remand of claims related to bankruptcy cases "on any equitable ground."</p><p>Section 1452(b) is most sensibly read largely to supplement, and generally not to displace, the rules governing cases removed from state courts set out in 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1447. Section 1447(d) encompassingly prescribes that "[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, [excepting only orders remanding civil rights cases removed pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1443]." The Court persuasively explains why \xc2\xa7 1452 does not negate the application of \xc2\xa7 1447(d) to bankruptcy cases. Accordingly, the Court holds \xc2\xa7 1447(d) dispositive, and I agree with that conclusion. But I am also convinced that \xc2\xa7 1452(b) independently warrants the judgment that remand orders in bankruptcy cases are not reviewable. I write separately to state my reasons for that conviction.</p><p>Section 1452(b) broadly provides for district court remand of claims related to bankruptcy cases "on any equitable ground," and declares that the remanding order is "not reviewable by appeal or otherwise." 1 Congress, when it</p><p>1 This case concerns, and I address in this opinion, only orders <i>remand</i><i>ing </i>claims "related to" bankruptcy cases.

The drafters, it bears emphasis, expressly contemplated that remand orders for claims related to bankruptcy cases "would not be appealable"; in particular, they reported that bankruptcy forum remands would be unreviewable <i>"in the same manner </i>that an order of the United States district court remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise."

No. 95-595, p. 51 (1977) (emphasis added).2</p><p>The lawmakers chose the capacious words "any equitable ground" with no hint whatever that they meant by their word choice to recall premerger distinctions between law</p><p>cating state-law claims merely "related to" a bankruptcy case, i. <i>e., </i>claims that do not independently qualify for federal-court jurisdiction.</p><p>Of course, every federal court, whether trial or appellate, is obliged to notice want of subject-matter jurisdiction on its own motion. See, <i>e. g., Mansfield, </i>C. &amp; <i>L. M. R. Co. </i>v. <i>Swan, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/379/case.html">111 U. S. 379</a>, 382 (1884). An interlocutory decision "to not remand," therefore, although not <i>per se </i>reviewable, would leave open for eventual appellate consideration-also and earlier for district court reconsideration-any question of the court\'s subject-matter jurisdiction. See, <i>e. g., Sykes </i>v. <i>Texas Air Corp., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/834/488/">834 F.2d 488</a>, 492, n. 16 <i>(CA5 </i>1987) ("When the district court decides to <i>retain </i>a case in the face of arguments that it lacks jurisdiction, the decision itself is technically unreviewable; but of course the appellate court reviewing any other aspect of the case must remand for dismissal if the refusal to remand was wrong, i. <i>e., </i>if there is no federal jurisdiction over the case.") (emphasis in original).</p><p>2 Mter the Court held inconsonant with Article III the Bankruptcy Act\'s broad grant of jurisdiction to bankruptcy judges, see <i>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. </i>v. <i>Marathon Pipe Line Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/case.html">458 U. S. 50</a>, 87 (1982), Congress transferred supervisory jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases to Article III courts and retained for the district courts the broad removal/remand authority the Act initially gave to bankruptcy courts.

In legal systems that never separated pleadings and procedure along law/equity lines, and not infrequently in our own long-merged system, "equitable" signals that which is reasonable, fair, or appropriate. Dictionary definitions of "equitable" notably include among appropriate meanings: "just and impartial," American Heritage Dictionary 622 (3d ed. 1992); also "dealing fairly and equally with all concerned," Webster\'s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 421 (1983). As Circuit Judge Easterbrook observed:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[T]he distinction between law and equity was abolished long ago in federal cases. Nothing in the history of the bankruptcy code suggests that Congress wanted to resuscitate it. Courts must separate \'legal\' from \'equitable\' grounds in 1789 on command of the seventh amendment. This task has little but the sanction of history to recommend it and is possible only because law versus equity was an intelligible line in the eighteenth century. In 1978, when Congress enacted the predecessor to \xc2\xa7 1452, there was no law-equity distinction. \'Equitable\' in \xc2\xa7 1452(b) makes more sense if it means \'appropriate.\'" <i>Hernandez </i>v. <i>Brakegate, Ltd., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/942/1223/">942 F.2d 1223</a>, 1226 (CA71991).</p></blockquote><p>Cf., <i>e. g., Hilton Davis Chemical Co. </i>v. <i>Warner-Jenkinson </i><i>Co., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/62/1512/">62 F.3d 1512</a>, 1521 (CA Fed. 1995) ("The term \'equitable\' can have many meanings ....

Indeed, counsel for petitioner recognized the potential for manipulation inherent in his proffered distinction between statutory time limits ("legal" limits) on the one hand and, on the other, court-made determinations that a procedural move is untimely because pursued without due expedition ("equitable" assessments). At oral argument, the following exchange occurred:</p><blockquote><p>\n"QUESTION: Suppose the judge in this case said, I\'m not 100 percent sure about strict time limit, but I think you should have come here sooner, so for equitable reasons I\'m remanding this because I think you dawdledan equitable notion like laches ... -that would not be reviewable, right?</p></blockquote><p>"MR. CUNDRA: That is correct.</p><blockquote><p>\n"QUESTION: SO it\'s the judge\'s label, what he wants to put on it. He can make it immune from review if he says, laches.</p></blockquote><p>"MR. CUNDRA: Yes.</p><blockquote><p>\n"QUESTION: But it\'s reviewable if he says, time bar under the statute.</p></blockquote><p>"MR. CUNDRA: Yes." Tr. of Oral Arg. 15-16.</p><p>As Circuit Judge Gee remarked in relation to this very issue, it "make[s] little sense" to rest reviewability <i>vel non </i>on the tag the trial court elects to place on its ruling. <i>Sykes </i>v. <i>Texas Air Corp., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/834/488/">834 F.2d 488</a>, 492 (CA5 1987).</p><p>Interpreting \xc2\xa7 1452(b) as fully in sync with \xc2\xa7 1447(d) on the nonreviewability of remand orders, we stress, secures the uniform treatment of all remands, regardless of the party initiating the removal or the court from which the case is removed. Cf. <i>Pacor, Inc. </i>v. <i>Higgins, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/743/984/">743 F.2d 984</a>, 991-992</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="135">135</a></p><p>(CA3 1984) (refusing to apply \xc2\xa7 1447(d) in bankruptcy cases because, <i>inter alia, </i>removals under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1441-1447 may be initiated only by defendants and are from state courts only, while \xc2\xa7 1452 authorizes removals by "a party" and applies to cases originally filed in federal as well as state tribunals). A restrictive definition of what is "equitable" could invite wasteful controversy over the reviewability of bankruptcy case remand orders that are not reached by \xc2\xa7 1447 and rest on grounds a common-law pleader might type "legal." It would show little respect for the legislature were courts to suppose that the lawmakers meant to enact an irrational scheme. Cf. <i>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Harris Trust and Sav. Bank, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/510/86/case.html">510 U. S. 86</a>, 94-95 (1993) (Court\'s examination of statutory language is "guided not by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look[s] to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.") (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Dedeaux, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/case.html">481 U. S. 41</a>, 51 (1987)); <i>Deal </i>v. <i>United States, 508 </i>U. S. 129, 132 (1993) (It is a "fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used.").</p><p>Moreover, even if jurisdictional and procedural defects were excluded from the "equitable ground" category, that would not force a construction of \xc2\xa7 1452(b) calling for different results depending on the party initiating the removal or the court from which a claim is removed. The phrase "any equitable ground" in \xc2\xa7 1452(b) sensibly can be read to relate not to the basis for the district court\'s refusal to entertain a case (as my discussion up to now has assumed), but rather to the basis for <i>remanding. </i>Ordinarily, a district court unable to hear a claim, because of lack of jurisdiction or some other legal hindrance, has no choice but to dismiss. Section 1452(b), under the construction advanced in this paragraph, provides an alternative to dismissal (as well as an alternative</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="136">136</a></p><p>to proceeding with the case though all the legal requirements are met), by authorizing remands as fairness warrants, i. <i>e., </i>when a remand would be "equitable."</p><p>In sum, a "strong congressional policy against review of remand orders," <i>Sykes, </i>834 F. 2d, at 490, underlies \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1447(d) and 1452(b). Courts serve the legislature\'s purpose best by reading \xc2\xa7 1452(b) to make sense and avoid nonsense, and to fit harmoniously within a set of provisions composing a coherent chapter of the Judicial Procedure part of the United States Code. Cf. <i>United Sav. Assn. of Tex. </i>v. <i>Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/365/case.html">484 U. S. 365</a>, 371 (1988) (statutory term "that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme," for example, when "only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law") (citations omitted). Thus the Sixth Circuit, I conclude, correctly ruled that neither \xc2\xa7 1452(b) nor \xc2\xa7 1447(d) permits the assertion of appellate jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
