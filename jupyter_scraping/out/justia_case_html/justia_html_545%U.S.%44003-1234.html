The 1965 version of the law authorized States to require proof that a truck operator had such a permit.  By 1991, 39 States demanded such proof, requiring a $10 per truck registration fee (State Registration) and giving each trucker a stamp to affix to a multistate \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d carried in the vehicle.  Finding this scheme inefficient and burdensome, Congress created the current Single State Registration System (SSRS), which allows a trucking company to fill out one set of forms in one State (base State), thereby registering its Federal Permit in every participating State through which its trucks travel.  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(c).  The base State can demand proof of the Federal Permit, proof of insurance, the name of an agent to receive service of process, and a fee equal to the sum of the individual state fees.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iv).  The SSRS prohibits a State from imposing any additional \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714504(b).  Michigan Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7478.2(2) imposes an annual $100 fee on each Michigan license-plated truck operating entirely in interstate commerce.  Petitioner interstate trucking companies subject to \xc2\xa7478.2(2) sought to have it invalidated, but the Michigan Court of Claims refused.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, because the fee is imposed for the administration of the State\xe2\x80\x99s Motor Carrier Act and for enforcement of state safety regulations, it is not a \xe2\x80\x9cregistration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d pre-empted by \xc2\xa714504(b).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Section \xc2\xa714504 does not pre-empt Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s $100 fee.

Statutory language makes clear that the federal provision reaches no further.  The subsection\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence uses the words \xe2\x80\x9cState registration\xe2\x80\x9d to refer only to state systems seeking evidence that a trucker has complied with the specific SSRS obligations enumerated in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iv).  No language in the second sentence suggests that the same words should be given a different, broader meaning there.  Nor does any language elsewhere in the statute suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d refers to <em>any</em> kind of State Registration whatsoever that might affect interstate carriers, or to those state requirements imposed by reason of a motor carrier\xe2\x80\x99s operation in interstate commerce.  The implementing regulations also do not support a broader meaning.  Historical context confirms this reading.  Congress enacted \xc2\xa714504 to simplify the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d system, which placed no constraints on any state filings or fees other than those concerning Federal Permit and insurance requirements.  In creating the SSRS, Congress gave no indication that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old.  Finally, nothing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes or objectives\xe2\x80\x94improving the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d system\xe2\x80\x99s efficiency and simplifying a uniform scheme for providing States with certain vital information\xe2\x80\x94either requires a broader reading of the statutory term or impliedly pre-empts non-SSRS-related state rules.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Section 478.2(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements do not concern the SSRS\xe2\x80\x99s subject matter.  First, the Michigan statute makes no reference to evidence of a Federal Permit, an insurance requirement, or an agent for receiving service of process.  Nor do any state rules related to the fee appear to require the filing of information on these matters.  In addition, because Michigan imposed its separate fee before the SSRS existed and before it began to participate in the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d system, the fee does not represent an effort to circumvent the limitations imposed in connection with federal laws governing State Registration of Federal Permits.  Finally, petitioners have failed to show that Michigan rules do not allow a Michigan-plated interstate truck choosing Michigan as its base State to comply with the SSRS requirements even if it does not comply with \xc2\xa7478.2(2).  The fact that Michigan appears to forgive the State\xe2\x80\x99s $10 SSRS fee for trucks that comply with \xc2\xa7478.2(2) can be seen as an effort to provide a modest, administratively efficient recompense to those motor carriers that choose Michigan as their base State, but such a subsidiary connection cannot transform the State\xe2\x80\x99s fee into a requirement concerning the SSRS statute\xe2\x80\x99s subject matter.

A Michigan law imposes \xe2\x80\x9can annual fee of $100.00\xe2\x80\x9d upon each Michigan license-plated truck that is \xe2\x80\x9coperating entirely in interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7478.2(2) (West 2002) (hereinafter MCL).  A federal statute states that \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>State registration requirement</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 is an unreasonable burden\xe2\x80\x9d upon interstate commerce when it imposes so high a fee.  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b) (emphasis added); see also \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III).  Does this federal statutory provision pre-empt the Michigan law?  We conclude that the Michigan fee requirement is not the kind of  \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d to which the federal statute refers.  And for that reason, the statute does not pre-empt it.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal law has long required most motor carriers doing interstate business to obtain a permit\xe2\x80\x94which we shall call a Federal Permit\xe2\x80\x94that reflects compliance with certain federal requirements.  See 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713901 <em>et seq.;</em> 49 CFR \xc2\xa7365.101 <em>et seq. </em>(2004).  In 1965, Congress authorized States to require proof that the operator of an interstate truck had secured a Federal Permit.  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7302(b)(2) (1976 ed.); see generally <em>Yellow Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Michigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/36/index.html">537 U. S. 36</a>, 39 (2002).  By 1991, 39 States demanded such proof by requiring some form of what we shall call State Registration (of the Federal Permit).  Those States typically would require truckers to file with a state agency evidence that each interstate truck was covered by a Federal Permit.  They would require the trucker to pay a State Registration fee of up to $10 per truck.  And they would issue a State Registration stamp that the trucker would affix to a multistate \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d carried within the vehicle.  See 49 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71023.32, 1023.33 (1990); <em>Yellow Transp.</em>, 537 U. S., at 39.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1991, Congress focused upon the fact that the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d system required a trucking company to obtain a separate stamp from each State through which an interstate truck traveled.  It found this scheme inefficient and burdensome.  See <em>id., </em>at 39\xe2\x80\x9340.<em> </em>And it enacted a statute setting forth a new system, the Single State Registration System (SSRS), which remains in effect today.  Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504.  The SSRS allows a trucking company to fill out <em>one</em> set of forms in <em>one</em> State (the base State), and by doing so to register its Federal Permit in <em>every</em> participating State through which its trucks will travel.  \xc2\xa714504(c); 49 CFR \xc2\xa7367.4(b) (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The SSRS statute says that the base State can demand: (1) proof of the trucking company\xe2\x80\x99s possession of a Federal Permit, (2) proof of insurance, (3) the name of an agent designated to receive \xe2\x80\x9cservice of process,\xe2\x80\x9d and (4) a total fee (charged for the filing of the proof of insurance) equal to the sum of the individual state fees.  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iv); 49 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7367.4(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4) (2004).  Each individual state fee, it adds, cannot exceed the amount the State charged under the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d system, and in no event can it exceed $10 per truck.  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III).<em> </em>After a truck owner registers, base state officials provide the owner with a receipt to be kept in the cab of each registered truck.  49 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7367.5(a), (b), (e) (2004).  The base State distributes to each participating State its share of the total registration fee.  \xc2\xa7367.6(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The SSRS statute specifies that a State may not impose any additional \xe2\x80\x9cregistration requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  It states specifically, in the statutory sentence at issue here, that when a State Registration requirement imposes further obligations, \xe2\x80\x9cthe part in excess is an unreasonable burden.\xe2\x80\x9d  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b).  It adds that a State may not require \xe2\x80\x9cdecals, stamps, cab cards, or any other means of registering \xe2\x80\xa6 specific vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(B)(iii).  And it provides that the \xe2\x80\x9ccharging or collection of any fee under this section that is not in accordance with the fee system established [in this provision] shall be deemed to be a burden on interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(C). <em> </em>At the same time, the statute makes clear that a State that complies with the SSRS system need not fear Commerce Clause attack, for it says that a state requirement that an interstate truck \xe2\x80\x9cmust register with the State\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cnot an unreasonable burden on transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d provided that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State registration is completed\xe2\x80\x9d in accordance with the SSRS statute.   \xc2\xa714504(b).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state law at issue here, \xc2\xa7478.2(2) of the Michigan Motor Carrier Act, reads as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA motor carrier licensed in this state shall pay an annual fee of $100.00 for each vehicle operated by the motor carrier which is registered in this state [<em>i.e.</em>, which has a Michigan license plate] and operating entirely in interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2) (West 2002).</p>\n<p align="left">\nRelated state rules and regulations require a carrier paying the $100 fee to identify each interstate truck by make, type, year, serial number, and unit number.

App. 24 (Affidavit of PSC official Thomas R. Lonergan).  And they provide that a carrier who pays this fee need not pay the $10 SSRS registration fee if the carrier chooses Michigan as its SSRS base State.

When a<em> State registration requirement </em>imposes obligations in excess of the standards of the Secretary, the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.\xe2\x80\x9d  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWhat is the scope of the italicized words?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners ask us to give these words a broad interpretation, sweeping within their ambit every state requirement involving some form of individualized registration that affects an interstate motor carrier.  Brief for Petitioners 15 (federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s limits apply \xe2\x80\x9cto <em>all </em>interstate motor carriers compelled to register their operations with <em>any </em>State regulatory commission under any State law\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).  The United States argues for a somewhat narrower interpretation, submitting that the words apply to \xe2\x80\x9cstate registration requirements that are imposed on interstate carriers <em>by reason of </em>their operation in interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>19\xe2\x80\x9320 (emphasis in original).  In our view, however, the language, read in context, is yet more\nnarrow.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reference to text, historical context, and purpose discloses that the words \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d do not apply to <em>every</em> State Registration requirement that happens to cover interstate carriers, nor to <em>every</em> such requirement specifically focused on a trucking operation\xe2\x80\x99s interstate character.  Rather, they apply only to those state requirements that concern <em>SSRS registration</em>\xe2\x80\x94that is, registration with a State of evidence that a carrier possesses a Federal Permit, registration of proof of insurance, or registration of the name of an agent \xe2\x80\x9cfor service of process.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(A)(iv).  Thus, the federal provision pre-empts only those state requirements that (1) concern the subject matter of the SSRS and (2) are \xe2\x80\x9cin excess\xe2\x80\x9d of the requirements that the SSRS imposes in respect to that subject matter.  See \xc2\xa714504(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, statutory language makes clear that the federal provision reaches no further.  Section 14504(b)\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence says that a state \xe2\x80\x9crequirement\xe2\x80\x9d that an interstate motor carrier must \xe2\x80\x9cregister with the State is not an unreasonable burden \xe2\x80\xa6 when the State registration<em> </em>is completed under standards of the Secretary under subsection (c).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  It is clear from the text as a whole that \xe2\x80\x9cState registration\xe2\x80\x9d cannot cover <em>all </em>registration requirements, but only some.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  The first sentence\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cstandards of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x9d (as well as the focus of the entire statute) tells us which.  Those \xe2\x80\x9cstandards,\xe2\x80\x9d set forth in subsection (c)\xe2\x80\x94which is titled \xe2\x80\x9cSingle State Registration System\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94exclusively relate to State Registration of \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of\xe2\x80\x9d a Federal Permit, \xe2\x80\x9cproof of\xe2\x80\x9d insurance, and the \xe2\x80\x9cname of a local agent for service of process,\xe2\x80\x9d and state fees \xe2\x80\x9cfor the filing of proof of insurance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iv); \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(B)(iv).  And the rest of the statute similarly deals exclusively with SSRS matters.  See \xc2\xa714504(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cstandards\xe2\x80\x9d mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe specification of forms and procedures required\xe2\x80\x9d to prove that a motor carrier is in compliance with federal requirements).  Thus, the words \xe2\x80\x9cState registration\xe2\x80\x9d in the pre-emption provision\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence refer only to state systems that seek evidence that a trucker has complied with specific, federally enumerated, <em>SSRS</em> obligations.  Cf. 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713908(d) (\xc2\xa714504\xe2\x80\x99s fees relate specifically to state efforts to obtain proof of insurance under the SSRS); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa713908(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3) (indicating that \xc2\xa714504 refers to state requirements having this purpose).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How could the same words in the second sentence refer to something totally different?  We have found no language here or elsewhere in the statute (which we reproduce in the Appendix, <em>infra</em>) suggesting that the term \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d in sentence two refers to all State Registration requirements \xe2\x80\x9cimposed on interstate carriers <em>by reason of </em>their operation in interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20 (emphasis in original).  Indeed, to read the words \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of . . .\xe2\x80\x9d into \xc2\xa714504, a linguistic stretch, would be wholly inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes, because it would leave a State free to implement a regulation in excess of specific SSRS limitations as long as it did not single out interstate carriers (say, a neutral rule that all truckers must pay $50, or $500, per truck for proof of insurance, or must designate multiple agents for service of process).  See <em>post</em>, at 8 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To avoid this severely incongruous result, the dissent (which adopts the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view) must resort to interpretive acrobatics.  After first reading subsection (b) to say that a neutral base State requirement, despite being \xe2\x80\x9cin excess\xe2\x80\x9d of SSRS standards, is not an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable burden on\xe2\x80\x9d commerce, it then reads subsection (c) to say that such a requirement, <em>because</em> it is \xe2\x80\x9cin excess\xe2\x80\x9d of SSRS standards, is<em> </em>nonetheless prohibited by the statute (in effect, an unreasonable burden on commerce).  <em>Post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  Aside from imposing significant complexities on the statute where otherwise none would exist, this reading stretches subsection (c)\xe2\x80\x99s function beyond that which its structure and language will allow.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, we see no language elsewhere in the statute suggesting that the term \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d refers to <em>any</em> kind of State Registration whatsoever that might affect interstate carriers.  And even the Government concedes that certain registration obligations\xe2\x80\x94those in \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional areas of state regulation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are beyond the pre-emptive reach of the statute.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 19.  Finally, the implementing regulations do not support these broader constructions.  See 49 CFR \xc2\xa7367.1 <em>et seq</em>.<em> </em>(2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our reading of the text finds confirmation in historical context.  Congress enacted \xc2\xa714504 to simplify the old \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d system.  See <em>Yellow Transp.,</em> 537 U. S., at 39\xe2\x80\x9340.  Under the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d scheme, <em>each</em> State could independently demand the same separate filings (evidence of a Federal Permit, proof of insurance, and a service-of-process agent) as well as separate fees.  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7302(b)(2) (1976 ed.); \xc2\xa711506 (1988 ed.); 49 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71023.11, 1023.21, 1023.32, 1023.51 (1990).  Federal law governing that scheme placed no express constraints on any state filings or fees other than those concerning Federal Permit and insurance requirements.  Indeed, federal regulations specified that the federal \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d statute did not \xe2\x80\x9caffect\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9ccollection or [the] method of collection of taxes or fees by a State\xe2\x80\x9d from interstate truckers \xe2\x80\x9cfor the operation of vehicles within\xe2\x80\x9d its \xe2\x80\x9cborders.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71023.104.  And they further provided that the statute did not \xe2\x80\x9caffect\xe2\x80\x9d state requirements \xe2\x80\x9cas to the external identification of vehicles to indicate the payment of a State tax or fee imposed for revenue purposes or for any other purpose\xe2\x80\x9d not governed by the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d system.  \xc2\xa71023.42.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Congress created the new SSRS, it did not indicate (in the text, structure, or divinable purpose of the new provision) that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old.  See ISTEA, 105 Stat. 1914.  The relevant differences between the SSRS and the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d regime were that: (1) one State, rather than many, would collect the relevant filings; (2) one State, rather than many, would collect the relevant fees; and (3) these fees, limited to the same amount as before, would relate to filing of proof of insurance rather than to filing of the Federal Permit.  Compare 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711506 (1988 ed.) with \xc2\xa714504 (2000 ed.); see also \xc2\xa711506 (1988 ed., Supp. IV).  These modifications merely sought more efficient, not greater, federal regulation.  See <em>Yellow Transp.,</em> <em>supra;</em> see also 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa713908(a), (d) (authorizing the Secretary to replace the SSRS with a yet more streamlined system and pre-empting only those State \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance filing requirements or fees that <em>are for the same purposes</em> as filings or fees the Secretary requires under the new system\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).<em> </em>And while the new regulations implementing the SSRS do not explicitly exempt unrelated state requirements from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive reach, neither they nor the rulemaking that produced them suggest any change to pre-existing practice in this respect.  See 49 CFR \xc2\xa7367.1 <em>et seq</em>. (2004); see also <em>Single-State Insurance Registration</em>, 9 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0C. 2d 610 (1993) (Interstate Commerce Commission decision announcing new regulations); <em>Single State Insurance Registration</em>, No. MC\xe2\x80\x93100 (Sub-No. 6), 1993 WL 17833 (I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0C., Jan. 13, 1993) (proposing regulations, providing justifications, and soliciting further comments).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we have found nothing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes or objectives\xe2\x80\x94improving the efficiency of the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d system and simplifying a uniform scheme for providing States with certain vital information\xe2\x80\x94that either requires a broader reading of the statutory term, or that impliedly pre-empts other, non-SSRS-related state rules.  Cf. <em>Geier </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html">529 U. S. 861</a>, 881 (2000) (federal statutes by implication pre-empt state law that stands \xe2\x80\x9cas an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution\xe2\x80\x9d of their federal objectives (internal quotation marks omitted)).  That is, we can find no indication that Congress sought to use this narrowly focused statute to forbid state fee or registration obligations that have nothing to do with basic SSRS (or earlier \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d) objectives\xe2\x80\x94say, for example, a State Registration requirement related to compliance by interstate carriers with rules governing the introduction of foreign pests into the jurisdiction, or with a State\xe2\x80\x99s version of the Amber Alert system, or with size, weight, and safety standards.  The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce Clause may (or may not) forbid some such rules.  But this statute\xe2\x80\x94which identifies and regulates very specific items\xe2\x80\x94says nothing about them, and there is no reason to believe that Congress wished to resolve <em>that</em> kind of Commerce Clause issue in this provision.  Cf. 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713908 (indicating that the SSRS may well be only a temporary system and similarly focusing on limited, federally enumerated requirements without discussing broad pre-emption).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude, as we have said, that the term \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the second sentence of the SSRS statute, covers only those State Registration requirements that concern the subject matter of that statutory provision, namely the registration of a Federal Permit, proof of insurance, and the name of an agent for service of process.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  It neither explicitly nor implicitly reaches unrelated matters.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second legal question involves the Michigan statute imposing the $100 fee on Michigan-plated trucks operating entirely in interstate commerce.  MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2) (West 2002).  Do the requirements set forth in that statute concern the SSRS statute\xe2\x80\x99s subject matter?  We think that they do not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, the Michigan statute imposing the $100 fee makes no reference to evidence of a Federal Permit, to any insurance requirement, or to an agent for receiving service of process.  Nor, as far as we can tell, do any state rules related to the $100 fee require the filing of information about these matters.  See Equipment List Form P\xe2\x80\x93344\xe2\x80\x93T<em> </em>(requiring information about truck make, type, year, unit number, and serial number).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, Michigan law imposed a separate fee on interstate motor carriers with trucks license plated in Michigan before the SSRS existed and before Michigan began to participate in the \xe2\x80\x9cbingo card\xe2\x80\x9d system.  See App. 24\xe2\x80\x9325; Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Second Motion for Partial Summary Disposition in No. 95\xe2\x80\x9315628\xe2\x80\x93CM etc. (Mich. Ct. Cl.), p.\xc2\xa05; Plaintiffs-Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 Brief on Appeal, in No. 226052 etc. (Mich. Ct. App.), pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936; MCL \xc2\xa7478.7(4) (West 2002).  Hence such a fee does not represent an effort somehow to circumvent the limitations imposed in connection with federal laws governing State Registration of Federal\nPermits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Michigan rules provide that a Michigan-plated interstate truck choosing Michigan as its SSRS base State can apparently comply with Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s SSRS requirements even if it does not comply with Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s $100 fee requirement.  The owner of that truck can fill out Michigan form RS\xe2\x80\x931, thereby providing Michigan with evidence that it has a Federal Permit.  App. 65\xe2\x80\x9366.  It can also fill out form RS\xe2\x80\x932, on which it indicates the total SSRS fees it owes to all participating States whose borders the truck will cross.  <em>Id., </em>at 67.  Upon submission of the two forms and payment of the fees, Michigan apparently will give the owner form RS\xe2\x80\x933, an SSRS receipt, a copy of which the owner can place in the vehicle of the truck, thereby complying with Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s (and all other participating States\xe2\x80\x99) SSRS-related \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  If that owner fails to pay Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s $100 fee for that truck, the owner will not receive a state fee decal.  But that owner will have violated only Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s $100 fee statute here at issue, MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2) (West 2002).  Petitioners have provided us with nothing that suggests the owner will have violated any other provision of Michigan law.  See \xc2\xa7478.7(4).  And they have not demonstrated that Michigan law in practice holds hostage a truck owner\xe2\x80\x99s SSRS compliance until the owner pays \xc2\xa7478.2(2)\xe2\x80\x99s $100 fee.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, we recognize that Michigan form RS\xe2\x80\x932, the form that lists all SSRS-participating States together with their SSRS-related fees, places an asterisk next to Michigan and states that \xe2\x80\x9c[v]ehicles base-plated in Michigan need not\xe2\x80\x9d pay any SSRS fee but \xe2\x80\x9care required to have a $100.00\xe2\x80\x9d Michigan decal.  App. 67.  Michigan thereby forgives Michigan-plated interstate trucks (which must pay Michigan $100) payment of the $10 Michigan SSRS fee that would otherwise be due.  And to that extent, there is a connection between the $100 fee and the SSRS.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan appears to forgive its $10 SSRS fee, however, only for the Michigan-plated interstate trucks of a carrier that has chosen Michigan as its SSRS \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d State.  See Reply Brief for Petitioners 14\xe2\x80\x9315, n.\xc2\xa08.  Michigan-plated trucks operating out of a different SSRS base State, say, Ohio, must pay the fee, which is remitted back to Michigan.  Thus, the $10 reduction can be seen simply as an effort to provide modest, administratively efficient (because Michigan itself is handling both fees) recompense to those motor carriers that operate Michigan-plated trucks and choose Michigan as their SSRS base State.  That subsidiary connection cannot transform Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s $100 fee, which exclusively involves non-SSRS subject matter (and was created for non-SSRS-related reasons), into a requirement that concerns the subject matter of the SSRS statute.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we conclude that 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b) does not pre-empt Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s $100 fee.

Proceeding to apply the rule so announced, the Court of Appeals held that the $100 fee imposed by MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2) on Michigan-plated interstate carriers is a regulatory fee rather than a registration fee because the fee \xe2\x80\x9cis imposed for the administration of the [Michigan Motor Carrier Act], particularly covering costs of enforcing safety regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d 255 Mich. App., at 604, 662 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 795.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority affirms the judgment below, but \xe2\x80\x9cfor other reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to adopt the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rationale is understandable.  MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2) and related state rules and regulations require a motor carrier that wants to operate Michigan-plated vehicles in interstate commerce in Michigan to fill out a form providing detailed identifying information for each vehicle and to pay a $100-per-vehicle fee.  In return, the State provides the carrier with decals that it must place on its trucks.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  If this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d in the general and ordinary sense of the term, it is hard to conceive of what is.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holding would allow the State to convert any registration fee into a regulatory fee simply by declaring a regulatory purpose or spending some portion of the money collected on regulation or administration.  The logic of this approach excludes from the coverage of 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b) almost all state requirements, including those dealing with similar subject matter as the SSRS.  The purpose of SSRS requirements, after all, is to regulate the interstate motor carrier industry; and the fees collected are used to administer the system.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval of the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning is implicit in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to affirm on a different ground.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  Yet the Court\xe2\x80\x99s affirmance of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision, coupled with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make its apparent disagreement with the reasoning explicit, will result in the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 broad rule surviving to work additional mischief in future cases, a most undesirable result in this area, where fees and regulatory requirements are so pervasive.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court appears to agree that MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2) imposes a state registration requirement on interstate motor carriers, it holds, nonetheless, that the provision is not pre-empted by 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b).  This, according to the Court, is because the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa714504(b) refers not to state registration requirements generally, but only to those state registration requirements that concern the same subject matter as the SSRS: registration of a federal permit, proof of insurance, and designation of an agent for service of process.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  Section 14504(b) simply cannot bear the narrowing construction the Court seeks to impose upon it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first sentence of \xc2\xa714504(b) authorizes States to impose registration requirements on interstate motor carriers if the registration \xe2\x80\x9cis completed under standards of the Secretary under [\xc2\xa714504(c)],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, under the SSRS.  The second sentence of \xc2\xa714504(b) pre-empts \xe2\x80\x9ca State registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d that imposes \xe2\x80\x9cobligations in excess\xe2\x80\x9d of the SSRS.  There ought to be no question that MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2) is a state registration requirement.  The Court seems to agree, at least when the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d is used in its ordinary and general sense.  It should also be apparent that the obligations imposed by \xc2\xa7478.2(2) are in excess of those authorized by the standards of the Secretary under 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(c).  The plain text of \xc2\xa714504(b), then, would appear to pre-empt MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2), at least when \xc2\xa7478.2(2) is considered in isolation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, departs from the text of the statute.  Title 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b), by its terms, saves from pre-emption only one class of state registration requirements imposed on interstate motor carriers: those completed under standards of the Secretary under \xc2\xa714504(c), <em>i.e.</em>, those that are authorized under the SSRS.  To this subset the Court adds a second class of state registration requirements saved from pre-emption: those that concern subject matters not covered under \xc2\xa714504(c).  The problem, of course, is that the statute simply does not provide for the exemption the Court invents.  There is no basis in the statutory text or structure for adding this limitation, and the Court cannot carry its heavy burden to show why the language Congress used in \xc2\xa714504(b) should not be given its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court makes only one textual argument for the limitation it superimposes on \xc2\xa714504(b)\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence.  The second sentence, the Court reasons, refers to the same set of state registration requirements discussed in the first sentence.  It must follow, the Court says, that because the first sentence of \xc2\xa714504(b) refers to SSRS registration, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d in the second sentence refers only to state registration requirements that concern the same subject matter as the SSRS.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s premise is faulty.  The two terms in the first sentence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crequirement of a State that [an interstate motor carrier] must register\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cregistration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are not, when taken by themselves, limited to state registration requirements concerning the same \xe2\x80\x9csubject matter\xe2\x80\x9d as the SSRS.  These terms, like the term \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d in the second sentence of \xc2\xa714504(b), refer generally to any state requirement that an interstate motor carrier register with the State.  No narrower reading is necessary to make perfect sense of each of \xc2\xa714504(b)\xe2\x80\x99s two sentences and of how they operate together.  The first sentence of \xc2\xa714504(b) declares that the subset of state registration requirements consisting of those requirements authorized under the SSRS\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, requirements \xe2\x80\x9ccompleted under standards of the Secretary under [\xc2\xa714504(c)]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are not pre-empted.  The second sentence of \xc2\xa714504(b) says that all other state registration requirements for interstate motor carriers are pre-empted.  It is difficult to understand the Court\xe2\x80\x99s mighty struggle to resist this simple, direct reading of the statutory language.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also observes that there is no language elsewhere in the statute or in the implementing regulations suggesting that \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa714504(b) refers to all types of state registration requirements imposed on interstate motor carriers, and the Court asserts that even the United States concedes that certain registration obligations in traditional areas of state regulation are beyond the statute\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive reach.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  The first claim is irrelevant and the second is wrong.  Section 14504(b) itself makes clear its pre-emptive scope, and confirmation by other statutory provisions or administrative regulations is unnecessary.  And, while the United States did say that \xc2\xa714504(b) was not \xe2\x80\x9cintended to preempt state laws and fees in traditional areas of state regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d the reason the United States believes this is so is because \xc2\xa714054(b) does not pre-empt general registration requirements that do not apply specifically to interstate motor carriers.  Brief as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 19\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps sensing the weakness of its textual argument, the Court turns to statutory history.  The Court is correct to say that, before the enactment of \xc2\xa714504(b) and the SSRS, federal law did not pre-empt state filings or fees other than those concerning federal permit and insurance requirements.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Pre-SSRS federal regulations, furthermore, specified that the federal statute did not affect the power of States to collect other fees from interstate motor carriers or to require decals indicating payment of these fees.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This is beside the point, however.  The extent of pre-emption before enactment of \xc2\xa714504(b) tells us little about \xc2\xa714504(b)\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive effect.  Similarly, the fact that pre-SSRS federal regulations preserved other state registration requirements is of minimal significance when, as the Court admits, the new regulations contain no such provisions.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  If anything, the failure to repromulgate regulations saving other state registration fees from pre-emption suggests that the federal agency charged with implementing the SSRS did think that \xc2\xa714504(b) expanded the scope of federal pre-emption.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s meaning is therefore obscure when it declares that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cdid not indicate (in the text, structure, or divinable purpose of the new provision) that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Congress did indicate an expansion of federal pre-emption in \xc2\xa714504(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctext\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it did so by replacing a narrow pre-emption clause with a broad pre-emption clause.  Congress is not required to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe really mean it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</em> v. <em>Nigh</em>, 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 4) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly think it \xe2\x80\x98scant indication\xe2\x80\x99 of intent to alter [the meaning of a statute] that Congress <em>amended the text of the statute</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps the Court means to suggest that what appears to be the plain meaning of \xc2\xa714504(b) is put in doubt by the fact that the predecessor statute\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive scope was much more limited.  Comparison with predecessor statutes, however, is permissible only to resolve statutory ambiguity that exists independent of the comparison with the predecessor statute; comparison with predecessor statutes cannot be used to create ambiguity about the meaning of an otherwise clear statute.  <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/526/index.html">540 U.

The Court, furthermore, does not explain why the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes require the Court\xe2\x80\x99s artificially narrow reading of the facially broad statutory command.  The most the Court is willing to say is that it \xe2\x80\x9ccan find no indication,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10, that when Congress said \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d it meant \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  So it says Congress must have meant \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement concerning the same subject matter as the SSRS.\xe2\x80\x9d  The text of \xc2\xa714504(b), however, does not admit of the qualifications the Court adds to it.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument from statutory purpose has no basis.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court suggests that if Congress intended \xc2\xa714504(b) to have the broad pre-emptive effect required by the text, Congress would have more clearly indicated that intention<em> Ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e can find no indication that Congress sought\xe2\x80\x9d to pre-empt requirements not related to SSRS subject matter).  It is not entirely clear what sort of additional indication of congressional purpose the Court is looking for.  The text, as noted above, does provide an indication of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  Perhaps the Court is troubled by the absence of statements in the legislative history endorsing \xc2\xa714504(b)\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of federal pre-emption.  The lack of confirmatory legislative history, however, is not a legitimate reason for imposing an artificial narrowing construction on broad but clear statutory text.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would be a strange canon of statutory construction that would require Congress to state in committee reports or elsewhere in its deliberations that which is obvious on the face of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harrison</em> v. <em>PPG Industries, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/578/index.html">446 U.

It should be noted, however, that this phrase is ambiguous in a different respect.  Section 14504(b) might be read, on the one hand, to exempt interstate motor carriers from any non-SSRS state registration requirement, including general requirements that apply to all motor carriers or to some other set of entities.  On the other hand, \xc2\xa714504(b) might be read to pre-empt only those non-SSRS registration requirements that apply specifically to interstate motor carriers.  That is, \xc2\xa714504(b) might come into play only if being an interstate motor carrier is a necessary or sufficient condition for imposition of a state registration requirement.  The United States takes the latter view of the statute, Brief as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 17\xe2\x80\x9322, and I am of the same opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cState registration requirement\xe2\x80\x9d in the second sentence of \xc2\xa714504(b) is not qualified, it is clear from context that this term refers to a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement of a State that a motor carrier providing [interstate transportation] must register with the State,\xe2\x80\x9d the more specific term that appears in \xc2\xa714509(b)\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence.  It is grammatically possible to read the statutory command as exempting interstate motor carriers from all registration requirements other than the SSRS, but that reading would lead to absurd results.  It would suggest, for example, that interstate motor carriers with a principal place of business in Michigan do not have to register their presence for purposes of state tax collection.  In context, the more natural and sensible reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9crequirement of a State that a motor carrier providing [interstate transportation] must register with the State,\xe2\x80\x9d includes only those registration requirements that are triggered specifically by the fact that the entity in question is an interstate motor carrier.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa714504(b) pre-empts state registration requirements that single out interstate carriers, but not general state registration requirements that apply to interstate carriers only incidentally, my analysis of \xc2\xa714504(b) does not necessarily mean the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate conclusion in this case is incorrect.  Respondents contend that MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2) applies only to trucks with Michigan license plates, and that \xc2\xa7478.2(2) should be considered together with \xc2\xa7478.2(1), which imposes a $100 fee on every truck doing intrastate business within Michigan.  According to the respondents, then, 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b) does not come into play because interstate carriers are not singled out; Michigan imposes the same $100 fee on all for-hire motor vehicles license-plated in Michigan.  Brief for Respondents 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  The petitioners and the United States take issue with this argument.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 10\xe2\x80\x9314; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 24\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view it is not necessary to reach this question.  The Michigan Court of Appeals resolved the case on the incorrect theory that a fee is not a registration fee if its purpose is to regulate the industry.  Given its erroneous view of the statute, the proper course should be to vacate the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision and remand for further proceedings.  Remanding the case would allow the Michigan courts to consider the competing arguments in light of the correct legal interpretation of 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b).  The respondents would, at that stage, be able to advance their arguments that MCL \xc2\xa7478.2(2) is not pre-empted when it is considered in conjunction with \xc2\xa7478.2(1) or any other aspect of the statutory scheme that bears on whether Michigan imposes registration requirements specifically on interstate motor carriers beyond those authorized under the SSRS.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court insists that to read \xe2\x80\x9crequirement that a motor carrier providing [interstate transportation] must register with the State\xe2\x80\x9d as including only those requirements that apply specifically to interstate motor carriers would be \xe2\x80\x9cwholly inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes, because it would leave a State free to implement a regulation in excess of specific SSRS limitations as long as it did not single out interstate carriers \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  The Court is correct that, under my interpretation, 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714504(b) would not pre-empt general, neutral requirements, even if they dealt with subject matter similar to that covered by the SSRS.  The Court is wrong, however, to suggest this therefore means an SSRS could collect from interstate motor carriers a $500 fee for proof of insurance or require designation of multiple agents for service of process, as long as the requirement in question applied evenhandedly to all motor carriers.  The Court errs because it fails to give adequate consideration to the restrictions imposed by \xc2\xa714504(c).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 14504(c)(2)(A) declares that \xe2\x80\x9conly a State acting in its capacity as a registration State under [the SSRS] may require a motor carrier registered by the Secretary under [the SSRS]\xe2\x80\x9d to file proof of federal registration and proof of insurance, to collect fees for filing proof of insurance, and to maintain a local agent for service of process.  Section \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(B) constrains the SSRS registration requirements and fees the SSRS registration State can impose on interstate motor carriers.  These sections contain an ambiguity similar to that which affects \xc2\xa714504(b).  Context, however, suggests that the ambiguity should be resolved differently.  The best interpretation of \xc2\xa714504(c), in my submission, is that no State participating in the SSRS other than an interstate motor carrier\xe2\x80\x99s designated SSRS registration State may impose requirements of the sort listed in \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(A) on that carrier, even if the requirement is general and applies to all motor carriers.  The SSRS registration State, furthermore, may only impose on registered interstate motor carriers requirements related to those listed in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iv) if the State conforms to the restrictions in \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taken together, the general pre-emption provision in \xc2\xa714504(b) and the specific limitations on SSRS registration States in \xc2\xa714504(c) establish a rational regulatory scheme.  Whether or not a State participates in the SSRS, it cannot impose a registration requirement that singles out interstate motor carriers unless that requirement is authorized under the SSRS.  States that participate in the SSRS may impose general, neutral registration requirements that happen to affect interstate motor carriers unless those requirements are inconsistent with the specific mandates of the SSRS related to proof of insurance, proof of federal permit, fees, and service of process.  Non-SSRS States may impose any general, neutral registration requirement, even if they require interstate motor carriers, among others, to file proof of insurance or maintain a local agent for service of process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation leads to a less sensible scheme.  According to the Court, that statute permits States to impose on interstate carriers any number of onerous requirements so long as these requirements are not explicitly linked to the subjects covered by the SSRS.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, furthermore, means that those States which are excluded from the SSRS under \xc2\xa714504(c)(2)(D) may not apply general state registration requirements to interstate motor carriers if the requirements concern proof of insurance or registration of an agent for service of process.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, the statute does not pre-empt state regulations that single out interstate carriers for special burdens well beyond what the SSRS allows, but it does prevent non-SSRS States from applying a number of modest, evenhanded registration requirements to interstate carriers, even though the SSRS is not available to these States.  That implausible result is not demanded by the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of heeding what Congress actually said, the Court relies on flawed textual analysis and dubious inferences from legislative silence to impose the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of what it thinks Congress probably wanted to say.  In my view, this is a mistake.  Other arguments, not considered by the Michigan Court of Appeals or by our Court, might support the ultimate outcome in this case.  These arguments, however, ought to be addressed on remand.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></font></div>'
