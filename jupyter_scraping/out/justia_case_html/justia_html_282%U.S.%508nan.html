JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a suit under the Act of July 1, 1918, c. 114, 40 Stat. 704, 705, U.S.Code, Title 35, \xc2\xa7 68, to recover for the unlicensed use of a patented invention.  The liability of the United States is established by the findings of the Court of Claims, and is not disputed.  Neither is there any dispute that the profits that the plaintiff would have made are a proper measure of the damages suffered.  The Court of Claims, however, ruled that interest should not be allowed upon the amount so fixed, and a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court upon that question.</p>\n<p>The Government, without formally confessing error, states its belief that interest should have been allowed.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 282 U. S. 509</a></p><p> The statute grants "recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use."  We are of opinion that interest should be allowed in order to make the compensation "entire."  In addition to the purpose of the word adverted to in <em>Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/275/331/case.html">275 U.
