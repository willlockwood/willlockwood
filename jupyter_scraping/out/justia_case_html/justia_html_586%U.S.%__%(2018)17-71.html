In 2001, the Service listed the dusky gopher frog as an endangered species.  See\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71533(a)(1).  That required the Service to designate \xe2\x80\x9ccritical habitat\xe2\x80\x9d for the frog.  The Service proposed designating as part of that critical habitat a site in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, which the Service dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cUnit 1.\xe2\x80\x9d  The frog had once lived in Unit 1, but the land had long been used as a commercial timber plantation, and no frogs had been spotted there for decades.  The Service concluded that Unit 1 met the statutory definition of unoccupied critical habitat because its rare, high-quality breeding ponds and distance from existing frog populations made it essential for the species\xe2\x80\x99 conservation.  \xc2\xa71532(5)(A)(ii).  The Service then commissioned a report on the probable economic impact of its proposed critical-habitat designation.  \xc2\xa71533(b)(2).  With regard to Unit 1, the report found that designation might bar future development of the site, depriving the owners of up to $33.9 million.  The Service nonetheless concluded that the potential costs were not disproportionate to the conservation benefits and proceeded to designate Unit 1 as critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Unit 1 is owned by petitioner Weyerhaeuser and a group of family landowners.  The owners of Unit 1 sued, contending that the closed-canopy timber plantation on Unit 1 could not be critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog, which lives in open-canopy forests.  The District Court upheld the designation.  The landowners also challenged the Service\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to exclude Unit 1 from the frog\xe2\x80\x99s critical habitat, arguing that the Service had failed to adequately weigh the benefits of designating Unit 1 against the economic impact, had used an unreasonable methodology for estimating economic impact, and had failed to consider several categories of costs.  The District Court approved the Service\xe2\x80\x99s methodology and declined to consider the challenge to the Service\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to exclude Unit 1.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, rejecting the suggestion that the \xe2\x80\x9ccritical habitat\xe2\x80\x9d definition contains any habitability requirement and concluding that the Service\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to exclude Unit 1 was committed to agency discretion by law and was therefore unreviewable.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0An area is eligible for designation as critical habitat under \xc2\xa71533(a)(3)(A)(i) only if it is habitat for the species.  That provision, the sole source of authority for critical-habit designations, states that when the Secretary lists a species as endangered he must also \xe2\x80\x9cdesignate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat.\xe2\x80\x9d  It does not authorize the Secretary to designate the area as critical habitat unless it is also habitat for the species.  The definition allows the Secretary to identify a subset of habitat that is critical, but leaves the larger category of habitat undefined.  The Service does not now dispute that critical habitat must be habitat, but argues that habitat can include areas that, like Unit 1, would require some degree of modification to support a sustainable population of a given species.  Weyerhaeuser urges that habitat cannot include areas where the species could not currently survive.  The Service, in turn, disputes the premise that the administrative record shows that the frog could not survive in Unit 1.  The Court of Appeals, which had no occasion to interpret the term \xe2\x80\x9chabitat\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71533(a)(3)(A)(i) or to assess the Service\xe2\x80\x99s administrative findings regarding Unit 1, should address these questions in the first instance.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to exclude an area from critical habitat under \xc2\xa71533(b)(2) is subject to judicial review.  The Administrative Procedure Act creates a \xe2\x80\x9cbasic presumption of judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d of agency action.  <i>Abbott Laboratories</i> v. <i>Gardner</i>,\n\n387 U.\xc2\xa0S. 136, 140.  The Service contends that the presumption is rebutted here because the action is \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted to agency discretion by law,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7701(a)(2), because \xc2\xa71533(b)(2) is one of those rare provisions \xe2\x80\x9cdrawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Lincoln</i> v. <i>Vigil</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 182, 191.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Section 1533(b)(2) describes a unified process for weighing the impact of designating an area as critical habitat.  The provision\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence requires the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9ctak[e] into consideration\xe2\x80\x9d economic and other impacts before designation, and the second sentence authorizes the Secretary to act on his consideration by providing that he \xe2\x80\x9cmay exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d designation.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d certainly confers discretion on the Secretary, but it does not segregate his discretionary decision not to exclude from the mandated procedure to consider the economic and other impacts of designation when making his exclusion decisions.  The statute is, therefore, not \xe2\x80\x9cdrawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the [Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s] exercise of [his] discretion\xe2\x80\x9d not to exclude.  <i>Lincoln</i>, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 191.  Weyerhaeuser\xe2\x80\x99s claim\xe2\x80\x94that the agency did not appropriately consider all the relevant statutory factors meant to guide the agency in the exercise of its discretion\xe2\x80\x94is the sort of claim that federal courts routinely assess when determining whether to set aside an agency decision as an abuse of discretion.  The Court of Appeals should consider in the first instance the question whether the Service\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the costs and benefits of designation and resulting decision not to exclude Unit 1 was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.

In such forests, frequent fires help maintain an open canopy, which in turn allows vegetation to grow on the forest floor.  The vegetation supports the small insects that the frog eats and provides a place for the frog\xe2\x80\x99s eggs to attach when it breeds.  The frog breeds in \xe2\x80\x9cephemeral\xe2\x80\x9d ponds that are dry for part of the year.  Such ponds are safe for tadpoles because predatory fish cannot live in them.  Designation of Critical Habitat for Dusky Gopher Frog, 77 Fed. Reg. 35129\xe2\x80\x9335131 (2012) (Designation).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dusky gopher frog once lived throughout coastal Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, in the longleaf pine forests that used to cover the southeast.  But more than 98% of those forests have been removed to make way for urban development, agriculture, and timber plantations.  The timber plantations consist of fast-growing loblolly pines planted as close together as possible, resulting in a closed-canopy forest inhospitable to the frog.  The near eradication of the frog\xe2\x80\x99s habitat sent the species into severe decline.  By 2001, the known wild population of the dusky gopher frog had dwindled to a group of 100 at a single pond in southern Mississippi.  That year, the Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the Endangered Species Act of 1973 on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, listed the dusky gopher frog as an endangered species.

It instead places conditions on the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s authority to effect any physical changes to the designated area, whether through activities of its own or by facilitating private development.  Section 7 of the ESA requires all federal agencies to consult with the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9c[e]nsure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency\xe2\x80\x9d is not likely to adversely affect a listed species\xe2\x80\x99 critical habitat.\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71536(a)(2).

The Service found that each of those areas possessed the three features that the Service considered \xe2\x80\x9cessential to the conservation\xe2\x80\x9d of the frog and that required special protection: ephemeral ponds; upland open-canopy forest containing the holes and burrows in which the frog could live; and open-canopy forest connecting the two.  But the Service also determined that designating only those four sites would not adequately ensure the frog\xe2\x80\x99s conservation.  Because the existing dusky gopher frog populations were all located in two adjacent counties on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, local events such as extreme weather or an outbreak of an infectious disease could jeopardize the entire species.  Designation of Critical Habitat for Mississippi Gopher Frog, 75 Fed. Reg. 31394 (2010) (proposed 50 CFR Part 17).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To protect against that risk, the Service proposed to designate as <i>unoccupied</i> critical habitat a 1,544-acre site in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana.  The site, dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cUnit 1\xe2\x80\x9d by the Service, had been home to the last known population of dusky gopher frogs outside of Mississippi.  The frog had not been seen in Unit 1 since 1965, and a closed-canopy timber plantation occupied much of the site.  But the Service found that the site retained five ephem- eral ponds \xe2\x80\x9cof remarkable quality,\xe2\x80\x9d and determined that an open-canopy forest could be restored on the surrounding uplands \xe2\x80\x9cwith reasonable effort.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although the uplands  in Unit 1 lacked the open-canopy forests (and, of course, the frogs) necessary for designation as occupied critical habitat, the Service concluded that the site met the statutory definition of unoccupied critical habitat because its rare, high-quality breeding ponds and its distance from existing frog populations made it essential for the conservation of the species.  Designation<i>,</i> at 35118, 35124, 35133, 35135.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After issuing its proposal, the Service commissioned a report on the probable economic impact of designating each area, including Unit 1, as critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog.

Because Unit 1 is designated as critical habitat, Section 7 of the ESA would require the Corps to consult with the Service before issuing any permits.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">According to the report, that consultation process could result in one of three outcomes.  First, it could turn out that the wetlands in Unit 1 are not subject to the Clean Water Act permitting requirements, in which case the landowners could proceed with their plans unimpeded.  Second, the Service could ask the Corps not to issue permits to the landowners to fill some of the wetlands on the site, in effect prohibiting development on 60% of Unit 1.  The report estimated that this would deprive the owners of $20.4 million in development value.  Third, by asking the Corps to deny even more of the permit requests, the Service could bar all development of Unit 1, costing the owners $33.9 million.  The Service concluded that those potential costs were not \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d to the conservation benefits of designation.  \xe2\x80\x9cConsequently,\xe2\x80\x9d the Service announced, it would not \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[e] [its] discretion to exclude\xe2\x80\x9d Unit 1 from the dusky gopher frog\xe2\x80\x99s critical habitat.

But the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccritical habitat\xe2\x80\x9d tells us what makes habitat \xe2\x80\x9ccritical,\xe2\x80\x9d not what makes it \xe2\x80\x9chabitat.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the statutory definition, critical habitat comprises areas occupied by the species \xe2\x80\x9con which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as unoccupied areas that the Secretary determines to be \xe2\x80\x9cessential for the conservation of the species.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71532(5)(A).  That is no baseline definition of habitat\xe2\x80\x94it identifies only certain areas that are indispensable to the conservation of the endangered species.  The definition allows the Secretary to identify the subset of habitat that is critical, but leaves the larger category of habitat undefined.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Service does not now dispute that critical habitat must be habitat, see Brief for Federal Respondents 23, although it made no such concession below.  Instead, the Service argues that habitat includes areas that, like Unit 1, would require some degree of modification to support a sustainable population of a given species.  <i>Id</i>., at 27.  Weyerhaeuser, for its part, urges that habitat cannot include areas where the species could not currently survive.  Brief for Petitioner 25.  (Habitat can, of course, include areas where the species does not currently <i>live</i>, given that the statute defines critical habitat to include unoccupied areas.)  The Service in turn disputes Weyerhaeuser\xe2\x80\x99s premise that the administrative record shows that the frog could not survive in Unit 1.  Brief for Federal Respondents 22, n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals concluded that \xe2\x80\x9ccritical habitat\xe2\x80\x9d designations under the statute were not limited to areas that qualified as habitat.  See 827 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 468 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no habitability requirement in the text of the ESA or the implementing regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The court therefore had no occasion to interpret the term \xe2\x80\x9chabitat\xe2\x80\x9d in Section 4(a)(3)(A)(i) or to assess the Service\xe2\x80\x99s administrative findings regarding Unit 1.  Accordingly, we vacate the judgment below and remand to the Court of Appeals to con- sider these questions in the first instance.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Weyerhaeuser also contends that, even if Unit 1 could be properly classified as critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog, the Service should have excluded it from designation under Section 4(b)(2) of the ESA.  That provision requires the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9ctak[e] into consideration the economic impact .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of specifying any particular area as critical habitat\xe2\x80\x9d and authorizes him to \xe2\x80\x9cexclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat.\xe2\x80\x9d  16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71533(b)(2).  To satisfy its obligation to consider economic impact, the Service commissioned a report estimating the costs of its proposed critical-habitat designation.  The Service concluded that the costs of designating the proposed areas, including Unit 1, were not \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d to the conservation benefits and, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsequently,\xe2\x80\x9d declined to make any exclusions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Weyerhaeuser claims that the Service\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion rested on a faulty assessment of the costs and benefits of designation and that the resulting decision not to exclude should be set aside.  Specifically, Weyerhaeuser contends that the Service improperly weighed the costs of designating Unit 1 against the benefits of designating <i>all </i>proposed critical habitat, rather than the benefits of designating Unit 1 in particular.  Weyerhaeuser also argues that the Service did not fully account for the economic impact of designating Unit 1 because it ignored, among other things, the costs of replacing timber trees with longleaf pines, maintaining an open canopy through controlled burning, and the tax revenue that St. Tammany Parish would lose if Unit 1 were never developed.  Brief for Petitioner 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  The Court of Appeals did not consider Weyerhaeuser\xe2\x80\x99s claim because it concluded that a decision not to exclude a certain area from critical habitat is unreviewable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Administrative Procedure Act creates a \xe2\x80\x9cbasic presumption of judicial review [for] one \xe2\x80\x98suffering legal wrong because of agency action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Abbott Laboratories</i> v. <i>Gardner</i>,\n\n387 U.\xc2\xa0S. 136, 140 (1967) (quoting\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702).  As we explained recently, \xe2\x80\x9clegal lapses and violations occur, and especially so when they have no consequence.  That is why this Court has so long applied a strong presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mach Mining, LLC </i>v. <i>EEOC</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938).  The presumption may be rebutted only if the relevant statute precludes review,\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7701(a)(1), or if the action is \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted to agency discretion by law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7701(a)(2).  The Service contends, and the lower courts agreed, that Section 4(b)(2) of the ESA commits to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s discretion decisions not to exclude an area from critical habitat.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has noted the \xe2\x80\x9ctension\xe2\x80\x9d between the prohibition of judicial review for actions \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted to agency discretion\xe2\x80\x9d and the command in \xc2\xa7706(2)(A) that courts set aside any agency action that is \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Heckler</i> v. <i>Chaney</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 821, 829 (1985).  A court could never determine that an agency abused its discretion if all matters committed to agency discretion were unreviewable.  To give effect to \xc2\xa7706(2)(A) and to honor the presumption of review, we have read the exception in \xc2\xa7701(a)(2) quite narrowly, restricting it to \xe2\x80\x9cthose rare circumstances where the relevant statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lincoln</i> v. <i>Vigil</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 182, 191 (1993).  The Service contends that Section 4(b)(2) of the ESA is one of those rare statutory provisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is, at the outset, reason to be skeptical of the Service\xe2\x80\x99s position.  The few cases in which we have applied the \xc2\xa7701(a)(2) exception involved agency decisions that courts have traditionally regarded as unreviewable, such as the allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation, <i>Lincoln</i>, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 191, or a decision not to reconsider a final action, <i>ICC</i> v. <i>Locomotive Engineers</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 270, 282 (1987).  By contrast, this case involves the sort of routine dispute that federal courts regularly review: An agency issues an order affecting the rights of a private party, and the private party objects that the agency did not properly justify its determination under a standard set forth in the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 4(b)(2) states that the Secretary</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cshall designate critical habitat .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. after taking into consideration the economic impact, the impact on national security, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat.

The first sentence of Section 4(b)(2) imposes a \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical requirement\xe2\x80\x9d that the Secretary \xe2\x80\x9ctak[e] into consideration\xe2\x80\x9d economic and other impacts before such a designation.  <i>Id.,</i> at 172 (emphasis deleted).  The second sentence authorizes the Secretary to act on his consideration by providing that he may exclude an area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of designation.  The Service followed that procedure here (albeit in a flawed manner, according to Weyerhaeuser).  It commissioned a report to estimate the costs of designating the proposed critical habitat, concluded that those costs were not \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d to the benefits of designation, and \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsequently\xe2\x80\x9d declined to \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[e] [its] discretion to exclude any areas from [the] designation of critical habitat.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 190.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Bennett </i>explained that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cultimate decision\xe2\x80\x9d to designate or exclude, which he \xe2\x80\x9carriv[es] at\xe2\x80\x9d after considering economic and other impacts, is reviewable \xe2\x80\x9cfor abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 172<i>.</i>  The Service dismisses that language as a \xe2\x80\x9cpassing reference .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not necessarily inconsistent with the Service\xe2\x80\x99s understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d which is that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to exclude an area is wholly discretionary and therefore unreviewable.  Brief for Federal Respondents 50.  The Service bases its understanding on the second sentence of Section 4(b)(2), which states that the Secretary \xe2\x80\x9c<i>may </i>exclude [an] area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of [designation].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d certainly confers discretion on the Secretary.  That does not, however, segregate his discretionary decision not to exclude from the procedure mandated by Section 4(b)(2), which directs the Secretary to consider the economic and other impacts of designation when making his exclusion decisions.  Weyerhaeuser\xe2\x80\x99s claim is the familiar one in administrative law that the agency did not appropriately consider all of the relevant factors that the statute sets forth to guide the agency in the exercise of its discretion.  Specifically, Weyerhaeuser contends that the Service ignored some costs and conflated the benefits of designating Unit 1 with the benefits of designating all of the proposed critical habitat.  This is the sort of claim that federal courts routinely assess when determining whether to set aside an agency decision as an abuse of discretion under \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  See <i>Judulang</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 42, 53 (2011) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen reviewing an agency action, we must assess .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 4(b)(2) requires the Secretary to consider economic impact and relative benefits before deciding whether to exclude an area from critical habitat or to proceed with designation.  The statute is, therefore, not \xe2\x80\x9cdrawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the [Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s] exercise of [his] discretion\xe2\x80\x9d not to exclude.  <i>Lincoln</i>, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 191.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because it determined that the Service\xe2\x80\x99s decisions not to exclude were committed to agency discretion and therefore unreviewable, the Court of Appeals did not consider whether the Service\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the costs and benefits of designation was flawed in a way that rendered the resulting decision not to exclude Unit 1 arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.
