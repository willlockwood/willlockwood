I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3, the State of South Dakota, in a time of shortage, may confine the sale of the cement it produces solely to its residents.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1919, South Dakota undertook plans to build a cement plant.  The project, a product of the State\'s then prevailing Progressive political movement, was initiated in response to recent regional cement shortages that "interfered with and delayed both public and private enterprises," and that were "threatening the people of this state."  <em>Eakin v. South Dakota State Cement Comm\'n,</em> 44 S.D. 268, 272, 183 N.W. 651, 652 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 447 U. S. 431</a></p><p> (1921). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In 1920, the South Dakota Cement Commission anticipated "[t]hat there would be a ready market for the entire output of the plant within the state."  Report of State </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 447 U. S. 432</a></p><p> Cement Commission 9 (1920).  The plant, however, located at Rapid City, soon produced more cement than South Dakotans could use.  Over the years, buyers in no less than nine nearby States purchased cement from the State\'s plant.   App. 26.  Between 1970 and 1977, some 40% of the plant\'s output went outside the State.</p>\n<p>The plant\'s list of out-of-state cement buyers included petitioner Reeves, Inc.  Reeves is a ready-mix concrete [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] distributor organized under Wyoming law and with facilities in Buffalo, Gillette, and Sheridan, Wyo.  <em>Id.</em> at 15.  From the beginning of its operations in 1958, and until 1978, Reeves purchased about 95% of its cement from the South Dakota plant.  <em>Id.</em> at 15 and 22.  In 1977, its purchases were $1,172,000.  <em>Id.</em> at 17.  In turn, Reeves has supplied three northwestern Wyoming counties with more than half their ready-mix concrete needs.  <em>Id.</em> at 15.  For 20 years, the relationship between Reeves and the South Dakota cement plant was amicable, uninterrupted, and mutually profitable.</p>\n<p>As the 1978 construction season approached, difficulties at the plant slowed production.  Meanwhile, a booming construction industry spurred demand for cement both regionally and nationally.  <em>Id.</em> at 13.  The plant found itself unable to meet all orders.  Faced with the same type of "serious cement shortage" that inspired the plant\'s construction, the Commission</p>\n<p>"reaffirmed its policy of supplying all South Dakota customers first and to honor all contract commitments, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 447 U. S. 433</a></p><p> with the remaining volume allocated on a first come, first served basis."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Reeves, which had no preexisting long-term supply contract, was hit hard and quickly by this development.  On June 30, 1978, the plant informed Reeves that it could not continue to fill Reeves\' orders, and on July 5, it turned away a Reeves truck.  <em>Id.</em> at 17-18.  Unable to find another supplier, <em>id.</em> at 21, Reeves was forced to cut production by 76% in mid-July.  <em>Id.</em> at 20.</p>\n<p>On July 19, Reeves brought this suit against the Commission, challenging the plant\'s policy of preferring South Dakota buyers, and seeking injunctive relief.  <em>Id.</em> at 3-10.  After conducting a hearing and receiving briefs and affidavits, the District Court found no substantial issue of material fact, and permanently enjoined the Commission\'s practice.  The court reasoned that South Dakota\'s "hoarding" was inimical to the national free market envisioned by the Commerce Clause.  <em>Id.</em> at 27-30.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.  <em>Reeves, Inc. v. Kelley,</em> 586 F.2d 1230, 1232 (1978).  It concluded that the State had "simply acted in a proprietary capacity," as permitted by <em>Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html">426 U. S. 794</a></span> (1976).  Petitioner sought certiorari.  This Court granted the petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Hughes v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html">441 U. S. 322</a></span> (1979).  <em>Reeves, Inc. v. Kelley,</em> 441 U.S. 939 (1979).

We granted Reeves\' petition for certiorari to consider once again the impact of the Commerce Clause on state proprietary activity.  444 U.S. 1031 (1980). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Alexandria Scrap</em> concerned a Maryland program designed to remove abandoned automobiles from the State\'s roadways and junkyards.  To encourage recycling, a "bounty" was offered for every Maryland-titled junk car converted into scrap.  Processors located both in and outside Maryland were eligible to collect these subsidies.  The legislation, as initially enacted in 1969, required a processor seeking a bounty to present documentation evidencing ownership of the wrecked car.  This requirement however, did not apply to "hulks," inoperable automobiles over eight years old.  In 1974, the statute was amended to extend documentation requirements to hulks, which comprised a large majority of the junk cars being processed.  Departing from prior practice, the new law imposed more exacting documentation requirements on out-of-state than in-state processors.  By making it less remunerative for suppliers to transfer vehicles outside Maryland, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 447 U. S. 435</a></p><p> reform triggered a "precipitate decline in the number of bounty-eligible hulks supplied to appellee\'s [Virginia] plant from Maryland sources."  426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#801">426 U. S. 801</a></span>.  Indeed,</p>\n<p>"[t]he practical effect was substantially the same as if Maryland had withdrawn altogether the availability of bounties on hulks delivered by unlicensed suppliers to licensed non-Maryland processors."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#803">426 U.

S. 819</a></span> (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>Invoking the Commerce Clause, a three-judge District Court struck down the legislation.  391 F.Supp. 46 (Md.1975).  It observed that the amendment imposed "substantial burdens upon the free flow of interstate commerce," <em>id.</em> at 62, and reasoned that the discriminatory program was not the least disruptive means of achieving the State\'s articulated objective.  <em>Id.</em> at 63.  <em>See generally Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/case.html">397 U.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court reversed.  It recognized the persuasiveness of the lower court\'s analysis if the inherent restrictions of the Commerce Clause were deemed applicable.  In the Court\'s view, however, <em>Alexandria Scrap</em> did not involve "the kind of action with which the Commerce Clause is concerned."  426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#805">426 U. S. 805</a></span>.  Unlike prior cases voiding state laws inhibiting interstate trade,</p>\n<p>"Maryland has not sought to prohibit the flow of hulks, or to regulate the conditions under which it may occur.

As that case explains, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 447 U.

There is no indication of a constitutional plan to limit the ability of the States themselves to operate freely in the free market.  <em>See</em> L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 336 (1978) ("the commerce clause was directed, as an historical matter, only at regulatory and taxing actions taken by states in their sovereign capacity").  The precedents comport with this distinction. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 447 U.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Moreover, state proprietary activities may be, and often are, burdened with the same restrictions imposed on private market participants. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Evenhandedness suggests that, when acting as proprietors, States should similarly share existing freedoms from federal constraints, including the inherent limits of the Commerce Clause.  <em>See State e rel. Collins v. Senatobia Blank Book &amp; Stationery Co.,</em> 115 Miss. 254, 260, 76 So. 258, 260 (1917); <em>Tribune Printing &amp; Binding Co. v. Barnes,</em> 7 N.D. 591, 597, 75 N.W. 94, 906 (1898).  Finally, as this case illustrates, the competing considerations in cases involving state proprietary action often will be subtle, complex, politically charged, and difficult to assess under traditional Commerce Clause analysis.  Given these factors, <em>Alexandria Scrap</em> wisely recognizes that, as a rule, the adjustment of interests in this context is a task better suited for Congress than this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 447 U. S. 440</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>South Dakota, as a seller of cement, unquestionably fits the "market participant" label more comfortably than a State acting to subsidize local scrap processors.  Thus, the general rule of <em>Alexandria Scrap</em> plainly applies here. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Petitioner argues, however, that the exemption for marketplace participation necessarily admits of exceptions.  While conceding that possibility, we perceive in this case no sufficient reason to depart from the general rule.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In finding a Commerce Clause violation, the District Court emphasized "that the Commission . . . made an election to become part of the interstate commerce system."  App. 28.  The gist of this reasoning, repeated by petitioner here, is that one good turn deserves another.  Having long exploited the interstate market, South Dakota should not be permitted to withdraw from it when a shortage arises.  This argument is not persuasive.  It is somewhat self-serving to say that South Dakota has "exploited" the interstate market.  An equally fair characterization is that neighboring States long have benefited from South Dakota\'s foresight and industry.  Viewed in this light, it is not surprising that <em>Alexandria Scrap</em> rejected an argument that the 1974 Maryland legislation challenged there was invalid because cars abandoned in Maryland had been processed in neighboring States for five years.  As in <em>Alexandria Scrap,</em> we must conclude that</p>\n<p>"this chronology does not distinguish the case, for Commerce Clause purposes, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 447 U. S. 441</a></p><p> from one in which a State offered [cement] only to domestic [buyers] from the start."</p>\n<p>426 U.S. 809. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Our rejection of petitioner\'s market exploitation theory fundamentally refocuses analysis.  It means that, to reverse, we would have to void a South Dakota "residents only" policy even if it had been enforced from the plant\'s very first days.  Such a holding, however, would interfere significantly with a State\'s ability to structure relations exclusively with its own citizens.  It would also threaten the future fashioning of effective and creative programs for solving local problems and distributing government largesse.  <em>See</em> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html">447 U.

S. 442</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Undaunted by these considerations, petitioner advances four more arguments for reversal:</p>\n<p>First, petitioner protests that South Dakota\'s preference for its residents responds solely to the "non-governmental objectiv[e]" of protectionism Brief for Petitioner 25.  Therefore, petitioner argues, the policy is <em>per se</em> invalid.  <em>See Philadelphia v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html">437 U. S. 617</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html#624">437 U. S. 624</a></span> (1978).</p>\n<p>We find the label "protectionism" of little help in this context.  The State\'s refusal to sell to buyers other than South Dakotans is "protectionist" only in the sense that it limits benefits generated by a state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to serve.  Petitioner\'s argument apparently also would characterize as "protectionist" rules restricting to state residents the enjoyment of state educational institutions, energy generated by a state-run plant, police and fire protection, and agricultural improvement and business development programs.  Such policies, while perhaps "protectionist" in a loose sense, reflect the essential and patently unobjectionable purpose of state government -- to serve the citizens of the state. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 447 U. S. 443</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Second, petitioner echoes the District Court\'s warning:</p>\n<p>"If a state in this union were allowed to hoard its commodities or resources for the use of their own residents only, a drastic situation might evolve.  For example, Pennsylvania or Wyoming might keep their coal, the northwest its timber, and the mining states their minerals.  The result being that embargo may be retaliated by embargo, and commerce would be halted at state lines."</p>\n<p>App. 29.  <em>See, e.g., Baldwin v. Montana Fish &amp; Game Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/371/case.html">436 U. S. 371</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/371/case.html#385">436 U. S. 385</a></span>-386 (1978).  This argument, although rooted in the core purpose of the Commerce Clause, does not fit the present facts.  Cement is not a natural resource, like coal, timber, wild game, or minerals.  <em>Cf. Hughes v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html">441 U. S. 322</a></span> (1979) (minnows); <em>Philadelphia v.

S. 229</a></span> (1911) (same); Note, 32 Rutgers L.Rev. 741 (1979).  It is the end product of a complex process whereby a costly physical plant and human labor act on raw materials.  South Dakota has not sought to limit access to the State\'s limestone or other materials used to make cement.  Nor has it restricted the ability of private firms or sister States to set up plants within its borders.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 4.  Moreover, petitioner has not suggested that South Dakota possesses unique access to the materials needed to produce cement. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Whatever limits might exist on a State\'s ability to invoke the <em>Alexandria Scrap</em> exemption to hoard resources which by happenstance are found there, those limits do not apply here.</p>\n<p>Third, it is suggested that the South Dakota program is infirm because it places South Dakota suppliers of ready-mix concrete at a competitive advantage in the out-of-state market; Wyoming suppliers, such as petitioner, have little chance against South Dakota suppliers who can purchase cement from the State\'s plant and freely sell beyond South Dakota\'s borders.</p>\n<p>The force of this argument is seriously diminished, if not eliminated, by several considerations.  The argument necessarily </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 447 U. S. 445</a></p><p> implies that the South Dakota scheme would be unobjectionable if sales in other States were totally barred.  It therefore proves too much, for it would tolerate even a greater measure of protectionism and stifling of interstate commerce than the challenged system allows.  <em>See K.S.B. Technical Sales Corp. v. North Jersey Dist. Water Supply Comm\'n,</em> 75 N.J. 272, 298, 381 A.2d 774, 787 (1977) ("It would be odd indeed to find that, when a state becomes less parochial . . . its purpose becomes suspect under the Commerce Clause").  <em>Cf. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,</em> 397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/case.html#142">397 U. S. 142</a></span> ("And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend . . . on whether [the state interest] could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities").  Nor is it to be forgotten that <em>Alexandria Scrap</em> approved a state program that "not only . . . effectively protect[ed] scrap processors with existing plants in Maryland from the pressures of competitors with nearby out-of-state plants, but [that] implicitly offer[ed] to extend similar protection to any competitor . . . willing to erect a scrap processing facility within Maryland\'s boundaries."  391 F.Supp. at 63.  Finally, the competitive plight of out-of-state ready-mix suppliers cannot be laid solely at the feet of South Dakota.  It is attributable as well to their own States\' not providing or attracting alternative sources of supply and to the suppliers\' own failure to guard against shortages by executing long-term supply contracts with the South Dakota plant.</p>\n<p>In its last argument, petitioner urges that, had South Dakota not acted, free market forces would have generated an appropriate level of supply at free market prices for all buyers in the region.  Having replaced free market forces, South Dakota should be forced to replicate how the free market would have operated under prevailing conditions.</p>\n<p>This argument appears to us to be simplistic and speculative.  The very reason South Dakota built its plant was because the free market had failed adequately to supply the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 447 U. S. 446</a></p><p> region with cement.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra.</em>  There is no indication, and no way to know, that private industry would have moved into petitioner\'s market area, and would have ensured a supply of cement to petitioner either prior to or during the 1978 construction season.  Indeed, it is quite possible that petitioner would never have existed -- far less operated successfully for 20 years -- had it not been for South Dakota cement. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>We conclude, then, that the arguments for invalidating South Dakota\'s resident-preference program are weak, at best.  Whatever residual force inheres in them is more than offset by countervailing considerations of policy and fairness.  Reversal would discourage similar state projects, even though this project demonstrably has served the needs of state residents and has helped the entire region for more than a half century.  Reversal also would rob South Dakota of the intended benefit of its foresight, risk, and industry. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 447 U. S. 447</a></p><p> these circumstances, there is no reason to depart from the general rule of <em>Alexandria Scrap.</em></p>\n<p>The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>It was said that the plant was built because the only cement plant in the State "had been operating successfully for a number of years until it had been bought by the so-called trust and closed down."  Report of South Dakota State Cement Commission 6 (1920).  In its report advocating creation of a cement plant, the Commission noted both the substantial profits being made by private producers in the prevailing market and the fact that producers outside the State were "now supplying all the cement used in" South Dakota.  Under the circumstances, the Commission reasoned, it would not be to the "capitalists[\'] . . . advantage to build a new plant within the state."  <em>Id.</em> at 8.  This skepticism regarding private industry\'s ability to serve public needs was a hallmark of Progressivism.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Hofstadter, The Age of Reform 227 (1955) ("In the Progressive era, the entire structure of business . . . became the object of a widespread hostility").  South Dakota, earlier a bastion of Populism, <em>id.</em> at 50, became a leading Progressivist State.  <em>See</em> R. Nye, Midwestern Progressive Politics 217-218 (1959); G. Mowry, Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Movement 155, and n. 125 (1946).  Roosevelt carried South Dakota in the election of 1912, <em>id.</em> at 281, n. 69, and Robert La Follette -- on a platform calling for public ownership of railroads and waterpower, <em>see</em> K. MacKay, The Progressive Movement of 1924, pp. 270-271 (app. 4) (1966) -- ran strongly (36.9%) in the State in 1924.  Congressional Quarterly\'s Guide to U.S. Elections 287 (1975).</p>\n<p>The backdrop against which the South Dakota cement project was initiated is described in H. Schell, History of South Dakota 268-269 (3d ed.1975):</p>\n<p>"Although a majority of the voters [in 1918] had seemingly subscribed to a state ownership philosophy, it was a question how far the Republican administration at Pierre would go in fulfilling campaign promises.  As [Governor] Norbeck entered upon his second term, he again urged a state hail insurance law and advocated steps toward a state-owned coal mine, cement plant, and state-owned stockyards.  He also recommended an appropriation for surveying dam sites for hydroelectric development.  The lawmakers readily enacted these recommendations into law, except for the stockyards proposal. . . ."</p>\n<p>". . .  In retrospect, [Norbeck\'s] program must be viewed as a part of the Progressives\' campaign against monopolistic prices.  There was, moreover, the fervent desire to make the services of the state government available to agriculture. . . .  These were basic tenets of the Progressive philosophy of government."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>"[C]ement is a finely ground manufactured mineral product, usually gray in color.

In Opinion No. 69-253, 53 Op.Cal.Atty. Gen. 72 (1970), the State\'s Attorney General reasoned that <em>Bethlehem Steel</em> similarly prohibited, under the "foreign commerce" Clause, statutes giving a preference to California-produced goods.  We have no occasion to explore the limits imposed on state proprietary actions by the "foreign commerce" Clause or the constitutionality of "Buy American" legislation.  <em>Compare Bethlehem Steel Corp., supra, with K.S.B.

But this chronology does not distinguish the case, for Commerce Clause purposes, from one in which a State offered bounties only to domestic processors from the start.  Regardless of when the State\'s largesse is first confined to domestic processors, the effect upon the flow of hulks resting within the State is the same:  they will tend to be processed inside the State, rather than flowing to foreign processors.  But no trade barrier of the type forbidden by the Commerce Clause, and involved in previous cases, impedes their movement out of State.

This characterization is an oversimplification.  The challenged feature of the Maryland program -- the discriminatory documentation requirement -- was not aimed at improving the environment; indeed, by decreasing the profit margin a hulk supplier could expect to receive if he delivered to the most accessible recycling plant, it is likely that the amendment somewhat set back the goal of encouraging hulk processing.  The stated justification for the discriminatory regulation -- reducing payments to out-of-state processors for recycling of hulks abandoned outside Maryland -- was not even mentioned by the Court in rebuffing the Virginia processor\'s Commerce Clause challenge.  Indeed, the central point of the Court\'s analysis was that demonstration of an "independent justification" was unnecessary to sustain the State\'s program.  <em>See</em> Note, 18 B.C.Ind. &amp; Com.L.Rev. at 927-928.  At bottom, the discrimination challenged in <em>Alexandria Scrap</em> was motivated by the same concern underlying South Dakota\'s resident-preference policy -- a desire to channel state benefits to the residents of the State supplying them.  If some underlying "commendable as well as legitimate" purpose, 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#809">426 U. S. 809</a></span>, is also required, it is certainly present here.  In establishing the plant, South Dakota sought the most unstartling governmental goal:  improvement of the quality of life in that State by generating a supply of a previously scarce product needed for local construction and governmental improvements.  A cement program, to be sure, may be a somewhat unusual or unorthodox way in which to utilize state funds to improve the quality of residents\' lives.  But</p>\n<p>"[a] State\'s project is as much a legitimate governmental activity whether it is traditional, or akin to private enterprise, or conducted for profit. . . .  A State may deem it as essential to its economy that it own and operate a railroad, a mill, or an irrigation system as it does to own and operate bridges, street lights, or a sewage disposal plant.  What might have been viewed in an earlier day as an improvident or even dangerous extension of state activities may today be deemed indispensable."</p>\n<p><em>New York v.

Although the out-of-state buyer in the secondary market will undoubtedly have to pay a markup not borne by South Dakota competitors, this result is not wholly unjust.  There should be little question that South Dakota at least could exact a premium on out-of-state purchases to compensate it for the State\'s investment and risk in the plan.  If one views the added markup paid by out-of-state buyers to South Dakota middlemen as the rough equivalent of this "premium," the challenged program equates with a permissible result.  The "bottom line" of the scheme closely parallels the result in <em>Alexandria Scrap:</em>  out-of-state concrete suppliers are not removed from the market altogether; to compete successfully with in-state competitors, however, they must achieve additional efficiencies or exploit natural advantages such as their location to offset the incremental advantage channeled by the State\'s own market behavior to in-state concrete suppliers.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner also seeks to distinguish <em>Alexandria Scrap</em> on the ground that there, unlike here, the State "created" the relevant market.  <em>See</em> 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#814">426 U.

In the subsequent debate over ratification, Alexander Hamilton emphasized the importance of unrestricted interstate commerce:</p>\n<p>"An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each, by an interchange of their respective productions. . . .

The Commerce Clause would bar legislation imposing on private parties the type of restraint on commerce adopted by South Dakota.  <em>See Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, supra; cf.

S. 449</a></p><p> a private business constitutionally could adopt a marketing policy that exclude customers who come from another State.  This case falls between those polar situations.  The State, through its Commission, engages in a commercial enterprise and restricts its own interstate distribution.  The question is whether the Commission\'s policy should be treated like state regulation of private parties or like the marketing policy of a private business.</p>\n<p>The application of the Commerce Clause to this case should turn on the nature of the governmental activity involved.  If a public enterprise undertakes an "integral operatio[n] in areas of traditional governmental functions," <em>National League of Cities v.

S. 450</a></p><p> the private market and operates a commercial enterprise for the advantage of its private citizens, it may not evade the constitutional policy against economic Balkanization.</p>\n<p>This distinction derives from the power of governments to supply their own needs, <em>see Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/113/case.html">310 U.

In procuring goods and services for the operation of government, a State may act without regard to the private marketplace and remove itself from the reach of the Commerce Clause.  <em>See American Yearbook Co. v. Askew,</em> 339 F.Supp. 719 (MD Fla.), <em>summarily aff\'d,</em> 409 U.S. 904 (1972).  But when a State itself becomes a participant in the private market for other purposes, the Constitution forbids actions that would impede the flow of interstate commerce.  These categories recognize no more than the "constitutional line between the State as government and the State as trader."  <em>New York v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/572/case.html">326 U.

S. 437</a></span> (1905).</p>\n<p>The Court holds that South Dakota, like a private business, should not be governed by the Commerce Clause when it enters the private market.  But precisely because South Dakota is a State, it cannot be presumed to behave like an enterprise "<em>engaged in an entirely private business.\'"  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html#439">447 U.

A State frequently will respond to market conditions on the basis of political, rather than economic, concerns.  To use the Court\'s terms, a State may attempt to act as a "market regulator," rather than a "market participant."  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html#436">447 U. S. 436</a></span>.  In that situation, it is a pretense to equate the State with a private economic actor.  State action burdening interstate trade is no less state action because it is </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 447 U. S. 451</a></em></p><p><em> accomplished by a public agency authorized to participate in the private market.\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The threshold issue is whether South Dakota has undertaken integral government operations in an area of traditional governmental functions, or whether it has participated in the marketplace as a private firm.  If the latter characterization applies, we also must determine whether the State Commission\'s marketing policy burdens the flow of interstate trade.  This analysis highlights the differences between the state action here and that before the Court in <em>Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.</em></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Alexandria Scrap,</em> a Virginia scrap processor challenged a Maryland program to pay bounties for every junk car registered in Maryland that was converted into scrap.  The program imposed more onerous documentation standards on non-Maryland processors, thereby diverting Maryland "hulks" to in-state processors.  The Virginia plaintiff argued that this diversion burdened interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>As the Court today notes, <em>Alexandria Scrap</em> determined that Maryland\'s bounty program constituted direct state participation in the market for automobile hulks.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html#435">447 U. S. 435</a></span>.  But the critical question -- the second step in the opinion\'s analysis -- was whether the bounty program constituted an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  Recognizing that the case did not fit neatly into conventional Commerce Clause theory, 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#807">426 U. S. 807</a></span>, we found no burden on commerce.</p>\n<p>The Court first observed:</p>\n<p>"Maryland has not sought to prohibit the flow of hulks, or to regulate the conditions under which it may occur.  Instead, it has entered into the market itself to bid up their price.  There has been an impact upon the interstate flow of hulks only because . . . Maryland effectively </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 447 U. S. 452</a></p><p> has made it more lucrative for unlicensed suppliers to dispose of their hulks in Maryland. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#806">426 U. S. 806</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We further stated</p>\n<p>"that the novelty of this case is not its presentation of a new form of \'burden\' upon commerce, but that appellee should characterize Maryland\'s action as a burden which the Commerce Clause was intended to make suspect."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#807">426 U. S. 807</a></span>.  The opinion then emphasized that "no trade barrier of the type forbidden by the Commerce Clause, and involved in previous cases, impedes th[e] movement [of hulks] out of State."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#809">426 U. S. 809</a></span>-810.  Rather, the hulks "remain within Maryland in response to market forces, including that exerted by money from the State."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html#812">426 U. S. 810</a></span>.  The Court concluded that the subsidies provided under the Maryland program erected no barriers to trade.  Consequently, the Commerce Clause did not forbid the Maryland program.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Unlike the market subsidies at issue in <em>Alexandria Scrap,</em> the marketing policy of the South Dakota Cement Commission has cut off interstate trade. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The State can raise such a bar when it enters the market to supply its own needs.  In order to ensure an adequate supply of cement for public uses, the State can withhold from interstate commerce the cement needed for public projects.  <em>Cf. National League of Cities v. Usery, supra.</em></p>\n<p>The State, however, has no parallel justification for favoring private, in-state customers over out-of-state customers.

S. 453</a></p><p> In response to political concerns that likely would be inconsequential to a private cement producer, South Dakota has shut off its cement sales to customers beyond its borders.

The Commerce Clause prohibits this severe restraint on commerce.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>I share the Court\'s desire to preserve state sovereignty.  But the Commerce Clause long has been recognized as a limitation on that sovereignty, consciously designed to maintain a national market and defeat economic provincialism.  The Court today approves protectionist state policies.  In the absence of contrary congressional action, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] those policies now can be implemented as long as the State itself directly participates in the market. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>By enforcing the Commerce Clause in this case, the Court would work no unfairness on the people of South Dakota.  They still could reserve cement for public projects and share in whatever return the plant generated.  They could not, however, use the power of the State to furnish themselves with cement forbidden to the people of neighboring States.</p>\n<p>The creation of a free national economy was a major goal of the States when they resolved to unite under the Federal Constitution.  The decision today cannot be reconciled with that purpose.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>By "protectionism," I refer to state policies designed to protect private economic interests within the State from the forces of the interstate market.  I would exclude from this term policies relating to traditional governmental functions, such as education, and subsidy programs like the one at issue in <em>Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html">426 U. S. 794</a></span> (1976).  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html#451">447 U. S. 451</a></span>-453.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to distinguish prior decisions that address the Commerce Clause limitations on a State\'s regulation of natural resource exploitation.  <em>E.g., Hughes v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html">441 U. S. 322</a></span> (1979); <em>Pennsylvania v. West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/553/case.html">262 U. S. 553</a></span> (1923).  The Court contends that cement production, unlike the activities involved in those cases, "is the end product of a complex process whereby a costly physical plant and human labor act on raw materials."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html#444">447 U. S. 444</a></span>.  The Courts distinction fails in two respects.  First, the principles articulated in the natural resources cases also have been applied in decisions involving agricultural production, notably milk processing.  <em>E.g., H. P. Hood &amp; Sons v. Du Mond,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/525/case.html">336 U. S. 525</a></span> (1949); <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/case.html">397 U. S. 137</a></span> (1970).  More fundamentally, the Court\'s definition of cement production describes all sophisticated economic activity, including the exploitation of natural resources.  The extraction of natural gas, for example, could hardly occur except through a "complex process whereby a costly physical plant and human labor act on raw materials."</p>\n<p>The Court also suggests that the Commerce Clause has no application to this case because South Dakota does not "posses[s] unique access to the materials needed to produce cement."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html#444">447 U. S. 444</a></span>.  But in its regional market, South Dakota has unique access to cement.  A cutoff in cement sales has the same economic impact as a refusal to sell resources like natural gas.  Customers can seek other sources of supply, or find a substitute product, or do without.  Regardless of the nature of the product the State hoards, the consumer has been denied the guarantee of the Commerce Clause that he "may look to . . . free competition from every producing area in the Nation to protect him from exploitation by any."  <em>H.

In this case,  South Dakota\'s cement plant has supported itself for many years. <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.
