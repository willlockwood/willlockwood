The Title VII amendment thus subjected States and their subdivisions to liability only if they employ a threshold number of workers, currently 15.  By contrast, the 1974 ADEA amendment added state and local governments directly to the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer.\xe2\x80\x9d  The same 1974 enactment also amended the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), on which many aspects of the ADEA are based, to reach all government employers regardless of their size.\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(d), (x).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The definitional provision\xe2\x80\x99s two-sentence delineation, set out in \xc2\xa7630(b), and the expression \xe2\x80\x9calso means\xe2\x80\x9d at the start of \xc2\xa7630(b)\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence, combine to establish separate categories: persons engaged in an industry affecting commerce with 20 or more employees; and States or political subdivisions with no attendant numerosity limitation.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The words \xe2\x80\x9calso means\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7630(b) add new categories of employers to the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s reach.

Guido and Rankin sued the Fire District, alleging that their termination violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),\n\n81Stat.\n602, as amended,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>  The Fire District sought dismissal of the suit on the ground that the District was too small to qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d within the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s controlling definitional provision,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7630(b), reads:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98employer\xe2\x80\x99 means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

We hold, in accord with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, that \xc2\xa7630(b)\xe2\x80\x99s two-sentence delineation, and the expression \xe2\x80\x9calso means\xe2\x80\x9d at the start of the second sentence, combine to establish separate categories: persons engaged in an industry affecting commerce with 20 or more employees; and States or political subdivisions with no attendant numerosity limitation.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]wenty or more employees\xe2\x80\x9d is confining language, but the confinement is tied to \xc2\xa7630(b)\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence, and does not limit the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s governance of the employment practices of States and political subdivisions thereof.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Initially, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n78Stat.\n253, as amended,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, applied solely to private sector employers.  The same was true of the ADEA, enacted three years later to protect workers against \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary age discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621(b).  As originally enacted, both Title VII and the ADEA imposed liability on \xe2\x80\x9cemployer[s],\xe2\x80\x9d defined in both statutes to include \xe2\x80\x9ca person engaged in an industry affecting commerce\xe2\x80\x9d whose employees met a numerical threshold, but specifically to exclude governmental entities.\n\n78Stat.\n253 (Title VII);\n\n81Stat.\n605 (ADEA).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1972, Congress amended Title VII to reach state and local employers.  Under the revised provision of Title VII, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98person\xe2\x80\x99 includes one or more individuals, governments, governmental agencies, [and] political subdivisions,\xe2\x80\x9d also certain other specified entities, and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98employer\xe2\x80\x99 means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).

The 1972 amendment to Title VII thereby extended the statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to state and local government entities by defining them as \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  In turn, as \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s],\xe2\x80\x9d these entities meet Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d and are subject to liability only if they have at least 15 employees.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two years later, in 1974, Congress amended the ADEA to cover state and local governments.  Unlike in Title VII, where Congress added such entities to the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d in the ADEA, Congress added them directly to the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, since 1974, the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s key definitional provision has read:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98employer\xe2\x80\x99 means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  The term also means (1) any agent of such a person, and (2) a State or political subdivision of a State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7630(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the same 1974 enactment, Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), on which parts of the ADEA had been modeled, to reach all government employers regardless of their size.  See\n\n88Stat.\n58,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(d), (x).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The parties dispute the proper reading of the ADEA following the 1974 amendment.  Does \xe2\x80\x9calso means\xe2\x80\x9d add new categories to the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer,\xe2\x80\x9d or does it merely clarify that States and their political subdivisions are a type of \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d included in \xc2\xa7630(b)\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence?  If the former, state and local governments are covered by the ADEA regardless of whether they have as many as 20 employees.  If the latter, they are covered only if they have at least 20 employees.  Federal courts have divided on this question.  Compare <i>Kelly </i>v.<i> Wauconda Park Dist.</i>, 801 F.\xc2\xa02d 269 (CA7 1986) (state and local governments are covered by the ADEA only if they have at least 20 employees); <i>Cink</i> v. <i>Grant County</i>, 635 Fed. Appx. 470 (CA10 2015) (same); <i>Palmer</i> v. <i>Arkansas Council on Economic Educ.</i>, 154 F.\xc2\xa03d 892 (CA8 1998) (same); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Monclova</i>, 920 F.\xc2\xa02d 360 (CA6 1990) (same), with this case, 859 F.\xc2\xa03d 1168 (CA9 2017) (state and local governments are covered by the ADEA regardless of their number of employees).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  583 U.\xc2\xa0S. __ (2018).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For several reasons, we conclude that the words \xe2\x80\x9calso means\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7630(b) add new categories of employers to the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  First and foremost, the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9calso means\xe2\x80\x9d is additive rather than clarifying.  As the Ninth Circuit explained, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98also\xe2\x80\x99 is a term of enhancement; it means \xe2\x80\x98in addition; besides\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98likewise; too.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  859 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1171 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New Collegiate Dictionary 34 (1973)).  Indeed, reading \xe2\x80\x9calso\xe2\x80\x9d additively to create a separate category of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to this Court altogether fitting in <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Wyoming</i>,\n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 226 (1983).  There, we held that applying the ADEA to state and local governments does not encroach on States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereignty or\n \nTenth Amendment immunity.  <i>Id.,</i> at 240\xe2\x80\x93242.  In the course of so holding, we described the 1974 ADEA amendment as \xe2\x80\x9cextend[ing] the substantive prohibitions of the Act to employers having at least 20 workers [as opposed to 25 in the original version], <i>and to</i> the Federal and State Governments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 233 (emphasis added).  In this regard, we note, it is undisputed that the ADEA covers Federal Government entities, which our opinion in <i>Wyoming</i> grouped with state entities, regardless of the number of workers they employ.\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Instructive as well, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9calso means\xe2\x80\x9d occurs dozens of times throughout the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code, typically carrying an additive meaning.  See Brief for Respondents 11\xe2\x80\x9313, and n.\xc2\xa02 (collecting citations).  For example,\n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71715z\xe2\x80\x931(i)(4), provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term \xe2\x80\x98elderly families\xe2\x80\x99 means families which consist of two or more persons the head of which (or his spouse) is sixty-two years of age or over or is handicapped.  Such term also means a single person who is sixty-two years of age or over or is handicapped.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] single person\xe2\x80\x9d plainly adds to, rather than clarifies, the preceding statutory delineation, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo or more persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Just so with States and their political subdivisions in the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Notably, in \xc2\xa71715z\xe2\x80\x931(i)(4), Congress repeated the \xe2\x80\x9csixty-two years of age or over or is handicapped\xe2\x80\x9d qualifier to render it applicable to \xe2\x80\x9ca single person.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the ADEA, by contrast, Congress did not repeat the \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty or more employees\xe2\x80\x9d qualifier when referencing state and local government entities.  This Court is not at liberty to insert the absent qualifier.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Furthermore, the text of \xc2\xa7630(b) pairs States and their political subdivisions with agents, a discrete category that, beyond doubt, carries no numerical limitation.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 55\xe2\x80\x9356.  The Fire District does not gainsay that the 20-employee restriction applies to \xc2\xa7630(b)\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence.  Its construction, however, would lift that restriction for the agent portion of the second sentence, and then reimpose it for the portion of that sentence addressing States and their political subdivisions.  We resist a reading so strange.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fire District presses the argument that the ADEA should be interpreted in line with Title VII, which, as noted <i>supra</i>, at 3, applies to state and local governments only if they meet a numerosity specification.  True, reading the ADEA as written to apply to States and political subdivisions regardless of size gives the ADEA, in this regard, a broader reach than Title VII.  But this disparity is a consequence of the different language Congress chose to employ.  See <i>Gross</i> v. <i>FBL Financial Services, Inc.</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167, 174 (2009) (differences between Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s and the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s language should not be ignored).  The better comparator is the FLSA, on which many aspects of the ADEA are based.  See\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7626(b) (ADEA incorporates the \xe2\x80\x9cpowers, remedies, and procedures\xe2\x80\x9d of the FLSA).  Like the FLSA, the ADEA ranks States and political subdivisions as \xe2\x80\x9cemployer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of the number of employees they have.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fire District warns that applying the ADEA to small public entities risks curtailment of vital public services such as fire protection.  Experience suggests otherwise.  For 30 years, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has consistently interpreted the ADEA as we do today.  EEOC Compliance Manual: Threshold Issues \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93III(B)(1)(a)(i), and n.\xc2\xa099.  See also <i>Kelly</i>, 801 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 270, n.\xc2\xa01.  And a majority of States forbid age discrimination by political subdivisions of any size; some 15 of these States subject private sector employers to age discrimination proscriptions only if they employ at least a threshold number of workers.  See Brief for Respondents 28\xe2\x80\x9329, and n.\xc2\xa06 (collecting citations).  No untoward service shrinkages have been documented.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, the text of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s definitional provision, also its kinship to the FLSA and differences from Title VII, leave scant room for doubt that state and local governments are \xe2\x80\x9cemployer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d covered by the ADEA regardless of their size.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">Affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Justice Kavanaugh took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Americans with Disabilities Act<i> </i>of 1990 defines \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d in materially the same way as Title VII and accords \xe2\x80\x9cperson .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the same meaning\xe2\x80\x9d as in Title VII.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712111(5), (7). </span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0We need not linger over possible applications of the agent clause, for no question of agent liability is before us in this case. </span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
