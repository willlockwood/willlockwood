The record did not reflect that petitioner had raised this objection in timely fashion in the trial court, but because the trial court had considered and rejected the contention on its merits in connection with petitioner\'s motion for a new trial, the Missouri Supreme Court reviewed the issue under its "plain error" rule.  Relying on its decision in <em>State v. Duren,</em> 556 S.W.2d 11 (1977), that court rejected petitioner\'s contention that the challenged provisions are invalid because they systematically exclude women from the jury selection process.  556 S.W.2d 42, 44 (1977).  The highest state court having reached and decided this issue, its judgment is subject to review in this Court.  <em>See Jenkins v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/153/case.html">418 U. S. 153</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/153/case.html#157">418 U. S. 157</a></span> (1974).  The petition for certiorari is granted. The motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> is granted.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 439 U.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST dissents.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring in the judgments. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/459/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>As I noted in my concurrence in <em>Hankerson v. North Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/233/case.html">432 U. S. 233</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/233/case.html#246">432 U. S. 246</a></span> (1977), the Court\'s attempt to fashion a satisfactory retroactivity doctrine in the years since <em>Linkletter v. Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html">381 U. S. 618</a></span> (1965), has not succeeded.  I adhere to the view expressed in <em>Hankerson</em> that the wisest approach to this problem is that outlined by Mr. Justice Harlan in <em>Mackey v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html">401 U. S. 667</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html#675">401 U. S. 675</a></span>-702 (1971).  That approach "contemplates, in rough outline, that courts apply a new rule retroactively in cases still pending on direct review, whereas cases on collateral review ordinarily would be considered in light of the rule as it stood when the conviction became final."  <em>Hankerson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/233/case.html#248">432 U. S. 248</a></span>.  As all of these cases are before us on direct review, the application to them of the principles announced in <em>Taylor v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html">419 U. S. 522</a></span> (1975), and <em>Duren v. Missouri, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/357/case.html">439 U. S. 357</a></span>, is proper.  Accordingly, I concur in the judgments of the Court.</p>\n<p>* [This opinion applies also to No. 77-6066, <em>Lee v. Missouri;</em> No. 77-6068, <em>Minor v.
