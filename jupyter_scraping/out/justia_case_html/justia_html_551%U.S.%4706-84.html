S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681m(a).  As applied to insurance companies, \xe2\x80\x9cadverse action\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9ca denial or cancellation of, an increase in any charge for, or a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or amount of, any insurance, existing or applied for.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71681a(k)(1)(B)(i).  FCRA provides a private right of action against businesses that use consumer reports but fail to comply.  A negligent violation entitles a consumer to actual damages, \xc2\xa71681<em>o</em>(a), and a willful one entitles the consumer to actual, statutory, and even punitive damages, \xc2\xa71681n(a).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93100 (GEICO) use<em> </em>an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s credit score to select the appropriate subsidiary insurance company and the particular rate at which a policy may be issued.  GEICO sends an adverse action notice only if a neutral credit score would have put the applicant in a lower priced tier or company; the applicant is not otherwise told if he would have gotten better terms with a better credit score.  Respondent Edo\xe2\x80\x99s credit score was taken into account when GEICO issued him a policy, but GEICO sent no adverse action notice because his company and tier placement would have been the same with a neutral score.  Edo filed a proposed class action, alleging willful violation of \xc2\xa71681m(a) and seeking statutory and punitive damages under \xc2\xa71681n(a).  The District Court granted GEICO summary judgment, finding no adverse action because the premium would have been the same had Edo\xe2\x80\x99s credit history not been considered.  Petitioners in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93100 (Safeco) also rely on credit reports to set initial insurance premiums.  Respondents Burr and Massey\xe2\x80\x94whom Safeco offered higher than the best rates possible without sending adverse action notices\xe2\x80\x94joined a proposed class action, alleging willful violation of \xc2\xa71681m(a) and seeking statutory and punitive damages under \xc2\xa71681n(a).  The District Court granted Safeco summary judgment on the ground that offering a single, initial rate for insurance cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cadverse action.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Ninth Circuit reversed both judgments.  In GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s case, it held that an adverse action occurs whenever a consumer would have received a lower rate had his consumer report contained more favorable information.  Since that would have happened to Edo, GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s failure to give notice was an adverse action.  The court also held that an insurer willfully fails to comply with FCRA if it acts in reckless disregard of a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s FCRA rights, remanding for further proceedings on the reckless disregard issue.  Relying on its decision in GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Ninth Circuit rejected the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s position in the Safeco case and remanded for further proceedings. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Willful failure covers a violation committed in reckless disregard of the notice obligation.  Where willfulness is a statutory condition of civil liability, it is generally taken to cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but reckless ones as well.  See, e.g., McLaughlin</em> v. <em>Richland Shoe Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/128/index.html">486 U. S. 128</a>, 133.  This construction reflects common law usage.  The standard civil usage thus counsels reading \xc2\xa71681n(a)\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully fails to comply\xe2\x80\x9d as reaching reckless FCRA violations, both on the interpretive assumption that Congress knows how this Court construes statutes and expects it to run true to form, see <em>Commissioner</em> v. <em>Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/152/index.html">508 U. S. 152</a>, 159, and under the rule that a common law term in a statute comes with a common law meaning, absent anything pointing another way, <em>Beck</em> v. <em>Prupis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/494/index.html">529 U. S. 494</a>, 500\xe2\x80\x93501.  Petitioners claim that \xc2\xa71681n(a)\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history points to a reading that liability attaches only to knowing violations, but the text as finally adopted points to the traditional understanding of willfulness in the civil sphere.  Their other textual and structural arguments are also unpersuasive.

See \xc2\xa71681(a).  These descriptions do nothing to suggest that remedies for consumers disadvantaged by unsound credit ratings should be denied to first-time victims, and the legislative histories of both FCRA\xe2\x80\x99s original enactment and a 1996 amendment reveal no reason to confine attention to customers and businesses with prior dealings.  Finally, nothing about insurance contracts suggests that Congress meant to differentiate applicants from existing customers when it set the notice requirement; the newly insured who gets charged more owing to an erroneous report is in the same boat with the renewal applicant.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0An increased rate is not \xe2\x80\x9cbased in whole or in part on\xe2\x80\x9d a credit report under \xc2\xa71681m(a) unless the report was a necessary condition of the increase.  In common talk, \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition.  Though some textual arguments point another way, it makes more sense to suspect that Congress meant to require notice and prompt a consumer challenge only when the consumer would gain something if the challenge succeeded.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0In determining whether a first-time rate is a disadvantageous increase, the baseline is the rate that the applicant would have received had the company not taken his credit score into account (the \xe2\x80\x9cneutral score\xe2\x80\x9d rate GEICO used in Edo\xe2\x80\x99s case).  That baseline comports with the understanding that \xc2\xa71681m(a) notice is required only when the credit report\xe2\x80\x99s effect on the initial rate is necessary to put the consumer in a worse position than other relevant facts would have decreed anyway.  Congress was more likely concerned with the practical question whether the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s rate actually suffered when his credit report was taken into account than the theoretical question whether the consumer would have gotten a better rate with the best possible credit score, the baseline suggested by the Government and respondent-plaintiffs.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s objection to this reading is rejected.  Although the rate initially offered for new insurance is an \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d calling for notice if it exceeds the neutral rate, once a consumer has learned that his credit report led the insurer to charge more, he need not be told with each renewal if his rate has not changed.  After initial dealing between the consumer and the insurer, the baseline for \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d is the previous rate or charge, not the \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d baseline that applies at the start.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0GEICO did not violate the statute, and while Safeco might have, it did not act recklessly.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because the initial rate GEICO offered Edo was what he would have received had his credit score not been taken into account, GEICO owed him no adverse action notice under \xc2\xa71681m(a).  P.\xc2\xa018.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Even if Safeco violated FCRA when it failed to give Burr and Massey notice on the mistaken belief that \xc2\xa71681m(a) did not apply to initial applications, the company was not reckless.  The common law has generally understood \xe2\x80\x9crecklessness\xe2\x80\x9d in the civil liability sphere as conduct violating an objective standard: action entailing \xe2\x80\x9can unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that it should be known.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Farmer</em> v. <em>Brennan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/825/index.html">511 U. S. 825</a>, 836.  There being no indication that Congress had something different in mind, there is no reason to deviate from the common law understanding in applying the statute.  See <em>Beck</em> v. <em>Prupis</em>, 529 U. S., at 500\xe2\x80\x93501.  Thus, a company does not act in reckless disregard of FCRA unless the action is not only a violation under a reasonable reading of the statute, but shows that the company ran a risk of violating the law substantially greater than the risk associated with a reading that was merely careless.  The negligence/recklessness line need not be pinpointed here, for Safeco\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute, albeit erroneous, was not objectively unreasonable.  Section 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i) is silent on the point from which to measure \xe2\x80\x9cincrease,\xe2\x80\x9d and Safeco\xe2\x80\x99s reading has a foundation in the statutory text and a sufficiently convincing justification to have persuaded the District Court to adopt it and rule in Safeco\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  Before these cases, no court of appeals had spoken on the issue, and no authoritative guidance has yet come from the Federal Trade Commission.  Given this dearth of guidance and the less-than-pellucid statutory text, Safeco\xe2\x80\x99s reading was not objectively unreasonable, and so falls well short of raising the \xe2\x80\x9cunjustifiably high risk\xe2\x80\x9d of violating the statute necessary for reckless liability.

The questions in these consolidated cases are whether willful failure covers a violation committed in reckless disregard of the notice obligation, and, if so, whether petitioners Safeco and GEICO committed reckless violations.

See 84 Stat. 1128, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681; <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/19/index.html">534 U. S. 19</a>, 23 (2001).  The Act requires, among other things, that \xe2\x80\x9cany person [who] takes any adverse action with respect to any consumer that is based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer report\xe2\x80\x9d must notify the affected consumer.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681m(a).  The notice must point out the adverse action, explain how to reach the agency that reported on the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit, and tell the consumer that he can get a free copy of the report and dispute its accuracy with the agency.  <em>Ibid</em>.  As it applies to an insurance company, \xe2\x80\x9cadverse action\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9ca denial or cancellation of, an increase in any charge for, or a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or amount of, any insurance, existing or applied for.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71681a(k)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FCRA provides a private right of action against businesses that use consumer reports but fail to comply.  If a violation is negligent, the affected consumer is entitled to actual damages.  \xc2\xa71681<em>o</em>(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If willful, however, the consumer may have actual damages, or statutory damages ranging from $100 to $1,000, and even punitive damages.  \xc2\xa71681n(a) (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner GEICO[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] writes auto insurance through four subsidiaries: GEICO General, which sells \xe2\x80\x9cpreferred\xe2\x80\x9d policies at low rates to low-risk customers; Government Employees, which also sells \xe2\x80\x9cpreferred\xe2\x80\x9d policies, but only to government employees; GEICO Indemnity, which sells standard policies to moderate-risk customers; and GEICO Casualty, which sells nonstandard policies at higher rates to high-risk customers.  Potential customers call a toll-free number answered by an agent of the four affiliates, who takes information and, with permission, gets the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s credit score.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  This information goes into GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s computer system, which selects any appropriate company and the particular rate at which a policy may be issued.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For some time after FCRA went into effect, GEICO sent adverse action notices to all applicants who were not offered \xe2\x80\x9cpreferred\xe2\x80\x9d policies from GEICO General or Government Employees.  GEICO changed its practice, however, after a method to \xe2\x80\x9cneutralize\xe2\x80\x9d an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s credit score was devised: the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s company and tier placement is compared with the company and tier placement he would have been assigned with a \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d credit score, that is, one calculated without reliance on credit history.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Under this new scheme, it is only if using a neutral credit score would have put the applicant in a lower priced tier or company that GEICO sends an adverse action notice; the applicant is not otherwise told if he would have gotten better terms with a better credit score.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Ajene Edo applied for auto insurance with GEICO.  After obtaining Edo\xe2\x80\x99s credit score, GEICO offered him a standard policy with GEICO Indemnity (at rates higher than the most favorable), which he accepted.  Because Edo\xe2\x80\x99s company and tier placement would have been the same with a neutral score, GEICO did not give Edo an adverse action notice.  Edo later filed this proposed class action against GEICO, alleging willful failure to give notice in violation of \xc2\xa71681m(a); he claimed no actual harm, but sought statutory and punitive damages under \xc2\xa71681n(a).  The District Court granted summary judgment for GEICO, finding there was no adverse action when \xe2\x80\x9cthe premium charged to [Edo] \xe2\x80\xa6 would have been the same even if GEICO Indemnity did not consider information in [his] consumer credit history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Edo</em> v. <em>GEICO Casualty Co.</em>, CV 02\xe2\x80\x93678\xe2\x80\x93BR, 2004 U.

Safeco sent them no adverse action notices, and they later joined a proposed class action against the company, alleging willful violation of \xc2\xa71681m(a) and seeking statutory and punitive damages under \xc2\xa71681n(a).  The District Court ordered summary judgment for Safeco, on the understanding that offering a single, initial rate for insurance cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cadverse action.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed both judgments.  In GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s case, it held that whenever a consumer \xe2\x80\x9cwould have received a lower rate for his insurance had the information in his consumer report been more favorable, an adverse action has been taken against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc.</em>, 435 F.\xc2\xa03d 1081, 1093 (2006).  Since a better credit score would have placed Edo with GEICO General, not GEICO Indemnity, the appeals court held that GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s failure to give notice was an adverse action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit also held that an insurer \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d fails to comply with FCRA if it acts with \xe2\x80\x9creckless disregard\xe2\x80\x9d of a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s rights under the Act.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1099.  It explained that a company would not be acting recklessly if it \xe2\x80\x9cdiligently and in good faith attempted to fulfill its statutory obligations\xe2\x80\x9d and came to a \xe2\x80\x9ctenable, albeit erroneous, interpretation of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The court went on to say that \xe2\x80\x9ca deliberate failure to determine the extent of its obligations\xe2\x80\x9d would not ordinarily escape liability under \xc2\xa71681n, any more than \xe2\x80\x9creliance on creative lawyering that provides indefensible answers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because the court believed that the enquiry into GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s reckless disregard might turn on undisclosed circumstances surrounding GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s revision of its notification policy, the Court of Appeals remanded the company\xe2\x80\x99s case for further proceedings.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the action against Safeco, the Court of Appeals rejected the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s position, relying on its reasoning in GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s case (where it had held that the notice requirement applies to a single statement of an initial charge for a new policy).  <em>Spano</em> v. <em>Safeco Corp.</em>, 140 Fed.

We have said before that \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cword of many meanings whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bryan</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/184/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/184/index.html">524 U.

S. 389</a>, 395 (1933))).  This construction reflects common law usage, which treated actions in \xe2\x80\x9creckless disregard\xe2\x80\x9d of the law as \xe2\x80\x9cwillful\xe2\x80\x9d violations.  See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa734, p. 212 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough efforts have been made to distinguish\xe2\x80\x9d the terms \xe2\x80\x9cwillful,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwanton,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creckless,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csuch distinctions have consistently been ignored, and the three terms have been treated as meaning the same thing, or at least as coming out at the same legal exit\xe2\x80\x9d).  The standard civil usage thus counsels reading the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully fails to comply\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71681n(a) as reaching reckless FCRA violations,[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and this is so both on the interpretive assumption that Congress knows how we construe statutes and expects us to run true to form, see <em>Commissioner</em> v. <em>Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/152/index.html">508 U. S. 152</a>, 159 (1993), and under the general rule that a common law term in a statute comes with a common law meaning, absent anything pointing another way, <em>Beck</em> v. <em>Prupis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/494/index.html">529 U. S. 494</a>, 500\xe2\x80\x93501 (2000).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0GEICO and Safeco argue that Congress did point to something different in FCRA, by a drafting history of \xc2\xa71681n(a) said to show that liability was supposed to attach only to knowing violations.  The original version of the Senate bill that turned out as FCRA had two standards of liability to victims: grossly negligent violation (supporting actual damages) and willful violation (supporting actual, statutory, and punitive damages).  S. 823, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa71 (1969).  GEICO and Safeco argue that since a \xe2\x80\x9cgross negligence\xe2\x80\x9d standard is effectively the same as a \xe2\x80\x9creckless disregard\xe2\x80\x9d standard, the original bill\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwillfulness\xe2\x80\x9d standard must have meant a level of culpability higher than \xe2\x80\x9creckless disregard,\xe2\x80\x9d or there would have been no requirement to show a different state of mind as a condition of the potentially much greater liability; thus, \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully fails to comply\xe2\x80\x9d must have referred to a knowing violation.  Although the gross negligence standard was reduced later in the legislative process to simple negligence (as it now appears in \xc2\xa71681<em>o</em>), the provision for willful liability remains unchanged and so must require knowing action, just as it did originally in the draft of \xc2\xa71681n.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps.  But Congress may have scaled the standard for actual damages down to simple negligence because it thought gross negligence, being like reckless action, was covered by willfulness.  Because this alternative reading is possible, any inference from the drafting sequence is shaky, and certainly no match for the following clue in the text as finally adopted, which points to the traditional understanding of willfulness in the civil sphere.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phrase in question appears in the preamble sentence of \xc2\xa71681n(a): \xe2\x80\x9cAny person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Then come the details, in paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B), spelling out two distinct measures of damages chargeable against the willful violator.  As a general matter, the consumer may get either actual damages or \xe2\x80\x9cdamages of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71681n(a)(1)(A).  But where the offender is liable \xe2\x80\x9cfor obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute sets liability higher: \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages \xe2\x80\xa6 or $1,000, whichever is greater.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71681n(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the companies were right that \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d limits liability under \xc2\xa71681n(a) to knowing violations, the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71681n(a)(1)(B) would be superfluous and incongruous; it would have made no sense for Congress to condition the higher damages under \xc2\xa71681n(a) on knowingly obtaining a report without a permissible purpose if the general threshold of any liability under the section were knowing misconduct.  If, on the other hand, \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d covers both knowing and reckless disregard of the law, knowing violations are sensibly understood as a more serious subcategory of willful ones, and both the preamble and the subsection have distinct jobs to do.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Menasche</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/528/index.html">348 U. S. 528</a>, 538\xe2\x80\x93539 (1955) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[G]ive effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Montclair</em> v. <em>Ramsdell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/147/index.html">107 U. S. 147</a>, 152 (1883))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The companies make other textual and structural arguments for their view, but none is persuasive.  Safeco thinks our reading would lead to the absurd result that one could, with reckless disregard, knowingly obtain a consumer report without a permissible purpose.  But this is not so; action falling within the knowing subcategory does not simultaneously fall within the reckless alternative.  Then both GEICO and Safeco argue that the reference to acting \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and willfully\xe2\x80\x9d in FCRA\xe2\x80\x99s criminal enforcement provisions, \xc2\xa71681q and \xc2\xa71681r, indicates that \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d cannot include recklessness.  But we are now on the criminal side of the law, where the paired modifiers are often found, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) (false statements to federal investigators); 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71097(a) (embezzlement of student loan funds); 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71542 (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) (false statements in a passport application).  As we said before, in the criminal law \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d typically narrows the otherwise sufficient intent, making the government prove something extra, in contrast to its civil-law usage, giving a plaintiff a choice of mental states to show in making a case for liability, see n. 9, <em>supra</em>.  The vocabulary of the criminal side of FCRA is consequently beside the point in construing the civil side.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before getting to the claims that the companies acted recklessly, we have the antecedent question whether either company violated the adverse action notice requirement at all.  In both cases, respondent-plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims are premised on initial rates charged for new insurance policies, which are not \xe2\x80\x9cadverse\xe2\x80\x9d actions unless quoting or charging a first-time premium is \xe2\x80\x9can increase in any charge for \xe2\x80\xa6 any insurance, existing or applied for.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681a(k)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Safeco\xe2\x80\x99s case, the District Court held that the initial rate for a new insurance policy cannot be an \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d because there is no prior dealing.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincrease in any charge for \xe2\x80\xa6 insurance\xe2\x80\x9d is readily understood to mean a change in treatment for an insured, which assumes a previous charge for comparison.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1260 (2d ed. 1957) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ddition or enlargement in size, extent, quantity, number, intensity, value, substance, etc.; augmentation; growth; multiplication\xe2\x80\x9d).  Since the District Court understood \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d to speak of change just as much as of comparative size or quantity, it reasoned that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d never touches the initial rate offer, where there is no change.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government takes the part of the Court of Appeals in construing \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d to reach a first-time rate.  It says that regular usage of the term is not as narrow as the District Court thought: the point from which to measure difference can just as easily be understood without referring to prior individual dealing.  The Government gives the example of a gas station owner who charges more than the posted price for gas to customers he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like; it makes sense to say that the owner increases the price and that the driver pays an increased price, even if he never pulled in there for gas before.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>26.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The Government implies, then, that reading \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d requires a choice, and the chosen reading should be the broad one in order to conform to what Congress had in mind.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading has the better fit with the ambitious objective set out in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s statement of purpose, which uses expansive terms to describe the adverse effects of unfair and inaccurate credit reporting and the responsibilities of consumer reporting agencies.  See \xc2\xa71681(a) (inaccurate reports \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly impair the efficiency of the banking system\xe2\x80\x9d; unfair reporting methods undermine public confidence \xe2\x80\x9cessential to the continued functioning of the banking system\xe2\x80\x9d; need to \xe2\x80\x9cinsure\xe2\x80\x9d that reporting agencies \xe2\x80\x9cexercise their grave responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d fairly, impartially, and with respect for privacy).  The descriptions of systemic problem and systemic need as Congress saw them do nothing to suggest that remedies for consumers placed at a disadvantage by unsound credit ratings should be denied to first-time victims, and the legislative histories of FCRA\xe2\x80\x99s original enactment and of the 1996 amendment reveal no reason to confine attention to customers and businesses with prior dealings.  Quite the contrary.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Finally, there is nothing about insurance contracts to suggest that Congress might have meant to differentiate applicants from existing customers when it set the notice requirement; the newly insured who gets charged more owing to an erroneous report is in the same boat with the renewal applicant.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  We therefore hold that the \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d required for \xe2\x80\x9cadverse action,\xe2\x80\x9d 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681a(k)(1)(B)(i), speaks to a disadvantageous rate even with no prior dealing; the term reaches initial rates for new applicants.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although offering the initial rate for new insurance can be an \xe2\x80\x9cadverse action,\xe2\x80\x9d respondent-plaintiffs have another hurdle to clear, for \xc2\xa71681m(a) calls for notice only when the adverse action is \xe2\x80\x9cbased in whole or in part on\xe2\x80\x9d a credit report.  GEICO argues that in order to have adverse action \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d a credit report, consideration of the report must be a necessary condition for the increased rate.  The Government and respondent-plaintiffs do not explicitly take a position on this point.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent there is any disagreement on the issue, we accept GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  In common talk, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition.  Under this most natural reading of \xc2\xa71681m(a), then, an increased rate is not \xe2\x80\x9cbased in whole or in part on\xe2\x80\x9d the credit report unless the report was a necessary condition of the increase.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As before, there are textual arguments pointing another way.  The statute speaks in terms of basing the action \xe2\x80\x9cin part\xe2\x80\x9d as well as wholly on the credit report, and this phrasing could mean that adverse action is \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d a credit report whenever the report was considered in the rate-setting process, even without being a necessary condition for the rate increase.  But there are good reasons to think Congress preferred GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s necessary-condition reading.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the statute has any claim to lucidity, not all \xe2\x80\x9cadverse actions\xe2\x80\x9d require notice, only those \xe2\x80\x9cbased \xe2\x80\xa6 on\xe2\x80\x9d information in a credit report.  Since the statute does not explicitly call for notice when a business acts adversely merely after consulting a report, conditioning the requirement on action \xe2\x80\x9cbased \xe2\x80\xa6 on\xe2\x80\x9d a report suggests that the duty to report arises from some practical consequence of reading the report, not merely some subsequent adverse occurrence that would have happened anyway.  If the credit report has no identifiable effect on the rate, the consumer has no immediately practical reason to worry about it (unless he has the power to change every other fact that stands between himself and the best possible deal); both the company and the consumer are just where they would have been if the company had never seen the report.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  And if examining reports that make no difference was supposed to trigger a reporting requirement, it would be hard to find any practical point in imposing the \xe2\x80\x9cbased \xe2\x80\xa6 on\xe2\x80\x9d restriction.  So it makes more sense to suspect that Congress meant to require notice and prompt a challenge by the consumer only when the consumer would gain something if the challenge succeeded.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To sum up, the difference required for an increase can be understood without reference to prior dealing (allowing a first-time applicant to sue), and considering the credit report must be a necessary condition for the difference.  The remaining step in determining a duty to notify in cases like these is identifying the benchmark for determining whether a first-time rate is a disadvantageous increase.  And in dealing with this issue, the pragmatic reading of \xe2\x80\x9cbased \xe2\x80\xa6 on\xe2\x80\x9d as a condition necessary to make a practical difference carries a helpful suggestion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government and respondent-plaintiffs argue that the baseline should be the rate that the applicant would have received with the best possible credit score, while GEICO contends it is what the applicant would have had if the company had not taken his credit score into account (the \xe2\x80\x9cneutral score\xe2\x80\x9d rate GEICO used in Edo\xe2\x80\x99s case).  We think GEICO has the better position, primarily because its \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d baseline is more comfortable with the understanding of causation just discussed, which requires notice under \xc2\xa71681m(a) only when the effect of the credit report on the initial rate offered is necessary to put the consumer in a worse position than other relevant facts would have decreed anyway.  If Congress was this concerned with practical consequences when it adopted a \xe2\x80\x9cbased \xe2\x80\xa6 on\xe2\x80\x9d causation standard, it presumably thought in equally practical terms when it spoke of an \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d that must be defined by a baseline to measure from.  Congress was therefore more likely concerned with the practical question whether the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s rate actually suffered when the company took his credit report into account than the theoretical question whether the consumer would have gotten a better rate with perfect credit.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government objects that this reading leaves a loophole, since it keeps first-time applicants who actually deserve better-than-neutral credit scores from getting notice, even when errors in credit reports saddle them with unfair rates.  This is true; the neutral-score baseline will leave some consumers without a notice that might lead to discovering errors.  But we do not know how often these cases will occur, whereas we see a more demonstrable and serious disadvantage inhering in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the best rates (the Government\xe2\x80\x99s preferred baseline) presumably go only to a minority of consumers, adopting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view would require insurers to send slews of adverse action notices; every young applicant who had yet to establish a gilt-edged credit report, for example, would get a notice that his charge had been \xe2\x80\x9cincreased\xe2\x80\x9d based on his credit report.  We think that the consequence of sending out notices on this scale would undercut the obvious policy behind the notice requirement, for notices as common as these would take on the character of formalities, and formalities tend to be ignored.  It would get around that new insurance usually comes with an adverse action notice, owing to some legal quirk, and instead of piquing an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s interest about the accuracy of his credit record, the commonplace notices would mean just about nothing and go the way of junk mail.  Assuming that Congress meant a notice of adverse action to get some attention, we think the cost of closing the loophole would be too high.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While on the subject of hypernotification, we should add a word on another point of practical significance.  Although the rate initially offered for new insurance is an \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d calling for notice if it exceeds the neutral rate, did Congress intend the same baseline to apply if the quoted rate remains the same over a course of dealing, being repeated at each renewal date?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot believe so.  Once a consumer has learned that his credit report led the insurer to charge more, he has no need to be told over again with each renewal if his rate has not changed.  For that matter, any other construction would probably stretch the word \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d more than it could bear.  Once the gas station owner had charged the customer the above-market price, it would be strange to speak of the same price as an increase every time the customer pulled in.  Once buyer and seller have begun a course of dealing, customary usage does demand a change for \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d to make sense.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Thus, after initial dealing between the consumer and the insurer, the baseline for \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d is the previous rate or charge, not the \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d baseline that applies at the start.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s case, the initial rate offered to Edo was the one he would have received if his credit score had not been taken into account, and GEICO owed him no adverse action notice under \xc2\xa71681m(a).[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Safeco did not give Burr and Massey any notice because it thought \xc2\xa71681m(a) did not apply to initial applications, a mistake that left the company in violation of the statute if Burr and Massey received higher rates \xe2\x80\x9cbased in whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d on their credit reports; if they did, Safeco would be liable to them on a showing of reckless conduct (or worse).  The first issue we can forget, however, for although the record does not reliably indicate what rates they would have obtained if their credit reports had not been considered, it is clear enough that if Safeco did violate the statute, the company was not reckless in falling down in its duty.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While \xe2\x80\x9cthe term recklessness is not self-defining,\xe2\x80\x9d the common law has generally understood it in the sphere of civil liability as conduct violating an objective standard: action entailing \xe2\x80\x9can unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that it should be known.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  <em>Farmer</em> v. <em>Brennan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/825/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/825/index.html">511 U.

See Prosser and Keeton \xc2\xa734, at 213 (recklessness requires \xe2\x80\x9ca known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There being no indication that Congress had something different in mind, we have no reason to deviate from the common law understanding in applying the statute.  See <em>Prupis</em>, 529 U. S., at 500\xe2\x80\x93501.  Thus, a company subject to FCRA does not act in reckless disregard of it unless the action is not only a violation under a reasonable reading of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s terms, but shows that the company ran a risk of violating the law substantially greater than the risk associated with a reading that was merely careless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, there is no need to pinpoint the negligence/recklessness line, for Safeco\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute, albeit erroneous, was not objectively unreasonable.  As we said, \xc2\xa71681a(k)(1)(B)(i) is silent on the point from which to measure \xe2\x80\x9cincrease.\xe2\x80\x9d  On the rationale that \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xe2\x80\x9d presupposes prior dealing, Safeco took the definition as excluding initial rate offers for new insurance, and so sent no adverse action notices to Burr and Massey.  While we disagree with Safeco\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, we recognize that its reading has a foundation in the statutory text, see <em>supra</em>, at 11, and a sufficiently convincing justification to have persuaded the District Court to adopt it and rule in Safeco\xe2\x80\x99s favor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not a case in which the business subject to the Act had the benefit of guidance from the courts of appeals or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that might have warned it away from the view it took.  Before these cases, no court of appeals had spoken on the issue, and no authoritative guidance has yet come from the FTC[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] (which in any case has only enforcement responsibility, not substantive rulemaking authority, for the provisions in question, see 15 U.

Given this dearth of guidance and the less-than-pellucid statutory text, Safeco\xe2\x80\x99s reading was not objectively unreasonable, and so falls well short of raising the \xe2\x80\x9cunjustifiably high risk\xe2\x80\x9d of violating the statute necessary for reckless liability.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals correctly held that reckless disregard of a requirement of FCRA would qualify as a willful violation within the meaning of \xc2\xa71681n(a).

The \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d language in the original statute emphasized that the consumer report must actually have caused the adverse action for the notice requirement to apply.  When Congress amended FCRA in 1996, it sought to define \xe2\x80\x9cadverse action\xe2\x80\x9d with greater particularity, and thus split the notice provision into two separate subsections.  See 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93426 to 3009\xe2\x80\x93427, 3009\xe2\x80\x93443 to 3009\xe2\x80\x93444.

When FCRA was initially enacted, the link between the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cadverse action\xe2\x80\x9d and the notice requirement was clear, since \xe2\x80\x9cadverse action\xe2\x80\x9d was defined within \xc2\xa71681m(a).

An applicant calling GEICO for insurance talks with a sales representative who acts for all the GEICO companies.

That is true even if the company would have made the same decision without looking at the report, because what the company actually did is more relevant than what it might have done.

As a matter of federal law, companies are free to adopt whatever \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d credit scores they want.  That score need not (and probably will not) reflect the median consumer credit score.  More likely, it will reflect a company\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the creditworthiness of a run-of-the-mill applicant who lacks a credit report.  Because those who have yet to develop a credit history are unlikely to be good credit risks, \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d credit scores will in many cases be quite low.  Yet under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, only those consumers with credit scores even lower than what may already be a very low \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d score will ever receive adverse action notices.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Court acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cthe neutral-score baseline will leave some consumers without a notice that might lead to discovering errors,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, it finds this unobjectionable because Congress was likely uninterested in \xe2\x80\x9cthe theoretical question of whether the consumer would have gotten a better rate with perfect credit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, however, disserves not only those consumers with \xe2\x80\x9cgilt-edged credit report[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, but also the much larger category of consumers with better-than-\xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d scores.  I find it difficult to believe that Congress could have intended for a company\xe2\x80\x99s unrestrained adoption of a \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d score to keep many (if not most) consumers from ever hearing that their credit reports are costing them money.  In my view, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text is amenable to a more sensible interpretation.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Stranger still, companies that automatically disqualify consumers who lack credit reports will never need to send any adverse action notices.  After all, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s baseline is \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the applicant would have had if the company had not taken his credit score into account,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15, but from such companies, what the applicant \xe2\x80\x9cwould have had\xe2\x80\x9d is no insurance at all.  An offer of insurance at <em>any</em> price, however inflated by a poor and perhaps incorrect credit score, will therefore never constitute an adverse action.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court also justifies its deviation from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text by reasoning that frequent adverse action notices would be ignored.

But rather than speculate about the likely effect of \xe2\x80\x9chypernotification,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17, I would defer to the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s position, informed by the Federal Trade Commission\xe2\x80\x99s expert judgment, that consumers by and large benefit from adverse action notices, however common.
