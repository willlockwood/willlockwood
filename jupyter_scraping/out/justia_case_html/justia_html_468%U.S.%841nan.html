Section 12(f)(2) requires applicants for Title IV assistance to file a statement with their institutions of higher education attesting to their compliance with the Act and implementing regulations.  A Presidential Proclamation requires young men to register for the draft within 30 days of their 18th birthday.  Failure to register within this time is a criminal offense.  The regulations permit late registrants to establish eligibility for Title IV assistance.  Appellee students (hereafter appellees), who have not registered for the draft, brought suits in Federal District Court seeking to enjoin the enforcement of \xc2\xa7 12(f).  The District Court granted the requested relief, holding that the regulations making late registrants eligible for Title IV aid were inconsistent with the statute, and that \xc2\xa7 12(f) is an unconstitutional bill of attainder because it singles out an identifiable group that would be ineligible for Title IV aid based on their failure to register.

Pp. 846-847.</p>\n<p>(b) Section 12(f) does not single out nonregistrants and make them ineligible for Title IV aid based on their past conduct, <em>i.e.,</em> failure to register.  The section does not require registration within the time fixed by the Presidential Proclamation, and does not make late registrants ineligible for aid.  The contrary view is inconsistent with 12(f)\'s structure and with the legislative history.  Section 12(f) clearly gives nonregistrants 30 days after receiving notice that they are ineligible for Title IV aid to register for the draft and qualify for aid.  The legislative history shows that Congress\' purpose in enacting \xc2\xa7 12(f) was to encourage registration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="842">Page 468 U.

Section 12(f)\'s requirements are not irreversible, but can be met readily by either timely or late registration.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/277/case.html">Cummings v.

It imposes none of the burdens historically associated with punishment.  It does not even deprive appellees of Title IV benefits permanently, since it leaves open perpetually the possibility of qualifying for aid.

Conditioning receipt of Title IV aid on draft registration is plainly a rational means to improve compliance with the registration requirements.

Section 12(f) does not violate appellees\' Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.  Since a student who has not registered for the draft is bound to know that he would be denied Title IV aid, he is no sense under any "compulsion" to seek that aid, and has no reason to make any statement to anyone as to whether or not he has registered.  As to a late registrant, since the law does not require him to disclose to his educational institution whether or not he registered late, he is not required to disclose any incriminating information in order to become eligible for aid.  The fact that appellees must register late in order to get Title IV aid, and thus reveal to the Selective Service their failure to comply timely with the registration requirements, does not violate appellees\' Fifth Amendment rights.  They have not been denied the opportunity to register, and have not been disqualified for financial aid for asserting a constitutional privilege.  <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/70/case.html">414 U. S. 70</a></span>, distinguished.  Appellees, not having sought to register, have had no occasion to assert their Fifth Amendment privilege when asked to state their dates of birth, nor has the Government refused any request for immunity for their answers or otherwise threatened them with penalties for invoking the privilege.  Under these circumstances, appellees will not be heard to complain that \xc2\xa7 12(f) violates their Fifth Amendment rights by forcing them to acknowledge during the draft registration process they have avoided that they have registered late.

Sections 12(b) and (c) of that Act impose criminal penalties for failure to register.  On July 2, 1980, President Carter issued a Proclamation requiring young men to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday.  Presidential Proclamation No. 4771, 3 CFR 82 (1981). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="844">Page 468 U. S. 844</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellee students (hereafter appellees) are anonymous individuals who were required to register before September 1, 1982.  On September 8, Congress enacted the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1983, Pub.L. 97-252, 96 Stat. 718.  Section 1113(a) of that Act added \xc2\xa7 12(f) to the Military Selective Service Act.  Section 12(f)(1) provides that any person who is required to register and fails to do so "in accordance with any proclamation" issued under the Military Selective Service Act "shall be ineligible for any form of assistance or benefit provided under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Section 12(f)(2) requires applicants for Title IV assistance to file with their institutions of higher education a statement attesting to their compliance with the draft registration law and regulations issued under it.  Sections 12(f)(3) and (4) require the Secretary of Education, in agreement with the Director of Selective Service, to prescribe methods for verifying such statements of compliance and to issue implementing regulations.</p>\n<p>Regulations issued in final form on April 11, 1983, <em>see</em> 48 Fed.Reg. 15578, provide that no applicant may receive Title IV aid unless he files a statement of compliance certifying that he is registered with the Selective Service or that, for a specified reason, he is not required to register.  34 CFR \xc2\xa7 668.24(a) (1983).  The regulations allow a student who has not previously registered, although required to do so, to establish eligibility for Title IV aid by registering, filing a statement of registration compliance, and, if required, verifying that he is registered. \xc2\xa7 668.27(b)(1).  The statement of compliance does not require the applicant to state the date that he registered. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="845">Page 468 U. S. 845</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In November, 1982, the Minnesota Public Interest Research Group filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota seeking to enjoin the operation of \xc2\xa7 12(f).  The District Court dismissed the Minnesota Group for lack of standing, but allowed three anonymous students to intervene as plaintiffs.  557 F.Supp. 923 (1983); 557 F.Supp. 925 (1983).  The intervenors alleged that they reside in Minnesota, that they need financial aid to pursue their educations, that they intend to apply for Title IV assistance, and that they are legally required to register with the Selective Service, but have failed to do so.  This suit was informally consolidated with a separate action brought by three other anonymous students making essentially the same allegations as the intervenors.</p>\n<p>In March, 1983 the District Court granted a preliminary injunction restraining the Selective Service System from enforcing \xc2\xa7 12(f).  After finding that appellees had demonstrated a threat of irreparable injury, the court held that appellees were likely to succeed on the merits.  First, the District Court thought it likely that \xc2\xa7 12(f) was a bill of attainder.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="846">Page 468 U. S. 846</a></p><p> The court interpreted the statutory bar to student aid as applicable to students who registered late.  Thus interpreted, the statute "clearly singles out an ascertainable group based on past conduct," and "legislatively determines the guilt of this ascertainable group."  <em>Doe v. Selective Service System,</em> 557 F.Supp. 937, 942, 943 (1983).  The court viewed the denial of aid as punishment within the meaning of the Bill of Attainder Clause because it "deprives students of the practical means to achieve the education necessary to pursue many vocations in our society."  <em>Id.</em> at 944.  Second, the District Court found it likely that \xc2\xa7 12(f) violated appellees\' Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.  In the District Court\'s view, the statement of compliance required by \xc2\xa7 12(f)(2) compels students who have not registered for the draft and need financial aid to confess to the fact of nonregistration, which is a crime.  50 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 462(a).</p>\n<p>On June 16, 1983, the District Court entered a permanent, nationwide injunction against the enforcement of \xc2\xa7 12(f).  The court held that the regulations making late registrants eligible for aid were inconsistent with the statute, and concluded that the statute was an unconstitutional attainder.  It also held the statute to violate appellees\' constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination.</p>\n<p>On June 29, we stayed the District Court\'s June 16 order pending the timely docketing and final disposition of this appeal.  <em>Selective Service System v. Doe,</em> 463 U.S. 1215.  We noted probable jurisdiction on December 5, 1983, 464 U.S. 1006, and we reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The District Court held that \xc2\xa7 12(f) falls within the category of congressional actions that Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, cl. 3, of the Constitution bars by providing that "[n]o Bill of Attainder . . . shall be passed."  A bill of attainder was most recently described by this Court as</p>\n<p>"a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="847">Page 468 U.

Although the State Constitution did not mention the persons or groups required to take the oath by name, the Court concluded that, in creating a qualification having no possible relation to their fitness for their chosen professions, the Constitution was intended "to reach the person, not the calling."  <em>Ibid.</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>On the same day that it decided <em>Cummings,</em> the Court struck down a similar oath that was required for admission to practice law in the federal courts.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/333/case.html">Ex parte Garland,</a></span></em> 4 Wall. 333 (1867).  Like the oath considered in <em>Cummings,</em> the oath "operate[d] as a legislative decree of perpetual exclusion" from the practice of law, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/333/case.html#377">71 U. S. 377</a></span>, since past affiliation with the Confederacy prevented attorneys from taking the oath without perjuring themselves.  <em>See Cummings v. Missouri, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/277/case.html#327">71 U. S. 327</a></span>.  In both <em>Cummings</em> and <em>Garland,</em> the persons in the group disqualified were defined entirely by irreversible acts committed by them.</p>\n<p>The District Court in this case viewed \xc2\xa7 12(f) as comparable to the provisions of the Reconstruction laws declared unconstitutional in <em>Cummings</em> and <em>Garland,</em> because it thought the statute singled out nonregistrants and made them ineligible for aid based on their past conduct, <em>i.e.,</em> failure to register.  To understand the District Court\'s analysis, it is necessary to turn to its construction of the statute.  The court noted that \xc2\xa7 12(f) disqualifies applicants for financial assistance unless they have registered "in accordance with any proclamation issued under [\xc2\xa7 3 of the Military Selective Service Act]," and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="849">Page 468 U. S. 849</a></p><p> that Proclamation No. 4771 requires those born after January 1, 1963, to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday.  <em>See</em> 3 CFR 82 (1981).  In the court\'s view, the language of \xc2\xa7 12(f), coupled with the Proclamation\'s 30-day registration requirement, precluded late registrants from qualifying for Title IV aid.  Having construed \xc2\xa7 12(f) as precluding late registration, the District Court read the statute to be retrospective, in that it denies financial assistance to an identifiable group -- nonregistrants -- based on their past conduct.  The District Court acknowledged that implementing regulations would allow students who had not previously registered to become eligible for Title IV benefits by registering, <em>see</em> 34 CFR \xc2\xa7 668.27(b)(1) (1983), but the court declared those regulations to be void because they conflicted with what the District Court viewed as \xc2\xa7 12(f)\'s requirement of registration within the time prescribed by Proclamation No. 4771.</p>\n<p>We reject the District Court\'s view that \xc2\xa7 12(f) requires registration within the time fixed by Proclamation No. 4771.  That view is plainly inconsistent with the structure of \xc2\xa7 12(f) and with the legislative history.  Subsection (f)(4) of the statute requires the Secretary of Education to issue regulations providing that "any person" to whom the Secretary proposes to deny Title IV assistance shall be given notice of the proposed denial and "not less than thirty days" after such notice to "establis[h] that he has complied with the registration requirement."  50 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 462(f)(4).  The statute clearly gives nonregistrants 30 days after receiving notice that they are ineligible for Title IV aid to register for the draft and qualify for aid.  <em>See</em> 34 CFR \xc2\xa7 668.27(b)(1) (1983).  To require registration within the time fixed by the Presidential Proclamation would undermine this provision allowing "any person" 30 days after notification to establish compliance with the registration requirement.  This was clearly a grace period.</p>\n<p>The District Court also ignored the relevant legislative history.  Congress\' purpose in enacting \xc2\xa7 12(f) was to encourage </p><p><a class="page-number" name="850">Page 468 U. S. 850</a></p><p> registration by those who must register, but have not yet done so. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Proponents of the legislation emphasized that those failing to register timely can qualify for aid by registering late. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The District Court failed to take account of this legislative purpose.  <em>See Heckler v. Edwards,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/870/case.html">465 U. S. 870</a></span> (1984).  Nor did its construction of \xc2\xa7 12(f) give adequate deference to the views of the Secretary of Education, who had helped to draft the statute.  <em>Miller v. Youakim,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/125/case.html">440 U.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Section 12(f) does not make late registrants ineligible for Title IV aid.</p>\n<p>Because it allows late registration, \xc2\xa7 12(f) is clearly distinguishable from the provisions struck down in <em>Cummings</em> and <em>Garland.</em> [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>Cummings</em> and <em>Garland</em> dealt with absolute barriers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="851">Page 468 U. S. 851</a></p><p> to entry into certain professions for those who could not file the required loyalty oaths; no one who had served the Confederacy could possible comply, for his status was irreversible.  By contrast, \xc2\xa7 12(f)\'s requirements, far from irreversible, can be met readily by either timely or late filing.  "Far from attaching to . . . past and ineradicable actions," ineligibility for Title IV benefits "is made to turn upon continuingly contemporaneous fact" which a student who wants public assistance can correct.  <em>Communist Party of United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board,</em> 367 U.S. at 87.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Even if the specificity element were deemed satisfied by \xc2\xa7 12(f), the statute would not necessarily implicate the Bill of Attainder Clause.  The proscription against bills of attainder reaches only statutes that inflict punishment on the specified individual or group.  In determining whether a statute inflicts punishment within the proscription against bills of attainder, our holdings recognize that the severity of a sanction is not determinative of its character as punishment.  <em>Flemming v. Nestor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/603/case.html">363 U.

That burdens are placed on citizens by federal authority does not make those burdens punishment.  <em>Nixon v.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Conversely, legislative intent to encourage compliance with the law does not establish that a statute is merely the legitimate regulation of conduct.

Nestor, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/603/case.html#616">363 U. S. 616</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In deciding whether a statute inflicts forbidden punishment, we have recognized three necessary inquiries:  (1) whether the challenged statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment; (2) whether the statute, "viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed, reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes"; and (3) whether the legislative record "evinces a congressional intent to punish."  <em>Nixon, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html#473">425 U.

We conclude that, under these criteria, \xc2\xa7 12(f) is not a punitive bill of attainder.</p>\n<p><em>1\n</em></p>\n<p>At common law, bills of attainder often imposed the death penalty; lesser punishments were imposed by bills of pains and penalties.  The Constitution proscribes these lesser penalties as well as those imposing death.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/277/case.html#323">Cummings v.

No affirmative disability or restraint is imposed,"</p>\n<p>and Congress has inflicted "nothing approaching the <em>infamous punishment\' of imprisonment" or other disabilities historically associated with punishment. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>Congress did not even deprive appellees of Title IV benefits permanently; appellees can become eligible for Title IV aid at any time simply by registering late, and thus "carry the keys of their prison in their own pockets."  <em>Shillitani v.

A statute that leaves open perpetually the possibility of qualifying for aid does not fall within the historical meaning of forbidden legislative punishment.</p>\n<p><em>2\n</em></p>\n<p>Our inquiry does not end with a determination that \xc2\xa7 12(f) does not inflict punishment in its historical sense.  To ensure that the Legislature has not created an impermissible penalty not previously held to be within the proscription against bills of attainder, we must determine whether the challenged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="854">Page 468 U. S. 854</a></p><p> statute can be reasonably said to further nonpunitive goals.  <em>Nixon,</em> 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/425/case.html#475">433 U. S. 475</a></span>-476.</p>\n<p>The legislative history reflects that \xc2\xa7 12(f) represents the considered congressional decision to further nonpunitive legislative goals.  Congress was well aware that more than half a million young men had failed to comply with the registration requirement. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The legislators emphasized that one of the primary purposes of \xc2\xa7 12(f) was to encourage those required to register to do so. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Conditioning receipt of Title IV aid on registration is plainly a rational means to improve compliance with the registration requirement.  Since the group of young men who must register for the draft overlaps in large part with the group of students who are eligible for Title IV aid, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] Congress reasonably concluded that \xc2\xa7 12(f) would be a strong tonic to many nonregistrants.</p>\n<p>Section 12(f) also furthers a fair allocation of scarce federal resources by limiting Title IV aid to those who are willing to meet their responsibilities to the United States by registering with the Selective Service when required to do so.  As one Senator stated:</p>\n<p>"This amendment seeks not only to increase compliance with the registration requirement, but also to insure the most fair and just usage of Federal education benefits.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="855">Page 468 U. S. 855</a></p><p> During these times of extreme budgetary constraints, times when even the most worthwhile programs are cut back drastically, this Government has every obligation to see that Federal dollars are spent in the most fair and prudent manner possible. . . .  If students want to further their education at the expense of their country, they cannot expect these benefits to be provided without accepting their fair share of the responsibilities to that Government. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]"</p>\n<p>Certain aspects of the legislation belie the view that \xc2\xa7 12(f) is a punitive measure.  Section 12(f) denies Title IV benefits to innocent as well as willful nonregistrants.  Yet punitive legislation ordinarily does not reach those whose failure to comply with the law is not willful.  Thus, in stressing that the legislation would reach unintentional violators, 128 Cong.Rec. 18355-18356 (1982) (remarks of Rep. Solomon); <em>id.</em> at 18357 (remarks of Rep. Simon); <em>id.</em> at 9666 (remarks of Sen. Stennis), proponents indicated that they intended to regulate all nonregistrants, rather than to single out intentional nonregistrants for punishment.  In this same nonpunitive spirit, Congress also allowed all nonregistrants to qualify for Title IV aid simply by registering late, instead of choosing to punish willful nonregistrants by denying them benefits even if they registered belatedly.</p>\n<p>We see therefore that the legislative history provides convincing support for the view that, in enacting \xc2\xa7 12(f), Congress sought, not to punish anyone, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] but to promote compliance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="856">Page 468 U. S. 856</a></p><p> with the draft registration requirement and fairness in the allocation of scarce federal resources.  Section 12(f) clearly furthers nonpunitive legislative goals.</p>\n<p>Because \xc2\xa7 12(f) does not single out an identifiable group that would be ineligible for Title IV aid or inflict punishment within the meaning of Bill of Attainder Clause, we hold that the District Court erred in striking down \xc2\xa7 12(f) as an impermissible attainder.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellees assert that \xc2\xa7 12(f) violates the Fifth Amendment by compelling nonregistrants to acknowledge that they have failed to register timely when confronted with certifying to their schools that they have complied with the registration law.  Pointing to the fact that the willful failure to register within the time fixed by Proclamation No. 4771 is a criminal offense punishable under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 12(a) and (b), they contend that \xc2\xa7 12(f) requires them -- since in fact they have not registered -- to confess to a criminal act, and that this is "compulsion" in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>However, a person who has not registered clearly is under no compulsion to seek financial aid; if he has not registered, he is simply ineligible for aid.  Since a nonregistrant is bound </p><p><a class="page-number" name="857">Page 468 U. S. 857</a></p><p> to know that his application for federal aid would be denied, he is in no sense under any "compulsion" to seek that aid.  He has no reason to make any statement to anyone as to whether or not he has registered.</p>\n<p>If appellees decide to register late, they could, of course, obtain Title IV aid without providing any information to their school that would incriminate them, since the statement to the school by the applicant is simply that he is in compliance with the registration law; it does not require him to disclose whether he was a timely or a late registrant.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em>  A late registrant is therefore not required to disclose any incriminating information in order to become eligible for aid.</p>\n<p>Although an applicant who registers late need not disclose that fact in his application for financial aid, appellants concede that a late registrant must disclose that his action is untimely when he makes a late registration with the Selective Service; the draft registration card must be dated and contain the registrant\'s date of birth.  32 CFR \xc2\xa7 1615.4 (1983).  This raises the question whether \xc2\xa7 12(f) violates appellees\' Fifth Amendment rights because they must register late in order to get aid, and thus reveal to the Selective Service the failure to comply timely with the registration law.  Appellees contend that, under our holding in <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/70/case.html">414 U. S. 70</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/70/case.html#83">414 U. S. 83</a></span>-84 (1973), the very risk that they will be ineligible for financial aid constitutes "compulsion" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>In <em>Turley,</em> we held that</p>\n<p>"the plaintiffs\' [architects\'] disqualification from public contracting for five years as a penalty for asserting a constitutional privilege is violative of their Fifth Amendment rights."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/70/case.html#83">414 U. S. 83</a></span>.  However, nonregistrants such as appellees are not in the same position as potential public contractors in <em>Turley.</em>  An 18-year-old male who refuses to register is, of course, subject to prosecution for failure to register, but he is not compelled by law to acknowledge his failure to comply.  Only when he registers -- including </p><p><a class="page-number" name="858">Page 468 U. S. 858</a></p><p> a late registration -- will he be asked to state his date of birth, and thus acknowledge that he did not timely register.</p>\n<p>None of these appellees has registered, and thus none of them has been confronted with a need to assert a Fifth Amendment privilege when asked to disclose his date of birth.  Unlike the architects in <em>Turley,</em> these appellees have not been denied the opportunity to register, and in no sense have they been disqualified for financial aid "for asserting a constitutional privilege."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>It is well settled that,</p>\n<p>"in the ordinary case, if a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the privilege, the government has not \'compelled\' him to incriminate himself,\'"</p>\n<p><em>Minnesota v. Murphy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/420/case.html">465 U.

However, these appellees, not having sought to register, have had no occasion to assert their Fifth Amendment privilege when asked to state their dates of birth; the Government has not refused any request for immunity for their answers or otherwise threatened them with penalties for invoking the privilege as in <em>Turley.</em>  Under these circumstances, \xc2\xa7 12(f) does not violate their Fifth Amendment rights by forcing them to acknowledge during the registration process they have avoided that they have registered late.

That argument is meritless.  Section 12(f) treats all nonregistrants alike, denying aid to both the poor and the wealthy.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Section 12(f) is in no sense punitive; it authorizes no punishment in any normal or general acceptance of that familiar term.

The Federalist No. 25, p. 161 (J. Cooke ed.1961).

By Presidential Proclamation, all men born after January 1, 1960, were required to register with the Selective Service System within 30 days of their 18th birthday. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  The issue in this case is not whether Congress has authority to implement the law, but whether the method it has chosen to do so offends constitutional guarantees of individual rights.  I conclude that \xc2\xa7 12(f) fails to pass constitutional muster on two grounds.  First, it compels self-incrimination, in violation of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="863">Page 468 U. S. 863</a></p><p> the Fifth Amendment.  Second, it violates the right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed under the Due Process Clause of that Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>At the time of the enactment of the statute before the Court today, Congress understood that, of the draft-eligible population of 9,039,000 men, some 674,000 had failed to register, and many more registrants had failed to provide current mailing addresses. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  Explanations for this widespread dereliction of legal duty have been as varied as the proposals to obtain full compliance.  Testifying at oversight hearings, Government officials have told Congress that most nonregistrants are "uninformed of the requirement or are unaware of the importance of registration," [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>] while only "a relatively small number of nonregistrants have <em>knowingly\' neglected their duty." [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  Private organizations have testified that noncompliance with the Selective Service law "is grounded in registration\'s violation of individual conscience and its infringement of religious freedom"; [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>] that they oppose </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="864">Page 468 U. S. 864</a></em></p><p><em> draft registration as a "massive government surveillance system" in which the Government collects, stores, and exchanges data on individuals in violation of constitutional and statutory rights; [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>] and that many cannot register as a matter of conscience because current regulations prohibit them from adjudicating their conscientious objector status prior to induction. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>Both the agency and Congress have crafted strategies to increase compliance with the law, such as increasing publicity programs, declaring a grace period when nonregistrants could comply without fear of prosecution, and posting lists of registrants in their local <em>post</em> offices. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  To identify and locate nonregistrants, Selective Service has collected Social Security numbers on draft registration forms, and located nonregistrants through computer data bank sharing with the Department of Health and Human Services and through mail forwarding by the Internal Revenue Service. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  Several persons </p><p><a class="page-number" name="865">Page 468 U. S. 865</a></p><p> have been prosecuted for their failure to register, and the names of others have been forwarded to the Department of Justice for investigation and possible prosecution; the attendant publicity is seen by the agency as an effective method of communicating the duty to register and the seriousness of the failure to do so. [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]</p>\n<p>It is in this context that Congress considered and adopted the statute before the Court, which was introduced on the floor by Representative Solomon and Senator Hayakawa as a rider to the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1983.  Section 1113(a) added a new subsection to the "Offenses and Penalties" section of the Military Selective Service Act.  50 U.S.C.App. 462(f).  The statute creates ineligibility for any form of assistance or benefit provided under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1070 <em>et seq.</em>) for any person required to register who fails to do so, 50 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 462(f)(1), and requires those persons to file with their post-secondary institution a "statement of compliance" with the draft registration requirement, 50 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 453.  \xc2\xa7 462(f)(2).  As the Court holds today, the purpose of this statute was not to penalize nonregistrants, but to encourage compliance with the legal duty to provide information to the Selective Service System. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="866">Page 468 U. S. 866</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is tempting to succumb to the comfortable conclusions the majority draws after its glancing review of this legislation.  After all, the Government has an explicit constitutional duty to provide for the common defense.  "[I]n a free society," as Congress has declared,</p>\n<p>"the obligations and privileges of serving in the armed forces and the reserve components thereof should be shared generally, in accordance with a system of selection which is fair and just. . . ."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 451(c).  The statute at issue has something to do with promoting full compliance with the registration law, which in turn promotes fairness in allocating burdens in the event of reinstitution of involuntary induction.  Much of the legislative rhetoric promoting \xc2\xa7 12(f) seems unexceptional:  youth should accept the obligations as well as the privileges of a democracy. [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  Nevertheless, mindful that "[i]t is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon," <em>Boyd v.

But I am confident the line has been crossed here. [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]</p>\n<p>I do not take issue with the majority\'s conclusion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/841/case.html#856">468 U.

[<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]  The neutrality of this compliance verification system is central to the majority\'s acceptance of the permissible, regulatory purpose of the statute.  However, our inquiry cannot stop there.  Although \xc2\xa7 12(f) does not coerce an admission of nonregistration, it does coerce registration with the Selective Service System, and hence individual reporting of self-incriminatory information directly to the Federal Government.</p>\n<p>If appellees were to register with Selective Service now so that they could submit statements of compliance to obtain financial aid for their schooling, they would still be in violation of federal law, for, by registering late, they would not have submitted to registration "in accordance with any proclamation" issued under \xc2\xa7 3 of the Military Selective Service Act, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="868">Page 468 U.

Failure to comply with Selective Service registration requirements within 30 days of one\'s 18th birthday is a felony, punishable by imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $10,000.  50 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 462(a).</p>\n<p>A student who registers late provides the Government with two crucial links in the chain of evidence necessary to prosecute him criminally.  <em>Cf. Marchetti v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/39/case.html">390 U. S. 39</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/39/case.html#48">390 U. S. 48</a></span>, and n. 9 (1968).  First, he supplies the Government with proof of two elements of a violation:  his birth date and date of registration.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, he calls attention to the fact that he is one of the 674,000 young men in technical violation of the Military Selective Service Act.  Armed with these data, the Government need prove only that the student "knowingly" failed to register at the time prescribed by law in order to obtain a conviction.  50 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 462(a).  When students, such as appellees in this case, have acknowledged their awareness of their legal duty to register, App. 11-12, 24-25, the Government could prosecute the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p>There can be little doubt that a late registration creates a "real and appreciable" hazard of incrimination and prosecution, and that the risk is not "so improbable that no reasonable man would suffer it to influence his conduct."  <em>Brown v. Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/591/case.html">161 U.

In their brief to this Court, for example, the appellants explicitly acknowledge that, although</p>\n<p>"failure to register within [30 days of one\'s 18th birthday] does not disqualify the registrant for Title IV aid, it is a criminal offense punishable under 50 U.S.C.App. (&amp; Supp. V) 462."</p>\n<p>Brief for Appellants 17, n. 7.  The Government thus appears to reserve the right to use information obtained by the leverage of withholding education aid as a basis for criminal prosecution.  Communications with registering men convey the same message.  For example, both the "Registration Form," SSS Form 1, and the "Acknowledgement Letter," SSS Form 3A, which is mailed to men as legal proof of compliance with Selective Service </p><p><a class="page-number" name="869">Page 468 U. S. 869</a></p><p> registration requirements, advise registrants that the information they have provided</p>\n<p>"may be furnished to the . . . Department of Justice -- for review and processing of suspected violations of the Military Selective Service Act . . . [and to the] Federal Bureau of Investigation -- for location of an individual when suspected of violation of the Military Selective Service Act."</p>\n<p>Finally, recent Government actions have acknowledged the realistic potential for prosecution.  For example, President Reagan declared a "grace period" in the first months of 1982, in which men could register without penalty. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]  The obvious implication of this declaration is that, once the grace period expires, late registrants will be prosecuted.  All of these governmental actions confirm the serious risk of self-incrimination and prosecution inherent in the act of late registration. [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="870">Page 468 U. S. 870</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Having established that late registration is an incriminating act, the question to be asked is whether the Government has exercised its powers in a way that deprives appellees of the freedom to refrain from self-incrimination through late registration.  <em>Garrity v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/493/case.html">385 U.

S. 8</a></span> (1964).  When the Government extracts incriminating information by the leverage of the threat of penalties, including the "threat of substantial economic sanction," <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley,</em> 414 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/70/case.html#82">414 U. S. 82</a></span>-83, the information is not volunteered.  Thus, our cases have found coercion in statutes that extracted information through the threat of termination of state employment, <em>Garrity v. New Jersey, supra; Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/280/case.html">392 U.

S. 273</a></span> (1968), through the threat of exclusion of a person from a profession, <em>Spevack v. Klein,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/511/case.html">385 U. S. 511</a></span> (1967), or through the threat of exclusion from participation in government contracts, <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley, supra.</em></p>\n<p>The threat of the denial of student aid is substantial economic coercion, and falls within the ambit of these cases.  For students who had received federal education aid before enactment of \xc2\xa7 12(f), termination of aid is coercive, because it could force these students to curtail their studies, thereby forfeiting their investment in prior education and abandoning their hopes for obtaining a degree.  Five of the six appellees in these cases fall into this category.  App. 11-12, 24-25.  Students who have not previously received federal aid may also be coerced by \xc2\xa7 12(f).  All students understand that entry into most professions and technical trades requires post-secondary education.  For students who cannot otherwise afford this education, compliance with \xc2\xa7 12(f) is coerced by the threat of foreclosing future employment opportunities.  All of the appellees have stated that their own career plans require them to complete a college education.  <em>Ibid.; see also id.</em> at 16, 29. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="871">Page 468 U. S. 871</a></p><p></p>\n<p>By withholding federal aid and the opportunity to obtain post-secondary education, \xc2\xa7 12(f) levies a substantial burden on students who have failed to register with the Selective Service System.  This statutory provision coerces students into incriminating themselves by filing late registration forms.  As the Court noted in <em>Garrity v. New Jersey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/493/case.html#497">385 U. S. 497</a></span>, the</p>\n<p>"option to lose their means of livelihood or to pay the penalty of self-incrimination is the antithesis of free choice to speak out or to remain silent."</p>\n<p>I therefore completely agree with appellees that this enforcement mechanism violates the Fifth Amendment\'s proscription against self-incrimination as interpreted in our previous cases, and would strike the provision down on this ground alone. [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, I do not understand the Court today to dispute that \xc2\xa7 12(f) raises serious Fifth Amendment problems.  The Court concedes that it would be incriminating for appellees to register with the Selective Service now.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/841/case.html#857">468 U. S. 857</a></span>.  The Court furthermore strongly suggests that appellees could exercise their Fifth Amendment rights if they did register, <em>cf. Garner v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/648/case.html">424 U. S. 648</a></span> (1976), and that the Government could not compel their answers at that point without immunization.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/841/case.html#858">468 U.

S. 872</a></p><p> assumes, however, that appellees must claim their privilege against self-incrimination before they can raise a Fifth Amendment claim in this lawsuit.  What the majority fails to recognize is that it would be just as incriminating for appellees to exercise their privilege against self-incrimination when they registered as it would be to fill out the form without exercising the privilege. [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>]  The barrier to prosecuting Military Selective Service Act violators is not so much the Government\'s inability to discover a birth date or date of registration as the difficulty in identifying the 674,000 nonregistrants.  The late registrant who "takes the Fifth" on SSS Form 1 calls attention to himself as much as, if not more than, a late registrant who marks down his birth date and date of registration.</p>\n<p>In <em>Marchetti v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/39/case.html">390 U. S. 39</a></span> (1968), and the related case of <em>Grosso v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/62/case.html">390 U. S. 62</a></span> (1968), the Court faced a similar situation, in which complying with a federal registration requirement was the practical equivalent of confessing to a crime.  In those cases, federal law required persons engaged in the business of accepting wagers to register and pay an occupational and excise tax.  Compliance did not exempt the gambler from any penalties for conducting his business, which was widely prohibited under federal and state law, and the information obtained if he did comply was readily available to assist the authorities in enforcing those penalties.  Petitioners failed to file the required </p><p><a class="page-number" name="873">Page 468 U. S. 873</a></p><p> forms because they feared that they would be prosecuted for gambling if they revealed their activities to the Federal Government; they were convicted of willful failure to do so.  The Court reversed the convictions, holding invalid a "statutory system . . . utilized to pierce the anonymity of citizens engaged in criminal activity."  <em>Grosso v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/62/case.html#76">390 U. S. 76</a></span> (BRENNAN, J., concurring).  The Court recognized that, by filing an incomplete form or explicitly invoking their Fifth Amendment privilege on the form itself, petitioners would incriminate themselves by informing the Government that they were involved in illegal gambling activities.  The Court therefore ruled that petitioners could exercise their Fifth Amendment rights by making "a <em>claim\' by silence," <em>Garner v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/648/case.html#659">424 U. S. 659</a></span>, n. 11, and refraining from filing the required forms.\n</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Marchetti-Grosso</em> Court based its holding in part on the fact that the information-gathering scheme was directed at those "inherently suspect of criminal activities."  <em>Marchetti v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/39/case.html#47">390 U. S. 47</a></span>.  Here, it is fair to say that the Government does not expect that most registrants will be in violation of the Selective Service laws.  At first blush, the required information might therefore seem less like the <em>Marchetti-Grosso</em> inquiries and more like income tax returns, "neutral on their face and directed at the public at large."  <em>Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/70/case.html">382 U. S. 70</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/70/case.html#79">382 U. S. 79</a></span> (1965).  In <em>Garner v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/648/case.html#661">424 U. S. 661</a></span>, the Court noted that the great majority of persons who file income tax returns do not incriminate themselves by disclosing the information required by the Government.  Because the Government has no reason to anticipate incriminating responses when requiring citizens\' self-reporting of answers to neutral regulatory inquiries, our cases put the burden of asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege on the speaker, and the right to make a claim by silence is not available. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="874">Page 468 U. S. 874</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To adopt this analogy, however, is to ignore the actual case or controversy before the Court.  When Congress passed \xc2\xa7 12(f), its focus was assuredly not prospective.  As the majority explains, Congress forged the link between education aid and Selective Service registration in order to bring into compliance with the law the 674,000 existing nonregistrants, including the six appellees in these cases.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/841/case.html#849">468 U. S. 849</a></span>-850, and n. 4.  Although, as a general matter, it is correct to say that registration is like an income tax return (neutral on its face and directed to the (male) population at large), \xc2\xa7 12(f)-compelled late registration is directed to a group inherently suspect of criminal activity, squarely presenting a <em>Marchetti</em> issue.</p>\n<p>In my view, therefore, young men who have failed to register with Selective Service, and at whom \xc2\xa7 12(f) was substantially aimed, are entitled to the same "claim by silence" as <em>Marchetti</em> and <em>Grosso.</em>  But these students are compelled to forgo that right under this statutory scheme.  The defect in \xc2\xa7 12(f) is that it denies students seeking federal aid the freedom to withhold their identities from the Federal Government.  If appellees assert their Fifth Amendment privilege by their silence, they are penalized for exercising a constitutional right by the withholding of education aid.  If they succumb to the economic coercion either by registering, or by registering but claiming the privilege as to particular disclosures, they have incriminated themselves.</p>\n<p>Thus, I cannot accept the majority\'s view that appellees\' Fifth Amendment claims are not ripe for review.  If the Court is suggesting that appellees must wait until they are prosecuted for late registration before adjudication of their claim, that</p>\n<p>"is, in effect, to contend that they should be denied the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege intended to relieve claimants of the necessity of making a choice between incriminating themselves and risking serious punishments for refusing to do so."</p>\n<p><em>Albertson v. Subversive</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="875">Page 468 U. S. 875</a></p><p> <em>Activities Control Board, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/1/case.html#76">367 U. S. 76</a></span>.  As in <em>Albertson,</em> where a federal statute required members of the Communist Party to register, appellees are put to the choice of registering, without a decision on the merits of their constitutional privilege claim, or not registering and suffering a penalty.  A nonregistrant\'s most efficacious opportunity to exercise his privilege against self-incrimination without simultaneously compromising that privilege is to challenge \xc2\xa7 12(f) anonymously, as appellees have done in this case.</p>\n<p>In sum, appellees correctly state that this law coerces them into self-incrimination in the face of a substantial risk of prosecution.  That risk should be cured by a statutory grant of immunity.  <em>See Minnesota v. Murphy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/420/case.html">465 U.

The grant would confirm that Congress\' intent in passing \xc2\xa7 12(f) was not to punish nonregistrants, but to promote compliance with the registration requirement.  The Government</p>\n<p>"may validly insist on answers to even incriminating questions . . . as long as it recognizes that the required answers may not be used in a criminal proceeding, and thus eliminates the threat of incrimination."</p>\n<p><em>Minnesota v.

The Government has a substantial interest in obtaining information to assure complete and accurate Selective Service registration, but obtaining it under the compulsion of \xc2\xa7 12(f), which is "capable of forcing the self-incrimination which the Amendment forbids," <em>Lefkowitz v. Cunningham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/801/case.html">431 U.

If Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 12(f) to encourage compliance with registration requirements, and not to identify and punish late registrants, the constitutional legislative purpose would be fulfilled without implicating students\' Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="876">Page 468 U.

While all nonregistrants are subject to imprisonment and fine, only those nonregistrants who qualify for education aid based on need are subjected both to that criminal process and to the economic compulsion imposed by the loss of financial aid.

Further, the adverse consequences of \xc2\xa7 12(f) on an identifiable group are inevitable, creating a strong inference that the adverse consequences were desired.  <em>Cf.

This animus cannot be rationalized away by the argument that Congress has an important interest in the fair allocation of scarce resources.  Entitlement programs of far greater scope than education aid -- for example, farm price supports -- confer benefits to a broader spectrum of economic interests, while much of our tax law -- oil depletion allowances, accelerated depreciation, capital gains, property owners\' deductions -- favors the more advantaged.  We can well imagine the effective political resistance that would follow Congress\' conditioning rich persons\' Government benefits and entitlements.  I can think of no constitutionally valid purpose that would justify singling out the less advantaged for special law enforcement attention.</p>\n<p>Congress has enacted other, constitutional means to enforce the Selective Service registration laws, means that do not involve invidious discrimination among subclasses of lawbreakers.  The right to an education is too basic, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="882">Page 468 U.

Considering that the statute of limitations for Selective Service registration violations is five years from the date of compliance with the law, or, for nonregistrants, age 31, 50 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 462(d), as well as the unpredictability and wide range of public and political responses to the act of noncooperation with military service over the course of our history, a nonregistrant reasonably expects immunity for his compelled disclosures, not merely references to current policy.

In the usual case, however, the Government has, for example, subpoenaed a witness to testify, and thus has already identified him.  Whether he chooses not to appear, or appears but invokes the privilege, the Government knows of his refusal to cooperate.  The appellees and other nonregistrants are not known to the Government.  Therefore, invocation of the Fifth Amendment by appellees gives the Government a different quality of information.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/19" name="F3/19">Footnote 3/19</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the OSFA Program Book is published annually, we cite to the 1981 edition because it contains the most recent statistics for distribution of federal education aid by income and ethnic group.

Although enfranchised, they are less able to exercise their vote because of their transience and, frequently, state laws burdening student voter registration.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> N.Y.
