Roughly six weeks later, the intermediate state appellate court issued its mandate.  When Gonzalez subsequently sought federal habeas relief, the District Court dismissed Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s petition as time barred by the 1-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  Under \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), state prisoners have one year to file federal habeas petitions running from \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court held that Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s judgment had become \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d when his time for seeking discretionary review in the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court expired, and that running the limitations period from that date, his petition was untimely.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder AEDPA, a habeas petitioner must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal a district court\xe2\x80\x99s final order in a habeas proceeding.  \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c)(1).

A Fifth Circuit judge granted Gonzalez a COA on the question whether his petition was timely.

The Fifth Circuit did not mention, and the State did not raise, the \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) defect.  When Gonzalez petitioned this Court for review, the State argued for the first time that the Fifth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s appeal based on the \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) defect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0Section 2253(c)(3) is a mandatory but nonjurisdictional rule.

The parties agree that \xc2\xa72253(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms make the issuance of a COA a jurisdictional prerequisite.  The parties also agree that \xc2\xa72253(c)(2), which speaks only to when a COA may issue and does not contain \xc2\xa72253(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional terms, is nonjurisdictional.  It follows that \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) is also nonjurisdictional.

Section 2253(c)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s cross-reference to \xc2\xa72253(c)(1) does not mean \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) can be read as part of \xc2\xa72253(c)(1), as Congress set off the requirements in distinct paragraphs with distinct terms.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72253(c)(3), meanwhile, underscores the rule\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory nature, but not all mandatory rules are jurisdictional.  Nor does \xc2\xa72253(c)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s mere proximity to other jurisdictional provisions turn a rule that speaks in nonjurisdictional terms into a jurisdictional hurdle.

United States, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522\n, the Court held that a federal conviction becomes final \xe2\x80\x9cwhen this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari,\xe2\x80\x9d or, if a petitioner does not seek certiorari, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 527.  In Jimenez v. Quarterman, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113\n, the Court adopted Clay\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmost natural reading of the statutory text\xe2\x80\x9d in construing \xe2\x80\x9cthe similar language of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 119.  The Court made no mention of when Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s appeal concluded and held that his judgment became final when his time for seeking certiorari expired.  Section 2244(d)(1)(A) thus consists of two prongs corresponding to two categories of petitioners.  For petitioners pursuing direct review all the way to this Court, the judgment becomes final at the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion of direct review,\xe2\x80\x9d when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies certiorari.  For all other petitioners, the judgment becomes final at the \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration of the time for seeking such review,\xe2\x80\x9d when the time for pursuing direct review in this Court, or in state court, expires.  Because Gonzalez did not appeal to the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, his judgment became final when his time for seeking review with that court expired.

Gonzalez further contends that when a petitioner does not seek certiorari, state law should define the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion of direct review.\xe2\x80\x9d  The words \xe2\x80\x9clatest of,\xe2\x80\x9d however, appear in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1), not \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  Nothing in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) contemplates any conflict between the two prongs or instructs that the later of the two shall prevail.  Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s approach of scouring each State\xe2\x80\x99s laws and cases to determine how the State defines finality, moreover, would contradict the uniform meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion of direct review\xe2\x80\x9d that Clay and Jimenez accepted.  It will be a rare situation in which a delay in the mandate\xe2\x80\x99s issuance is so severe as to prevent a petitioner from filing a federal habeas petition within a year or requesting a stay and abeyance.  Finally, the Court rejects Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that his petition is timely because it was filed within a year of when his time for seeking certiorari review expired.

The first, \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c), provides that a habeas peti- tioner must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal a federal district court\xe2\x80\x99s final order in a habeas proceeding.  \xc2\xa72253(c)(1).  The COA may issue only if the petitioner has made a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72253(c)(2), and \xe2\x80\x9cshall indicate which specific issue\xe2\x80\x9d satisfies that showing.  \xc2\xa72253(c)(3).  We hold that \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) is not a jurisdictional requirement.  Accordingly, a judge\xe2\x80\x99s failure to \xe2\x80\x9cindicate\xe2\x80\x9d the requisite constitutional issue in a COA does not deprive a court of appeals of subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second provision, \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), establishes a 1-year limitations period for state prisoners to file federal habeas petitions, running from \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\xe2\x80\x9d  We hold that, for a state prisoner who does not seek review in a State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, the judgment becomes \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d on the date that the time for seeking such review expires.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Rafael Gonzalez was convicted of murder in Texas state court.  The intermediate state appellate court, the Texas Court of Appeals, affirmed Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s conviction on July 12, 2006.  Gonzalez then allowed his time for seeking discretionary review with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (Texas CCA)\xe2\x80\x94the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court for criminal appeals\xe2\x80\x94to expire on August 11, 2006.  Tex. Rule App. Proc. 68.2(a) (2011).  The Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate on September 26, 2006.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter Gonzalez, proceeding pro\xc2\xa0se, petitioned unsuccessfully for state habeas relief, he filed a federal habeas petition under \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 on January 24, 2008, in the U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  His petition alleged, inter alia, that the nearly 10-year delay between his indictment and trial violated his \n \nSixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.  The District Court, without discussing Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claims, dismissed Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s petition as time barred by the 1-year statute of limitations in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  Although Gonzalez argued that his judgment had not become final until the Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate, the District Court held that Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s judgment had become final when his time for seeking discretionary review in the Texas CCA expired on August 11, 2006.  Counting from that date, and tolling the limitations period for the time during which Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s state habeas petition was pending, Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period elapsed on December 17, 2007\xe2\x80\x94over a month before he filed his federal habeas petition.

Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for a COA on two grounds: (1) his habeas petition was timely, and (2) his \n \nSixth Amendment speedy-trial right was violated.  A Court of Appeals judge granted a COA on the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the habeas application was timely filed because Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final, and thus the limitations period commenced, on the date the intermediate state appellate court issued its mandate.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 347.

Acknowledging that a sister Circuit had run the limitations period from the date of a state court\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of a mandate, the Court of Appeals deemed the mandate\xe2\x80\x99s issuance \xe2\x80\x9cirrelevant\xe2\x80\x9d to determining finality under \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  Id., at 224, 226 (disagreeing with Riddle v. Kemna, 523 F.\xc2\xa03d 850 (CA8 2008) (en banc)).  The Court of Appeals held that because a judgment becomes final at \xe2\x80\x9cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), the limitations period begins to run for petitioners who fail to appeal to a State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court when the time for seeking further direct review in the state court expires.  The Court of Appeals therefore concluded that Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final on August 11, 2006, and his habeas petition was time barred.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals did not address Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment claim or discuss whether the COA had been improperly issued.

As we explained in Miller-El v. Cockrell, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322 (2003)\n, \xc2\xa72253(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94establish that \xe2\x80\x9cuntil a COA has been issued federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appeals from habeas petitioners.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 336.

Section 2253(c)(2) speaks only to when a COA may issue\xe2\x80\x94upon \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\xe2\x80\x9d  It does not contain \xc2\xa72253(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional terms.  See Russello v. United States, \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16, \n23 (1983)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it would be passing strange if, after a COA has issued, each court of appeals adjudicating an appeal were dutybound to revisit the threshold showing and gauge its \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial[ity]\xe2\x80\x9d to verify its jurisdiction.  That inquiry would be largely duplicative of the merits question before the court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt follows that \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well.  Like \xc2\xa72253(c)(2), it too reflects a threshold condition for the issuance of a COA\xe2\x80\x94the COA\xe2\x80\x99s indication of \xe2\x80\x9cwhich specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).\xe2\x80\x9d  It too \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [appeals] courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arbaugh, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 515 (internal quo- tation marks omitted).  The unambiguous jurisdictional terms of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72253(a), (b), and (c)(1) show that Congress would have spoken in clearer terms if it intended \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) to have similar jurisdictional force.  Instead, the contrast underscores that the failure to obtain a COA is jurisdictional, while a COA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to indicate an issue is not.  A defective COA is not equivalent to the lack of any COA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is telling, moreover, that Congress placed the power to issue COAs in the hands of a \xe2\x80\x9ccircuit justice or judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  It would seem somewhat counterintuitive to render a panel of court of appeals judges powerless to act on appeals based on COAs that Congress specifically empowered one court of appeals judge to grant.  Indeed, whereas \xc2\xa72253(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s substantial-showing requirement at least de- scribes a burden that \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicant\xe2\x80\x9d seeking a COA bears, \xc2\xa72253(c)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s indication requirement binds only the judge issuing the COA.  Notably, Gonzalez advanced both the timeliness and \n \nSixth Amendment issues in his application for a COA.  A petitioner, having successfully obtained a COA, has no control over how the judge drafts the COA and, as in Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s case, may have done everything required of him by law.  That fact would only compound the \xe2\x80\x9cunfai[r] prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d resulting from the sua\xc2\xa0sponte dismissals and remands that jurisdictional treatment would entail.

Florida, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16).  The COA process screens out issues unworthy of judicial time and attention and ensures that frivolous claims are not assigned to merits panels.  Once a judge has made the determination that a COA is warranted and resources are deployed in briefing and argument, however, the COA has fulfilled that gatekeeping function.  Even if additional screening of already-issued COAs for \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) defects could further winnow the cases before the courts of appeals, that would not outweigh the costs of further delay from the extra layer of review.  This case, in which the alleged defect would be dispositive, exemplifies those inefficiencies; the State requests that we vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss the appeal based on a \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) defect that it raised for the first time in response to a petition for certiorari.  And delay would be particularly fruitless in the numerous cases where, as here, the district court dismissed the petition on procedural grounds and the court of appeals affirms, without having to address the omitted constitutional issue at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State, aided by the United States as amicus curiae, makes several arguments in support of jurisdictional treatment of \xc2\xa72253(c)(3).  None is persuasive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the State notes that although \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) does not speak in jurisdictional terms, it refers back to \xc2\xa72253(c)(1), which does.  The State argues that it is as if \xc2\xa72253(c)(1) provided: \xe2\x80\x9cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability that shall indicate the specific issue or issues that satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2), an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  The problem is that the statute provides no such thing.  Instead, Congress set off the requirements in distinct paragraphs and, rather than mirroring their terms, excluded the jurisdictional terms in one from the other.  Notably, the State concedes that \xc2\xa72253(c)(2) is nonjurisdictional, even though it too cross-references \xc2\xa72253(c)(1) and is cross-referenced by \xc2\xa72253(c)(3).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the State seizes on the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72253(c)(3), arguing that an omitted indication renders the COA no COA at all.  But calling a rule nonjurisdictional does not mean that it is not mandatory or that a timely objection can be ignored.  If a party timely raises the COA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to indicate a constitutional issue, the court of appeals panel must address the defect by considering an amendment to the COA or remanding to the district judge for specification of the issues.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  This Court, moreover, has long \xe2\x80\x9crejected the notion that \xe2\x80\x98all mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. properly typed jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Henderson, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see also Dolan v.

Nothing in \xc2\xa72253(c)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s prescription establishes that an omitted indication should remain an open issue throughout the case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the United States argues that the placement of \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) in a section containing jurisdictional provisions signals that it too is jurisdictional.  In characterizing certain requirements as nonjurisdictional, we have on occasion observed their \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98separat[ion]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d from jurisdictional provisions.  E.g., Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7); Arbaugh, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 515.  The converse, however, is not necessarily true: Mere proximity will not turn a rule that speaks in nonjurisdictional terms into a jurisdictional hurdle.  In fact, \xc2\xa72253(c)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s proximity to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72253(a), (b), and (c)(1) highlights the absence of clear jurisdictional terms in \xc2\xa72253(c)(3).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the State analogizes a COA to a notice of appeal, pointing out that both a notice and its contents are jurisdictional prerequisites.  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1) provides that a notice of appeal must: \xe2\x80\x9c(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9c(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have held that \xe2\x80\x9cRule 3\xe2\x80\x99s dictates are jurisdictional in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  Smith v. Barry, \n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244, \n248 (1992)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe reject this analogy.  We construed the content requirements for notices of appeal as jurisdictional because we were \xe2\x80\x9cconvinced that the harshness of our construction [wa]s \xe2\x80\x98imposed by the legislature.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., \n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 312, \n318 (1988)\n.  Rule 4, we noted, establishes mandatory time limits for filing a notice of appeal.  Excusing a failure to name a party in a notice of appeal, in violation of Rule 3, would be \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent to permitting courts to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of Rule 4.  Id., at 315.  And \xe2\x80\x9ctime limits for filing a notice of appeal have been treated as jurisdictional in American law for well over a century.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bowles v. Russell, \n\n551 U. S. 205\n, n.\xc2\xa02 (2007).  Accordingly, the Advisory Committee Note \xe2\x80\x9cmakes no distinction among the various requirements of Rule 3 and Rule 4,\xe2\x80\x9d treating them \xe2\x80\x9cas a single jurisdictional threshold.\xe2\x80\x9d  Torres, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 315; see also id., at 316 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Advisory Committee viewed the requirements of Rule 3 as jurisdictional in nature\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, we find no similar basis for treating the paragraphs of \xc2\xa72253(c) as a single jurisdictional threshold.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, in explaining why the naming requirement was jurisdictional in Torres, we reasoned that an unnamed party leaves the notice\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cintended recipient[s]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the appellee and court\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cunable to determine with certitude whether [that party] should be bound by an adverse judgment or held liable for costs or sanctions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 318.  The party could sit on the fence, await the outcome, and opt to participate only if it was favorable.  That possibility of gamesmanship is not present here.  Unlike the party who fails to submit a compliant notice of appeal, the habeas petitioner who obtains a COA cannot control how that COA is drafted.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And whereas a party\xe2\x80\x99s failure to be named in a notice of appeal gives absolutely no \xe2\x80\x9cnotice of [his or her] appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d a judge\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of a COA reflects his or her judgment that the appeal should proceed and supplies the State with notice that the habeas litigation will continue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause we conclude that \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) is a nonjurisdictional rule, the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe next consider whether Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition was time barred.

The question before us is when the judgment becomes \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d if a petitioner does not appeal to a State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn construing the language of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), we do not write on a blank slate.  In Clay v. United States, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522 (2003)\n, we addressed AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations for federal prisoners seeking postconviction relief.  See \xc2\xa72255(f)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (beginning 1-year period of limitations from \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final\xe2\x80\x9d).  We held that the federal judgment becomes final \xe2\x80\x9cwhen this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari,\xe2\x80\x9d or, if a petitioner does not seek certiorari, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 527.  In so holding, we rejected the argument that, if a petitioner declines to seek certiorari, the limitations period \xe2\x80\x9cstarts to run on the date the court of appeals issues its mandate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 529.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Jimenez v. Quarterman, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113 (2009)\n, we described Clay\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation as comporting \xe2\x80\x9cwith the most natural reading of the statutory text\xe2\x80\x9d and saw \xe2\x80\x9cno reason to depart\xe2\x80\x9d from it in \xe2\x80\x9cconstruing the similar language of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).\xe2\x80\x9d  555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 119.  The state court had permitted Jimenez to file an out-of-time direct appeal.  We held that this \xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d the limitations period; Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s judgment would now become final at \xe2\x80\x9cthe conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of that [out-of-time] appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 120\xe2\x80\x93121.  Because Jimenez did not seek certiorari, we made no mention of when the out-of-time appeal \xe2\x80\x9cconclu[ded].\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, we held that his judgment became final when his \xe2\x80\x9ctime for seeking certiorari review in this Court expired.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 120.  Nor did we mention the date on which the state court issued its mandate.  Both Clay and Jimenez thus suggested that the direct review process either \xe2\x80\x9cconcludes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexpires,\xe2\x80\x9d depending on whether the petitioner pursues or forgoes direct appeal to this Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe now make clear what we suggested in those cases:  The text of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), which marks finality as of \xe2\x80\x9cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review,\xe2\x80\x9d consists of two prongs.  Each prong\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion of direct review\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration of the time for seeking such review\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94relates to a distinct category of petitioners.  For petitioners who pursue direct review all the way to this Court, the judgment becomes final at the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion of direct review\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a petition for certiorari.  For all other petitioners, the judgment becomes final at the \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration of the time for seeking such review\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94when the time for pursuing direct review in this Court, or in state court, expires.  We thus agree with the Court of Appeals that because Gonzalez did not appeal to the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, his judgment became final when his time for seeking review with the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court expired.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGonzalez offers an alternative reading of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A): Courts should determine both the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion of direct review\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration of the time for seeking such review\xe2\x80\x9d for every petitioner who does not seek certiorari, then start the 1-year clock from the \xe2\x80\x9clatest of\xe2\x80\x9d the two dates.  Gonzalez rejects our uniform definition of the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion of direct review\xe2\x80\x9d as the date on which this Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a petition for certiorari.  In his view, whenever a petitioner does not seek certiorari, the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion of direct review\xe2\x80\x9d is the date on which state law marks finality\xe2\x80\x94in Texas, the date on which the mandate issues.  Ex\xc2\xa0parte Johnson, 12 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 472, 473 (Crim. App. 2000) (per\xc2\xa0curiam).  Applying this approach, Gonzalez contends that his habeas petition was timely because his direct review \xe2\x80\x9cconcluded\xe2\x80\x9d when the mandate issued (on September 26, 2006), later than the date on which his time for seeking Texas CCA review \xe2\x80\x9cexpired\xe2\x80\x9d (August 11, 2006).  We find his construction of the statute unpersuasive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, Gonzalez lacks a textual anchor for his later- in-time approach.  The words \xe2\x80\x9clatest of\xe2\x80\x9d do not appear anywhere in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  Rather, they appear in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1) and refer to the \xe2\x80\x9clatest of\xe2\x80\x9d the dates in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D)\xe2\x80\x94the latter three of which are inapplicable here.  Nothing in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) contemplates any conflict between the \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion of direct review\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration of the time for seeking such review,\xe2\x80\x9d much less instructs that the later of the two shall prevail.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor is Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s later-in-time reading necessary to give both prongs of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) full effect.  Our reading does so by applying one \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d the other, depending on whether the direct review process concludes or expires.  Treating the judgment as final on one date \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d the other is consistent with the disjunctive language of the provision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, Gonzalez misreads our precedents.  Gonzalez asserts that in Jimenez, we made a later-in-time choice between the two prongs.  That is mistaken.  Rather, we chose between two \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration\xe2\x80\x9d dates corresponding to different appeals: Jimenez initially failed to appeal to the Texas Court of Appeals and that appeal became final when his \xe2\x80\x9ctime for seeking discretionary review .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. expired.\xe2\x80\x9d  555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 117, 119.  When Jimenez was later allowed to file an out-of-time appeal, he pursued appeals with both the Texas Court of Appeals and Texas CCA; the out-of-time appeal thus became final when his \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ime for seeking certiorari review .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with this Court expired.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 116, 120.  We adopted the out-of-time appeal\xe2\x80\x99s date of finality over the initial appeal\xe2\x80\x99s date of finality.  Id., at 119\xe2\x80\x93121.  Critically, by deeming the initial appeal final at the expiration of time for seeking review in state court, and the out-of-time appeal final at the expiration of time for seeking certiorari in this Court, we reinforced Clay\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration\xe2\x80\x9d prong governs all petitioners who do not pursue direct review all the way to this Court.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, Gonzalez argues that AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s federalism concerns and respect for state-law procedures mean that we should not read \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) to disregard state law.  We agree.  That is why a state court\xe2\x80\x99s reopening of direct review will reset the limitations period.  555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 121.  That is also why, just as we determine the \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration of the time for seeking [direct] review\xe2\x80\x9d from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadlines when petitioners forgo certiorari, we look to state-court filing deadlines when petitioners forgo state-court appeals.  Referring to state-law procedures in that context makes sense because such deadlines are inherently court specific.  There is no risk of relying on \xe2\x80\x9cstate-law rules that may differ from the general federal rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clay, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 531.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, Gonzalez urges us to scour each State\xe2\x80\x99s laws and cases to determine how it defines finality for every petitioner who forgoes a state-court appeal.  That ap- proach would usher in state-by-state definitions of the con- clusion of direct review.  It would be at odds with the uniform definition we adopted in Clay and accepted in the \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) context in Jimenez.  And it would pose serious administrability concerns.  Even if roughly \xe2\x80\x9chalf of the States define the conclusion of direct review as the issuance of the mandate or similar process,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 40, that still leaves half with either different rules or no settled rules at all.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, Gonzalez speculates that our reading will rob some habeas petitioners of the full 1-year limitations pe- riod.  Gonzalez asserts that our reading starts the clock running from the date that his time for seeking Texas CCA review expired, even though, under Texas law, he could not file for state habeas relief until six weeks later, on the date the Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.07, \xc2\xa73(a) (Vernon Supp. 2011).  His inability to initiate state habeas proceedings during those six weeks, he argues, reduced his 1-year federal habeas filing period by six weeks.  We expect, however, that it will be a rare situation where a petitioner confronting similar state laws faces a delay in the mandate\xe2\x80\x99s issuance so excessive that it prevents him or her from filing a federal habeas petition within a year.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  A petitioner who has exhausted his or her claims in state court need not await state habeas proceedings to seek federal habeas relief on those claims.  To the extent a petitioner has had his or her federal filing period severely truncated by a delay in the mandate\xe2\x80\x99s issuance and has unexhausted claims that must be raised on state habeas review, such a petitioner could file a request for a stay and abeyance from the federal district court.  See Rhines v. Weber, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 269, \n277 (2005)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, Gonzalez argues, as an alternative to his later-in-time construction, that his petition should be considered timely because it was filed within a year of when his time for seeking this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to the Texas CCA\xe2\x80\x99s review\xe2\x80\x94expired.  We can review, however, only judgments of a \xe2\x80\x9cstate court of last resort\xe2\x80\x9d or of a lower state court if the \xe2\x80\x9cstate court of last resort\xe2\x80\x9d has denied discretionary review.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 13.1; see also \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257(a) (2006 ed.).  Because Gonzalez did not appeal to the Texas CCA, this Court would have lacked jurisdiction over a petition for certiorari from the Texas Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision affirming Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  We therefore decline to incorporate the 90-day period for seeking certiorari in determining when Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s judgment became final.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, we hold that \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) is a mandatory but nonjurisdictional rule.  Here, the COA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to \xe2\x80\x9cindicate\xe2\x80\x9d a constitutional issue did not deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  We further hold that, with respect to a state prisoner who does not seek review in a State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court, the judgment becomes \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) when the time for seeking such review expires\xe2\x80\x94here, August 11, 2006.

Subsection (a) gives appellate jurisdiction to \xe2\x80\x9cthe court of appeals for the circuit in which  the proceeding is held\xe2\x80\x9d; subsection (b) carves out certain classes of cases from that appellate jurisdiction; and subsec-tion (c) imposes a procedural hurdle to the exercise of that appellate jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94a judge\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of a certificate of appealability, see Miller-El v.

Everyone agrees that the certificate issued below contains no such indication.  See ante, at 5.  It appears, in fact, that the issuing judge never considered whether any of Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claims satisfied paragraph (2).  As far as we know, no federal judge has ever determined that Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x9chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72253(c)(2).  The Court does not even suggest that he has\xe2\x80\x94but it goes on to decide the statute-of-limitations issue in the case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIts basis for proceeding in this fashion is the remarkable statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] defective COA is not equivalent to the lack of any COA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  That is simply not true with respect to a significant defect in a legal document.  Would one say that a deed which lacks the words of conveyance is not equivalent to the lack of a deed?  Or that a passport which lacks the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s affirmance of the bearer\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship is not equivalent to the lack of a passport?  Minor technical defects are one thing, but a defect that goes to the whole purpose of the instrument is something else.  And the whole purpose of the certificate-of-appealability procedure is to make sure that, before a case can proceed to the court of appeals, a judge has made the determination that it presents a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.  To call something a valid certificate of appealability which does not contain the central finding that is the whole purpose of a certificate of appealability is quite absurd.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court says that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce a judge has made the determination that a COA is warranted and resources are deployed in briefing and argument, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the COA has fulfilled [its] gatekeeping function.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  But of course it has not done so\xe2\x80\x94it has performed no gatekeeping function whatever\xe2\x80\x94if \xe2\x80\x9cthe determination that a COA is warranted\xe2\x80\x9d has not been accompanied by the issuing judge\xe2\x80\x99s opinion required to support the determination:  that there is an issue as to which the applicant has made  a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72253(c)(2).  As the very next sentence of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion discloses, what the Court means by \xe2\x80\x9chas fulfilled [its] gatekeeping function\xe2\x80\x9d is simply that it will not be worth the trouble of going back, since that would \xe2\x80\x9cnot outweigh the costs of further delay,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is doubtless true, and it demonstrates the hollowness of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that \xe2\x80\x9ccalling a rule nonjurisdictional does not mean that it is not mandatory or that a timely objection can be ignored,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 10.  That statement is true enough as a general proposition: Calling the numerosity requirement in Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., \n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 500 (2006)\n, nonjurisdictional, for example, did not eliminate it, where protest was made, as a continuing mandatory requirement for relief on the merits, id., at 516.  Even the time-of-filing requirement in Eberhart v. United States, \n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 12 (2005)\n (per curiam), continued to have \xe2\x80\x9cbite\xe2\x80\x9d even though it was held nonjurisdictional: It prevented relief when the failure to observe it was prop-erly challenged, id., at 19.  But the Court has managed to create today a \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d requirement which\xe2\x80\x94precisely because it will not be worth the trouble of going back\xe2\x80\x94has no practical, real-world effect.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  What is the consequence when the issuing judge, over properly preserved objection, produces a COA like the one here, which does not contain the required opinion?  None whatever.  The habeas petitioner already has what he wants, argument before the court of appeals.  The government, for its part, is either confident in its view that there has been no substantial showing of denial of a constitutional right\xe2\x80\x94in which case it is just as easy (if not easier) to win before three judges as it is before one; or else it is not\xe2\x80\x94in which case a crusade to enforce \xc2\xa72253(c) is likely to yield nothing but additional litigation expenses.  As for the three-judge panel of the court of appeals, it remains free, as always, to choose whichever mandatory-but-not-jurisdictional basis it wishes for resolving the case.  Cf. Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n\xe2\x80\x9394 (1998).  Why not choose the one that is sure to be final and that might avoid embarrassing a colleague?  No one has any interest in enforcing the \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  Which is perhaps why, as I proceed to discuss, mandatory requirements for court-to-court appeal are always made jurisdictional.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tPast Treatment of Similar Provisions\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the Court acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98context, including this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6, n.\xc2\xa03 (quoting Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13)).  Thus, we have said that a requirement prescribed as a condition to obtaining judicial review of agency action  is quite different (nonjurisdictional) from a requirement prescribed as a condition to appeal from one court to another (jurisdictional).  See Henderson, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ \xe2\x80\x93 ___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938).  We have always\xe2\x80\x94always, without exception\xe2\x80\x94held that procedural conditions for appealing a case from one Article III court to another are jurisdic-tional.  When an appeal is \xe2\x80\x9cnot taken within the time prescribed by law,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cCourt of Appeals [is] without juris-diction.\xe2\x80\x9d  George v.

When a party\xe2\x80\x99s name is not listed in the notice of appeal, as the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure require, the court has no jurisdiction over that party\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.

The certificate of probable cause, of which the COA was born, arrived on the scene over 100 years ago in \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act Restricting in certain cases the right of appeal to the Supreme Court in habeas corpus proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d Act of Mar. 10, 1908, ch. 76, \n\n35Stat.\n40:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[F]rom a final decision by a court of the United States in a proceeding in habeas corpus where the detention complained of is by virtue of process issued out of a State court no appeal to the Supreme Court shall be allowed unless the United States court by which the final decision was rendered or a justice of the Supreme Court shall be of opinion that there exists probable cause for an appeal, in which event, on allowing the same, the said court or justice shall cer-tify that there is probable cause for such allowance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe last version of this statute, before it was amended to its current form in AEDPA, provided for issuance of the certificate of probable cause by a circuit judge instead of a justice.  See \xc2\xa72253, \n\n62Stat.\n967 (codified at \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253).  Even applying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s simplistic rule that the jurisdictional restriction must be contained in the very same paragraph as the procedural requirement, there is no doubt that under this statute a judge\xe2\x80\x99s certification that there was probable cause for an appeal was jurisdictional.  See, e.g., Ex parte Patrick, \n\n212 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555 (1908)\n (per cu-riam); Bilik v. Strassheim, \n\n212 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551 (1908)\n (per cu-riam).  There is no reason whatever to think that Congress rendered the statement of opinion unnecessary for jurisdiction by (1) extending the requirement for it to \xc2\xa72255 proceedings; (2) requiring the opinion to address a more specific point (not just probable cause for an appeal but presence of an issue presenting a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t; and (3) giving the document in which the judge is required to express the opinion a name (\xe2\x80\x9ccertificate of appealability\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x94so that now a \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate of appealability\xe2\x80\x9d without opinion will suffice.  Neither any one of these steps, nor all of them combined, suggest elimination of jurisdictional status for the required expression of opinion.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  It would be an en-tirely strange way of achieving that result.

But the Court does not.  So to distinguish Torres it has to find something else in Rule 3(c) that provided a \xe2\x80\x9cclear statement\xe2\x80\x9d of what \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The best it can come up with, ante, at 12, is an unclear statement, and that not from Congress but from Advisory Committee Notes referred to in the Torres opinion.  Such Notes are (of course) \xe2\x80\x9cthe product of the Advisory Committee, and not Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthey are transmitted to Congress before the rule is enacted into law.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

I know of no precedent for the proposition that legislative history can satisfy a clear-statement requirement imposed by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions.  Does today\xe2\x80\x99s distinguishing of Torres mean that legislative history can waive the sovereign immunity of the United States?  See United States v.

Because the timely filing of a notice of appeal is \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory and jurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. Robinson, \n\n361 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220, \n224 (1960)\n, compliance with the provisions of those rules is of the utmost importance.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 315 (quoting 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.

There is simply no principled basis for saying that Torres satisfies the \xe2\x80\x9cclear-statement principle,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 6, except the commonsense notion that when a document is made jurisdictional, and the required contents of that document specified, a document that does not contain those contents cannot confer jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court is not willing to say that Torres is no longer good law, but I doubt whether future litigants will be so coy.  They know that in the past, to avoid the uncongenial rigidity of the rule that procedures attending court-to-court appeals are jurisdictional, we have performed wondrous contortions to find compliance with those rules.  For example, in Smith v. Barry, \n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244, \n248 (1992)\n, we held that an \xe2\x80\x9cinformal brief\xe2\x80\x9d filed after a defective notice of appeal counted as a valid notice of appeal.  In Foman v. Davis, \n\n371 U.\xc2\xa0S. 178, \n181 (1962)\n, we held that a notice of appeal from the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment was also a notice of appeal from the underlying judgment.  And in Houston v. Lack, \n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 266, \n270 (1988)\n, we held that a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s notice of appeal was \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d when it was delivered to prison authorities for forwarding to the district court.  These (shall we say) creative interpretations of the procedural requirements were made necessary by the background principle that is centuries old:  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the mode prescribed for removing cases by writ of error or appeal  be too strict and technical, and likely to produce inconvenience or injustice, it is for Congress to provide a remedy  by altering the existing laws; not for the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Curry, 6 How. 106, 113 (1848).  But if we have been willing to expose ourselves to ridicule in order to approve implausible compliance with procedural prerequisites to appeal, surely we may be willing to continue and expand the process of simply converting those obnoxious prerequisites into the now favored \xe2\x80\x9cclaims processing rules,\xe2\x80\x9d enabling us to avoid unseemly contortions by simply invoking the ever-judge-friendly principles of equity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat began as an effort to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bring some discipline\xe2\x80\x99 to the use of the term \xe2\x80\x98jurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 5 (quoting Henderson, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5)), shows signs of becoming a libertine, liberating romp through our established jurisprudence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA few remaining points raised by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion warrant response.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court holds that the requirement imposed by paragraph (c)(2) (that a COA may issue \xe2\x80\x9conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitution-al right\xe2\x80\x9d) is not jurisdictional, and says that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t follows that \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7.   I need not reach the issue whether (c)(2) is jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x94though it seems to me that the Court disposes rather summarily of the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s view that it is.  And I need not confront the Court with the back-at-you argument that if (c)(3) is jurisdictional (as I think) then (c)(2) is as well.  For whether one runs it backwards or forwards, the argument is a bad one.  Assuming that (c)(2) is nonjurisdictional, it does not at all \xe2\x80\x9cfollow\xe2\x80\x9d that (c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well.  Paragraph (c)(3) is jurisdictional not because it is located in subsection (c), but because it describes the required content of a COA.  Paragraph (c)(2) does not; it sets forth the criterion for a COA\xe2\x80\x99s issuance.  A judge may apply that criterion erroneously but still produce a COA that (as paragraph (c)(3) requires) \xe2\x80\x9cindicate[s] which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).\xe2\x80\x9d  It no more follows that the erroneousness of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s indication must destroy the jurisdiction that the COA creates, than it followed under the predecessor statute that the erroneousness of the certification of probable cause for an appeal destroyed the jurisdiction that the certification created.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The two issues are quite separate: what the judge must find, and what the COA (or certification) must contain.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court points out that Gonzalez raised the \n \nSixth Amendment issue in his application for a COA, that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] petitioner, having successfully obtained a COA, has no control over how the judge drafts the COA,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the petitioner, \xe2\x80\x9cas in Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s case, may have done everything required of him by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  Perhaps it is true that the defective COA was not at all Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s fault\xe2\x80\x94though he could have promptly moved to amend it.  But no-fault elimination of jurisdiction is not forbidden.  In Bowles v. Russell, \n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205 (2007)\n, we enforced a time limit on notice of appeal where the district court had purported to extend the time to file and the appellant had complied with the court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  Id., at 207, 213\xe2\x80\x93214.  It did not matter that the fault lay with the court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Court points out that treating \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) as jurisdictional would waste a lot of time.  \xe2\x80\x9cEven if additional screening of already-issued COAs for \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) defects could further winnow the cases before the courts of appeals, that would not outweigh the costs of further delay from the extra layer of review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9.  But that is not an argument directed to the statute before us; it is an argument directed against enforcement of all jurisdictional requirements (all of which, I suspect, are the object of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s mounting disfavor).  And the argument may not even be true, except in the (presumably rare) case where the jurisdictional prescription is disregarded.  Over the long term, the time saved to judges and lawyers by an enforceable requirement that appeals be screened by a single judge may vastly outweigh the time wasted by the occasional need for enforcement.  That, it seems to me, is what Congress believed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTerminology is destiny.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, and the erosion of our prior jurisprudence that will perhaps follow upon it, is foreshadowed and facilitated by the unfortunate terminology with which we have chosen to accompany our campaign to \xe2\x80\x9cbring some discipline\xe2\x80\x9d to determinations of jurisdiction.  We have said that the universe of rules placing limitations upon the courts is divided into (1) \xe2\x80\x9cclaims processing rules,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) jurisdiction-removing rules.  Unless our prior jurisprudence is to be repudiated, that is a false dichotomy.  The requirement that the unsuccessful litigant file a timely notice of appeal, for example, is (if the term is to have any meaning) a claims-processing rule, ordering the process by which claims are adjudicated.  Yet as discussed above, that, and all procedures that must be followed to proceed from one court to another, have always been deemed jurisdictional.  The proper dichotomy is between claims processing rules that are jurisdictional, and those that are not.  To put it otherwise suggests a test for jurisdiction that is not to be found in our cases.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the end of the day, the indication requirement in \xc2\xa72253(c)(3) is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98imposed by the legislature and not by  the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Torres, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318 (quoting Schiavone v.

Whether or not its enforcement leads to a harsh result, wastes time in this particular case, or (though the Court does not give this as a reason) prevents us from reaching a circuit  conflict we are dying to resolve, we are obliged to enforce it.

Oakland Scavenger Co., \n, held, see infra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312), it would be an entirely unprecedented jurisdictional provision.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">5</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion suggests that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would seem somewhat counterintuitive to render a panel of court of appeals judges powerless to act on appeals based on COAs that Congress specifically empowered one court of appeals judge to grant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  To begin with, we do not think that an anomaly.  It makes entire sense to enable a single circuit judge to nip improper appeals in the bud, sparing parties the trouble of an appeal, and courts the expenditure of three times as much judicial energy.  But if it were an anomaly, it would be one that existed as well under the prior statute, which was held to be jurisdictional.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">6</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xe2\x80\x9cTorres involved .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a different textual, contextual, and historical backdrop,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 13, n.\xc2\xa08, does not withstand scrutiny.  First, consider the \xe2\x80\x9ctextual backdrop.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court cannot really believe that Rule 3(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s statement that a notice of appeal \xe2\x80\x9cmust .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. specify\xe2\x80\x9d the appealing party is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clear\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdictional language,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 7, while \xc2\xa72253(c)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cshall indicate\xe2\x80\x9d the issue or issues is not.  If it did, it would say as much, since that would readily distinguish Torres.  And then consider the \xe2\x80\x9ccontextual\xe2\x80\x9d (whatever that means) and \xe2\x80\x9chistor-ical backdrop.\xe2\x80\x9d  Each provision, in mandatory-but-not-jurisdictional language, specifies what another document, itself jurisdictional in light of statutory text and history, must contain.  The two cases are, of course, literally \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 13, n.\xc2\xa08, but not in any legally relevant way.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court also tries to distinguish Torres on the ground that failure to comply with Rule 3 presented a different \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility of gamesmanship,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 13, from that presented here.  I fail to see the relevance of that happenstance.  The premise of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is that the question of jurisdiction vel non is governed by a \xe2\x80\x9cclear-statement principle,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 6.  The statement here is precisely as clear as the statement in Torres.  Do we enforce clear statements only when there is a \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility of gamesmanship\xe2\x80\x9d?  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s free-wheeling purposivism defies textual analysis.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">8</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0We held in Nowakowski v.

That the announcement has not been heeded is demonstrated by Bowles v. Russell, \n (decided after Kontrick), which (over the dissent of the author of Kontrick) reaffirmed Browder.
