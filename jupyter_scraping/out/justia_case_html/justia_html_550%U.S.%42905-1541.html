S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77426(a)(1), if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levies upon a third party\xe2\x80\x99s property to collect taxes owed by another, the third party may bring a wrongful levy action against the United States, so long as such action is brought before \xe2\x80\x9cthe expiration of 9 months from the date of the levy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa76532(c)(1).  In contrast, the limitations period for a tax refund action under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(a)(1) begins with an administrative claim that may be filed within at least two years, and may be brought to court within another two years after an administrative denial.  The IRS levied on a bank account in which petitioner (Trust) had deposited funds because the IRS assumed that the Trust\xe2\x80\x99s creators had transferred assets to the Trust to evade taxes.  The bank responded with a check to the Treasury.  Almost a year later, the Trust and others brought a \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) action claiming wrongful levies, but the District Court dismissed the complaint because it was filed after the 9-month limitations period had expired.  After unsuccessfully pursing a tax refund at the administrative level, the Trust filed a refund action under \xc2\xa71346(a)(1).  The District Court held that a wrongful levy claim under \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) was the sole remedy possible and dismissed, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The Trust missed \xc2\xa77426(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s deadline for challenging a levy, and may not bring the challenge as a tax refund claim under \xc2\xa71346(a)(1).  Section 7426(a)(1) provides the exclusive remedy for third-party wrongful levy claims.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts more general remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>GSA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/820/index.html">425 U. S. 820</a>, 834, and it braces the preemption claim when resort to a general remedy would effectively extend the limitations period for the specific one, see<em> id.</em>,<em> </em>at 833.  If third parties could avail themselves of \xc2\xa71346(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s general tax refund jurisdiction, they could effortlessly evade \xc2\xa77426(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s much shorter limitations period.  The Trust argues that, because <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/527/index.html">514 U. S. 527</a>, construed \xc2\xa71346(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s general jurisdictional grant expansively enough to cover third parties\xe2\x80\x99 wrongful levy claims, treating \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) as the exclusive avenue for these claims would amount to a disfavored holding that \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) implicitly repealed \xc2\xa71346(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing jurisdictional grant.  But this reads <em>Williams</em> too broadly.  <em>Williams</em> involved a lien and was decided on the specific understanding that no other remedy was open to the plaintiff.  Here, the Trust challenges a levy and could have made a timely claim under \xc2\xa77426(a)(1).  Even if the presumption against implied repeals applied here, \xc2\xa77426(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s 9-month limitations period cannot be reconciled with the notion that the same challenge would be open under \xc2\xa71346(a)(1) for up to four years.  Nor can the two statutory schemes be harmonized by construing \xc2\xa77426(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadline to cover only those actions seeking predeprivation remedies unavailable under \xc2\xa71346(a)(1).  On its face, \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) applies to predeprivation and postdeprivation claims alike.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77426(a)(1), but subject to a statutory filing deadline the trust missed.  The question is whether the trust may still challenge the levy through an action for tax refund under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(a)(1).  We hold that it may not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Internal Revenue Code provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76321.  \xe2\x80\x9cA federal tax lien, however, is not self-executing,\xe2\x80\x9d and the IRS must take \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ffirmative action \xe2\x80\xa6 to enforce collection of the unpaid taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>National Bank of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/713/index.html">472 U.

No. 1708, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 30 (1966), the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 added \xc2\xa77426(a)(1), providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a levy has been made on property \xe2\x80\xa6 any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in \xe2\x80\xa6 such property and that such property was wrongfully levied upon may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court.\xe2\x80\x9d  80 Stat. 1143.  The action must, however, be brought before \xe2\x80\x9cthe expiration of 9 months from the date of the levy.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  \xc2\xa76532(c)(1).  This short limitations period contrasts with its counterpart in a tax refund action under 28 U.

Cullers, Jr., and Dorothy Cullers established the EC Term of Years Trust in 1991, the IRS assessed federal tax liabilities against them for what the Government claimed (and the Trust does not dispute, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7) were unwarranted income tax deductions in the 1980s.  The Government assumed that the Cullerses had transferred assets to the Trust to evade taxes, and so filed a tax lien against the Trust in August 1999.  The Trust denied any obligation, but for the sake of preventing disruptive collection efforts by the IRS, it deposited funds in a bank account, against which the IRS issued a notice of levy to the bank in September 1999.  In October, the bank responded with a check for over $3 million to the United States Treasury.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Almost a year after that, the Trust (joined by several other trusts created by the Cullerses) brought a civil action under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) claiming wrongful levies, but the District Court dismissed it because the complaint was filed after the 9-month limitations period had expired, see \xc2\xa76532(c)(1).  The court also noted that tax-refund claims under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(a)(1) were not open to the plaintiff trusts because \xc2\xa77426 \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98affords the exclusive remedy for an innocent third party whose property is confiscated by the IRS to satisfy another person\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>BSC Term of Years Trust</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 2001\xe2\x80\x931 USTC \xc2\xb650,174, p. 87,237, n.\xc2\xa01, 87 AFTR 2d \xc2\xb62001\xe2\x80\x93390, p. 2001\xe2\x80\x93547, n.\xc2\xa01 (WD Tex., 2000) (quoting <em>Texas Comm.

Congress specifically tailored \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) to third party claims of wrongful levy, and if third parties could avail themselves of the general tax refund jurisdiction of \xc2\xa71346(a)(1), they could effortlessly evade the levy statute\xe2\x80\x99s 9-month limitations period thought essential to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s tax collection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Trust argues that in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/527/index.html">514 U. S. 527</a> (1995), we construed the general jurisdictional grant of \xc2\xa71346(a)(1) expansively enough to cover third parties\xe2\x80\x99 wrongful levy claims.  So, according to the Trust, treating \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) as the exclusive avenue for these claims would amount to a disfavored holding that \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) implicitly repealed the pre-existing jurisdictional grant of \xc2\xa71346(a)(1).  See <em>Radzanower</em> v. <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/148/index.html">426 U.

S. 535</a> (1974).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Trust reads <em>Williams </em>too broadly.  Although we decided that \xc2\xa71346(a)(1) authorizes a tax-refund claim by a third party whose property was subjected to an allegedly wrongful tax lien, we so held on the specific understanding that no other remedy, not even a timely claim under \xc2\xa77426(a)(1), was open to the plaintiff in that case.  See <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 536\xe2\x80\x93538.  Here, on the contrary, the Trust challenges a levy, not a lien, and could have made a timely claim under \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) for the relief it now seeks under \xc2\xa71346(a)(1).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And even if the canon against implied repeals applied here, the Trust still could not prevail.  We simply cannot reconcile the 9-month limitations period for a wrongful levy claim under \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) with the notion that the same challenge would be open under \xc2\xa71346(a)(1) for up to four years.  See <em>Posadas</em> v. <em>National City Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/296/497/index.html">296 U. S. 497</a>, 503 (1936) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one\xe2\x80\x9d).  On this point, the Trust proposes that the two statutory schemes can be \xe2\x80\x9charmonized\xe2\x80\x9d by construing the deadline for filing \xc2\xa77426(a)(1) claims to cover only those actions seeking \xe2\x80\x9cpre-deprivation\xe2\x80\x9d remedies unavailable under \xc2\xa71346(a)(1).  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 6.  But this reading would violate the clear text of \xc2\xa77426(a)(1), which on its face applies to pre-deprivation and post-deprivation claims alike.  See 26 U.
