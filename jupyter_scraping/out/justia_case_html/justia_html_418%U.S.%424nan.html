CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 414 U.S. 1091 (1973), to resolve a conflict in the Circuits concerning whether, in sentencing a youth offender under other applicable penal statutes, \xc2\xa7 5010(d) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5005 <em>et seq.,</em> requires a federal district court first to make an explicit finding, supported by reasons on the record, that the offender would not benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c) of \xc2\xa7 5010.  The Court of Appeals held that such a finding may be implied from the record, 484 F.2d 849 (CA7 1973).  Three Circuits have taken that position, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and three Circuits have required an explicit finding accompanied by supporting reasons. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We conclude that, while an express finding of no benefit must be made on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 418 U. S. 426</a></p><p> record, the Act does not require that it be accompanied by supporting reasons.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>On October 19, 1971, a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs made arrangements with petitioner\'s codefendant, whose case is not before this Court, to purchase approximately 1,000 tablets of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) the following day.  At the appointed hour on October 20, 1971, the undercover agent was shown approximately 1,000 LSD tablets in the possession of petitioner\'s codefendant, who transferred the tablets to the agent.  The exhibition and transfer took place in an automobile being driven by petitioner.  After the tablets were transferred to the agent, but before money had changed hands, petitioner and his codefendant were arrested.  The complaint upon which the arrest warrant for petitioner issued charged him with knowingly and intentionally possessing approximately 1,000 tablets of LSD, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 844(a). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Subsequent to petitioner\'s release on his own recognizance, his counsel informed the District Court that petitioner intended to plead guilty to the charge, and requested the completion of a presentence report prior to the plea, as authorized by Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 32(c).</p>\n<p>On February 14, 1972, proceedings were had in the District Court upon the filing of an information, arraignment, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 418 U. S. 427</a></p><p> plea, and sentence.  The Government filed a one-count information charging petitioner and his codefendant with a misdemeanor offense under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 844(a).  The Government informed the court that the maximum sentence petitioner and his codefendant, who were first offenders under \xc2\xa7 844(a), could receive was one year in prison, a fine of $5,000, or both; the court was also advised that, since petitioner might have been under the age of 26, <em>see</em> <a href="#F9" name="T9">n</a> 9, <em>infra,</em> he "may also be subject to the Federal Youth Corrections Act." [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  App. 6.  Petitioner, who was 19 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 418 U. S. 428</a></p><p> years old at the time of the proceeding, and had had no prior criminal record, pleaded guilty, as did his codefendant.  After inquiry as prescribed by Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11 to determine whether there was a basis, in fact, for petitioner\'s guilty plea, and whether it was entered voluntarily with understanding of its nature and consequences, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the District Court accepted the plea. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 418 U. S. 429</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Since petitioner desired to be sentenced at this proceeding, the District Court recessed to consider the presentence report, which petitioner\'s counsel had already read.  After recess and before sentencing, petitioner was given his right to allocution, and petitioner\'s counsel requested the court that petitioner "be placed . . . on probation under the Youth Corrections Act."  App. 13.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em>  Petitioner then received a split sentence which remitted him to the custody of the Attorney General for one year, to serve 90 days\' confinement "in a jail-type or treatment" institution, although the judgment mentions only a "jail-type" institution; the execution of the remainder of the sentence was suspended, and petitioner was placed on probation for two years upon release from custody.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3651. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  At no time during the proceeding, including </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 418 U. S. 430</a></p><p> sentencing, did the District Court make any reference to the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</p>\n<p>On May 1, 1972, after having filed numerous other post-conviction motions for relief, petitioner filed the motion at issue here, seeking relief pursuant to Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 32(d) and 35, and 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2255, on two grounds.  The first alleged that his guilty plea was not made understandingly; that issue is not before us.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  The second alleged that the District Court was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence given because the court failed to make a finding that petitioner would not derive benefit from treatment under \xc2\xa7 5010(b) or (c), as assertedly required by \xc2\xa7 5010(d).  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em>  The District Court held an evidentiary hearing to consider this motion, as well as other motions pending at that time.  All were denied without opinion.  The District Court stated at the post-conviction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 418 U. S. 431</a></p><p> hearing that the Act did not require an affirmative finding that petitioner would not benefit from treatment thereunder before the court could sentence him under other applicable penalty provisions; the court concluded that, in committing petitioner for one year under a split sentence "the [District] Court impliedly [held] the Youth Corrections Act not applicable."  App. 45.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the view that trial judges must make an explicit finding that youth offenders would not benefit from treatment under the Act.  The Court of Appeals held that such a determination may be implied from the record as a whole, and that the imposition of the split sentence upon petitioner after his counsel had raised the possibility of sentencing under that Act satisfied \xc2\xa7 5010(d).  484 F.2d at 851.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em><em>The Federal Youth Corrections Act</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The sole issue in this case is the validity of the sentence imposed by the District Court.  Petitioner contends that, before any adult sentence may be imposed \xc2\xa7 5010(d) requires, first, that the sentencing judge find explicitly that the convicted defendant would receive no benefit from treatment under the Act and, second, that the sentencing judge must explain the reasons for his finding.  We begin with the general proposition that, once it is determined that a sentence is within the limitations set forth in the statute under which it is imposed, appellate review is at an end.

Our task, therefore, is to determine whether the sentence imposed here was permitted under \xc2\xa7 5010(d) of the Act.</p>\n<p>The Federal Youth Corrections Act has been accurately described as the most comprehensive federal statute concerned with sentencing.  <em>United States v. Coefield,</em> 155 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 209, 476 F.2d 1152, 1156 (1973).  The Act is in substantial part an outgrowth of recommendations made by the Judicial Conference of the United States more than 30 years ago. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The principles and procedures contained in the Conference recommendations were, in turn, largely based on those developed since 1894 for a system of treatment of young offenders in England, known as the Borstal system.  <em>See</em> Criminal Justice Act of 1948, 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6, c. 58, and Criminal Justice Act of 161, 9 &amp; 10 Eliz. 2, c. 39.  Statistics available at the time of the Conference study revealed the two principal motivating factors behind the enactment of the Act:  first, the period of life between 16 and 22 years of age was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 418 U. S. 433</a></p><p> found to be the time when special factors operated to produce habitual criminals.  Second, then-existing methods of treating criminally inclined youths were found inadequate in avoiding recidivism.  H.R.Rep. No. 2979, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 2-3 (1950) (hereinafter H.R.Rep. No. 2979).  The Act was thus designed to provide a better method for treating young offenders convicted in federal courts in that vulnerable age bracket, to rehabilitate them and restore normal behavior patterns.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>To accomplish this objective, federal district judges were given two new alternatives to add to the array of sentencing options previously available to them, <em>see</em> <a href="#F9" name="T9">n</a> 9, <em>infra:</em>  first, they were enabled to commit an eligible offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment under the Act. 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5010(b) and (c).  Second, if they believed an offender did not need commitment, they were authorized to place him on probation under the Act. 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5010(a).  If the sentencing court chose the first alternative, the youth offender would be committed to the program of treatment created by the Act.</p>\n<p>The objective of these options represented a departure from traditional sentencing, and focused primarily on correction and rehabilitation.  All persons under 22 years of age at the time of conviction were made eligible for probation or treatment under the Act, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] the latter defined </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 418 U. S. 434</a></p><p> as "corrective and preventive guidance and training designed to protect the public by correcting [their] antisocial tendencies."  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5006(e) and (g).  To implement the program of treatment for youth offenders committed under the Act, a Youth Correction Division was created under the Board of Parole which, in conjunction with the Bureau of Prisons and the Probation Service, operates to provide the unique features of the Act\'s program.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5005.</p>\n<p>An important element of the program was that, once a person was committed for treatment under the Act, the execution of sentence was to fit the person, not the crime for which he was convicted.  Classification agencies were to be established by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to receive and study the person committed and make recommendations to the Director as to appropriate treatment.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5014, 5015.  Further, the range of treatment available was made broad to provide maximum flexibility.  The Director was authorized both to adapt numerous public facilities and to contract with public or private agencies in order to provide institutional treatment which the Director could vary according to the committed person\'s progress or lack of it.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5011, 5015.  An integral part of the treatment program was the segregation of the committed persons, insofar as practicable, so as to place them with those similarly committed, to avoid the influence of association with the more hardened inmates serving traditional criminal sentences.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5011.</p>\n<p>In addition to institutional treatment, the Division was empowered to order conditional release under supervision at any time of those committed under the Act, with federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 418 U. S. 435</a></p><p> probation officers providing the supervision. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5007, 5017, 5019.  Conditional release was mandatory after a period of time fixed by the statutory formula.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5017.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em>  The Division was further authorized to order the unconditional discharge of committed persons after a fixed period of treatment, and was required unconditionally to discharge them within a period also fixed by statutory formula.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5017.  A powerful tool available to the Division was its discretion to discharge committed persons unconditionally before it was required to do so, for, upon such discharge, the conviction upon which the sentence rested would be automatically set aside.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5021(a).  <em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  Similarly, if the sentencing judge chose the second alternative created by the Act, <em>i.e.,</em> placement of the youth offender on probation under its provisions, the judge himself could exercise his discretion to discharge the offender from probation unconditionally.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5021(b).  <em>See</em> <a href="#F6" name="T6">n</a> 6, <em>supra.</em>  This, too, would result in the automatic setting aside of the offender\'s conviction.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5021(b).</p>\n<p>The foregoing describes the new options of treatment and probation made available to the federal sentencing court under the Act. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Our concern is not with the operation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 418 U. S. 436</a></p><p> of these alternatives, but with the decision of the court to employ them, for the Act also preserved the power of trial judges to sentence youth offenders under "any other applicable penalty provision."  It is to the question of when a judge may sentence a youth offender outside the Act that we now turn.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em><em>Sentencing Discretion Under the Act</em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>(A)\n</em></p>\n<p>The language affecting the sentencing role of the judge under the Act is found in \xc2\xa7 5010(d), which tells us:</p>\n<p>"If the court shall find that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c), then the court may sentence the youth offender under any other applicable penalty provision."</p>\n<p>Our concern is with the effect of the requirement of a "no benefit" finding on the judge\'s sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p>The legislative history clearly indicates that the Act was meant to enlarge, not restrict, the sentencing options of federal trial courts in order to permit them to sentence youth offenders for rehabilitation of a special sort.</p>\n<p>"The proposed legislation is designed to make available for the <em>discretionary</em> use of the Federal judges a system for the sentencing and treatment of [youth offenders] that will promote the rehabilitation of those who <em>in the opinion of the sentencing judge</em> show promise of becoming useful citizens. . . ."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 2979, p. 1.  (Emphasis added.) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 418 U. S. 437</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"The purpose of the proposed legislation is to provide a <em>new alternative sentencing</em> and treatment procedure for [youth offenders]."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 1180, 81st Cong. 1st Sess. . 1 (1949) (hereinafter S.Rep. No. 1180).  (Emphasis added.)  Thus, apart from the discretion vested in administrative agencies for treatment of those committed under the Act, as described in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html#431">418 U. S. </a></span> the Act was intended to broaden the scope of judicial sentencing discretion to include the alternatives of treatment or probation thereunder.</p>\n<p>The Act was a product of studies made by a committee of federal judges under the auspices of the Judicial Conference of the United States.  The views of the sponsors as to the effect of the Act on the sentencing discretion of the trial courts are thus of particular importance, and they uniformly support the view that the Act was intended to preserve the unfettered sentencing discretion of federal district judges.  Most pertinent is the statement made by the Chairman of the Judicial Conference special committee appointed to study punishment for crime, <em>see</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra,</em> Chief Judge John J. Parker, who testified before the Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which conducted the only hearings held on the bill (S. 2609) enacted as the Federal Youth Corrections Act.  Judge Parker stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he act . . . does not interfere with the power of the judge [with respect to sentencing youth offenders], but gives him merely an alternative method of treatment of those people. . . .  He may still give the youthful offender the punishment prescribed by existing statutes, there is nothing in the bill that prevents that.  All that the bill does is to provide that, if, in his judgment and discretion, he thinks that the offender before the court is one that can be treated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 418 U. S. 438</a></p><p> with advantage under this bill, he can sentence him under this bill instead of under the existing law."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>". . .  I do not see any possible objection [to the Act].  They say that there are some of these fellows that ought to be given serious punishment notwithstanding their being young, and it [the Act] does not prevent their being given serious punishment.  Nothing prevents a man from getting 25 years punishment if he deserves it.  Nothing prevents his being executed if he deserves such sentence."</p>\n<p>Hearings on S. 1114 and S. 2609 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 444 (1949) (hereinafter Hearings).</p>\n<p>To the same effect is the statement made by Circuit Judge Orie L. Phillips, the Chairman of the Conference subcommittee which gave particular attention to the treatment of youth offenders.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra.</em>  In response to the statement of Senator Kilgore, sponsor of S. 2609, that the bill "takes nothing" (in terms of sentencing) "away from the court," Judge Phillips replied:  "That is correct; it is purely optional."  Hearings 69.  Earlier, Judge Phillips had said of the bill:  "That is merely a flexibility, and it is not a command that he send the boys up," to which Senator Kilgore replied:  "I agree with you on that. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 67.  To the extent other testimony and the debates addressed the question of sentencing discretion under the Act, they invariably reflected the same view, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] as did the House </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 418 U. S. 439</a></p><p> Report, quoted above, and the Department of Justice, which recommended enactment of S. 2609 and noted that the bill "would not deprive the court of any of its present functions as to sentencing."  S.Rep. No. 1180, pp. 111.  The Senate Report\'s language was identical to that of the Department of Justice. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at 1.  The legislative history </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 418 U. S. 440</a></p><p> of the Act confirms the conclusion that Congress did not intend to alter or circumscribe the sentencing discretion of federal district judges by requiring that any substantive standard be met before the imposition of sentence.  There is virtual unanimity of opinion in the legislative history that the Act was intended to increase the sentencing options of federal trial judges, rather than to limit the exercise of their discretion whether to employ the newly created options.</p>\n<p>To construe \xc2\xa7 5010(d)\'s requirement of a "no benefit" finding to circumscribe that discretion would be incompatible with a clear congressional intent; such a construction would also be at odds with traditional sentencing doctrine.  The intent of Congress was in accord with long-established authority in the United States vesting the sentencing function exclusively in the trial court. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>"If there is one rule in the federal criminal practice </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 418 U. S. 441</a></p><p> which is firmly established, it is that the appellate court has no control over a sentence which is within the limits allowed by a statute."</p>\n<p><em>Gurera v. United States,</em> 40 F.2d 338, 340-341 (CA8 1930).  <em>See Gore v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/386/case.html">357 U.

S. 299</a></span> (1932).</p>\n<p>The statutes referred to in this line of cases established a permissible range within which sentences could be imposed; if a judge imposed a sentence within that range, his exercise of discretion as to where within the permissible range sentence should be fixed was not subject to challenge.  The authority to sentence a youth offender under "any other applicable penalty provision" is expressly reserved to federal trial courts by \xc2\xa7 5010(d), and thus is within the permissible range of sentences which may be imposed under the Act.  The "no benefit" finding required by the Act is not to be read as a substantive standard which must be satisfied to support a sentence outside the Act, for such a reading would subject the sentence to appellate review even though the sentence was permitted by the Act\'s terms, thereby limiting the sentencing court\'s discretion.  We will not assume Congress to have intended such a departure from well established doctrine without a clear expression to disavow it.  As our review has shown, the exclusive sentencing power of district judges was acknowledged, and Congress\' intention to affirm that power was clearly indicated.</p>\n<p>From our conclusion that a finding of "no benefit" was not intended to constitute a substantive standard, it follows that a sentence outside the Act need not be accompanied by a statement of reasons why the court chose such a sentence.  The only purpose of such a requirement would be to facilitate appellate supervision of, and thus to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 418 U. S. 442</a></p><p> limit, the trial court\'s sentencing discretion. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  In short, we hold that the discretion vested in a district judge under \xc2\xa7 5010(d) is essentially the same as the. traditional discretion vested in the court, for example, to impose the minimum sentence on a first offender or a larger sentence on a recidivist.  If the failure of a court to sentence a particular youth offender under the Act appears "too harsh, the remedy must be afforded by act of Congress, not by judicial legislation under the guise of construction," <em>Blockburger, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/305/case.html">284 U.

S. 393</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>(B)\n</em></p>\n<p>Although the Act was not in any way intended to circumscribe the discretion of sentencing courts, it did provide a new sentencing alternative designed to prevent youthful offenders from continuing their involvement in criminal conduct after the expiration of their sentence.  In the novelty of the treatment option made available, and the importance of the objective it was to serve, lies the purpose of \xc2\xa7 5010(d)\'s requirement that the court find "no benefit" before imposing a sentence other than one under \xc2\xa7 5010(b) or (c). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 418 U.

Such a finding would make unmistakably clear that the sentencing judge was not only aware of the existence of the new Act, but also knew that the youth offender before him was eligible because of his age for the treatment it provided to accomplish its important purpose.</p>\n<p>"Appellate modification of a statutorily authorized sentence . . . is an entirely different matter than the careful scrutiny of the <em>judicial process</em> by which the particular punishment was determined.  Rather than an unjustified incursion into the province of the sentencing judge, this latter responsibility is, on the contrary, a necessary incident of what has always been appropriate appellate review of criminal cases."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Hartford,</em> 489 F.2d 652, 654 (CA5 1974).  (Emphasis in original.)  Once it is made clear that the sentencing judge has considered the option of treatment under the Act and rejected it, however, no appellate review is warranted.</p>\n<p>The question whether the finding of "no benefit" must be explicit or whether it may be implicit in the record of a particular case is answered by the manifest desire of Congress to assure that treatment under the Act be considered by the court as one option whenever the youth offender is eligible for it.  If the finding may be implied </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 418 U. S. 444</a></p><p> from the record, appellate courts must go on to determine what constitutes a sufficient showing of the requisite implication.  To hold that a "no benefit" finding is implicit each time a sentence under the Act is not chosen would render \xc2\xa7 5010(d) nugatory; to hold that something more is necessary to support the inference that must be found in the record would create an <em>ad hoc</em> rule.  Appellate courts should not be subject to the burden of case-by-case examination of the record to make sure that the sentencing judge considered the treatment option made available by the Act.  Literal compliance with the Act can be satisfied by any expression that makes clear the sentencing judge considered the alternative of sentencing under the Act and decided that the youth offender would not derive benefit from treatment under the Act.</p>\n<p>This case provides an example of the problems arising when the required finding is left to implication.  Counsel\'s references to the Act followed by the District Court\'s sentence indeed afford support for the argument that, by implication, the options of the Act were considered and rejected.  However at the post-conviction hearing, the District Court found from the record of the sentencing hearing the implication that the Act was "not applicable."  It is thus unclear whether this meant the court believed petitioner to be legally ineligible for treatment under the Act -- which would be error -- or whether, realizing he was eligible, nevertheless deliberately opted to sentence him as an adult.  An explicit finding that petitioner would not have benefited from treatment under the Act would have removed all doubt concerning whether the enlarged discretion Congress provided to sentencing courts was indeed exerciseed.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the end that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 418 U.

The Chief Justice appointed four federal courts of appeals judges and three district judges to the committee which undertook the study.  A subcommittee gave particular attention to the treatment of youth offenders.  The committee made a report to the Judicial Conference in 1942, and developed a draft of an act to provide a correctional system for adult and youth offenders.  The report as adopted by the Conference was first presented to Congress in 1943.

The judge may suspend imposition or execution of sentence and place the offender on probation.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5010(a).  Alternatively, the judge may sentence the offender for treatment and supervision at a special youth facility, to be discharged in no more than 6 years, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5010(b), or he may commit the offender to a youth institution for a term which may exceed 6 years, up to the maximum period authorized by law for the offense.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5010(c).

I would require that the explicit "no benefit" finding be augmented by a statement of the reasons for imposing an adult sentence.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>I find no basis in either the language or history of the YCA to support the Court\'s observation that the Act was intended to "preserve unfettered" the discretion of the sentencing judge.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html#437">418 U. S. 437</a></span>.  The YCA was the product of more than 10 years of study by various groups, and was modeled after the English Borstal system, which had achieved substantial success in rehabilitating young offenders. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The initial legislative proposal, an American Law Institute model Act, removed the power to sentence eligible offenders from the trial judges altogether and reposed that power in a correctional authority. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Not surprisingly, that proposal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 418 U. S. 447</a></p><p> brought swift and sharp criticism from the judges, whose power was to be sharply curtailed.  The next proposal, by the Judicial Conference, involved shared sentencing powers between trial judges and correctional authorities. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  It met with similar criticism.  The 1949 proposal, which was finally enacted into law, retained sentencing power in the trial judge.  As the Court today points out, the drafters of the Act repeatedly emphasized that the legislation "<em>does not interfere with the [sentencing] power of the judge. . . .\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html#437">418 U. S. 437</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>But even the very first Judicial Conference proposal contained a provision specifically requiring the trial judge to make a finding that a youth offender would not benefit from treatment, and should not be committed under the Act, before sentencing him under any other penalty provisions. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  This finding requirement was adapted from the similar Borstal provision which disallows a sentencing court to</p>\n<p>"impose imprisonment on a person under twenty-one years of age unless . . . no other [Borstal] method of dealing with him is appropriate. . . . [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]"</p>\n<p>The finding requirement of the Judicial Conference draft was not subject to the same criticism as the provisions which actually removed, rather than limited, the exercise of trial judges\' sentencing discretion, and the finding requirement was ultimately enacted into law as \xc2\xa7 5010(d).</p>\n<p>The finding requirement is an integral part of the YCA scheme.  The stated premise of the Act is that young people between the ages of 18 and 22, especially, are promising subjects for rehabilitation. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  The purpose of the legislation was, for those offenders, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 418 U. S. 448</a></p><p> to</p>\n<p>"substitute for retributive punishment methods of training and treatment designed to correct and prevent antisocial tendencies.  It departs from the mere punitive idea of dealing with criminals, and looks primarily to the objective idea of rehabilitation."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 2979, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1950). [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  It is clear that, from its very inception, the youth corrections program was intended to establish among the goals judges could consider in sentencing eligible offenders, one as paramount -- that of rehabilitation. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  And, in this limited sense, the sentencing discretion of trial judges is necessarily circumscribed in regard to youth offenders.  The finding requirement of \xc2\xa7 5010(d) effectuates this policy by permitting eligible offenders to be deprived of the rehabilitative treatment provided under the Act only where they would not benefit therefrom.</p>\n<p>The Senate Report accompanying the bill explained the circumstances under which adult sentencing would be proper:</p>\n<p>"If . . . the judge is convinced the youth is incorrigible and would derive no help from the program, he may sentence him under any applicable provision of law."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 1180, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1949).  Other aspects of the legislative history underscore Congress\' intention that the Act provide a preferred sentencing alternative for eligible offenders.  Senator Kilgore, one of the sponsors of the legislation, observed that given the requisite finding "only about 10 percent of [eligible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 418 U. S. 449</a></p><p> offenders would] eventually have to [be] sentence[d as adults], or less."  Hearing on S. 895 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1943).  The House Report concluded that, even given the instances in which YCA rehabilitative treatment would fail, "more than 70 percent [of eligible youth offenders] can be rehabilitated" under the Act.  H.R.Rep. No. 2979, <em>supra,</em> at 10.  The panoply of treatment options [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] available under the Act is but further evidence that the YCA program was intended to be sufficiently comprehensive to deal with all but the "incorrigible" youth.</p>\n<p>This congressional intent finds clear expression in the words of the statute.  Section 5010(d) does not say the sentencing court must merely consider the treatment option provided by the Act; it says in the most uncompromising terms that the court must find the youth "will not benefit" from YCA treatment as a prerequisite to imposing an adult sentence.  The use of the words "shall find" emphasizes the mandatory nature of that finding.  The specific quality of the finding is underscored by \xc2\xa7 5010(e), which provides for an eligible offender to be temporarily committed for observation and study for the purpose of providing the sentencing court with a report on the particular question defined by \xc2\xa7 5010(d) -- whether the youth offender would benefit from treatment under the Act. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 418 U. S. 450</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Thus; while the Act does not remove a trial judge\'s responsibility or discretion for the sentencing determination, it does provide a preferred disposition for eligible offenders.  A sentencing judge is not required to sentence a youth offender under the Act; the judge can still exercise his</p>\n<p>"sound discretion to deny such rehabilitative treatment to those youths in the exceptional cases where the judge determines that the special youth treatment afforded by the Act would be of no value."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Waters,</em> 141 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 291, 437 F.2d 722, 724 (1970).  The legislative history relied on by the Court merely emphasizes this point -- that the Act was intended to be another sentencing alternative available to the trial Judge, and that the decision as to whether it should be employed in a particular case remains a decision committed to his discretion.  That history is not, however, inconsistent with what seems to me the plain meaning of the words of the statute -- that the sentencing Judge\'s discretion is circumscribed by the affirmative finding requirement of \xc2\xa7 5010(d). [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  The YCA "provides a preferred sentencing alternative" which must be used in sentencing a youth unless the facts of the individual case meet the statutory requirement -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 418 U. S. 451</a></p><p> unless, in the language of \xc2\xa7 5010(d), the court finds that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under the Act. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  <em>Cox v. United States,</em> 473 F.2d at 337; <em>United States v. Waters,</em> 141 U.S.App.D.C. at 29293, 437 F.2d at 725-726.  Every Court of Appeals which has considered the issue, except the court below, has agreed that the manner in which the sentencing judge exercises his discretion is thus limited.  <em>Brooks v. United States,</em> 497 F.2d 1059 (CA6 1974); <em>United States v. Kaylor,</em> 491 F.2d 1133 (CA2 1974) (en banc); <em>United States v. Schenker,</em> 486 F.2d 318 (CA5 1973); <em>United States v. Coefield,</em> 155 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 476 F.2d 1152 (1973) (en banc); <em>Cox v. United States, supra; Williams v. United States,</em> 476 F.2d 970 (CA3 1973); <em>see United States v. MacDonald,</em> 455 F.2d 1259, 1265 (CA1 1972); [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] <em>cf. Small v. United States,</em> 304 A.2d 641 (DC Ct.App. 1973).</p>\n<p>In a sense, the Court today also recognizes the inherent limitation on the judge\'s discretion imposed by \xc2\xa7 5010(d) by requiring an explicit "no benefit" finding as a prerequisite to adult sentencing.  As conceived by the Court, however, the required "no benefit" finding is no finding at all, but merely a ritualistic invocation of the statutory language.  In explaining why the "no benefit" finding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 418 U. S. 452</a></p><p> must be explicit, the Court notes that "[t]o hold that a <em>no benefit\' finding is implicit each time a sentence under the Act is not chosen would render \xc2\xa7 5010(d) nugatory."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html#444">418 U. S. 444</a></span>.  Despite these protestations, the Court today renders the finding requirement of \xc2\xa7 5010(d) a nullity.  By holding that the Act was intended to preserve "the unfettered sentencing discretion of federal district judges," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html#437">418 U. S. 437</a></span>, and that sentencing judges need only have "considered the option of treatment under the Act and rejected it," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html#443">418 U. S. 443</a></span>, the Court effectively reads the unambiguous mandate of a "no benefit" finding out of the Act.  A mere parroting of the statutory language is hardly an affirmative finding.  The Court\'s opinion seems to indicate that the sentencing judge need not mean what he says when he pronounces the "no benefit" litany.  Although the Court requires him to go through the charade of saying that the offender would not benefit from treatment under the Act, it apparently does not require that the judge actually find no benefit, but only that he be aware of the Act and reject it.  I think it remarkable that this Court should approve such an empty and duplicitous ritual.\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>If the Court were to hold that the Act limited a trial judge\'s discretion by requiring that he actually find a youth offender would not benefit from YCA treatment before sentencing him as an adult, I would think that more than a mere recitation of the conclusory finding of "no benefit" should be required.  To say that simply invoking the words of the statute satisfies the mandate of \xc2\xa7 5010(d) affords far too little credence both to Congress\' deep concern for the rehabilitative potential of young offenders and to its obvious intention that eligible offenders be sentenced under the Act if they would benefit from its rehabilitative programs.  To give effect to these concerns, I would require that the trial judge include, on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 418 U. S. 453</a></p><p> record, a statement which makes clear that he considered the provisions of the Act, weighed the treatment option available, and decided in light of his familiarity with the offender that he would not derive benefit from treatment under the Act. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>The mere recitation of the "no benefit" litany can hardly bear the weight of demonstrating such compliance.  By taking the unusual step of requiring a specific finding in this limited but highly important area of sentencing, Congress mandated a reasoned determination that the offender would not benefit from the rehabilitative treatment available under the Act.  Accordingly, in my view, a statement of the factors which informed and shaped the sentencing decision must accompany the conclusory finding of "no benefit" if that congressional purpose is to be served.</p>\n<p>The Borstal system, which provided the model for the youth corrections scheme in general and the requirement of \xc2\xa7 5010(d) in particular, envisions a trial judge stating his reasons for sentencing an eligible offender as an adult. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  Similarly, most of the Courts of Appeals which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="454">Page 418 U. S. 454</a></p><p> have faced the issue have required a statement of reasons as a necessary concomitant of the \xc2\xa7 5010(d) finding.  A unanimous en banc decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and a near-unanimous en banc decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] have found a statement of reasons supporting the "no benefit" finding to be "<em>essential to a knowledgeable administration of the Act. . . .\'"  <em>United States v. Kaylor,</em> 491 F.2d at 1139; <em>United States v. Coefield,</em> 155 U.S.App.D.C. at 210, 476 F.2d at 1157.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has, more recently, held that a statement of reasons accompanying adult sentencing is\n</em></p>\n<p>"necessary to insure that the sentencing court . . . has deliberately considered whether a youth offender may benefit from the treatment provided for in the Act. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Brooks v. United States,</em> 497 F.2d at 1063.  Similarly, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently remanded a case for consideration of whether treatment under the Act would be beneficial to the offender, and specifically ordered the trial judge to state the reasons for his conclusion.  <em>Cox v. United States,</em> 473 F.2d at 337.  In fact, the court below is the only Court of Appeals to specifically disavow a requirement of reasons for a \xc2\xa7 5010(d) sentence. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 418 U. S. 455</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Contrary to the Court\'s assertion that appellate review is the only purpose to be served by a statement of reasons, that requirement serves a number of other important policies.  First, it might well contribute to rationalizing the sentencing process, and to decreasing disparities in sentences.  Articulating reasons should assist a trial judge in developing for himself a consistent set of principles on which to base his sentencing decisions.  Requiring</p>\n<p>"[s]uch a procedure would encourage the judge to clarify and justify, in his own mind, the grounds for the sentence he chooses.  As a result, sentencing decisions would tend, on the whole, to be more carefully thought out."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Velazquez,</em> 482 F.2d 139, 142 (CA2 1973); <em>accord, United States v. Brown,</em> 479 F.2d 1170, 1172 (CA2 1973).</p>\n<p>The reasons may also be of use to correctional authorities in their handling of the prisoner after sentence.  The kind of correctional and rehabilitative treatment an offender receives should take into account the reasons for his sentence.</p>\n<p>A disclosure of reasons may also aid the defendant\'s counsel to insure that the sentence is not premised on misinformation or inaccuracies in the material upon which the sentencing judge relies.</p>\n<p>"A Sphinx-like silence on the court\'s part precludes anyone (including the parties, [and] the judge . . .) from learning whether he acted in error."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1173; <em>cf. United States v. Tucker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/443/case.html">404 U. S. 443</a></span> (1972). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 418 U. S. 456</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Moreover, an articulation of reasons may actually contribute to the offender\'s rehabilitation by avoiding any feeling that his sentence was arbitrary. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  As MR. JUSTICE (then Judge) STEWART observed:</p>\n<p>"Justice is measured in many ways, but, to a convicted criminal, its surest measure lies in the fairness of the sentence he receives. . . .  It is an anomaly that a judicial system which has developed so scrupulous a concern for the protection of a criminal defendant throughout every other stage of the proceedings against him should have so neglected this important dimension of fundamental justice."</p>\n<p><em>Shepard v. United States,</em> 257 F.2d 293, 294 (CA6 1958).  If reasons were articulated for the sentencing decision, an offender would be less apt to perceive his fate as being arbitrarily determined. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  Reasoned decisions may even enhance the legitimacy of the sentencing process as perceived by the general public, for, as noted by the Report of the American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice:</p>\n<p>"It is hardly commanding of public respect for our system, on the one hand, to increase the alternatives of the sentencing judge so that he can shape his sentence to fit each case, and, on the other hand, to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 418 U. S. 457</a></p><p> take the position that he need not explain why he selects a particular sentence. . . . [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]"</p>\n<p>Although these considerations apply to sentencing decisions generally, [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>] I do not mean to suggest that reasons are required in any other sentencing context.  Contrary to the majority\'s accusations, my view of the Act does not require wholesale abandonment of "traditional sentencing doctrine."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html#440">418 U. S. 440</a></span>.  We are concerned here with only a limited, albeit important, area of sentencing for which Congress has established special rules.  Congress\' urgent concern for the rehabilitative potential of young offenders and the specific-finding requirement of \xc2\xa7 5010(d) make the need for reasons particularly compelling in this context.  Requiring a statement of reasons would encourage trial judges to direct their attention to the crucial questions of benefit and treatment, to take a hard look at the relevant factors, and to focus on value judgments inherent in their sentencing decision.  <em>See United States v. Phillips,</em> 156 U.S.App.D.C. 217, 479 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 418 U. S. 458</a></p><p> F.2d 1200 (1973).  It is clearly consonant with the Act to require such reasoned consideration.  I must agree with the perceptive observations of Senior judge Fahy of the District of Columbia Circuit that requiring a statement of reasons is essential to assure:</p>\n<p>"firstly, that the District Judge manifest not only an awareness that the Act is applicable to the case, but also an accurate understanding of the scope of his discretion under the Act; secondly, that the District Judge has been informed of the pertinent facts relating to the individual defendant before him, either by evidence coming to his attention in the trial, by a presentence report, or by a recommendation and report made under section 5010(e); and thirdly, that the District Judge, by his statement of reasons where required, has given consideration and related the facts of the individual case to the applicable law."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Coefield,</em> 155 U.S.App. D C., at 210-211, 476 F.2d at 1157-1158 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Section 5010(e) of the Act provides a mechanism for the trial judge to secure the expert assistance of correctional authorities in determining whether an eligible offender would benefit from treatment.  I agree with the two Courts of Appeals which have passed on the issue that:</p>\n<p>"[W]hen a judge has availed himself of the assistance afforded by \xc2\xa7 5010(e), that is to say, where he has ordered the youth offender committed . . . for observation and study . . . and the Division has made its report to the court, and after considering the report has followed its findings or recommendation in imposing sentence, additional reasons are not required to be stated, although, of course, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="459">Page 418 U. S. 459</a></p><p> judge is not prevented from stating his own reasons."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Kaylor,</em> 491 F.2d at 1139.  <em>Accord, United States v. Coefield,</em> 155 U.S.App.D.C. at 210, 476 F.2d at 1157.  But the Act clearly intended that the ultimate sentencing decision remain with the trial judge.  That decision should not pass by abdication to the correctional authorities who prepare the \xc2\xa7 5010(e) study.  Thus, where a trial judge secures a \xc2\xa7 5010(e) report, he should adopt its reasons as his own only after assuring himself of the adequacy of the report and propriety of its recommendation. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]</p>\n<p>I see no reason to reach here the issue of appellate review of the District Court\'s imposition of an adult sentence.  I believe that the Youth Corrections Act provides a preferred sentencing alternative which can only be abandoned on the basis of a finding that an eligible offender will not benefit from treatment under the Act.  The District Court imposed sentence on the assumption that the YCA was not a preferred disposition and no finding was required.  The Court today finds the District Court\'s sentence invalid only for failure to make the required "no benefit" finding.  Under either the Court\'s view or my own, the appellate review question is clearly not yet presented by this case. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court insofar as it reverses and remands because the District Court failed to make the requisite "no benefit" finding.

Kaylor,</em> 491 F.2d at 1137.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/14" name="F2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]</p>\n<p>Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Walker,</em> 469 F.2d 1377 (1972), the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed that the Act precluded adult sentencing where the offender would derive benefit from treatment under the Act, but found it clear from the nature of the offenses involved that the defendant had no antisocial tendencies to be corrected, hence no benefit to be derived from YCA treatment.  <em>Id.</em> at 1381 n. 4.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/15" name="F2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Brooks v.

Coefield,</em> 155 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 210-211, 476 F.2d 1152, 1157-1158 (1973) (en banc).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/16" name="F2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>Criminal Justice Act of 1948, \xc2\xa7 17(3), 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6, c. 58.  The Court asserts, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/case.html#440">418 U. S. 440</a></span> n. 14, that the reference to the English Borstal system made in drafting the Act "did not include the English view of the trial court\'s discretion to make use of that system."  To support this claim, the Court relies on two general descriptions of American sentencing procedures made a decade after enactment of the legislation.  Those comments were not directed to the administration of the YCA; hence their validity as indicia of congressional intent in this limited context is questionable, at best.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that the Borstal system did, in fact, provide a model on the question of the trial court\'s sentencing discretion, not the least of which is the marked similarity between 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5010(d) and the Criminal Justice Act of 1948, \xc2\xa7 17(2), 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6, c. 58, both of which require a no-benefit finding as a prerequisite to adult sentencing.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/17" name="F2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>Only Judge MacKinnon, of the 10 participating judges on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, dissented from that court\'s en banc decision in <em>Coefield, supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/18" name="F2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p>The First Circuit, in <em>United States v. MacDonald,</em> 455 F.2d 1259, 1265 (1972), remanded a case to the District Court "to make the findings required by the Federal Youth Corrections Act," leaving unclear whether those findings encompassed a statement of reasons.  The Third Circuit specifically reserved the issue in <em>Williams v. United States,</em> 476 F.2d 970 (1973).  The Fifth Circuit, in its only case on the issue, remanded for appropriate findings under \xc2\xa7 5010(d) without explanation as to whether an ultimate finding of no benefit was alone sufficient.  <em>United States v. Schenker,</em> 486 F.2d 318 (1973).  A case specifically,dealing with the reasons requirement, <em>Hoyt v. United States,</em> No. 73-2435, is presently pending before the Fifth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit called for an express no benefit finding, but has not faced the question of whether reasons are required in support thereof.  <em>United States v.
