UNITED STATES<br/>\n555 U. S. ____ (2008)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">JAMES ERIC MOORE <em>v.</em> UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x9310689.\xe2\x80\x83Decided October 14, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0James Eric Moore was convicted of one count of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute, a violation of 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a)(1) and (b)(1).  Given the quantity of crack cocaine, the presentence report calculated that Moore\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines was 151 to 188 months.  At sentencing, Moore asked the District Court to impose a below-Guidelines sentence in light of our decision in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a> (2005), and the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 disparate treatment of similar amounts of crack and powder cocaine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court refused, saying:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWith regard to the crack and powder cocaine difference, that is the law.  I\xe2\x80\x99m applying the law as it currently stands.  If that is going to be changed, that is a congressional matter.  Congress is the one who looks at the guidelines and decides whether or not they should be put in\xe2\x80\x94in force\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t the judges.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the lawmakers, and I have taken an oath to apply the law, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I will do in this sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 55\xe2\x80\x9356.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe District Court sentenced Moore to 188 months of imprisonment and six years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moore appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction and sentence.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore</em>, 470 F.\xc2\xa03d 767 (2006).  In response to his claim that the District Court should have considered the crack/powder disparity, the Court of Appeals held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court was correct in concluding that \xe2\x80\x98neither <em>Booker</em> nor [18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa73553(a) authorizes district courts to reject\xe2\x80\x99 the powder cocaine to crack cocaine quantity ratio mandated by Congress and reflected in the Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 770 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spears</em>, 469 F.\xc2\xa03d 1166, 1176 (CA8 2006) (en banc)).  Moore filed a petition for certiorari with this Court.  Pet. for Cert. in <em>Moore</em> v. <em>United States</em>, No. 06\xe2\x80\x939749.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Moore\xe2\x80\x99s certiorari petition was pending, this Court issued its opinion in <em>Kimbrough</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), concluding that a judge \xe2\x80\x9cmay consider the disparity between the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses\xe2\x80\x9d when applying 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a), \xe2\x80\x9ceven in a mine-run case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 21).  We granted Moore\xe2\x80\x99s petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of <em>Kimbrough</em>.  <em>Moore</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, without new briefing, the Eighth Circuit affirmed again.  518 F.\xc2\xa03d 577 (2008).  This time, the Court of Appeals concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s there was then no circuit authority to the contrary, we presume the district court was aware that <em>Booker</em> granted it discretion to vary downward based upon the impact of the crack cocaine guidelines on this defendant, but elected not to exercise that discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 580.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proceeding <em>pro se</em>, Moore again petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s new characterization of the transcript is wrong, and that it is \xe2\x80\x9cclear that the district court thought judges had no discre[t]ion to reject\xe2\x80\x9d the Guidelines ratio.  Pet. for Cert. 7.  The United States agrees that the Eighth Circuit erred, see Brief for United States 9, and so do we.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the District Court said that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t isn\xe2\x80\x99t the judges\xe2\x80\x9d but Congress that \xe2\x80\x9clooks at the [G]uidelines and decides whether or not they should be put \xe2\x80\xa6 in force,\xe2\x80\x9d the court showed that it did not think it had the discretion later upheld by <em>Kimbrough</em>.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 56.  The Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s first decision recognized this, describing the District Court as \xe2\x80\x9cconcluding\xe2\x80\x9d (correctly under circuit precedent) that it was not \xe2\x80\x9cauthorize[d] . . . to reject\xe2\x80\x9d the crack/powder disparity.  <em>Moore,</em> 470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 770 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s comments at sentencing, the Court of Appeals should have remanded the case to the District Court for resentencing under <em>Kimbrough</em>.  We express no views on how the District Court should exercise its discretion at resentencing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in</em> <em>forma pauperis </em>are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
