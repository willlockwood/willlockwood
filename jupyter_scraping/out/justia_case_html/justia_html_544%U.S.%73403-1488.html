Cochran, Jr., a California trial court found that petitioner Tory, assisted by petitioner Craft and others, had, <em>inter alia, </em>falsely claimed that Cochran owed him money, picketed Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s office with signs containing insults and obscenities, and pursued Cochran while chanting similar threats and insults, in order to coerce Cochran into paying Tory money to desist from such libelous and slanderous activity.  Because Tory indicated that he would continue to engage in the activity absent a court order, the court permanently enjoined petitioners and their agents from, among other things, picketing, displaying signs, and making oral statements about Cochran and his firm in any public forum. The California Court of Appeal affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari.  After oral argument, Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s counsel informed the Court of Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s death, moved to substitute Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s widow as respondent, and suggested that the case be dismissed as moot.  Petitioners agreed to the substitution, but denied that the case was moot.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s widow is substituted as respondent, but the case is not moot.  Despite Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s death, the injunction remains in effect.  Nothing in its language says to the contrary.  Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s counsel argues that the injunction is still necessary, valid, and enforceable, and no source of California law says that it automatically became invalid upon Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s death.  As this Court understands that law, a person cannot definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a court has ruled that it is.  Given this uncertainty, the injunction here continues significantly to restrain petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 speech, thus presenting an ongoing federal controversy.  Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s death, however, makes it unnecessary for this Court to explore petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 basic claims.  Rather, the Court need only point out that the injunction, as written, has lost its underlying rationale.  Since picketing Cochran and his law offices while engaging in injunction-forbidden speech could no longer coerce Cochran to pay for desisting in this activity, the grounds for the injunction are much diminished or have disappeared altogether.  Consequently the injunction amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking plausible justification.

The state trial court determined that Tory (with the help of petitioner Ruth Craft and others) had engaged in unlawful defamatory activity.  It found, for example, that Tory, while claiming falsely that Cochran owed him money, had complained to the local bar association, had written Cochran threatening letters demanding $10 million, had picketed Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s office holding up signs containing various insults and obscenities; and, with a group of associates, had pursued Cochran while chanting similar threats and insults.  App. 38, 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  The court concluded that Tory\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Cochran owed him money was without foundation, that Tory engaged in a continuous pattern of libelous and slanderous activity, and that Tory had used false and defamatory speech to \xe2\x80\x9ccoerce\xe2\x80\x9d Cochran into paying \xe2\x80\x9camounts of money to which Tory was not entitled\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9ctribute\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cpremium\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cdesisting\xe2\x80\x9d from this libelous and slanderous activity.  <em>Id.</em>, at 39, 42\xe2\x80\x9343.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After noting that Tory had indicated that he would continue to engage in this activity in the absence of a court order, the Superior Court issued a permanent injunction.  The injunction, among other things, prohibited Tory, Craft, and their \xe2\x80\x9cagents\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crepresentatives\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cpicketing,\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cdisplaying signs, placards or other written or printed material,\xe2\x80\x9d and from \xe2\x80\x9corally uttering statements\xe2\x80\x9d about Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., and about Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s law firm in \xe2\x80\x9cany public forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 34.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tory and Craft appealed.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  Tory and Craft then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, raising the following question:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.</p>\n<p align="left">\nWe granted the petition.  542 U. S. ___ (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After oral argument, Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s counsel informed the Court of Johnnie Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s recent death.  Counsel also moved to substitute Johnnie Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s widow, Sylvia Dale Mason Cochran, as respondent, and suggested that we dismiss the case as moot.  Tory and Craft filed a response agreeing to the substitution of Ms. Cochran.  But they denied that the case was moot.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with Tory and Craft that the case is not moot.  Despite Johnnie Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s death, the injunction remains in effect.  Nothing in its language says to the contrary.  Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s counsel tells us that California law does not recognize a \xe2\x80\x9ccause of action for an injury to the memory of a deceased person\xe2\x80\x99s reputation,\xe2\x80\x9d see<em> Kelly</em> v. <em>Johnson Pub. Co.</em>, 160 Cal. App. 2d 718, 325 P.\xc2\xa02d 659 (1958), which circumstance, counsel believes, \xe2\x80\x9cmoots\xe2\x80\x9d a <em>\xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d </em>of the injunction (the portion \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal to Cochran\xe2\x80\x9d).  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Suggestion of Death, etc., 4 (emphasis added).  But counsel adds that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he [i]njunction continues to be necessary, valid and enforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 9.  The parties have not identified, nor have we found, any source of California law that says the injunction here <em>automatically</em> becomes invalid upon Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s death, not even the portion personal to Cochran.  Counsel also points to the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue of\xe2\x80\x9d Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9claw practice\xe2\x80\x9d and adds that his widow has an interest in enforcing the injunction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9412.  And, as we understand California law, a person cannot definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a court has ruled that it is.  See <em>Mason</em> v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.</em>, 60 Cal. App. 2d 587, 591, 141 P.\xc2\xa02d 475, 477\xe2\x80\x93478 (1943)<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here the party served believes\xe2\x80\x9d a court order \xe2\x80\x9cinvalid he should take the proper steps to have it dissolved\xe2\x80\x9d);  <em>People</em> v. <em>Gonzalez</em>, 12 Cal. 4th 804, 818, 910 P.\xc2\xa02d 1366, 1375 (1996) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] person subject to a court\xe2\x80\x99s injunction may elect whether to challenge the constitutional validity of the injunction when it is issued, or to reserve that claim until a violation of the injunction is charged as a contempt of court\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given the uncertainty of California law, we take it as a given that the injunction here continues significantly to restrain petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 speech, presenting an ongoing federal controversy.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dombrowski</em> v. <em>Pfister,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/index.html">380 U. S. 479</a>, 486\xe2\x80\x93487 (1965); <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Button</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/index.html">371 U. S. 415</a>, 432\xe2\x80\x93433 (1963).  Consequently, we need not, and we do not, dismiss this case as moot.  Cf.  <em>Firefighters</em> v. <em>Stotts,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/561/index.html">467 U. S. 561</a>, 569 (1984) (case not moot in part because it appears from \xe2\x80\x9cterms\xe2\x80\x9d of the injunction that it is \xe2\x80\x9cstill in force\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunless set aside must be complied with\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, Johnnie Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s death makes it unnecessary, indeed unwarranted, for us to explore petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 basic claims, namely (1) that the First Amendment forbids the issuance of a permanent injunction in a defamation case, at least when the plaintiff is a public figure, and (2) that the injunction (considered prior to Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s death) was not properly tailored and consequently violated the First Amendment.  See Brief for Petitioners ii, iii.  Rather, we need only point out that the injunction, as written, has now lost its underlying rationale.  Since picketing Cochran and his law offices while engaging in injunction-forbidden speech could no longer achieve the objectives that the trial court had in mind (<em>i.e.</em>, coercing Cochran to pay a \xe2\x80\x9ctribute\xe2\x80\x9d for desisting in this activity), the grounds for the injunction are much diminished, if they have not disappeared altogether.  Consequently the injunction, as written, now amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking plausible justification.  See <em>Nebraska Press Assn.</em> v. <em>Stuart,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/539/index.html">427 U. S. 539</a>, 559 (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]rior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Pittsburgh Press Co.</em> v. <em>Pittsburgh Comm\xe2\x80\x99n on Human Relations,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/376/index.html">413 U.

See <em>Carroll</em> v. <em>President and Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Princess Anne,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/175/index.html">393 U.

We vacate the judgment of the California Court of Appeal, and we remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  If, as the Cochran supplemental brief suggests, injunctive relief may still be warranted, any appropriate party remains free to ask for such relief.

The Court recognizes this, <em>ante</em>, at 3, but nevertheless vacates the judgment below, <em>ante</em>, at 4.  It does so only after deciding, as it must to exercise jurisdiction, that in light of the uncertainty in California law, the case is not moot.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933; <em>ASARCO Inc.</em> v. <em>Kadish,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/605/index.html">490 U. S. 605</a>, 621, n. 1 (1989) (when a case coming from a state court becomes moot, this Court \xe2\x80\x9clack[s] jurisdiction and thus also the power to disturb the state court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>City News &amp; Novelty, Inc.</em> v. <em>Waukesha, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/531/278/index.html">531 U.

Whether the injunction remains valid in these changed circumstances is neither the reason we took this case nor an important question, but merely a matter of case-specific error correction.  Petitioners remain free to seek relief on both constitutional and state-law grounds in the California courts.  And, if the injunction is invalid, they need not obey it: California does not recognize the \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral bar\xe2\x80\x9d rule, and thus permits collateral challenges to injunctions in contempt proceedings.  <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez</em>, 12 Cal. 4th 804, 818, 910 P.\xc2\xa02d 1366, 1375 (1996) (a person subject to an injunction may challenge \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional validity of the injunction when it is issued, or . . . reserve that claim until a violation of the injunction is charged as a contempt of court\xe2\x80\x9d).  The California courts can resolve the matter and, given the new state of affairs, might very well adjudge the case moot or the injunction invalid on state-law grounds rather than the constitutional grounds the Court rushes to embrace.  As a prudential matter, the better course is to avoid passing unnecessarily on the constitutional question.  See <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 345\xe2\x80\x93348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court purports to save petitioners the uncertainty of possible enforcement of the injunction, and thereby to prevent any chill on their First Amendment rights, by vacating the decision below.  But what the Court gives with the left hand it takes with the right, for it only invites further litigation by pronouncing that \xe2\x80\x9cinjunctive relief may still be warranted,\xe2\x80\x9d conceding that \xe2\x80\x9cany appropriate party remains free to ask for such relief,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[ing] no view on the constitutional validity of any such new relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  What the Court means by \xe2\x80\x9cany appropriate party\xe2\x80\x9d is unclear.  Perhaps the Court means Sylvia Dale Mason Cochran, Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s widow, who has taken his place in this suit.  Or perhaps it means the Cochran firm, which has never been a party to this case, but may now (if \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d) intervene and attempt to enjoin the defamation of a now-deceased third party.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision invites the doubts it seeks to avoid.  Its decision is unnecessary and potentially self-defeating.  The more prudent course is to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
