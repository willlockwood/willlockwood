JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The precise issue in this proceeding is whether petitioner, who filed his petition for naturalization two days before the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1101 <em>et seq.,</em> may compel a final hearing on the same before the determination of deportation proceedings instituted after the effective date of the Act and based solely on grounds initiated by that Act.  The "priority provision" of the Act, \xc2\xa7 318, states "no petition for naturalization shall be finally heard . . . if there is pending against the petitioner a deportation proceeding."  66 Stat. 244, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1429. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  But petitioner claims that the savings clause of the Act, \xc2\xa7 405, 66 Stat. 280, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1101, note, which we considered in <em>United States v. Menasche, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/528/case.html">348 U. S. 528</a></span>, preserves his eligibility for citizenship under prior law, and that final hearing thereon cannot be delayed by reason of the pendency of the subsequently instituted deportation action.  Both the trial court, 115 F.Supp. 336, and the Court of Appeals, 210 F.2d 82, decided against the petitioner.  We granted certiorari, 348 U.S. 811, in order to determine the relationship between \xc2\xa7 318 and \xc2\xa7 405 of the 1952 Act.</p>\n<p>On October 1, 1952, petitioner submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service a preliminary application to file a petition for naturalization, Form N-400.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 348 U. S. 542</a></p><p> Following a preliminary examination, he filed his petition for naturalization on December 22, 1952, two days before the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.  The pre-naturalization investigation disclosed that petitioner had a criminal record; he had been convicted of grand larceny in 1913, and of manslaughter in 1915.  Section 241(a) of the 1952 Act subjects aliens to deportation if they are convicted "at any time after entry . . . of two crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct."  66 Stat. 204, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1251(a)(4).  On June 22, 1953, a warrant of arrest was issued against petitioner, based on his 1913 and 1915 convictions, charging as grounds for deportation petitioner\'s presence in the country in violation of \xc2\xa7 241(a)(4).  The deportation proceedings were in progress when, on July 28, 1953, petitioner, through an order to show cause filed in this case, moved to compel a final hearing on his petition for naturalization, and, in the interim, to stay the deportation proceedings.  Relying on \xc2\xa7 318, <em>supra,</em> the district judge denied the motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s main argument is that, under \xc2\xa7 405(a), nothing contained in the new Act,</p>\n<p>"unless otherwise specifically provided therein, shall be construed to affect . . . any status, condition, right in process of acquisition . . . done or existing at the time this Act shall take effect."</p>\n<p>Petitioner was eligible for citizenship under the prior law, and remains eligible under the new Act.  But, under the prior law, petitioner was not deportable.  Petitioner argues that the deportation proceeding, based solely on \xc2\xa7 241(a) of the new Act, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] is adversely affecting a right protected by \xc2\xa7 405(a), to-wit, his inchoate right to citizenship.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 348 U. S. 543</a></p><p> This, he claims, is in direct contravention of the terms of \xc2\xa7 405(a) unless some other section in the Act "otherwise specifically provide[s]."  Section 318, advanced as just such an exception, says, "[n]otwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b) . . . ," and makes no mention of \xc2\xa7 405(a).  Thus, petitioner concludes, \xc2\xa7 318 is not a specific exception to the protection afforded his rights by \xc2\xa7 405(a), and, if he is to vindicate his rights under that section, he must prevail in the present proceedings.</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioner that, absent a specific provision to the contrary, he has rights protected by \xc2\xa7 405(a).  These stem from the filing of his Form N-400, from his petition for naturalization, and, perhaps, from his fulfillment of the five-year residence requirement.  <em>United States v. Menasche, supra.</em>  But we hold that \xc2\xa7 318 specifically excepts rights under the prior law from the protection of \xc2\xa7 405 when these rights stem from a petition for naturalization or from some other step in the naturalization process. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The practice previous to the enactment of a priority provision in the immigration and nationality laws was for both the deportation and naturalization processes to proceed along together until either petitioner\'s deportation or naturalization, <em>ipso facto,</em> terminated the possibility of the other occurring.  <em>See United States v. Waskowski,</em> 158 F.2d 962.  And, in the few instances where deportations were stayed in order to permit aliens to obtain a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 348 U. S. 544</a></p><p> hearing under a recently enacted naturalization provision, the remedy was by habeas corpus after the termination of the deportation proceedings and after a stay had been denied in those proceedings.  <em>United States ex rel. Walther v. District Director of Immigration and Naturalization,</em> 175 F.2d 693; <em>Petition of Kavadias,</em> 177 F.2d 497.  But, as a general rule, stays were not utilized, <em>cf. Klig v. Watkins,</em> 84 F.Supp. 486, and there ensued a race between the alien to gain citizenship and the Attorney General to deport him.  If the alien was successful in forcing a final hearing and the granting of his naturalization petition, the deportation proceedings were completely nullified.  To remedy this situation, the Congress incorporated \xc2\xa7 27 in the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1015, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) \xc2\xa7 729(c).  This section prohibited naturalization or the holding of final hearings on naturalization petitions where deportation proceedings were instituted "under the provisions of this or any other Act."  The 1950 Act took effect immediately, and contained no savings clause, although it introduced new grounds for deportation which were to be retroactively applied.  <em>See Galvan v. Press,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/522/case.html">347 U. S. 522</a></span>.  And, in <em>United States ex rel. Jankowski v. Shaughnessy,</em> 186 F.2d 580, the priority provision -- \xc2\xa7 27 -- was held to apply to naturalization petitions filed before the effective date of the Act even though the deportation proceedings were commenced, as here, under the new statute.</p>\n<p>Section 318 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 reenacted \xc2\xa7 27 in substantially the same form, retaining the language of its predecessor in suspending final hearings on naturalization where deportation proceedings were instituted <em>under this or any other Act.</em>  But petitioner contends that this plain language does not apply to his case, because Congress did not specifically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="545">Page 348 U. S. 545</a></p><p> exempt \xc2\xa7 318 from the operation of the savings clause embodied in \xc2\xa7 405(a), under which his inchoate right to citizenship is preserved.</p>\n<p>It is true that \xc2\xa7 318 begins with the phrase, "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b)," which, at first glance, might indicate that it was intended not to apply to \xc2\xa7 405(a).  But further analysis renders this position untenable.  The same priority section had been inserted as an emergency provision in the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, and had been given immediate prospective and retroactive effect.  It was carried forward almost verbatim as \xc2\xa7 318 in the 1952 Act.  And, to make certain that it would apply to rights existing under petitions for naturalization, the Congress added to \xc2\xa7 318 the phrase "[n]otwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b)," referring to the only part of the savings clause which deals explicitly with the law applicable to naturalization petitions.  The congressional purpose must have been to have \xc2\xa7 318 supersede rights stemming from such petitions, for, under any other interpretation, its previous approach under the 1950 law is unexplainedly reversed, and the "notwithstanding" clause is rendered meaningless.  It may be that the draftsmen could have been more exact in their language, since \xc2\xa7 405(a), as well as \xc2\xa7 405(b), embraces rights under pending petitions, <em>see United States v. Menasche, supra.</em>  But we think their intent is plain enough.</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends that this application of \xc2\xa7 318 will have the result of affording more protection to pre-petition rights of the <em>Menasche</em>-type than to inchoate rights under a petition for naturalization itself, since the former are not embraced within \xc2\xa7 405(b).  But we do not believe \xc2\xa7 318 differentiates between these steps in the process of naturalization.  Each is but part of the whole process leading to citizenship, and each is subject to the provisions of \xc2\xa7 318. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 348 U. S. 546</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Nor can we accept petitioner\'s argument that Congress intended \xc2\xa7 318 to apply only to deportation proceedings based on grounds existing under the prior law.  In making this contention, petitioner gives away nothing and gains nothing.  If the groups for deportation are the same under the prior law as under the new Act, then nothing in the new Act affects petitioner; it is clear that rights under the savings clause have not been infringed, even if there is no specific exception.  Only where something in the new law introduces a change, thereby affecting one\'s status under the old law, is the savings clause called into play.  Only then is a specific exception to \xc2\xa7 405 required.  Thus, if petitioner\'s construction were to prevail, the "notwithstanding" language in \xc2\xa7 318 would be as meaningless as under the interpretation previously advanced and rejected.  The "notwithstanding" clause takes on meaning only when we assume that the new Act has made some change in the law to which the "notwithstanding" statement is noting a specific exception.  That is this case. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The role thus played by \xc2\xa7 405(b) is in substantial accord with the operation of its predecessor, \xc2\xa7 347(b) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1168, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \xc2\xa7 747.  It was pointed out in <em>Menasche, supra,</em> that \xc2\xa7 347(b), with its two-year limitation, was considered to be a special limitation on the rights preserved by subsection (a) of that savings clause.  The two-year period has been deleted in \xc2\xa7 405(b), but the subsection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 348 U. S. 547</a></p><p> remains a special limitation on the broad savings provision, bringing to bear the specific exceptions found in \xc2\xa7 318 and other provisions of the new Act whenever the protection of \xc2\xa7 405(a) is sought for rights connected with the naturalization process. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>In our view, \xc2\xa7 405[b] is the vehicle for applying each of these exceptions to the rights and liabilities emerging from naturalization proceedings under prior law and otherwise preserved by \xc2\xa7 405(a).  In using the "notwithstanding" language in these sections, Congress clearly manifested its intent that certain policies should override the otherwise broad and pervasive principle of the savings clause.  In <em>United States v. Menasche, supra,</em> we recognized the wide scope to be given the savings clause.  We would be lax in our duty if we did not give recognition also to the congressional purpose to override the savings clause when other considerations were thought more compelling </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 348 U. S. 548</a></p><p> than the preservation of <em>the status quo.</em>  If we are not to nullify this clear legislative purpose and render meaningless the "notwithstanding" language of \xc2\xa7 318 and the other sections, we must find for the Government and hold that \xc2\xa7 318 bars petitioner\'s attempt to compel a hearing on his naturalization petition while the deportation proceeding is pending.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The text of this provision, in material part, is as follows:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 318.  . . .
