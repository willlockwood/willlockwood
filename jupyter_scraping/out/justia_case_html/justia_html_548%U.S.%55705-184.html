S. Armed Forces invaded Afghanistan.  During the hostilities, in 2001, militia forces captured petitioner Hamdan, a Yemeni national, and turned him over to the U. S. military, which, in 2002, transported him to prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Over a year later, the President deemed Hamdan eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year, he was charged with conspiracy \xe2\x80\x9cto commit \xe2\x80\xa6 offenses triable by military commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  In habeas and mandamus petitions, Hamdan asserted that the military commission lacks authority to try him because (1) neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for conspiracy, an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war; and (2) the procedures adopted to try him violate basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted habeas relief and stayed the commission\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings, concluding that the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to establish military commissions extends only to offenders or offenses triable by such a commission under the law of war; that such law includes the Third Geneva Convention; that Hamdan is entitled to that Convention\xe2\x80\x99s full protections until adjudged, under it, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified a prisoner of war, the commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801 <em>et seq.</em>, and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  The D. C. Circuit reversed.  Although it declined the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s challenge, cf. <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/738/index.html">420 U. S. 738</a>, the appeals court ruled, on the merits, that Hamdan was not entitled to relief because the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable.  The court also concluded that <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html">317 U. S. 1</a>, foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commission\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, and that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial before the commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor Armed Forces regulations implementing the Geneva Conventions.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">415 F.\xc2\xa03d 33, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts V and VI\xe2\x80\x93D\xe2\x80\x93iv, concluding:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, based on the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), is denied.  DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) provides that \xe2\x80\x9cno court \xe2\x80\xa6 shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider \xe2\x80\xa6 an application for \xe2\x80\xa6 habeas corpus filed by \xe2\x80\xa6 an alien detained \xe2\x80\xa6 at Guantanamo Bay.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1005(h)(2) provides that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71005(e)(2) and (3)\xe2\x80\x94which give the D. C. Circuit \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction to review the final decisions of, respectively, combatant status review tribunals and military commissions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshall apply with respect to any claim whose review is \xe2\x80\xa6 pending on\xe2\x80\x9d the DTA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, as was Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s case.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71005(e)(1) and (h) repeal this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction to review the decision below is rebutted by ordinary principles of statutory construction.  A negative inference may be drawn from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to include \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) within the scope of \xc2\xa71005(h)(2).  Cf., <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 330.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf \xe2\x80\xa6 Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [\xc2\xa71005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in <em>Lindh</em>.  The legislative history shows that Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71005(e)(1), (2), and (3) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive only after having <em>rejected</em> earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within that directive\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of the very language that would have achieved the result the Government urges weighs heavily against the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  See <em>Doe</em> v. <em>Chao,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/614/index.html">540 U. S. 614</a>, 621\xe2\x80\x93623.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Government argues unpersuasively that abstention is appropriate under <em>Councilman,</em> which concluded that, as a matter of comity, federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in pending courts-martial against service members, see 420 U. S., at 740.  Neither of the comity considerations <em>Councilman</em> identified weighs in favor of abstention here.  First, the assertion that military discipline and, therefore, the Armed Forces\xe2\x80\x99 efficient operation, are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts, see <em>id.,</em> at 752, is inapt because Hamdan is not a service member.  Second, the view that federal courts should respect the balance Congress struck when it created \xe2\x80\x9can integrated system of military courts and review procedures\xe2\x80\x9d is inapposite, since the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of that integrated system.  Rather than <em>Councilman,</em> the most relevant precedent is <em>Ex parte Quirin</em>, where the Court, far from abstaining pending the conclusion of ongoing military proceedings, expedited its review because of (1) the public importance of the questions raised, (2) the Court\xe2\x80\x99s duty, in both peace and war, to preserve the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and (3) the public interest in a decision on those questions without delay, 317 U. S. at 19.  The Government has identified no countervailing interest that would permit federal courts to depart from their general duty to exercise the jurisdiction Congress has conferred on them.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by any congressional Act.  <em>Quirin</em> held that Congress had, through Article of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions to try offenders or offenses against the law of war.  317 U. S., at 28.  UCMJ Art. 21, which is substantially identical to the old Art. 15, reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe jurisdiction [of] courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions \xe2\x80\xa6 of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such \xe2\x80\xa6 commissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821.  Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, even <em>Quirin</em> did not view that authorization as a sweeping mandate for the President to invoke military commissions whenever he deems them necessary.  Rather, <em>Quirin</em> recognized that Congress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution and the common law of war, the President already had to convene military commissions\xe2\x80\x94with the express condition that he and those under his command comply with the law of war.  See 317 U. S., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  Neither the AUMF nor the DTA can be read to provide specific, overriding authorization for the commission convened to try Hamdan.  Assuming the AUMF activated the President\xe2\x80\x99s war powers, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/542/507/index.html">542 U. S. 507</a>, and that those powers include authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circumstances, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.</em>, at 518, there is nothing in the AUMF\xe2\x80\x99s text or legislative history even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in UCMJ Art. 21.  Cf. <em>Ex parte Yerger,</em> 8 Wall. 85, 105.  Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this commission.  Although the DTA, unlike either Art. 21 or the AUMF, was enacted after the President convened Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission, it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo Bay.  Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the Constitution and laws, including the law of war.  Absent a more specific congressional authorization, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s task is, as it was in <em>Quirin</em>, to decide whether Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s military commission is so justified.  Pp. 25\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.\xc2\xa0The military commission at issue lacks the power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  Pp. 49\xe2\x80\x9372.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The commission\xe2\x80\x99s procedures, set forth in Commission Order No. 1, provide, among other things, that an accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding the official who appointed the commission or the presiding officer decides to \xe2\x80\x9cclose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Grounds for closure include the protection of classified information, the physical safety of participants and witnesses, the protection of intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities, and \xe2\x80\x9cother national security interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officer\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to the client what took place therein.  Another striking feature is that the rules governing Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission permit the admission of <em>any</em> evidence that, in the presiding officer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, would have probative value to a reasonable person.  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to classified and other \xe2\x80\x9cprotected information,\xe2\x80\x9d so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is \xe2\x80\x9cprobative\xe2\x80\x9d and that its admission without the accused\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair trial.  Pp. 49\xe2\x80\x9352.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Government objects to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of a procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds, <em>inter alia,</em> that Hamdan will be able to raise such a challenge following a final decision under the DTA, and that there is no basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that it will not be conducted in good faith and according to law.  These contentions are unsound.  First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a prison sentence shorter than 10 years, he has no automatic right to federal-court review of the commission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d under DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(3).  Second, there <em>is</em> a basis to presume that the procedures employed during Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial will violate the law: He will be, and <em>indeed already has been</em>, excluded from his own trial.  Thus, review of the procedures in advance of a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d is appropriate.  Pp. 52\xe2\x80\x9353. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Because UCMJ Article 36 has not been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission trial are illegal.  The procedures governing such trials historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  Although this uniformity principle is not inflexible and does not preclude all departures from courts-martial procedures, any such departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  That understanding is reflected in Art. 36(b), which provides that the procedural rules the President promulgates for courts-martial and military commissions alike must be \xe2\x80\x9cuniform insofar as practicable,\xe2\x80\x9d 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836(b).  The \xe2\x80\x9cpracticability\xe2\x80\x9d determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial.  The President here has determined, pursuant to the requirement of <em>Art. 36(a),</em> that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts\xe2\x80\x9d to Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission.  The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial.  And even if subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements could be satisfied without an official practicability determination, that subsection\xe2\x80\x99s requirements are not satisfied here.  Nothing in the record demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules here.  There is no suggestion, <em>e.g.,</em> of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  It is not evident why the danger posed by international terrorism, considerable though it is, should require, in the case of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial, any variance from the courts-martial rules.  The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: The right to be present.  See 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7839(c).  Because the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as \xe2\x80\x9cpracticable,\xe2\x80\x9d the courts-martial rules must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Art. 36(b).

Circuit dismissed Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s challenge in this regard on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Conventions are not judicially enforceable and that, in any event, Hamdan is not entitled to their protections.  Neither of these grounds is persuasive.  Pp. 62\xe2\x80\x9368.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The appeals court relied on a statement in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/index.html">339 U. S. 763</a>, 789, n.\xc2\xa014, suggesting that this Court lacked power even to consider the merits of a Convention argument because the political and military authorities had sole responsibility for observing and enforcing prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 rights under the Convention.  However, <em>Eisentrager</em> does not control here because, regardless of the nature of the rights conferred on Hamdan, cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rauscher,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/119/407/index.html">119 U. S. 407</a>, they are indisputably part of the law of war, see <em>Hamdi, </em>542 U. S., at 520\xe2\x80\x93521, compliance with which is the condition upon which UCMJ Art. 21 authority is granted.  Pp. 63\xe2\x80\x9365.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Alternatively, the appeals court agreed with the Government that the Conventions do not apply because Hamdan was captured during the war with al Qaeda, which is not a Convention signatory, and that conflict is distinct from the war with signatory Afghanistan.  The Court need not decide the merits of this argument because there is at least one provision of the Geneva Conventions that applies here even if the relevant conflict is not between signatories. Common Article 3, which appears in all four Conventions, provides that, in a \xe2\x80\x9cconflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties [<em>i.e.,</em> signatories], each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum,\xe2\x80\x9d certain provisions protecting \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ersons \xe2\x80\xa6 placed <em>hors de combat</em> by \xe2\x80\xa6 detention,\xe2\x80\x9d including a prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cthe passing of sentences \xe2\x80\xa6 without previous judgment \xe2\x80\xa6 by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees \xe2\x80\xa6 recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit ruled Common Article 3 inapplicable to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda is international in scope and thus not a \xe2\x80\x9cconflict not of an international character.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  That reasoning is erroneous.  That the quoted phrase bears its literal meaning and is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations is demonstrated by Common Article 2, which limits its own application to any armed conflict between signatories and provides that signatories must abide by all terms of the Conventions even if another party to the conflict is a nonsignatory, so long as the nonsignatory \xe2\x80\x9caccepts and applies\xe2\x80\x9d those terms.  Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict \xe2\x80\x9cin the territory of\xe2\x80\x9d a signatory.  The latter kind of conflict does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories or not).

At a minimum, a military commission can be \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d only if some practical need explains deviations from court-martial practice.  No such need has been demonstrated here.

The commission convened to try Hamdan does not meet those requirements.

P. 72.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts V and VI\xe2\x80\x93D\xe2\x80\x93iv:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Government has not charged Hamdan with an \xe2\x80\x9coffense \xe2\x80\xa6 that by the law of war may be tried by military commission,\xe2\x80\x9d 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821.  Of the three sorts of military commissions used historically, the law-of-war type used in <em>Quirin </em>and other cases is the only model available to try Hamdan.  Among the preconditions, incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, UCMJ Art. 21, for such a tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction are, <em>inter alia, </em>that it must be limited to trying offenses committed within the convening commander\xe2\x80\x99s field of command, <em>i.e., </em>within the theater of war, and that the offense charged must have been committed during, not before or after, the war.  Here, Hamdan is not alleged to have committed any overt act in a theater of war or on any specified date after September 11, 2001.  More importantly, the offense alleged is not triable by law-of-war military commission.  Although the common law of war may render triable by military commission certain offenses not defined by statute, <em>Quirin, </em>317 U. S., at 30, the precedent for doing so with respect to a particular offense must be plain and unambiguous, cf., <em>e.g., Loving</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/748/index.html">517 U. S. 748</a>, 771.  That burden is far from satisfied here.  The crime of \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d has rarely if ever been tried as such in this country by any law-of-war military commission not exercising some other form of jurisdiction, and does not appear in either the Geneva Conventions or the Hague Conventions\xe2\x80\x94the major treaties on the law of war.  Moreover, that conspiracy is not a recognized violation of the law of war is confirmed by other international sources, including, <em>e.g., </em>the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, which pointedly refused to recognize conspiracy to commit war crimes as such a violation.  Because the conspiracy charge does not support the commission\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.

The procedures adopted to try Hamdan deviate from those governing courts-martial in ways not justified by practical need, and thus fail to afford the requisite guarantees.  Moreover, various provisions of Commission Order No. 1 dispense with the principles, which are indisputably part of customary international law, that an accused must, absent disruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial and must be privy to the evidence against him.

In November 2001, during hostilities between the United States and the Taliban (which then governed Afghanistan), Hamdan was captured by militia forces and turned over to the U. S. military.  In June 2002, he was transported to Guantanamo Bay.  Over a year later, the President deemed him eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year had passed, Hamdan was charged with one count of conspiracy \xe2\x80\x9cto commit \xe2\x80\xa6 offenses triable by military commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus to challenge the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s intended means of prosecuting this charge.  He concedes that a court-martial constituted in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801 <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try him.  His objection is that the military commission the President has convened lacks such authority, for two principal reasons: First, neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for the crime of conspiracy\xe2\x80\x94an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war.  Second, Hamdan contends, the procedures that the President has adopted to try him violate the most basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s request for a writ of habeas corpus.  344 F. Supp. 2d 152 (DC 2004).  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  415 F.\xc2\xa03d 33 (2005).  Recognizing, as we did over a half-century ago, that trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure, <em>Ex\xc2\xa0parte Quirin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html">317 U.

S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the military commission convened to try Hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions.  Four of us also conclude, see Part V, <em>infra</em>, that the offense with which Hamdan has been charged is not an \xe2\x80\x9coffens[e] that by \xe2\x80\xa6 the law of war may be tried by military commissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  10  U.

Americans will never forget the devastation wrought by these acts.  Nearly 3,000 civilians were killed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress responded by adopting a Joint Resolution authorizing the President to \xe2\x80\x9cuse all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks \xe2\x80\xa6 in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), 115 Stat. 224, note following 50 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71541 (2000 ed., Supp. III).  Acting pursuant to the AUMF, and having determined that the Taliban regime had supported al Qaeda, the President ordered the Armed Forces of the United States to invade Afghanistan.  In the ensuing hostilities, hundreds of individuals, Hamdan among them, were captured and eventually detained at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 13, 2001, while the United States was still engaged in active combat with the Taliban, the President issued a comprehensive military order intended to govern the \xe2\x80\x9cDetention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d 66 Fed. Reg. 57833 (hereinafter November 13 Order or Order).  Those subject to the November 13 Order include any noncitizen for whom the President determines \xe2\x80\x9cthere is reason to believe\xe2\x80\x9d that he or she (1) \xe2\x80\x9cis or was\xe2\x80\x9d a member of al Qaeda or (2) has engaged or participated in terrorist activities aimed at or harmful to the United States.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57834.  Any such individual \xe2\x80\x9cshall, when tried, be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law, including imprisonment or death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The November 13 Order vested in the Secretary of Defense the power to appoint military commissions to try individuals subject to the Order, but that power has since been delegated to John D. Altenberg, Jr., a retired Army major general and longtime military lawyer who has been designated \xe2\x80\x9cAppointing Authority for Military Commissions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On July 3, 2003, the President announced his determination that Hamdan and five other detainees at Guantanamo Bay were subject to the November 13 Order and thus triable by military commission.  In December 2003, military counsel was appointed to represent Hamdan.  Two months later, counsel filed demands for charges and for a speedy trial pursuant to Article 10 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7810.  On February 23, 2004, the legal adviser to the Appointing Authority denied the applications, ruling that Hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of the UCMJ.  Not until July 13, 2004, after Hamdan had commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, did the Government finally charge him with the offense for which, a year earlier, he had been deemed eligible for trial by military commission.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The charging document, which is unsigned, contains 13 numbered paragraphs.  The first two paragraphs recite the asserted bases for the military commission\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94namely, the November 13 Order and the President\xe2\x80\x99s July 3, 2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible for trial by military commission.  The next nine paragraphs, collectively entitled \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Allegations,\xe2\x80\x9d describe al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s activities from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and identify Osama bin Laden as the group\xe2\x80\x99s leader.  Hamdan is not mentioned in these paragraphs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Only the final two paragraphs, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cCharge: Conspiracy,\xe2\x80\x9d contain allegations against Hamdan.  Paragraph 12 charges that \xe2\x80\x9cfrom on or about February 1996 to on or about November 24, 2001,\xe2\x80\x9d Hamdan \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose and conspired and agreed with [named members of al Qaeda] to commit the following offenses triable by military commission: attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.  There is no allegation that Hamdan had any command responsibilities, played a leadership role, or participated in the planning of any activity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Paragraph 13 lists four \xe2\x80\x9covert acts\xe2\x80\x9d that Hamdan is alleged to have committed sometime between 1996 and November 2001 in furtherance of the \xe2\x80\x9centerprise and conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d: (1) he acted as Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbodyguard and personal driver,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbeliev[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d all the while that bin Laden \xe2\x80\x9cand his associates were involved in\xe2\x80\x9d terrorist acts prior to and including the attacks of September 11, 2001; (2) he arranged for transportation of, and actually transported, weapons used by al Qaeda members and by bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s bodyguards (Hamdan among them); (3) he \xe2\x80\x9cdrove or accompanied [O]sama bin Laden to various al Qaida-sponsored training camps, press conferences, or lectures,\xe2\x80\x9d at which bin Laden encouraged attacks against Americans; and (4) he received weapons training at al Qaeda-sponsored camps.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65a\xe2\x80\x9367a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After this formal charge was filed, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington transferred Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s habeas and mandamus petitions to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Meanwhile, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) convened pursuant to a military order issued on July 7, 2004, decided that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s continued detention at Guantanamo Bay was warranted because he was an \xe2\x80\x9cenemy combatant.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Separately, proceedings before the military commission commenced.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court granted Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s petition for habeas corpus and stayed the commission\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings.  It concluded that the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to establish military commissions extends only to \xe2\x80\x9coffenders or offenses triable by military [commission] under the law of war,\xe2\x80\x9d 344 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 158; that the law of war includes the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, T. I. A. S. No. 3364 (Third Geneva Convention); that Hamdan is entitled to the full protections of the Third Geneva Convention until adjudged, in compliance with that treaty, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified as a prisoner of war, the military commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  344 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 158\xe2\x80\x93172.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the District of\xc2\xa0Columbia Circuit reversed.  Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s challenge.  Cf. <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html">420 U. S. 738</a> (1975).  On the merits, the panel rejected the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s further conclusion that Hamdan was entitled to relief under the Third Geneva Convention.  All three judges agreed that the Geneva Conventions were not \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially enforceable,\xe2\x80\x9d 415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 38, and two thought that the Conventions did not in any event apply to Hamdan, <em>id.</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9342; but see <em>id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  In other portions of its opinion, the court concluded that our decision in <em>Quirin</em> foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commission\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, and held that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial before the contemplated commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor U. S. Armed Forces regulations intended to implement the Geneva Conventions.  415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 38, 42\xe2\x80\x9343.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 7, 2005, we granted certiorari to decide whether the military commission convened to try Hamdan has authority to do so, and whether Hamdan may rely on the Geneva Conventions in these proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 13, 2006, the Government filed a motion to dismiss the writ of certiorari.  The ground cited for dismissal was the recently enacted Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109\xe2\x80\x93148, 119 Stat. 2739.  We postponed our ruling on that motion pending argument on the merits, 546 U. S. ___ (2006), and now deny it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The DTA, which was signed into law on December 30, 2005, addresses a broad swath of subjects related to detainees.  It places restrictions on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U. S. custody, and it furnishes procedural protections for U. S. personnel accused of engaging in improper interrogation.  DTA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71002\xe2\x80\x931004, 119 Stat. 2739\xe2\x80\x932740.  It also sets forth certain \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures for status review of detainees outside the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71005, <em>id.</em>, at 2740.  Subsections (a) through (d) of \xc2\xa71005 direct the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the procedures being used by CSRTs to determine the proper classification of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to adopt certain safeguards as part of those procedures.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsection (e) of \xc2\xa71005, which is entitled \xe2\x80\x9cJudicial Review of Detention of Enemy Combatants,\xe2\x80\x9d supplies the basis for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional argument.

Accordingly, it argues, we lack jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision below.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional and statutory grounds.  Principal among his constitutional arguments is that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s preferred reading raises grave questions about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to impinge upon this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.  Support for this argument is drawn from <em>Ex parte Yerger,</em> 8 Wall. 85 (1869), in which, having explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe denial to this court of appellate jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to consider an original writ of habeas corpus would \xe2\x80\x9cgreatly weaken the efficacy of the writ,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 102\xe2\x80\x93103, we held that Congress would not be presumed to have effected such denial absent an unmistakably clear statement to the contrary.  See <em>id.</em>, at 104\xe2\x80\x93105; see also <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/651/index.html">518 U. S. 651</a> (1996);<em> Durousseau</em> v. <em>United States,</em> 6 Cranch 307, 314 (1810) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (The \xe2\x80\x9cappellate powers of this court\xe2\x80\x9d are not created by statute but are \xe2\x80\x9cgiven by the constitution\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Klein,</em> 13 Wall. 128 (1872).  Cf. <em>Ex parte McCardle,</em> 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (holding that Congress had validly foreclosed one avenue of appellate review where its repeal of habeas jurisdiction, reproduced in the margin,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] could not have been \xe2\x80\x9ca plainer instance of positive exception\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hamdan also suggests that, if the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading is correct, Congress has unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find it unnecessary to reach either of these arguments.  Ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice to rebut the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory\xe2\x80\x94at least insofar as this case, which was pending at the time the DTA was enacted, is concerned.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government acknowledges that only paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (e) are expressly made applicable to pending cases, see \xc2\xa71005(h)(2), 119 Stat. 2743\xe2\x80\x932744, but argues that the omission of paragraph (1) from the scope of that express statement is of no moment.  This is so, we are told, because Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to expressly reserve federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over pending cases erects a presumption against jurisdiction, and that presumption is rebutted by neither the text nor the legislative history of the DTA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first part of this argument is not entirely without support in our precedents.  We have in the past \xe2\x80\x9capplied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/244/index.html">511 U.

But the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption\xe2\x80\x94viz., the presumption against retroactivity\xe2\x80\x94in certain limited circumstances.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  If a statutory provision \xe2\x80\x9cwould operate retroactively\xe2\x80\x9d as applied to cases pending at the time the provision was enacted, then \xe2\x80\x9cour traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 280.  We have explained, however, that, unlike other intervening changes in the law, a jurisdiction-conferring or jurisdiction&amp;nbhyph;stripping statute usually \xe2\x80\x9ctakes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hallowell</em>, 239 U. S., at 508.  If that is truly all the statute does, no retroactivity problem arises because the change in the law does not \xe2\x80\x9cimpair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\xe2\x80\x99s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 280.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  And if a new rule has no retroactive effect, the presumption against retroactivity will not prevent its application to a case that was already pending when the new rule was enacted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That does not mean, however, that all jurisdiction-stripping provisions\xe2\x80\x94or even all such provisions that truly lack retroactive effect\xe2\x80\x94must apply to cases pending at the time of their enactment.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]ormal rules of construction,\xe2\x80\x9d including a contextual reading of the statutory language, may dictate otherwise.  <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 326 (1997).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  A familiar principle of statutory construction, relevant both in <em>Lindh</em> and here, is that a negative inference may be drawn from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute.  See <em>id.</em>, at 330; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U.

The Court in <em>Lindh</em> relied on this reasoning to conclude that certain limitations on the availability of habeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to cases filed after that statute\xe2\x80\x99s effective date.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to identify the temporal reach of those limitations, which governed noncapital cases, stood in contrast to its express command in the same legislation that new rules governing habeas petitions in capital cases \xe2\x80\x9capply to cases pending on or after the date of enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7107(c), 110 Stat. 1226; see <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329\xe2\x80\x93330.  That contrast, combined with the fact that the amendments at issue \xe2\x80\x9caffect[ed] substantive entitlement to relief,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 327, warranted drawing a negative inference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A like inference follows <em>a fortiori </em>from <em>Lindh</em> in this case.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf \xe2\x80\xa6 Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [\xc2\xa71005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in <em>Lindh</em>.  In <em>Lindh</em>, the provisions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but were later \xe2\x80\x9cjoined together and \xe2\x80\xa6 considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 330.  We observed that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 tandem review and approval of the two sets of provisions strengthened the presumption that the relevant omission was deliberate.  <em>Id.</em>, at 331; see also <em>Field</em> v. <em>Mans,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/59/index.html">516 U.

Here, Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (e) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive that paragraphs (2) and (3) apply to pending cases only after having <em>rejected</em> earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within the scope of that directive.  Compare DTA \xc2\xa71005(h)(2), 119 Stat. 2743\xe2\x80\x932744, with 151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005) (S.

First, it asserts that <em>Lindh</em> is inapposite because \xe2\x80\x9cSection 1005(e)(1) and (h)(1) remove jurisdiction, while Section 1005(e)(2), (3) and (h)(2) create an exclusive review mechanism and define the nature of that review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Motion to Dismiss 4.  Because the provisions being contrasted \xe2\x80\x9caddress wholly distinct subject matters,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Hadix, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/343/index.html">527 U. S. 343</a>, 356 (1999), the Government argues, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 different treatment of them is of no significance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument must fail because it rests on a false distinction between the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d nature of subsection (e)(1) and the \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural\xe2\x80\x9d character of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3).  In truth, all three provisions govern jurisdiction over detainees\xe2\x80\x99 claims; subsection (e)(1) addresses jurisdiction in habeas cases and other actions \xe2\x80\x9crelating to any aspect of the detention,\xe2\x80\x9d while subsections (e)(2) and (3) vest exclusive,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] but limited, <em>jurisdiction</em> in the Court of Appeals for the District of\xc2\xa0Columbia Circuit to review \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of CSRTs and military commissions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That subsection (e)(1) strips jurisdiction while subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) restore it in limited form is hardly a distinction upon which a negative inference must founder.  Justice Scalia, in arguing to the contrary, maintains that Congress had \xe2\x80\x9cample reason\xe2\x80\x9d to provide explicitly for application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending cases because \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction-stripping\xe2\x80\x9d provisions like subsection (e)(1) have been treated differently under our retroactivity jurisprudence than \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction-conferring\xe2\x80\x9d ones like subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3).  <em>Post</em>, at 8 (dissenting opinion); see also Reply Brief in Support of Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Motion to Dismiss 5\xe2\x80\x936.  That theory is insupportable.  Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) \xe2\x80\x9cconfer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit) where there was none before,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 8 (emphasis in original); but see <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/542/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/466/index.html">542 U.

The provisions impose no additional liability or obligation on any private party or even on the United States, unless one counts the burden of litigating an appeal\xe2\x80\x94a burden not a single one of our cases suggests triggers retroactivity concerns.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Moreover, it strains credulity to suggest that the desire to reinforce the application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending cases drove Congress to <em>exclude</em> subsection (e)(1) from \xc2\xa71005(h)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s second objection is that applying subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) but not (e)(1) to pending cases \xe2\x80\x9cproduces an absurd result\xe2\x80\x9d because it grants (albeit only temporarily) dual jurisdiction over detainees\xe2\x80\x99 cases in circumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the District of Columbia Circuit will have \xe2\x80\x9c<em>exclusive</em>\xe2\x80\x9d and immediate jurisdiction over such cases.  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Motion to Dismiss 7.  But the premise here is faulty; subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant jurisdiction only over actions to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine the validity of any final decision\xe2\x80\x9d of a CSRT or commission.  Because Hamdan, at least, is not contesting any \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d of a CSRT or military commission, his action does not fall within the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3).  There is, then, no absurdity.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s more general suggestion that Congress can have had no good reason for preserving habeas jurisdiction over cases that had been brought by detainees prior to enactment of the DTA not only is belied by the legislative history, see n. 10, <em>supra</em>, but is otherwise without merit.  There is nothing absurd about a scheme under which pending habeas actions\xe2\x80\x94particularly those, like this one, that challenge the very legitimacy of the tribunals whose judgments Congress would like to have reviewed\xe2\x80\x94are preserved, and more routine challenges to final decisions rendered by those tribunals are carefully channeled to a particular court and through a particular lens of review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we cannot leave unaddressed Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s contentions that the \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning of \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) is entirely clear,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 6, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment\xe2\x80\x94in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 3 (emphasis in original).  Only by treating the <em>Bruner</em> rule as an inflexible trump (a thing it has never been, see n. 7, <em>supra</em>) and ignoring both the rest of \xc2\xa71005\xe2\x80\x99s text and its drafting history can one conclude as much.  Congress here expressly provided that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applied to pending cases.  It chose not to so provide\xe2\x80\x94after having been presented with the option\xe2\x80\x94for subsection (e)(1).  The omission is an integral part of the statutory scheme that muddies whatever \xe2\x80\x9cplain meaning\xe2\x80\x9d may be discerned from blinkered study of subsection (e)(1) alone.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s speculation about what Congress might have intended by the omission not only is counterfactual, cf. n. 10, <em>supra</em> (recounting legislative history), but rests on both a misconstruction of the DTA and an erroneous view our precedents, see <em>supra</em>, at 17, and n. 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we deny the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on our decision in <em>Councilman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html">420 U.

He neither questioned the lawfulness of courts-martial or their procedures nor disputed that, as a serviceman, he was subject to court-martial jurisdiction.  His sole argument was that the subject matter of his case did not fall within the scope of court-martial authority.  See <em>id.</em>, at 741, 759.  The District Court granted his request for injunctive relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari and reversed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 761.  We did not reach the merits of whether the marijuana charges were sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cservice connected\xe2\x80\x9d to place them within the subject-matter jurisdiction of a court-martial.  Instead, we concluded that, as a matter of comity, federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in pending court-martial proceedings against members of the Armed Forces,[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and further that there was nothing in the particular circumstances of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s case to displace that general rule.

First, military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts.  See <em>Councilman</em>, 420 U. S., at 752.  Second, federal courts should respect the balance that Congress struck between military preparedness and fairness to individual service members when it created \xe2\x80\x9can integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals, consisting of civilian judges \xe2\x80\x98completely removed from all military influence or persuasion\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 758 (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R.

Just as abstention in the face of ongoing state criminal proceedings is justified by our expectation that state courts will enforce federal rights, so abstention in the face of ongoing court-martial proceedings is justified by our expectation that the military court system established by Congress\xe2\x80\x94with its substantial procedural protections and provision for appellate review by independent civilian judges\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwill vindicate servicemen\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights,\xe2\x80\x9d 420 U.

Unlike the officer in <em>Councilman</em>,<em> </em>Hamdan has no right to appeal any conviction to the civilian judges of the Court of Military Appeals (now called the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, see Pub. L. 103\xe2\x80\x93337, 108 Stat. 2831).  Instead, under Dept. of Defense Military Commission Order No. 1 (Commission Order No. 1), which was issued by the President on March 21, 2002, and amended most recently on August 31, 2005, and which governs the procedures for Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission, any conviction would be reviewed by a panel consisting of three military officers designated by the Secretary of Defense.  Commission Order No. 1 \xc2\xa76(H)(4).  Commission Order No. 1 provides that appeal of a review panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, \xc2\xa76(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, \xc2\xa76(H)(6).[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have no doubt that the various individuals assigned review power under Commission Order No. 1 would strive to act impartially and ensure that Hamdan receive all protections to which he is entitled.  Nonetheless, these review bodies clearly lack the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and thus bear insufficient conceptual similarity to state courts to warrant invocation of abstention principles.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, neither of the two comity considerations underlying our decision to abstain in <em>Councilman</em> applies to the circumstances of this case.  Instead, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Quirin</em> is the most relevant precedent.  In <em>Quirin</em>, seven German saboteurs were captured upon arrival by submarine in New York and Florida.  317 U. S., at 21.  The President convened a military commission to try the saboteurs, who then filed habeas corpus petitions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging their trial by commission.  We granted the saboteurs\xe2\x80\x99 petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judgment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 19.  Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.  That course of action was warranted, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n view of the public importance of the questions raised by [the cases] and of the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court of Appeals here recognized, <em>Quirin </em>\xe2\x80\x9cprovides a compelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to interrupt the processes of military commissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 36.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The circumstances of this case, like those in <em>Quirin</em>, simply do not implicate the \xe2\x80\x9cobligations of comity\xe2\x80\x9d that, under appropriate circumstances, justify abstention.  <em>Quackenbush</em> v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/706/index.html">517 U. S. 706</a>, 733 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Government has identified no other \xe2\x80\x9cimportant countervailing interest\xe2\x80\x9d that would permit federal courts to depart from their general \xe2\x80\x9cduty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 716 (majority opinion).  To the contrary, Hamdan and the Government both have a compelling interest in knowing in advance whether Hamdan may be tried by a military commission that arguably is without any basis in law and operates free from many of the procedural rules prescribed by Congress for courts-martial\xe2\x80\x94rules intended to safeguard the accused and ensure the reliability of any conviction.  While we certainly do not foreclose the possibility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases seeking review of ongoing military commission proceedings (such as military commissions convened on the battlefield), the foregoing discussion makes clear that, under our precedent, abstention is not justified here.  We therefore proceed to consider the merits of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s challenge.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The military commission, a tribunal neither mentioned in the Constitution nor created by statute, was born of military necessity.  See W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).  Though foreshadowed in some respects by earlier tribunals like the Board of General Officers that General Washington convened to try British Major John Andr\xc3\xa9 for spying during the Revolutionary War, the commission \xe2\x80\x9cas such\xe2\x80\x9d was inaugurated in 1847.  <em>Id.</em>, at 832; G. Davis, A Treatise on the Military Law of the United States 308 (2d ed. 1909) (hereinafter Davis).  As commander of occupied Mexican territory, and having available to him no other tribunal, General Winfield Scott that year ordered the establishment of both \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>military commissions</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to try ordinary crimes committed in the occupied territory and a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>council of war</em>\xe2\x80\x9d to try offenses against the law of war.  Winthrop 832 (emphases in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for use of military commissions, during the Civil War, the dual system favored by General Scott was not adopted.  Instead, a single tribunal often took jurisdiction over ordinary crimes, war crimes, and breaches of military orders alike.  As further discussed below, each aspect of that seemingly broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by a separate military exigency.  Generally, though, the need for military commissions during this period\xe2\x80\x94as during the Mexican War\xe2\x80\x94was driven largely by the then very limited jurisdiction of courts-martial: \xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>occasion</em> for the military commission arises principally from the fact that the jurisdiction of the court-martial proper, in our law, is restricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the military force and to certain specific offences defined in a written code.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 831 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exigency alone, of course, will not justify the establishment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by Article I, \xc2\xa78 and Article\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa71 of the Constitution unless some other part of that document authorizes a response to the felt need.  See <em>Ex parte Milligan</em>, 4 Wall. 2, 121 (1866) (\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly no part of the judicial power of the country was conferred on [military commissions]\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Ex parte Vallandigham,</em> 1 Wall. 243, 251 (1864); see also <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 25 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress and the President, like the courts, possess no power not derived from the Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d).  And that authority, if it exists, can derive only from the powers granted jointly to the President and Congress in time of war.

Congress cannot direct the conduct of campaigns, nor can the President, or any commander under him, without the sanction of Congress, institute tribunals for the trial and punishment of offences, either of soldiers or civilians, unless in cases of a controlling necessity, which justifies what it compels, or at least insures acts of indemnity from the justice of the legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Wall., at 139\xe2\x80\x93140.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether Chief Justice Chase was correct in suggesting that the President may constitutionally convene military commissions \xe2\x80\x9cwithout the sanction of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d in cases of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling necessity\xe2\x80\x9d is a question this Court has not answered definitively, and need not answer today.  For we held in Quirin </em>that Congress had, through Article of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions in such circumstances.  317 U. S., at 28 (\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Articles of War, and especially Article 15, Congress has explicitly provided, so far as it may constitutionally do so, that military tribunals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses against the law of war in appropriate cases\xe2\x80\x9d).  Article 21 of the UCMJ, the language of which is substantially identical to the old Article 15 and was preserved by Congress after World War II,[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] reads as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cJurisdiction of courts-martial not exclusive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of this code conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such military commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d  64 Stat. 115.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have no occasion to revisit <em>Quirin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s controversial characterization of Article of War 15 as congressional authorization for military commissions.  Cf. Brief for Legal Scholars and Historians as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 12\xe2\x80\x9315.  Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, however, even <em>Quirin</em> did not view the authorization as a sweeping mandate for the President to \xe2\x80\x9cinvoke military commissions when he deems them necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 17.  Rather, the <em>Quirin</em> Court recognized that Congress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution and the common law of war, the President had had before 1916 to convene military commissions\xe2\x80\x94with the express condition that the President and those under his command comply with the law of war.  See 317 U. S., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  That much is evidenced by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry, <em>following</em> its conclusion that Congress had authorized military commissions, into whether the law of war had indeed been complied with in that case.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government would have us dispense with the inquiry that the <em>Quirin</em> Court undertook and find in either the AUMF or the DTA specific, overriding authorization for the very commission that has been convened to try Hamdan.  Neither of these congressional Acts, however, expands the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to convene military commissions.  First, while we assume that the AUMF activated the President\xe2\x80\x99s war powers, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/542/507/index.html">542 U. S. 507</a> (2004) (plurality opinion), and that those powers include the authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circumstances, see <em>id.</em>, at 518; <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329; see also <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U. S., at 11, there is nothing in the text or legislative history of the AUMF even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in Article 21 of the UCMJ.  Cf. <em>Yerger,</em> 8 Wall., at 105 (\xe2\x80\x9cRepeals by implication are not favored\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this commission.  Although the DTA, unlike either Article 21 or the AUMF, was enacted after the President had convened Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission, it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo Bay.  The DTA obviously \xe2\x80\x9crecognize[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the existence of the Guantanamo Bay commissions in the weakest sense, Brief for Respondents 15, because it references some of the military orders governing them and creates limited judicial review of their \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision[s],\xe2\x80\x9d DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743.  But the statute also pointedly reserves judgment on whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable\xe2\x80\x9d in reviewing such decisions and whether, if they are, the \xe2\x80\x9cstandards and procedures\xe2\x80\x9d used to try Hamdan and other detainees actually violate the \xe2\x80\x9cConstitution and laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the \xe2\x80\x9cConstitution and laws,\xe2\x80\x9d including the law of war.  Absent a more specific congressional authorization, the task of this Court is, as it was in <em>Quirin</em>, to decide whether Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s military commission is so justified.  It is to that inquiry we now turn.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common law governing military commissions may be gleaned from past practice and what sparse legal precedent exists.  Commissions historically have been used in three situations.  See Bradley &amp; Goldsmith, Congressional Authorization and the War on Terrorism, 118 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 2048, 2132\xe2\x80\x932133 (2005); Winthrop 831\xe2\x80\x93846; Hearings on H.\xc2\xa0R. 2498 before the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Armed Services, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 975 (1949).  First, they have substituted for civilian courts at times and in places where martial law has been declared.  Their use in these circumstances has raised constitutional questions, see <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Kahanamoku,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/304/index.html"></a><a href="/us/327/304/index.html">327 U. S. 304</a> (1946); <em>Milligan</em>, 4 Wall., at 121\xe2\x80\x93122, but is well recognized.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  See Winthrop 822, 836\xe2\x80\x93839.  Second, commissions have been established to try civilians \xe2\x80\x9cas part of a temporary military government over occupied enemy territory or territory regained from an enemy where civilian government cannot and does not function.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em>, 327 U.

Illustrative of this second kind of commission is the one that was established, with jurisdiction to apply the German Criminal Code, in occupied Germany following the end of World War II.  See <em>Madsen</em> v. <em>Kinsella,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/341/index.html">343 U. S. 341</a>, 356 (1952).[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third type of commission, convened as an \xe2\x80\x9cincident to the conduct of war\xe2\x80\x9d when there is a need \xe2\x80\x9cto seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329, has been described as \xe2\x80\x9cutterly different\xe2\x80\x9d from the other two.  Bickers, Military Commissions are Constitutionally Sound: A Response to Professors Katyal and Tribe, 34 Tex. Tech.

The last time the U. S. Armed Forces </p>\n<p align="left">used the law-of-war military commission was during World War II.  In <em>Quirin</em>, this Court sanctioned President Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s use of such a tribunal to try Nazi saboteurs captured on American soil during the War.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html">317 U.

That is both appropriate and unsurprising.  Since Guantanamo Bay is neither enemy-occupied territory nor under martial law, the law-of-war commission is the only model available.  At the same time, no more robust model of executive power exists; <em>Quirin</em> represents the high-water mark of military power to try enemy combatants for war crimes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The classic treatise penned by Colonel William Winthrop, whom we have called \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98Blackstone of Military Law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Reid</em> v. <em>Covert,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/1/index.html">354 U. S. 1</a>, 19, n.\xc2\xa038 (1957) (plurality opinion), describes at least four preconditions for exercise of jurisdiction by a tribunal of the type convened to try Hamdan.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] military commission, (except where otherwise authorized by statute), can legally assume jurisdiction only of offenses committed within the field of the command of the convening commander.\xe2\x80\x9d  Winthrop 836.  The \xe2\x80\x9cfield of command\xe2\x80\x9d in these circumstances means the \xe2\x80\x9ctheatre of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Second, the offense charged \xe2\x80\x9cmust have been committed within the period of the war.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at 837.  No jurisdiction exists to try offenses \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted either before or after the war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Third, a military commission not established pursuant to martial law or an occupation may try only \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ndividuals of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s army who have been guilty of illegitimate warfare or other offences in violation of the laws of war\xe2\x80\x9d and members of one\xe2\x80\x99s own army \xe2\x80\x9cwho, in time of war, become chargeable with crimes or offences not cognizable, or triable, by the criminal courts or under the Articles of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 838.  Finally, a law-of-war commission has jurisdiction to try only two kinds of offense: \xe2\x80\x9cViolations of the laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribunals only,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[b]reaches of military orders or regulations for which offenders are not legally triable by court-martial under the Articles of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 839.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All parties agree that Colonel Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s treatise accurately describes the common law governing military commissions, and that the jurisdictional limitations he identifies were incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, Article 21 of the UCMJ.  It also is undisputed that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission lacks jurisdiction to try him unless the charge \xe2\x80\x9cproperly set[s] forth, not only the details of the act charged, but the circumstances conferring <em>jurisdiction</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 842 (emphasis in original).  The question is whether the preconditions designed to ensure that a military necessity exists to justify the use of this extraordinary tribunal have been satisfied here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The charge against Hamdan, described in detail in Part I, <em>supra</em>, alleges a conspiracy extending over a number of years, from 1996 to November 2001.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  All but two months of that more than 5-year-long period preceded the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the enactment of the AUMF\xe2\x80\x94the Act of Congress on which the Government relies for exercise of its war powers and thus for its authority to convene military commissions.[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Neither the purported agreement with Osama bin Laden and others to commit war crimes, nor a single overt act, is alleged to have occurred in a theater of war or on any specified date after September 11, 2001.  None of the overt acts that Hamdan is alleged to have committed violates the law of war.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These facts alone cast doubt on the legality of the charge and, hence, the commission; as Winthrop makes plain, the offense alleged must have been committed both in a theater of war and <em>during</em>, not before, the relevant conflict.  But the deficiencies in the time and place allegations also underscore\xe2\x80\x94indeed are symptomatic of\xe2\x80\x94the most serious defect of this charge: The offense it alleges is not triable by law-of-war military commission.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U. S., at 13 (\xe2\x80\x9cNeither congressional action nor the military orders constituting the commission authorized it to place petitioner on trial unless the charge proffered against him is of a violation of the law of war\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no suggestion that Congress has, in exercise of its constitutional authority to \xe2\x80\x9cdefine and punish . . . Offences against the Law of Nations,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa010, positively identified \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d as a war crime.[<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  As we explained in <em>Quirin</em>, that is not necessarily fatal to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim of authority to try the alleged offense by military commission; Congress, through Article 21 of the UCMJ, has \xe2\x80\x9cincorporated by reference\xe2\x80\x9d the common law of war, which may render triable by military commission certain offenses not defined by statute.  317 U. S., at 30.  When, however, neither the elements of the offense nor the range of permissible punishments is defined by statute or treaty, the precedent must be plain and unambiguous.  To demand any less would be to risk concentrating in military hands a degree of adjudicative and punitive power in excess of that contemplated either by statute or by the Constitution.

Although the picture arguably was less clear in <em>Yamashita</em>, compare 327 U. S., at 16 (stating that the provisions of the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, 36 Stat. 2306, \xe2\x80\x9cplainly\xe2\x80\x9d required the defendant to control the troops under his command), with 327 U.

That burden is far from satisfied here.  The crime of \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d has rarely if ever been tried as such in this country by any law-of-war military commission not exercising some other form of jurisdiction,[<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>] and does not appear in either the Geneva Conventions or the Hague Conventions\xe2\x80\x94the major treaties on the law of war.[<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  Winthrop explains that under the common law governing military commissions, it is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt.  See Winthrop 841 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in <em>overt acts</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions merely\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government cites three sources that it says show otherwise.  First, it points out that the Nazi saboteurs in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy.  See Brief for Respondents 27.  Second, it observes that Winthrop at one point in his treatise identifies conspiracy as an offense \xe2\x80\x9cprosecuted by military commissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing Winthrop 839, and n.\xc2\xa05).  Finally, it notes that another military historian, Charles Roscoe Howland, lists conspiracy \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as an offense that was tried as a violation of the law of war during the Civil War.  Brief for Respondents 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (citing C. Howland, Digest of Opinions of the Judge Advocates General of the Army 1071 (1912) (hereinafter Howland)).  On close analysis, however, these sources at best lend little support to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position and at worst undermine it.  By any measure, they fail to satisfy the high standard of clarity required to justify the use of a military commission.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the defendants in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy is not persuasive, since the Court declined to address whether the offense actually qualified as a violation of the law of war\xe2\x80\x94let alone one triable by military commission.  The <em>Quirin</em> defendants were charged with the following offenses:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[I.]\xe2\x80\x82Violation of the law of war.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[II.]\xe2\x80\x82Violation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, or corresponding with or giving intelligence to, the enemy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[III.]\xe2\x80\x82Violation of Article 82, defining the offense of spying.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[IV.]\xe2\x80\x82Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in charges [I, II, and III].\xe2\x80\x9d  317 U. S., at 23.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Government, defending its charge, argued that the conspiracy alleged \xe2\x80\x9cconstitute[d] an additional violation of the law of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  The saboteurs disagreed; they maintained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he charge of conspiracy can not stand if the other charges fall.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.  The Court, however, declined to resolve the dispute.  It concluded, first, that the specification supporting Charge I adequately alleged a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of the law of war\xe2\x80\x9d that was not \xe2\x80\x9cmerely colorable or without foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  The facts the Court deemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defendants, admitted enemy combatants, entered upon U. S. territory in time of war without uniform \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the war.\xe2\x80\x9d  That act was \xe2\x80\x9ca hostile and warlike\xe2\x80\x9d one.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36, 37.  The Court was careful in its decision to identify an overt, \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete\xe2\x80\x9d act.  Responding to the argument that the saboteurs had \xe2\x80\x9cnot actually committed or attempted to commit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military operations\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore had not violated the law of war, the Court responded that they had actually \xe2\x80\x9cpassed our military and naval lines and defenses or went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with hostile purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 38.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe offense was complete when with that purpose they entered\xe2\x80\x94or, having so entered, they remained upon\xe2\x80\x94our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate means of identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to the other charges alleged, the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ince the first specification of Charge I sets forth a violation of the law of war, we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of the second specification of Charge I, or to construe the 81st and 82nd Articles of War for the purpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under Charges II and III allege violations of those Articles or whether if so construed they are constitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 46.  No mention was made at all of Charge IV\xe2\x80\x94the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If anything, <em>Quirin</em> supports Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s argument that conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war.  Not only did the Court pointedly omit any discussion of the conspiracy charge, but its analysis of Charge I placed special emphasis on the <em>completion</em> of an offense; it took seriously the saboteurs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that there can be no violation of a law of war\xe2\x80\x94at least not one triable by military commission\xe2\x80\x94without the actual commission of or attempt to commit a \xe2\x80\x9chostile and warlike act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 37\xe2\x80\x9338.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That limitation makes eminent sense when one considers the necessity from whence this kind of military commission grew: The need to dispense swift justice, often in the form of execution, to illegal belligerents captured on the battlefield.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 40 (1916) (testimony of Brig. Gen. Enoch H. Crowder) (observing that Article of War 15 preserves the power of \xe2\x80\x9cthe military commander <em>in the field in time of war</em>\xe2\x80\x9d to use military commissions (emphasis added)).  The same urgency would not have been felt vis-\xc3\x80-vis enemies who had done little more than agree to violate the laws of war.  Cf. 31 Op. Atty. Gen. 356, 357, 361 (1918) (opining that a German spy could not be tried by military commission because, having been apprehended before entering \xe2\x80\x9cany camp, fortification or other military premises of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d he had \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted [his offenses] outside of the field of military operations\xe2\x80\x9d).  The <em>Quirin</em> Court acknowledged as much when it described the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to use law-of-war military commissions as the power to \xe2\x80\x9cseize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies <em>who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort</em> have violated the law of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  317 U. S., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Winthrop and Howland are only superficially more helpful to the Government.  Howland, granted, lists \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracy by two or more to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy\xe2\x80\x9d as one of over 20 \xe2\x80\x9coffenses against the laws and usages of war\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpassed upon and punished by military commissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Howland 1071.  But while the records of cases that Howland cites following his list of offenses against the law of war support inclusion of the other offenses mentioned, they provide no support for the inclusion of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.  See <em>ibid.</em> (citing Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 2, 144; R. 3, 401, 589, 649; R. 4, 320; R. 5, 36, 590; R. 6, 20; R. 7, 413; R. 8, 529; R. 9, 149, 202, 225, 481, 524, 535; R. 10, 567; R. 11, 473, 513; R. 13, 125, 675; R. 16, 446; R. 21, 101, 280).  Winthrop, apparently recognizing as much, excludes conspiracy of any kind from his own list of offenses against the law of war.  See Winthrop 839\xe2\x80\x93840.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Winthrop does, unsurprisingly, include \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal conspiracies\xe2\x80\x9d in his list of \xe2\x80\x9c[c]rimes and statutory offenses cognizable by State or U. S. courts\xe2\x80\x9d and triable by martial law or military government commission.  See <em>id.</em>, at 839.  And, in a footnote, he cites several Civil War examples of \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracies of this class, <em>or of the first and second classes combined</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 839, n.\xc2\xa05 (emphasis added).  The Government relies on this footnote for its contention that conspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime (a crime of the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst class\xe2\x80\x9d) and, independently, as a war crime (a crime of the \xe2\x80\x9csecond class\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the footnote will not support the weight the Government places on it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have seen, the military commissions convened during the Civil War functioned at once as martial law or military government tribunals and as law-of-war commissions.  See n. 27, <em>supra</em>.  Accordingly, they regularly tried war crimes and ordinary crimes together.  Indeed, as Howland observes, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ot infrequently the crime, as charged and found, was a combination of the two species of offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Howland 1071; see also Davis 310, n.\xc2\xa02; Winthrop 842.  The example he gives is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98murder in violation of the laws of war.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Howland 1071\xe2\x80\x931072.  Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s conspiracy \xe2\x80\x9cof the first and second classes combined\xe2\x80\x9d is, like Howland\xe2\x80\x99s example, best understood as a species of compound offense of the type tried by the hybrid military commissions of the Civil War.  It is not a stand-alone offense against the law of war.  Winthrop confirms this understanding later in his discussion, when he emphasizes that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>overt acts</em>\xe2\x80\x9d constituting war crimes are the only proper subject at least of those military tribunals not convened to stand in for local courts.  Winthrop 841, and nn. 22, 23 (emphasis in original) (citing W. Finlason, Martial Law 130 (1867)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas cites as evidence that conspiracy is a recognized violation of the law of war the Civil War indictment against Henry Wirz, which charged the defendant  with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[m]aliciously, willfully, and traitorously \xe2\x80\xa6 combining, confederating, and conspiring [with others] to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 to the end that the armies of the United States might be weakened and impaired, in violation of the laws and customs of war.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (dissenting opinion) (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Doc. No. 314, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., 785 (1865); emphasis deleted).  As shown by the specification supporting that charge, however, Wirz was alleged to have <em>personally committed</em> a number of atrocities against his victims, including torture, injection of prisoners with poison, and use of \xe2\x80\x9cferocious and bloodthirsty dogs\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cseize, tear, mangle, and maim the bodies and limbs\xe2\x80\x9d of prisoners, many of whom died as a result.  <em>Id.</em>, at 789\xe2\x80\x93790.  Crucially, Judge Advocate General Holt determined that one of Wirz\xe2\x80\x99s alleged co-conspirators, R.\xc2\xa0B. Winder, should <em>not</em> be tried by military commission because there was as yet insufficient evidence of his own personal involvement in the atrocities: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the case of R.\xc2\xa0B. Winder, <em>while the evidence at the trial of Wirz was deemed by the court to implicate him in the conspiracy</em> against the lives of all Federal prisoners in rebel hands, <em>no such specific overt acts of violation of the laws of war</em> are as yet fixed upon him as to make it expedient to prefer formal charges and bring him to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 783 (emphases added).[<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, international sources confirm that the crime charged here is not a recognized violation of the law of war.[<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  As observed above, see <em>supra</em>, at 40, none of the major treaties governing the law of war identifies conspiracy as a violation thereof.  And the only \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d crimes that have been recognized by international war crimes tribunals (whose jurisdiction often extends beyond war crimes proper to crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace) are conspiracy to commit genocide and common plan to wage aggressive war, which is a crime against the peace and requires for its commission actual participation in a \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete plan to wage war.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal: Nuremberg, 14 November 1945\xe2\x80\x931 October 1946, p. 225 (1947).  The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, over the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s objections, pointedly refused to recognize as a violation of the law of war conspiracy to commit war crimes, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 22 <em>id.</em>, at 469,[<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>] and convicted only Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s most senior associates of conspiracy to wage aggressive war, see S. Pomorski, Conspiracy and Criminal Organization, in the Nuremberg Trial and International Law 213, 233\xe2\x80\x93235 (G. Ginsburgs &amp; V. Kudriavtsev eds. 1990).  As one prominent figure from the Nuremberg trials has explained, members of the Tribunal objected to recognition of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Anglo-American concept of conspiracy was not part of European legal systems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized laws of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 36 (1992); see also <em>id.</em>, at 550 (observing that Francis Biddle, who as Attorney General prosecuted the defendants in <em>Quirin</em>, thought the French judge had made a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98persuasive argument that conspiracy in the truest sense is not known to international law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the sources that the Government and Justice Thomas rely upon to show that conspiracy to violate the law of war is itself a violation of the law of war in fact demonstrate quite the opposite.  Far from making the requisite substantial showing, the Government has failed even to offer a \xe2\x80\x9cmerely colorable\xe2\x80\x9d case for inclusion of conspiracy among those offenses cognizable by law-of-war military commission.  Cf. <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 36.  Because the charge does not support the commission\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The charge\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings are not merely formal, but are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition\xe2\x80\x94at least in the absence of specific congressional authorization\xe2\x80\x94for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.  Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s tribunal was appointed not by a military commander in the field of battle, but by a retired major general stationed away from any active hostilities.  Cf. <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush, </em>542 U. S., at 487 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (observing that \xe2\x80\x9cGuantanamo Bay is \xe2\x80\xa6 far removed from any hostilities\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a theater of war and which military efficiency demands be tried expeditiously, but with an <em>agreement</em> the inception of which long predated the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the AUMF.  That may well be a crime,[<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>] but it is not an offense that \xe2\x80\x9cby the law of war may be tried by\xc2\xa0military commissio[n].\xe2\x80\x9d  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821.  None of the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of the agreement is itself a war crime, or even necessarily occurred during time of, or in a theater of, war.  Any urgent need for imposition or execution of judgment is utterly belied by the record; Hamdan was arrested in November 2001 and he was not charged until mid-2004.  These simply are not the circumstances in which, by any stretch of the historical evidence or this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, a military commission established by Executive Order under the authority of Article 21 of the UCMJ may lawfully try a person and subject him to punishment.</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission, the commission lacks power to proceed.  The UCMJ conditions the President\xe2\x80\x99s use of military commissions on compliance not only with the American common law of war, but also with the rest of the UCMJ itself, insofar as applicable, and with the \xe2\x80\x9crules and precepts of the law of nations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28\xe2\x80\x94including, <em>inter alia</em>, the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U. S., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  The procedures that the Government has decreed will govern Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial by commission violate these laws.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The commission\xe2\x80\x99s procedures are set forth in Commission Order No. 1, which was amended most recently on </p>\n<p align="left">August 31, 2005\xe2\x80\x94after Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial had already begun.  Every commission established pursuant to Commission Order No. 1 must have a presiding officer and at least three other members, all of whom must be commissioned officers.  \xc2\xa74(A)(1).  The presiding officer\xe2\x80\x99s job is to rule on questions of law and other evidentiary and interlocutory issues; the other members make findings and, if applicable, sentencing decisions.  \xc2\xa74(A)(5).  The accused is entitled to appointed military counsel and may hire civilian counsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a U. S. citizen with security clearance \xe2\x80\x9cat the level SECRET or higher.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(C)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The accused also is entitled to a copy of the charge(s) against him, both in English and his own language (if different), to a presumption of innocence, and to certain other rights typically afforded criminal defendants in civilian courts and courts-martial.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75(A)\xe2\x80\x93(P).  These rights are subject, however, to one glaring condition: The accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding that either the Appointing Authority or the presiding officer decides to \xe2\x80\x9cclose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Grounds for such closure \xe2\x80\x9cinclude the protection of information classified or classifiable \xe2\x80\xa6 ; information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure; the physical safety of participants in Commission proceedings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities; and other national security interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76(B)(3).[<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officer\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to his or her client what took place therein.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another striking feature of the rules governing Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission is that they permit the admission of <em>any</em> evidence that, in the opinion of the presiding officer, \xe2\x80\x9cwould have probative value to a reasonable person.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76(D)(1).  Under this test, not only is testimonial hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion fully admissible, but neither live testimony nor witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 written statements need be sworn.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76(D)(2)(b), (3).  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to evidence in the form of \xe2\x80\x9cprotected information\xe2\x80\x9d (which includes classified information as well as \xe2\x80\x9cinformation protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinformation concerning other national security interests,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76(B)(3), 6(D)(5)(a)(v)), so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is \xe2\x80\x9cprobative\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa76(D)(1) and that its admission without the accused\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge would not \xe2\x80\x9cresult in the denial of a full and fair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76(D)(5)(b).[<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  Finally, a presiding officer\xe2\x80\x99s determination that evidence \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have probative value to a reasonable person\xe2\x80\x9d may be overridden by a majority of the other commission members.  \xc2\xa76(D)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once all the evidence is in, the commission members (not including the presiding officer) must vote on the accused\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  A two-thirds vote will suffice for both a verdict of guilty and for imposition of any sentence not including death (the imposition of which requires a unanimous vote).  \xc2\xa76(F).  Any appeal is taken to a three-member review panel composed of military officers and designated by the Secretary of Defense, only one member of which need have experience as a judge.  \xc2\xa76(H)(4).  The review panel is directed to \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard any variance from procedures specified in this Order or elsewhere that would not materially have affected the outcome of the trial before the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Once the panel makes its recommendation to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary can either remand for further proceedings or forward the record to the President with his recommendation as to final disposition.  \xc2\xa76(H)(5).  The President then, unless he has delegated the task to the Secretary, makes the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76(H)(6).  He may change the commission\xe2\x80\x99s findings or sentence only in a manner favorable to the accused.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hamdan raises both general and particular objections to the procedures set forth in Commission Order No. 1.  His general objection is that the procedures\xe2\x80\x99 admitted deviation from those governing courts-martial itself renders the commission illegal.  Chief among his particular objections are that he may, under the Commission Order, be convicted based on evidence he has not seen or heard, and that any evidence admitted against him need not comply with the admissibility or relevance rules typically applicable in criminal trials and court-martial proceedings.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government objects to our consideration of any procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1) the abstention doctrine espoused in Councilman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html">420 U.

Second, contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, there <em>is</em> a \xe2\x80\x9cbasis to presume\xe2\x80\x9d that the procedures employed during Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial will violate the law: The procedures are described with particularity in Commission Order No. 1, and implementation of some of them has already occurred.  One of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s complaints is that he will be, and <em>indeed already has been</em>, excluded from his own trial.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.  Under these circumstances, review of the procedures in advance of a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the timing of which is left entirely to the discretion of the President under the DTA\xe2\x80\x94is appropriate.  We turn, then, to consider the merits of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s procedural challenge.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In part because the difference between military commissions and courts-martial originally was a difference of jurisdiction alone, and in part to protect against abuse and ensure evenhandedness under the pressures of war, the procedures governing trials by military commission historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 The War of the Rebellion 248 (2d series 1894) (General Order 1 issued during the Civil War required military commissions to \xe2\x80\x9cbe constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules as courts-martial in order to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accounts of commentators from Winthrop through General Crowder\xe2\x80\x94who drafted Article of War 15 and whose views have been deemed \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritative\xe2\x80\x9d by this Court, <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 353\xe2\x80\x94confirm as much.[<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]  As recently as the Korean and Vietnam wars, during which use of military commissions was contemplated but never made, the principle of procedural parity was espoused as a background assumption.  See Paust, Antiterrorism Military Commissions: Courting Illegality, 23 Mich. J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 1, 3\xe2\x80\x935 (2001\xe2\x80\x932002).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a glaring historical exception to this general rule.  The procedures and evidentiary rules used to try General Yamashita near the end of World War II deviated in significant respects from those then governing courts-martial.  See <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/327/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/327/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/327/1/index.html">327 U. S. 1</a>.  The force of that precedent, however, has been seriously undermined by post-World War II developments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was Commanding General of the Fourteenth Army Group of the Imperial Japanese Army, which had exercised control over the Philippine Islands.  On September 3, 1945, after American forces regained control of the Philippines, Yamashita surrendered.  Three weeks later, he was charged with violations of the law of war.  A few weeks after that, he was arraigned before a military commission convened in the Philippines.  He pleaded not guilty, and his trial lasted for two months.  On December 7, 1945, Yamashita was convicted and sentenced to hang.  See <em>id.</em>, at 5; <em>id.</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9334 (Murphy, J., dissenting).  This Court upheld the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The procedures and rules of evidence employed during Yamashita\xe2\x80\x99s trial departed so far from those used in courts-martial that they generated an unusually long and vociferous critique from two Members of this Court.  See <em>id.</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9381 (Rutledge, J., joined by Murphy, J., dissenting).[<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]  Among the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 primary concerns was that the commission had free rein to consider all evidence \xe2\x80\x9cwhich in the commission\xe2\x80\x99s opinion \xe2\x80\x98would be of assistance in proving or disproving the charge,\xe2\x80\x99 without any of the usual modes of authentication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49 (Rutledge, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority, however, did not pass on the merits of Yamashita\xe2\x80\x99s procedural challenges because it concluded that his status disentitled him to any protection under the Articles of War (specifically, those set forth in Article 38, which would become Article 36 of the UCMJ) or the Geneva Convention of 1929, 47 Stat. 2021 (1929 Geneva Convention).  The Court explained that Yamashita was neither a \xe2\x80\x9cperson made subject to the Articles of War by Article 2\xe2\x80\x9d thereof, 327 U. S., at 20, nor a protected prisoner of war being tried for crimes committed during his detention, <em>id.</em>, at 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At least partially in response to subsequent criticism of General Yamashita\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the UCMJ\xe2\x80\x99s codification of the Articles of War after World War II expanded the category of persons subject thereto to include defendants in Yamashita\xe2\x80\x99s (and Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s) position,[<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>] and the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 extended prisoner-of-war protections to individuals tried for crimes committed before their capture.  See 3 Int\xe2\x80\x99l Comm. of Red Cross,[<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>] Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 413 (1960) (hereinafter GCIII Commentary) (explaining that Article 85, which extends the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s protections to \xe2\x80\x9c[p]risoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to capture,\xe2\x80\x9d was adopted in response to judicial interpretations of the 1929 Convention, including this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Yamashita</em>).  The most notorious exception to the principle of uniformity, then, has been stripped of its precedential value.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The uniformity principle is not an inflexible one; it does not preclude all departures from the procedures dictated for use by courts-martial.  But any departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  See Winthrop 835, n. 81.  That understanding is reflected in Article 36 of the UCMJ, which provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a)\xe2\x80\x82The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions, and other military tribunals may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b)\xe2\x80\x82All rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable and shall be reported to Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  70A Stat. 50.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Article 36 places two restrictions on the President\xe2\x80\x99s power to promulgate rules of procedure for courts-martial and military commissions alike.  First, no procedural rule he adopts may be \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to or inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the UCMJ\xe2\x80\x94however practical it may seem.  Second, the rules adopted must be \xe2\x80\x9cuniform insofar as practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is, the rules applied to military commissions must be the same as those applied to courts-martial unless such uniformity proves impracticable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates both of these restrictions; he maintains that the procedures described in the Commission Order are inconsistent with the UCMJ and that the Government has offered no explanation for their deviation from the procedures governing courts-martial, which are set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.) (Manual for Courts-Martial).  Among the inconsistencies Hamdan identifies is that between \xc2\xa76 of the Commission Order, which permits exclusion of the accused from proceedings and denial of his access to evidence in certain circumstances, and the UCMJ\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll \xe2\x80\xa6 proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d other than votes and deliberations by courts-martial \xe2\x80\x9cshall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  10  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. A. \xc2\xa7839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Hamdan also observes that the Commission Order dispenses with virtually all evidentiary rules applicable in courts-martial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government has three responses.  First, it argues, only 9 of the UCMJ\xe2\x80\x99s 158 Articles\xe2\x80\x94the ones that expressly mention \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary commissions\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>]\xe2\x80\x94actually apply to commissions, and Commission Order No. 1 sets forth no procedure that is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to or inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d those 9 provisions.  Second, the Government contends, military commissions would be of no use if the President were hamstrung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern courts-martial.  Finally, the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination that \xe2\x80\x9cthe danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d renders it impracticable \xe2\x80\x9cto apply in military commissions \xe2\x80\xa6 the principles of law and rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,\xe2\x80\x9d November 13 Order \xc2\xa71(f), is, in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, explanation enough for any deviation from court-martial procedures.  See Brief for Respondents 43\xe2\x80\x9347, and n. 22.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hamdan has the better of this argument.  Without reaching the question whether any provision of Commission Order No. 1 is strictly \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to or inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d other provisions of the UCMJ, we conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9cpracticability\xe2\x80\x9d determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial.  Subsection (b) of Article 36 was added after World War II, and requires a different showing of impracticability from the one required by subsection (a).  Subsection (a) requires that the rules the President promulgates for courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike conform to those that govern procedures in <em>Article III courts</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cso far as <em>he considers</em> practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836(a) (emphasis added).  Subsection (b), by contrast, demands that the rules applied in courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions\xe2\x80\x94whether or not they conform with the Federal Rules of Evidence\xe2\x80\x94be \xe2\x80\x9cuniform <em>insofar as practicable</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7836(b) (emphasis added).  Under the latter provision, then, the rules set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial must apply to military commissions unless impracticable.[<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President here has determined, pursuant to subsection (a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7836(a), to Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission.  We assume that complete deference is owed that determination.  The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial.[<a href="#F51" name="T51">Footnote 51</a>] And even if subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements may be satisfied without such an official determination, the requirements of that subsection are not satisfied here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules in this case.  There is no suggestion, for example, of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the reasons articulated in the President\xe2\x80\x99s Article 36(a) determination ought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability of applying court-martial rules, the only reason offered in support of that determination is the danger posed by international terrorism.[<a href="#F52" name="T52">Footnote 52</a>]  Without for one moment underestimating that danger, it is not evident to us why it should require, in the case of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial, any variance from the rules that govern courts-martial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: the right to be present.  See 10  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. A. \xc2\xa7839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Whether or not that departure technically is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to or inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the terms of the UCMJ, 10  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836(a), the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as \xe2\x80\x9cpracticable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the circumstances, then, the rules applicable in courts-martial must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Article 36(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s objection that requiring compliance with the court-martial rules imposes an undue burden both ignores the plain meaning of Article 36(b) and misunderstands the purpose and the history of military commissions.  The military commission was not born of a desire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is afforded by courts-martial; it developed, rather, as a tribunal of necessity to be employed when courts-martial lacked jurisdiction over either the accused or the subject matter.  See Winthrop 831.  Exigency lent the commission its legitimacy, but did not further justify the wholesale jettisoning of procedural protections.  That history explains why the military commission\xe2\x80\x99s procedures typically have been the ones used by courts-martial.  That the jurisdiction of the two tribunals today may sometimes overlap, see <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract from the force of this history;[<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>] Article 21 did not transform the military commission from a tribunal of true exigency into a more convenient adjudicatory tool.  Article 36, confirming as much, strikes a careful balance between uniform procedure and the need to accommodate exigencies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war.  That Article not having been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial are illegal.[<a href="#F54" name="T54">Footnote 54</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva Conventions.  The Court of Appeals dismissed Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s Geneva Convention challenge on three independent grounds: (1) the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable; (2) Hamdan in any event is not entitled to their protections; and (3) even if he is entitled to their protections, <em>Councilman </em>abstention is appropriate.  Judge Williams, concurring, rejected the second ground but agreed with the majority respecting the first and the last.  As we explained in Part III, <em>supra</em>, the abstention rule applied in <em>Councilman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html">420 U. S. 738</a>, is not applicable here.[<a href="#F55" name="T55">Footnote 55</a>]  And for the reasons that follow, we hold that neither of the other grounds the Court of Appeals gave for its decision is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">i</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals relied on <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/index.html">339 U. S. 763</a> (1950), to hold that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions to challenge the Government\xe2\x80\x99s plan to prosecute him in accordance with Commission Order No. 1.  <em>Eisentrager</em> involved a challenge by 21 German nationals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes by a military tribunal convened in Nanking, China, and to their subsequent imprisonment in occupied Germany.  The petitioners argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that the 1929 Geneva Convention rendered illegal some of the procedures employed during their trials, which they said deviated impermissibly from the procedures used by courts-martial to try American soldiers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 789.  We rejected that claim on the merits because the petitioners (unlike Hamdan here) had failed to identify any prejudicial disparity \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the Commission that tried [them] and those that would try an offending soldier of the American forces of like rank,\xe2\x80\x9d and in any event could claim no protection, under the 1929 Convention, during trials for crimes that occurred before their confinement as prisoners of war.  <em>Id.</em>, at 790.[<a href="#F56" name="T56">Footnote 56</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Buried in a footnote of the opinion, however, is this curious statement suggesting that the Court lacked power even to consider the merits of the Geneva Convention argument:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not holding that these prisoners have no right which the military authorities are bound to respect.  The United States, by the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929, 47 Stat. 2021, concluded with forty-six other countries, including the German Reich, an agreement upon the treatment to be accorded captives.  These prisoners claim to be and are entitled to its protection.  It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.  Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential intervention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 789, n.\xc2\xa014.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court of Appeals, on the strength of this footnote, held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe 1949 Geneva Convention does not confer upon Hamdan a right to enforce its provisions in court.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 40.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever else might be said about the <em>Eisentrager</em> footnote, it does not control this case.  We may assume that \xe2\x80\x9cthe obvious scheme\xe2\x80\x9d of the 1949 Conventions is identical in all relevant respects to that of the 1929 Convention,[<a href="#F57" name="T57">Footnote 57</a>] and even that that scheme would, absent some other provision of law, preclude Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s provisions as an independent source of law binding the Government\xe2\x80\x99s actions and furnishing petitioner with any enforceable right.[<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>]  For, regardless of the nature of the rights conferred on Hamdan, cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rauscher,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/119/407/index.html">119 U. S. 407</a> (1886), they are, as the Government does not dispute, part of the law of war.  See <em>Hamdi, </em>542 U. S., at 520\xe2\x80\x93521 (plurality opinion).  And compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.</p>\n<p align="left">ii</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the Court of Appeals, acknowledgment of that condition was no bar to Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial by commission.  As an alternative to its holding that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions at all, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Conventions did not in any event apply to the armed conflict during which Hamdan was captured.  The court accepted the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s assertions that Hamdan was captured in connection with the United States\xe2\x80\x99 war with al Qaeda and that that war is distinct from the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan.  It further reasoned that the war with al Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva Conventions.  See 415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 41\xe2\x80\x9342.

One such provision prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cthe passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals thought, and the Government asserts, that Common Article 3 does not apply to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda, being \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98international in scope,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d does not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conflict not of an international character.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 41.  That reasoning is erroneous.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cconflict not of an international character\xe2\x80\x9d is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations.  So much is demonstrated by the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental logic [of] the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s provisions on its application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  Common Article 2 provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, \xc2\xb61).  High Contracting Parties (signatories) also must abide by all terms of the Conventions vis-\xc3\x80-vis one another even if one party to the conflict is a nonsignatory \xe2\x80\x9cPower,\xe2\x80\x9d and must so abide vis-\xc3\x80-vis the nonsignatory if \xe2\x80\x9cthe latter accepts and applies\xe2\x80\x9d those terms.  <em>Ibid.</em> (Art. 2, \xc2\xb63).  Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory \xe2\x80\x9cPower\xe2\x80\x9d who are involved in a conflict \xe2\x80\x9cin the territory of\xe2\x80\x9d a signatory.  The latter kind of conflict is distinguishable from the conflict described in Common Article 2 chiefly because it does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories or not).  In context, then, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnot of an international character\xe2\x80\x9d bears its literal meaning.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, J.

Although the Court of Appeals rejected the Article 3 argument on the merits, it also stated that, because the challenge was not \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d it did not fall within the exception that <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html">420 U.

As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued <em>after</em> the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power.

See <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9310 (dissenting opinion).  But even the Government does not go so far; although the United States had for some time prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001, been aggressively pursuing al Qaeda, neither in the charging document nor in submissions before this Court has the Government asserted that the President\xe2\x80\x99s <em>war powers</em> were activated prior to September 11, 2001.  Cf. Brief for Respondents 25 (describing the events of September 11, 2001, as \xe2\x80\x9can act of war\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ctriggered a right to deploy military forces abroad to defend the United States by combating al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x9d).  Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 further argument that the AUMF is \xe2\x80\x9cbackward looking\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore authorizes <em>trial by military commission</em> of crimes that occurred prior to the inception of war is insupportable.  See <em>post</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa03.  If nothing else, Article 21 of the UCMJ requires that the President comply with the law of war in his use of military commissions.  As explained in the text, the law of war permits trial only of offenses \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted within the period of the war.\xe2\x80\x9d  Winthrop 837; see also <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (observing that law-of-war military commissions may be used to try \xe2\x80\x9cthose enemies <em>who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort</em> have violated the law of war\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The sources that Justice Thomas relies on to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position.  Colonel Green\xe2\x80\x99s short exegesis on military commissions cites Howland for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ffenses committed before a <em>formal declaration of war</em> or <em>before the declaration of martial law</em> may be tried by military commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Military Commission, 42 Am.

Assuming that to be true, nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law.  Our focus instead is on the September 11, 2001 attacks that the Government characterizes as the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cact[s] of war,\xe2\x80\x9d and on the measure that authorized the President\xe2\x80\x99s deployment of military force\xe2\x80\x94the AUMF.   Because we do not question the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position that the war commenced with the events of September 11, 2001, the <em>Prize Cases,</em> 2 Black 635 (1863) (cited <em>post</em>, at 2, 7, 8, and 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting)), are not germane to the analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that Julius Otto Kuehn\xe2\x80\x99s trial by military commission \xe2\x80\x9cfor conspiring with Japanese officials to betray the United States fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government prior to its attack on Pearl Harbor\xe2\x80\x9d stands as authoritative precedent for Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial by commission, <em>post</em>, at 9, misses the mark in three critical respects.  First, Kuehn was tried for the <em>federal espionage crimes </em>under what were then 50 U. S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa731, 32, and 34, <em>not</em> with common-law violations of the law of war.  See Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 30, pp. 3067\xe2\x80\x933069 (1946).  Second, he was tried by <em>martial law</em> commission (a kind of commission Justice Thomas acknowledges is not relevant to the analysis here, and whose jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of . . . martial law,\xe2\x80\x9d Winthrop 837, see <em>supra</em>, n. 28), <em>not</em> a commission established exclusively to try violations of the law of war.  See <em>ibid.</em>   Third, the martial law commissions established to try crimes in Hawaii were ultimately declared illegal by this Court.  See <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Kahanamoku,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/304/index.html"></a><a href="/us/327/304/index.html">327 U.

See <em>post</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9321, and n. 9.  There are innumerable problems with this approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the crimes Justice Thomas identifies were not actually charged.  It is one thing to observe that charges before a military commission \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98need not be stated with the precision of a common law indictment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 15, n.\xc2\xa07 (citation omitted); it is quite another to say that a crime <em>not charged</em> may nonetheless be read into an indictment.   Second, the Government plainly had available to it the tools and the time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes Justice Thomas refers to, if it believed they were supported by the allegations.  As Justice Thomas himself observes, see <em>post</em>, at 21, the crime of aiding the enemy may, in circumstances where the accused owes allegiance to the party whose enemy he is alleged to have aided, be triable by military commission pursuant to Article 104 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7904.  Indeed, the Government has charged detainees under this provision when it has seen fit to do so.  See Brief for David Hicks as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the cases Justice Thomas relies on to show that Hamdan may be guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do not support his argument.  Justice Thomas begins by blurring the distinction between those categories of \xe2\x80\x9coffender\xe2\x80\x9d who may be tried by military commission (<em>e.g.</em>, jayhawkers and the like) with the \xe2\x80\x9coffenses\xe2\x80\x9d that may be so tried.  Even when it comes to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98being a guerilla,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d cf. <em>post</em>, at 18, n.\xc2\xa09 (citation omitted), a label alone does not render a person susceptible to execution or other criminal punishment; the charge of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98being a guerilla\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d invariably is accompanied by the allegation that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98took up arms\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as such.  This is because, as explained by Judge Advocate General Holt in a decision upholding the charge of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98being a guerilla\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as one recognized by \xe2\x80\x9cthe universal usage of the times,\xe2\x80\x9d the charge is simply shorthand (akin to \xe2\x80\x9cbeing a spy\xe2\x80\x9d) for \xe2\x80\x9cthe perpetration of a succession of similar acts\xe2\x80\x9d of violence.

The convictions of certain high-level Nazi officials for \xe2\x80\x9cmembership in a criminal organization\xe2\x80\x9d were secured pursuant to specific provisions of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal that permitted indictment of individual organization members following convictions of the organizations themselves.  See Arts. 9 and 10, in 1 Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal 12 (1947).   The initial plan to use organizations\xe2\x80\x99 convictions as predicates for mass individual trials ultimately was abandoned.  See T.

This is not a case, then, where the Executive can assert some unilateral authority to fill a void left by congressional inaction.  It is a case where Congress, in the proper exercise of its powers as an independent branch of government, and as part of a long tradition of legislative involvement in matters of military justice, has considered the subject of military tribunals and set limits on the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  Where a statute provides the conditions for the exercise of governmental power, its requirements are the result of a deliberative and reflective process engaging both of the political branches.  Respect for laws derived from the customary operation of the Executive and Legislative Branches gives some assurance of stability in time of crisis.  The Constitution is best preserved by reliance on standards tested over time and insulated from the pressures of the moment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These principles seem vindicated here, for a case that may be of extraordinary importance is resolved by ordinary rules.  The rules of most relevance here are those pertaining to the authority of Congress and the interpretation of its enactments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems appropriate to recite these rather fundamental points because the Court refers, as it should in its exposition of the case, to the requirement of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that military tribunals be \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 69\xe2\x80\x94a requirement that controls here, if for no other reason, because Congress requires that military commissions like the ones at issue conform to the \xe2\x80\x9claw of war,\xe2\x80\x9d 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821.  Whatever the substance and content of the term \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d as interpreted in this and any later cases, there seems little doubt that it relies upon the importance of standards deliberated upon and chosen in advance of crisis, under a system where the single power of the Executive is checked by other constitutional mechanisms.  All of which returns us to the point of beginning\xe2\x80\x94that domestic statutes control this case.  If Congress, after due consideration, deems it appropriate to change the controlling statutes, in conformance with the Constitution and other laws, it has the power and prerogative to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, save Parts V and VI\xe2\x80\x93D\xe2\x80\x93iv.  To state my reasons for this reservation, and to show my agreement with the remainder of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis by identifying particular deficiencies in the military commissions at issue, this separate opinion seems appropriate.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Trial by military commission raises separation-of-powers concerns of the highest order.  Located within a single branch, these courts carry the risk that offenses will be defined, prosecuted, and adjudicated by executive officials without independent review.  Cf. <em>Loving</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/748/index.html">517 U. S. 748</a>, 756\xe2\x80\x93758, 760 (1996).  Concentration of power puts personal liberty in peril of arbitrary action by officials, an incursion the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s three-part system is designed to avoid.  It is imperative, then, that when military tribunals are established, full and proper authority exists for the Presidential directive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The proper framework for assessing whether Executive actions are authorized is the three-part scheme used by Justice Jackson in his opinion in <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/579/index.html">343 U. S. 579</a> (1952).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 635.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 637.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, as the Court observes, the President has acted in a field with a history of congressional participation and regulation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9330, 55\xe2\x80\x9357.  In the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801 <em>et seq.</em>, which Congress enacted, building on earlier statutes, in 1950, see Act of May 5, 1950, ch. 169, 64 Stat. 107, and later amended, see, <em>e.g.,</em> Military Justice Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 1335, Congress has set forth governing principles for military courts.  The UCMJ as a whole establishes an intricate system of military justice.  It authorizes courts-martial in various forms, 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7816\xe2\x80\x93820 (2000 ed. and Supp. III); it regulates the organization and procedure of those courts, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7822\xe2\x80\x93835, 851\xe2\x80\x93854; it defines offenses, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7877\xe2\x80\x93934, and rights for the accused, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7827(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c), 831, 844, 846, 855 (2000 ed.); and it provides mechanisms for appellate review, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7859\xe2\x80\x93876b (2000 ed. and Supp. III).  As explained below, the statute further recognizes that special military commissions may be convened to try war crimes.  See <em>infra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936; \xc2\xa7821 (2000 ed.).  While these laws provide authority for certain forms of military courts, they also impose limitations, at least two of which control this case.  If the President has exceeded these limits, this becomes a case of conflict between Presidential and congressional action\xe2\x80\x94a case within Justice Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s third category, not the second or first.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One limit on the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority is contained in \xc2\xa7836 of the UCMJ.  That section provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(a) Pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including modes of proof, for cases arising under this chapter triable in courts-martial, military commissions and other military tribunals, and procedures for courts of inquiry, may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(b) All rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836 (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn this provision the statute allows the President to implement and build on the UCMJ\xe2\x80\x99s framework by adopting procedural regulations, subject to three requirements: (1) Procedures for military courts must conform to district-court rules insofar as the President \xe2\x80\x9cconsiders practicable\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) the procedures may not be contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of the UCMJ; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cinsofar as practicable\xe2\x80\x9d all rules and regulations under \xc2\xa7836 must be uniform, a requirement, as the Court points out, that indicates the rules must be the same for military commissions as for courts-martial unless such uniformity is impracticable, <em>ante</em>, at 57, 59, and n. 50.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court further instructs, even assuming the first and second requirements of \xc2\xa7836 are satisfied here\xe2\x80\x94a matter of some dispute, see <em>ante</em>, at 57\xe2\x80\x9359\xe2\x80\x94the third requires us to compare the military-commission procedures with those for courts-martial and determine, to the extent there are deviations, whether greater uniformity would be practicable.  <em>Ante</em>, at 59\xe2\x80\x9362.  Although we can assume the President\xe2\x80\x99s practicability judgments are entitled to some deference, the Court observes that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of language in the uniformity provision of 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836(b) contrasts with the language of \xc2\xa7836(a).  This difference suggests, at the least, a lower degree of deference for \xc2\xa7836(b) determinations.  <em>Ante</em>, at 59\xe2\x80\x9360.  The rules for military courts may depart from federal-court rules whenever the President \xe2\x80\x9cconsiders\xe2\x80\x9d conformity impracticable, \xc2\xa7836(a); but the statute requires procedural uniformity across different military courts \xe2\x80\x9cinsofar as [uniformity is] practicable,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7836(b), not insofar as the President considers it to be so.  The Court is right to conclude this is of relevance to our decision.  Further, as the Court is also correct to conclude, <em>ante</em>, at 60, the term \xe2\x80\x9cpracticable\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be construed to permit deviations based on mere convenience or expedience.  \xe2\x80\x9cPracticable\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cfeasible,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, \xe2\x80\x9cpossible to practice or perform\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of being put into practice, done, or accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1780 (1961).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 chosen language, then, is best understood to allow the selection of procedures based on logistical constraints, the accommodation of witnesses, the security of the proceedings, and the like.  Insofar as the \xe2\x80\x9c[p]retrial, trial, and post-trial procedures\xe2\x80\x9d for the military commissions at issue deviate from court-martial practice, the deviations must be explained by some such practical need.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to \xc2\xa7836, a second UCMJ provision, 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821, requires us to compare the commissions at issue to courts-martial.  This provision states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial do not deprive military commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In \xc2\xa7821 Congress has addressed the possibility that special military commissions\xe2\x80\x94criminal courts other than courts-martial\xe2\x80\x94may at times be convened.  At the same time, however, the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to convene military commissions is limited: It extends only to \xe2\x80\x9coffenders or offenses\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cby statute or by the law of war may be tried by\xe2\x80\x9d such military commissions.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>ante</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  The Government does not claim to base the charges against Hamdan on a statute; instead it invokes the law of war.  That law, as the Court explained in <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942), derives from \xe2\x80\x9crules and precepts of the law of nations\xe2\x80\x9d; it is the body of international law governing armed conflict.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28.  If the military commission at issue is illegal under the law of war, then an offender cannot be tried \xe2\x80\x9cby the law of war\xe2\x80\x9d before that commission.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is correct to concentrate on one provision of the law of war that is applicable to our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s armed conflict with al Qaeda in Afghanistan and, as a result, to the use of a military commission to try Hamdan.  <em>Ante</em>, at 65\xe2\x80\x9370; see also 415 F.\xc2\xa03d 33, 44 (CADC 2005) (Williams, J., concurring).  That provision is Common Article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949.  It prohibits, as relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Article 3 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 3316, 3318, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 3364.  The provision is part of a treaty the United States has ratified and thus accepted as binding law.  See <em>id.</em>, at 3316.  By Act of Congress, moreover, violations of Common Article 3 are considered \xe2\x80\x9cwar crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d punishable as federal offenses, when committed by or against United States nationals and military personnel.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72441.  There should be no doubt, then, that Common Article 3 is part of the law of war as that term is used in \xc2\xa7821.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent by Justice Thomas argues that Common Article 3 nonetheless is irrelevant to this case because in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/index.html">339 U. S. 763</a> (1950), it was said to be the \xe2\x80\x9cobvious scheme\xe2\x80\x9d of the 1929 Geneva Convention that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> i.e</em>., signatory states, <em>id.</em>, at 789, n.\xc2\xa014.  As the Court explains, <em>ante</em>, at 63\xe2\x80\x9365, this language from <em>Eisentrager</em> is not controlling here.  Even assuming the <em>Eisentrager</em> analysis has some bearing upon the analysis of the broader 1949 Conventions and that, in consequence, rights are vindicated \xe2\x80\x9cunder [those Conventions]\xe2\x80\x9d only through protests and intervention, 339 U. S., at 789, n.\xc2\xa014, Common Article 3 is nonetheless relevant to the question of authorization under \xc2\xa7821.  Common Article 3 is part of the law of war that Congress has directed the President to follow in establishing military commissions.  <em>Ante</em>, at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.  Consistent with that view, the <em>Eisentrager</em> Court itself considered on the merits claims that \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural irregularities\xe2\x80\x9d under the 1929 Convention \xe2\x80\x9cdeprive[d] the Military Commission of jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 U. S., at 789, 790.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In another military commission case,<em> In re Yamashita,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/1/index.html">327 U. S. 1</a> (1946), the Court likewise considered on the merits\xe2\x80\x94without any caveat about remedies under the Convention\xe2\x80\x94a claim that an alleged violation of the 1929 Convention \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ed] want of authority in the commission to proceed with the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 23, 24.  That is the precise inquiry we are asked to perform here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Assuming the President has authority to establish a special military commission to try Hamdan, the commission must satisfy Common Article 3\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of a \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples,\xe2\x80\x9d 6 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 3318.  The terms of this general standard are yet to be elaborated and further defined, but Congress has required compliance with it by referring to the \xe2\x80\x9claw of war\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7821.  The Court correctly concludes that the military commission here does not comply with this provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Common Article 3\xe2\x80\x99s standard of a \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>,<em> </em>supports, at the least, a uniformity principle similar to that codified in \xc2\xa7836(b).  The concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted court\xe2\x80\x9d providing \xe2\x80\x9cindispensable\xe2\x80\x9d judicial guarantees requires consideration of the system of justice under which the commission is established, though no doubt certain minimum standards are applicable.  See <em>ante</em>, at 69\xe2\x80\x9370; 1 Int\xe2\x80\x99l Committee of the Red Cross, Customary International Humanitarian Law 355 (2005) (explaining that courts are \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d under Common Article 3 if they are \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and organised in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regular military courts in our system are the courts-martial established by congressional statutes.  Acts of Congress confer on those courts the jurisdiction to try \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d subject to war crimes prosecution.  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7818.  As the Court explains, moreover, while special military commissions have been convened in previous armed conflicts\xe2\x80\x94a practice recognized in \xc2\xa7821\xe2\x80\x94those military commissions generally have adopted the structure and procedure of courts-martial.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 1 The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies 248 (2d series 1894) (Civil War general order requiring that military commissions \xe2\x80\x9cbe constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules as courts-martial in order to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise\xe2\x80\x9d); W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 835, n.\xc2\xa081 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]ilitary commissions are constituted and composed, and their proceedings are conducted, similarly to general courts-martial\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 United Nations War Crimes Commission, Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals 116\xe2\x80\x93117 (1947) (reprint 1997) (hereinafter Law Reports) (discussing post-World War II regulations requiring that military commissions \xe2\x80\x9chav[e] regard for\xe2\x80\x9d rules of procedure and evidence applicable in general courts-martial); see also <em>ante</em>, at 53\xe2\x80\x9357; <em>post</em>, at 31, n.\xc2\xa015 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Today, moreover, \xc2\xa7836(b)\xe2\x80\x94which took effect after the military trials in the World War II cases invoked by the dissent, see <em>Madsen</em> v. <em>Kinsella,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/341/index.html">343 U. S. 341</a>, 344\xe2\x80\x93345, and n.\xc2\xa06 (1952); <em>Yamashita</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 5; <em>Quirin,</em> 317 U. S., at 23\xe2\x80\x94codifies this presumption of uniformity at least as to \xe2\x80\x9c[p]retrial, trial, and post-trial procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Absent more concrete statutory guidance, this historical and statutory background\xe2\x80\x94which suggests that some practical need must justify deviations from the court-martial model\xe2\x80\x94informs the understanding of which military courts are \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d under United States law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, whether or not the possibility, contemplated by the regulations here, of midtrial procedural changes could by itself render a military commission impermissibly irregular, <em>ante</em>, at 70, n. 65; see also Military Commission Order No. 1, \xc2\xa711 (Aug. 31, 2005), App. to Brief for Petitioner 46a\xe2\x80\x9372a (hereinafter MCO), an acceptable degree of independence from the Executive is necessary to render a commission \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d by the standards of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s system of justice.  And any suggestion of Executive power to interfere with an ongoing judicial process raises concerns about the proceedings\xe2\x80\x99 fairness.  Again, however, courts-martial provide the relevant benchmark.  Subject to constitutional limitations, see <em>Ex parte Milligan,</em> 4 Wall. 2 (1866), Congress has the power and responsibility to determine the necessity for military courts, and to provide the jurisdiction and procedures applicable to them.  The guidance Congress has provided with respect to courts-martial indicates the level of independence and procedural rigor that Congress has deemed necessary, at least as a general matter, in the military context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At a minimum a military commission like the one at issue\xe2\x80\x94a commission specially convened by the President to try specific persons without express congressional authorization\xe2\x80\x94can be \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d by the standards of our military justice system only if some practical need explains deviations from court-martial practice.  In this regard the standard of Common Article 3, applied here in conformity with \xc2\xa7821, parallels the practicability standard of \xc2\xa7836(b).  Section 836, however, is limited by its terms to matters properly characterized as procedural\xe2\x80\x94that is, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]retrial, trial, and post-trial procedures\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94while Common Article 3 permits broader consideration of matters of structure, organization, and mechanisms to promote the tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s insulation from command influence.  Thus the combined effect of the two statutes discussed here\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7836 and 821\xe2\x80\x94is that considerations of practicability must support departures from court-martial practice.  Relevant concerns, as noted earlier, relate to logistical constraints, accommodation of witnesses, security of the proceedings, and the like, not mere expedience or convenience.  This determination, of course, must be made with due regard for the constitutional principle that congressional statutes can be controlling, including the congressional direction that the law of war has a bearing on the determination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These principles provide the framework for an analysis of the specific military commission at issue here.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In assessing the validity of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s military commission the precise circumstances of this case bear emphasis.  The allegations against Hamdan are undoubtedly serious.  Captured in Afghanistan during our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s armed conflict with the Taliban and al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x94a conflict that continues as we speak\xe2\x80\x94Hamdan stands accused of overt acts in furtherance of a conspiracy to commit terrorism:  delivering weapons and ammunition to al Qaeda, acquiring trucks for use by Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s bodyguards, providing security services to bin Laden, and receiving weapons training at a terrorist camp.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a\xe2\x80\x9367a.  Nevertheless, the circumstances of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial present no exigency requiring special speed or precluding careful consideration of evidence.  For roughly four years, Hamdan has been detained at a permanent United States military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  And regardless of the outcome of the criminal proceedings at issue, the Government claims authority to continue to detain him based on his status as an enemy combatant.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against this background, the Court is correct to conclude that the military commission the President has convened to try Hamdan is unauthorized.  <em>Ante</em>, at 62, 69\xe2\x80\x9370, 72.  The following analysis, which expands on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion, explains my reasons for reaching this conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, the structure and composition of the military commission deviate from conventional court-martial standards.  Although these deviations raise questions about the fairness of the trial, no evident practical need explains them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the UCMJ, courts-martial are organized by a \xe2\x80\x9cconvening authority\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94either a commanding officer, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary concerned, or the President.  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7822\xe2\x80\x93824 (2000 ed. and Supp. III).  The convening authority refers charges for trial, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, Rule for Courts-Martial 401 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M.), and selects the court-martial members who vote on the guilt or innocence of the accused and determine the sentence, 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7825(d)(2), 851\xe2\x80\x93852 (2000 ed.); R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 503(a).  Paralleling this structure, under Military Commission Order No. 1 an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Appointing Authority\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94either the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdesignee\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94establishes commissions subject to the order, MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa72, approves and refers charges to be tried by those commissions, \xc2\xa74(B)(2)(a), and appoints commission members who vote on the conviction and sentence, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(A)(1\xe2\x80\x933).  In addition the Appointing Authority determines the number of commission members (at least three), oversees the chief prosecutor, provides \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigative or other resources\xe2\x80\x9d to the defense insofar as he or she \xe2\x80\x9cdeems necessary for a full and fair trial,\xe2\x80\x9d approves or rejects plea agreements, approves or disapproves communications with news media by prosecution or defense counsel (a function shared by the General Counsel of the Department of Defense), and issues supplementary commission regulations (subject to approval by the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, unless the Appointing Authority is the Secretary of Defense).  See MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(A)(2), 5(H), 6(A)(4), 7(A); Military Commission Instruction No. 3, \xc2\xa75(C) (July 15, 2005) (hereinafter MCI), available at www.\ndefenselink.mil/news/Aug2005/d20050811MC13.pdf; MCI No. 4, \xc2\xa75(C) (Sept. 16, 2005), available at www.\ndefenselink.mil/news/Oct2005/d20051003MCI4.pdf MCI No. 6, \xc2\xa73(B)(3) (April 15, 2004), available at www.\ndefenselink.mil/news/Apr2004/d20040420ins6.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against the background of these significant powers for the Appointing Authority, which in certain respects at least conform to ordinary court-martial standards, the regulations governing the commissions at issue make several noteworthy departures.  At a general court-martial\xe2\x80\x94the only type authorized to impose penalties of more than one year\xe2\x80\x99s incarceration or to adjudicate offenses against the law of war, R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 201(f); 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7818\xe2\x80\x93820 (2000 ed. and Supp. III)\xe2\x80\x94the presiding officer who rules on legal issues must be a military judge.  R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 501(a)(1), 801(a)(4)\xe2\x80\x93(5); 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7816(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III); see also R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 201(f)(2)(B)(ii) (likewise requiring a military judge for certain other courts-martial); 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7819 (2000 ed. and Supp. III) (same).  A military judge is an officer who is a member of a state or federal bar and has been specially certified for judicial duties by the Judge Advocate General for the officer\xe2\x80\x99s Armed Service.  R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 502(c); 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7826(b).  To protect their independence, military judges at general courts-martial are \xe2\x80\x9cassigned and directly responsible to the Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate General\xe2\x80\x99s designee.\xe2\x80\x9d  R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 502(c).  They must be detailed to the court, in accordance with applicable regulations, \xe2\x80\x9cby a person assigned as a military judge and directly responsible to the Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate General\xe2\x80\x99s designee.\xe2\x80\x9d  R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 503(b); see also 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7826(c); see generally <em>Weiss</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/163/index.html">510 U. S. 163</a>, 179\xe2\x80\x93181 (1994) (discussing provisions that \xe2\x80\x9cinsulat[e] military judges from the effects of command influence\xe2\x80\x9d and thus \xe2\x80\x9cpreserve judicial impartiality\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, by contrast, the Appointing Authority selects the presiding officer, MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(A)(1), (A)(4); and that officer need only be a judge advocate, that is, a military lawyer, \xc2\xa74(A)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Appointing Authority, moreover, exercises supervisory powers that continue during trial.  Any interlocutory question \xe2\x80\x9cthe disposition of which would effect a termination of proceedings with respect to a charge\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to decision not by the presiding officer, but by the Appointing Authority.  \xc2\xa74(A)(5)(e) (stating that the presiding officer \xe2\x80\x9cshall certify\xe2\x80\x9d such questions to the Appointing Authority).  Other interlocutory questions may be certified to the Appointing Authority as the presiding officer \xe2\x80\x9cdeems appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  While in some circumstances the Government may appeal certain rulings at a court-martial\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9can order or ruling that terminates the proceedings with respect to a charge or specification,\xe2\x80\x9d R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 908(a); see also 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7862(a)\xe2\x80\x94the appeals go to a body called the Court of Criminal Appeals, not to the convening authority.  R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 908; 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7862(b); see also R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 1107 (requiring the convening authority to approve or disapprove the findings and sentence of a court-martial but providing for such action only after entry of sentence and restricting actions that increase penalties); 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7860 (same); cf. \xc2\xa7837(a) (barring command influence on court-martial actions).  The Court of Criminal Appeals functions as the military\xe2\x80\x99s intermediate appeals court; it is established by the Judge Advocate General for each Armed Service and composed of appellate military judges.  R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 1203; 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7866.  This is another means in which, by structure and tradition, the court-martial process is insulated from those who have an interest in the outcome of the proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, in addition to these powers with respect to the presiding officer, the Appointing Authority has greater flexibility in appointing commission members.  While a general court-martial requires, absent a contrary election by the accused, at least five members, R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 501(a)(1); 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7816(1) (2000 ed. and Supp. III), the Appointing Authority here is free, as noted earlier, to select as few as three.  MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa74(A)(2).  This difference may affect the deliberative process and the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As compared to the role of the convening authority in a court-martial, the greater powers of the Appointing Authority here\xe2\x80\x94including even the resolution of dispositive issues in the middle of the trial\xe2\x80\x94raise concerns that the commission\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking may not be neutral.  If the differences are supported by some practical need beyond the goal of constant and ongoing supervision, that need is neither apparent from the record nor established by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s submissions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no answer that, at the end of the day, the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), 119 Stat. 2739, affords military-commission defendants the opportunity for judicial review in federal court.  As the Court is correct to observe, the scope of that review is limited, DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(3)(D), <em>id., </em>at 2743; see also <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, and the review is not automatic if the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence is under 10 years, \xc2\xa71005(e)(3)(B), <em>ibid</em>.  Also, provisions for review of legal issues after trial cannot correct for structural defects, such as the role of the Appointing Authority, that can cast doubt on the factfinding process and the presiding judge\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion during trial.  Before military-commission defendants may obtain judicial review, furthermore, they must navigate a military review process that again raises fairness concerns.  At the outset, the Appointing Authority (unless the Appointing Authority is the Secretary of Defense) performs an \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative review\xe2\x80\x9d of undefined scope, ordering any \xe2\x80\x9csupplementary proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d deemed necessary.  MCO No. 1 \xc2\xa76(H)(3).  After that the case is referred to a three-member\nReview Panel composed of officers selected by the\nSecretary of Defense.  \xc2\xa76(H)(4); MCI No. 9, \xc2\xa74(B) (Oct. 11, 2005), available at www.defenselink.mil/news/Oct2005/\nd20051014MCI9.pdf.  Though the Review Panel may return the case for further proceedings only if a majority \xe2\x80\x9cform[s] a definite and firm conviction that a material error of law occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa76(H)(4); MCI No. 9, \xc2\xa74(C)(1)(a), only one member must have \xe2\x80\x9cexperience as a judge,\xe2\x80\x9d MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa76(H)(4); nothing in the regulations requires that other panel members have legal training.  By comparison to the review of court-martial judgments performed by such independent bodies as the Judge Advocate General, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7862, 864, 866, 867, 869, the review process here lacks structural protections designed to help ensure impartiality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These structural differences between the military commissions and courts-martial\xe2\x80\x94the concentration of functions, including legal decisionmaking, in a single executive official; the less rigorous standards for composition of the tribunal; and the creation of special review procedures in place of institutions created and regulated by Congress\xe2\x80\x94remove safeguards that are important to the fairness of the proceedings and the independence of the court.  Congress has prescribed these guarantees for courts-martial; and no evident practical need explains the departures here.  For these reasons the commission cannot be considered regularly constituted under United States law and thus does not satisfy Congress\xe2\x80\x99 requirement that military commissions conform to the law of war.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from these structural issues, moreover, the basic procedures for the commissions deviate from procedures for courts-martial, in violation of \xc2\xa7836(b).  As the Court explains, <em>ante</em>, at 51, 61, the Military Commission Order abandons the detailed Military Rules of Evidence, which are modeled on the Federal Rules of Evidence in conformity with \xc2\xa7836(a)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of presumptive compliance with district-court rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the order imposes just one evidentiary rule:  \xe2\x80\x9cEvidence shall be admitted if \xe2\x80\xa6 the evidence would have probative value to a reasonable person,\xe2\x80\x9d MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa76(D)(1).  Although it is true some military commissions applied an amorphous evidence standard in the past, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 1 Law Reports 117\xe2\x80\x93118 (discussing World War II military commission orders); Exec. Order No. 9185, 7 Fed. Reg. 5103 (1942) (order convening military commission to try Nazi saboteurs), the evidentiary rules for those commissions were adopted before Congress enacted the uniformity requirement of 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836(b) as part of the UCMJ, see Act of May 5, 1950, ch. 169, 64 Stat. 107, 120, 149.  And while some flexibility may be necessary to permit trial of battlefield captives like Hamdan, military statutes and rules already provide for introduction of deposition testimony for absent witnesses, 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7849(d); R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 702, and use of classified information, Military Rule Evid. 505.  Indeed, the deposition-testimony provision specifically mentions military commissions and thus is one of the provisions the Government concedes must be followed by the commission at issue.  See <em>ante</em>, at 58.  That provision authorizes admission of deposition testimony only if the witness is absent for specified reasons, \xc2\xa7849(d)\xe2\x80\x94a requirement that makes no sense if military commissions may consider all probative evidence.  Whether or not this conflict renders the rules at issue \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to or inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the UCMJ under \xc2\xa7836(a), it creates a uniformity problem under \xc2\xa7836(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule here could permit admission of multiple hearsay and other forms of evidence generally prohibited on grounds of unreliability.  Indeed, the commission regulations specifically contemplate admission of unsworn written statements, MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa76(D)(3); and they make no provision for exclusion of coerced declarations save those \xe2\x80\x9cestablished to have been made as a result of torture,\xe2\x80\x9d MCI No. 10, \xc2\xa73(A) (Mar. 24, 2006), available at www.\ndefenselink.mil/news/Mar2006/d20060327MCI10.pdf; cf. Military Rule Evid. 304(c)(3) (generally barring use of statements obtained \xe2\x80\x9cthrough the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement\xe2\x80\x9d); 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7831(d) (same).  Besides, even if evidence is deemed nonprobative by the presiding officer at Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the military-commission members still may view it.  In another departure from court-martial practice the military commission members may object to the presiding officer\xe2\x80\x99s evidence rulings and determine themselves, by majority vote, whether to admit the evidence.  MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa76(D)(1); cf. R.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M. 801(a)(4), (e)(1) (providing that the military judge at a court-martial determines all questions of law).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court explains, the Government has made no demonstration of practical need for these special rules and procedures, either in this particular case or as to the military commissions in general, <em>ante</em>, at 59\xe2\x80\x9361; nor is any such need self-evident.  For all the Government\xe2\x80\x99s regulations and submissions reveal, it would be feasible for most, if not all, of the conventional military evidence rules and procedures to be followed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, as presently structured, Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s military commission exceeds the bounds Congress has placed on the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7836 and 821 of the UCMJ.  Because Congress has prescribed these limits, Congress can change them, requiring a new analysis consistent with the Constitution and other governing laws.  At this time, however, we must apply the standards Congress has provided.  By those standards the military commission is deficient.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of the conclusion that the military commission here is unauthorized under the UCMJ, I see no need to consider several further issues addressed in the plurality opinion by Justice Stevens and the dissent by Justice Thomas.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, I would not decide whether Common Article 3\xe2\x80\x99s standard\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples,\xe2\x80\x9d 6 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 3320 (\xc2\xb6(1)(d))\xe2\x80\x94necessarily requires that the accused have the right to be present at all stages of a criminal trial.  As Justice Stevens explains, Military Commission Order No. 1 authorizes exclusion of the accused from the proceedings if the presiding officer determines that, among other things, protection of classified information so requires.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76(B)(3), (D)(5); <em>ante</em>, at 50.  Justice Stevens observes that these regulations create the possibility of a conviction and sentence based on evidence Hamdan has not seen or heard\xe2\x80\x94a possibility the plurality is correct to consider troubling.  <em>Ante</em>, at 71\xe2\x80\x9372, n. 67 (collecting cases); see also <em>In re Oliver,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/257/index.html">333 U. S. 257</a>, 277 (1948) (finding \xe2\x80\x9cno support for sustaining petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction of contempt of court upon testimony given in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s absence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the dissent by Justice Thomas points out, however, the regulations bar the presiding officer from admitting secret evidence if doing so would deprive the accused of a \xe2\x80\x9cfull and fair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  MCO No. 1, \xc2\xa76(D)(5)(b); see also <em>post</em>, at 47.  This fairness determination, moreover, is unambiguously subject to judicial review under the DTA.  See \xc2\xa71005(e)(3)(D)(i), 119 Stat. 2743 (allowing review of compliance with the \xe2\x80\x9cstandards and procedures\xe2\x80\x9d in Military Commission Order No. 1).  The evidentiary proceedings at Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s trial have yet to commence, and it remains to be seen whether he will suffer any prejudicial exclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There should be reluctance, furthermore, to reach unnecessarily the question whether, as the plurality seems to conclude, <em>ante</em>, at 70, Article 75 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions is binding law notwithstanding the earlier decision by our Government not to accede to the Protocol.  For all these reasons, and without detracting from the importance of the right of presence, I would rely on other deficiencies noted here and in the opinion by the Court\xe2\x80\x94deficiencies that relate to the structure and procedure of the commission and that inevitably will affect the proceedings\xe2\x80\x94as the basis for finding the military commissions lack authorization under 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836 and fail to be regularly constituted under Common Article 3 and \xc2\xa7821.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I likewise see no need to address the validity of the conspiracy charge against Hamdan\xe2\x80\x94an issue addressed at length in Part V of Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 opinion and in Part II\xe2\x80\x93C of Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 dissent.  See <em>ante</em>, at 36\xe2\x80\x9349; <em>post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9328.  In light of the conclusion that the military commissions at issue are unauthorized Congress may choose to provide further guidance in this area.  Congress, not the Court, is the branch in the better position to undertake the \xe2\x80\x9csensitive task of establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national interest or international justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba</em> v. <em>Sabbatino,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/398/index.html">376 U.

That claim leads me to state briefly what I believe the majority sets forth both explicitly and implicitly at greater length.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion ultimately rests upon a single ground: Congress has not issued the Executive a \xe2\x80\x9cblank check.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/542/507/index.html">542 U.

I add the following comments to provide a further explanation of my reasons for disagreeing with the holding of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The holding of the Court, as I understand it, rests on the following reasoning.  A military commission is lawful only if it is authorized by 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821; this provision permits the use of a commission to try \xe2\x80\x9coffenders or offenses\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cby statute or by the law of war may be tried by\xe2\x80\x9d such a commission; because no statute provides that an offender such as petitioner or an offense such as the one with which he is charged may be tried by a military commission, he may be tried by military commission only if the trial is authorized by \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of war\xe2\x80\x9d; the Geneva Conventions are part of the law of war; and Common Article 3 of the Conventions prohibits petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial because the commission before which he would be tried is not \xe2\x80\x9ca regularly constituted court,\xe2\x80\x9d Third Geneva Convention, Art. 3, \xc2\xb61<em>(d), </em>Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 3316, 3320, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 3364.  I disagree with this holding because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s commission is \xe2\x80\x9ca regularly constituted court.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Common Article 3 provides as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall\nbe bound to apply, as a minimum, the following\nprovisions:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1)\xe2\x80\x82\xe2\x80\xa6 [T]he following acts are and shall remain prohibited \xe2\x80\xa6 :</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(d)\xe2\x80\x82[T]he passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by <em>a regularly constituted court</em> affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 3318\xe2\x80\x933320 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Common Article 3 thus imposes three requirements.  Sentences may be imposed only by (1) a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x9d (2) that is \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) that affords \xe2\x80\x9call the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>.<em>,</em> at 3320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I see no need here to comment extensively on the meaning of the first and third requirements.  The first requirement is largely self-explanatory, and, with respect to the third, I note only that on its face it imposes a uniform international standard that does not vary from signatory to signatory.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second element (\xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d) is the one on which the Court relies, and I interpret this element to require that the court be appointed or established in accordance with the appointing country\xe2\x80\x99s domestic law.  I agree with the Court, see <em>ante</em>, at 69, n. 64, that, as used in Common Article 3, the term \xe2\x80\x9cregularly\xe2\x80\x9d is synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9cproperly.\xe2\x80\x9d  The term \xe2\x80\x9cconstitute\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cappoint,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cset up,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cestablish,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 486 (1961), and therefore \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d means properly appointed, set up, or established.  Our cases repeatedly use the phrases \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproperly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d in this sense.  See, <em>e.g., Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/542/507/index.html">542 U. S. 507</a>, 538 (2004) (plurality opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.); <em>Nguyen</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/69/index.html">539 U.

S. 176</a>, 185 (1878).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to determine whether a court has been properly appointed, set up, or established, it is necessary to refer to a body of law that governs such matters.  I interpret Common Article 3 as looking to the domestic law of the appointing country because I am not aware of any international law standard regarding the way in which such a court must be appointed, set up, or established, and because different countries with different government structures handle this matter differently.  Accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9ca regularly constituted court\xe2\x80\x9d is a court that has been appointed, set up, or established in accordance with the domestic law of the appointing country.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to this interpretation, the opinions supporting the judgment today hold that the military commission before which petitioner would be tried is not \xe2\x80\x9ca regularly constituted court\xe2\x80\x9d (a) because \xe2\x80\x9cno evident practical need explains\xe2\x80\x9d why its \xe2\x80\x9cstructure and composition \xe2\x80\xa6 deviate from conventional court-martial standards,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part); see also <em>ante</em>, at 69\xe2\x80\x9370 (Opinion of the Court); and (b) because, contrary to 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836(b), the procedures specified for use in the proceeding before the military commission impermissibly differ from those provided under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for use by courts-martial, <em>ante</em>, at 52\xe2\x80\x9362 (Opinion of the Court); <em>ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part).  I do not believe that either of these grounds is sound.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I see no basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a military commission cannot be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9ca regularly constituted court\xe2\x80\x9d unless it is similar in structure and composition to a regular military court or unless there is an \xe2\x80\x9cevident practical need\xe2\x80\x9d for the divergence.  There is no reason why a court that differs in structure or composition from an ordinary military court must be viewed as having been improperly constituted.  Tribunals that vary significantly in structure, composition, and procedures may all be \xe2\x80\x9cregularly\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cproperly\xe2\x80\x9d constituted.  Consider, for example, a municipal court, a state trial court of general jurisdiction, an Article I federal trial court, a federal district court, and an international court, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.  Although these courts are \xe2\x80\x9cdifferently constituted\xe2\x80\x9d and differ substantially in many other respects, they are all \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Common Article 3 had been meant to require trial before a country\xe2\x80\x99s military courts or courts that are similar in structure and composition, the drafters almost certainly would have used language that expresses that thought more directly.  Other provisions of the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War refer expressly to the ordinary military courts and expressly prescribe the \xe2\x80\x9cuniformity principle\xe2\x80\x9d that Justice Kennedy sees in Common Article 3, see <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Article 84 provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] prisoner of war shall be tried only by a military court, unless the existing laws of the Detaining Power expressly permit the civil courts to try a member of the armed forces of the Detaining Power in respect of the particular offence alleged to have been committed by the prisoner of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 U. S. T., at 3382.  Article 87 states that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]risoners of war may not be sentenced by the military authorities and courts of the Detaining Power to any penalties except those provided for in respect of members of the armed forces of the said Power who have committed the same acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 3384.  Similarly, Article 66 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Civilian Persons in Time of War\xe2\x80\x94a provision to which the Court looks for guidance in interpreting Common Article 3, see <em>ante</em> at 69\xe2\x80\x94expressly provides that civilians charged with committing crimes in occupied territory may be handed over by the occupying power \xe2\x80\x9cto its properly constituted, non-political military courts, on condition that the said courts sit in the occupied country.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 U. S. T. 3516, 3558\xe2\x80\x933560, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 3365.  If Common Article 3 had been meant to incorporate a \xe2\x80\x9cuniformity principle,\xe2\x80\x9d it presumably would have used language like that employed in the provisions noted above.  For these reasons, I cannot agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the military commission at issue here is not a \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted court\xe2\x80\x9d because its structure and composition differ from those of a court-martial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the suggestion of the Court, see <em>ante</em>, at 69, the commentary on Article 66 of Fourth Geneva Convention does not undermine this conclusion.  As noted, Article 66 permits an occupying power to try civilians in its \xe2\x80\x9cproperly constituted, non-political military courts,\xe2\x80\x9d 6 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 3558.  The commentary on this provision states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe courts are to be \xe2\x80\x98regularly constituted\xe2\x80\x99.  This wording definitely excludes all special tribunals.  It is the ordinary military courts of the Occupying Power which will be competent.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Int\xe2\x80\x99l Comm. of Red Cross, Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 340 (1958) (hereinafter GCIV Commentary).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court states that this commentary \xe2\x80\x9cdefines \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 tribunals to include \xe2\x80\x98ordinary military courts\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98definitely exclud[e] all special tribunals.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 69 (alteration in original).  This much is clear from the commentary itself.  Yet the mere statement that a military court <em>is</em> a regularly constituted tribunal is of no help in addressing petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his commission <em>is not</em> such a tribunal.  As for the commentary\xe2\x80\x99s mention of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial tribunals,\xe2\x80\x9d it is doubtful whether we should take this gloss on Article 66\xe2\x80\x94which forbids an <em>occupying power</em> from trying <em>civilians</em> in courts set up specially for that purpose\xe2\x80\x94to tell us much about the very different context addressed by Common Article 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if Common Article 3 recognizes this prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cspecial tribunals,\xe2\x80\x9d that prohibition does not cover petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s tribunal.  If \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d means anything in contradistinction to \xe2\x80\x9cregular,\xe2\x80\x9d it would be in the sense of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9crelating to a single thing,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cregular\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cuniform in course, practice, or occurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2186, 1913.  Insofar as respondents propose to conduct the tribunals according to the procedures of Military Commission Order No. 1 and orders promulgated thereunder\xe2\x80\x94and nobody has suggested respondents intend otherwise\xe2\x80\x94then it seems that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s tribunal, like the hundreds of others respondents propose to conduct, is very much regular and not at all special.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I also disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s military commission is \xe2\x80\x9cillegal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 62, because its procedures allegedly do not comply with 10  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836.  Even if \xc2\xa7836(b), unlike Common Article 3, does impose at least a limited uniformity requirement amongst the tribunals contemplated by the UCMJ, but see <em>ante</em>, at 35 (Thomas, J., dissenting), and even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that some of the procedures specified in Military Commission Order No. 1 impermissibly deviate from court-martial procedures, it does not follow that the military commissions created by that order are not \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d or that trying petitioner before such a commission would be inconsistent with the law of war.  If Congress enacted a statute requiring the federal district courts to follow a procedure that is unconstitutional, the statute would be invalid, but the district courts would not.  Likewise, if some of the procedures that may be used in military commission proceedings are improper, the appropriate remedy is to proscribe the use of those particular procedures, not to outlaw the commissions.  I see no justification for striking down the entire commission structure simply because it is possible that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial might involve the use of some procedure that is improper.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Returning to the three elements of Common Article 3\xe2\x80\x94(1) a court, (2) that is appointed, set up, and established in compliance with domestic law, and (3) that respects universally recognized fundamental rights\xe2\x80\x94I conclude that all of these elements are satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the commissions qualify as courts.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the commissions were appointed, set up, and established pursuant to an order of the President, just like the commission in <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942), and the Court acknowledges that <em>Quirin</em> recognized that the statutory predecessor of 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821 \xe2\x80\x9cpreserved\xe2\x80\x9d the President\xe2\x80\x99s power \xe2\x80\x9cto convene military commissions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 29.  Although Justice Kennedy concludes that \xe2\x80\x9can acceptable degree of independence from the Executive is necessary to render a commission \xe2\x80\x98regularly constituted\xe2\x80\x99 by the standards of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s system of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, he offers no support for this proposition (which in any event seems to be more about fairness or integrity than regularity).  The commission in <em>Quirin</em> was certainly no more independent from the Executive than the commissions at issue here, and 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7821 and 836 do not speak to this issue.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the commission procedures, taken as a whole, and including the availability of review by a United States Court of Appeals and by this Court<em>,</em> do not provide a basis for deeming the commissions to be illegitimate.  The Court questions the following two procedural rules: the rule allowing the Secretary of Defense to change the governing rules \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98from time to time\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (which does not rule out mid-trial changes), see <em>ante</em>, at 70, n. 65 (Opinion of the Court); <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part), and the rule that permits the admission of any evidence that would have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98probative value to a reasonable person\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (which departs from our legal system\xe2\x80\x99s usual rules of evidence), see <em>ante</em>, at 51, 60 (Opinion of the Court); <em>ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Neither\nof these two rules undermines the legitimacy of the\ncommissions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Surely the entire commission structure cannot be stricken merely because it is possible that the governing rules might be changed during the course of one or more proceedings.  <em>If</em> a change is made and applied during the course of an ongoing proceeding and <em>if</em> the accused is found guilty, the validity of that procedure can be considered in the review proceeding for that case.  After all, not every midtrial change will be prejudicial.  A midtrial change might amend the governing rules in a way that is inconsequential or actually favorable to the accused.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the standard for the admission of evidence at commission proceedings, the Court does not suggest that this rule violates the international standard incorporated into Common Article 3 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples,\xe2\x80\x9d 6 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 3320).  Rules of evidence differ from country to country, and much of the world does not follow aspects of our evidence rules, such as the general prohibition against the admission of hearsay.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Blumenthal, Shedding Some Light on Calls for Hearsay Reform: Civil Law Hearsay Rules in Historical and Modern Perspective, 13 Pace Int\xe2\x80\x99l L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 93, 96\xe2\x80\x93101 (2001).  If a particular accused claims to have been unfairly prejudiced by the admission of particular evidence, that claim can be reviewed in the review proceeding for that case.  It makes no sense to strike down the entire commission structure based on speculation that some evidence might be improperly admitted in some future case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I believe that Common Article 3 is satisfied here because the military commissions (1) qualify as courts, (2) that were appointed and established in accordance with domestic law, and (3) any procedural improprieties that might occur in particular cases can be reviewed in those cases.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The commentary on Common Article 3 supports this interpretation.  The commentary on Common Article 3, \xc2\xb61(d), in its entirety states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A]lthough [sentences and executions without a proper trial] were common practice until quite recently, they are nevertheless shocking to the civilized mind\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Sentences and executions without previous trial are too open to error.  \xe2\x80\x98Summary justice\xe2\x80\x99 may be effective on account of the fear it arouses \xe2\x80\xa6 , but it adds too many further innocent victims to all the other innocent victims of the conflict.  All civilized nations surround the administration of justice with safeguards aimed at eliminating the possibility of judicial errors.  The Convention has rightly proclaimed that it is essential to do this even in time of war.  <em>We must be very clear about one point: it is only \xe2\x80\x98summary\xe2\x80\x99 justice which it is intended to prohibit.  </em>No sort of immunity is given to anyone under this provision.  There is nothing in it to prevent a person presumed to be guilty from being arrested and so placed in a position where he can do no further harm; and it leaves intact the right of the State to prosecute, sentence and punish according to the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  GCIV Commentary 39 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems clear that the commissions at issue here meet this standard.  Whatever else may be said about the system that was created by Military Commission Order No. 1 and augmented by the Detainee Treatment Act, \xc2\xa71005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742, this system\xe2\x80\x94which features formal trial procedures, multiple levels of administrative review, and the opportunity for review by a United States Court of Appeals and by this Court\xe2\x80\x94does not dispense \xe2\x80\x9csummary justice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Section 821 looks to the \xe2\x80\x9claw of war,\xe2\x80\x9d not separation of powers issues.

The Court having concluded otherwise, it is appropriate to respond to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the merits of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims because its opinion openly flouts our well-established duty to respect the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in matters of military operations and foreign affairs.

Consistent with this conclusion, the Constitution vests in the President \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he executive Power,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa71, provides that he \xe2\x80\x9cshall be Commander in Chief\xe2\x80\x9d of the Armed Forces, \xc2\xa72, and places in him the power to recognize foreign governments, \xc2\xa73.  This Court has observed that these provisions confer upon the President broad constitutional authority to protect the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s security in the manner he deems fit.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Prize Cases,</em> 2 Black 635, 668 (1863) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf a war be made by invasion of a foreign nation, the President is not only authorized but bound to resist force by force \xe2\x80\xa6 without waiting for any special legislative authority\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Page,</em> 9 How. 603, 615 (1850) (acknowledging that the President has the authority to \xe2\x80\x9cemploy [the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Armed Forces] in the manner he may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress, to be sure, has a substantial and essential role in both foreign affairs and national security.  But \xe2\x80\x9cCongress cannot anticipate and legislate with regard to every possible action the President may find it necessary to take or every possible situation in which he might act,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch failure of Congress \xe2\x80\xa6 does not, \xe2\x80\x98especially \xe2\x80\xa6 in the areas of foreign policy and national security,\xe2\x80\x99 imply \xe2\x80\x98congressional disapproval\xe2\x80\x99 of action taken by the Executive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dames &amp; Moore</em> v. <em>Regan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/654/index.html">453 U.

Rather, in these domains, the fact that Congress has provided the President with broad authorities does not imply\xe2\x80\x94and the Judicial Branch should not infer\xe2\x80\x94that Congress intended to deprive him of particular powers not specifically enumerated. See <em>Dames &amp; Moore</em>, 453 U.

Accordingly, in the very context that we address today, this Court has concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe detention and trial of petitioners\xe2\x80\x94ordered by the President in the declared exercise of his powers as Commander in Chief of the Army in time of war and of grave public danger\xe2\x80\x94are not to be set aside by the courts without the clear conviction that they are in conflict with the Constitution or laws of Congress constitutionally enacted.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ex parte</em> <em>Quirin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html">317 U.

In the present conflict, Congress has authorized the President \xe2\x80\x9cto use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons <em>he determines</em> planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 \xe2\x80\xa6 in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) 115 Stat. 224, note following 50 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71541 (2000 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added).  As a plurality of the Court observed in <em>Hamdi</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9ccapture, detention, and <em>trial</em> of unlawful combatants, by \xe2\x80\x98universal agreement and practice,\xe2\x80\x99 are \xe2\x80\x98important incident[s] of war,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hamdi</em>, 542 U.

S., at 518; <em>id</em>., at 587 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  <em>Hamdi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s observation that military commissions are included within the AUMF\xe2\x80\x99s authorization is supported by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous recognition that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n important incident to the conduct of war is the adoption of measures by the military commander, not only to repel and defeat the enemy, but to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who, in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort, have violated the law of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Yamashita,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/327/1/index.html">327 U.

Instead, the Court determines the scope of this power based exclusively on Article 21 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821, the successor to Article 15 of the Articles of War, which <em>Quirin </em>held \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized trial of offenses against the law of war before [military] commissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  317 U. S., at 29.  As I shall discuss below, Article 21 alone supports the use of commissions here.  Nothing in the language of Article 21, however, suggests that it outlines the entire reach of congressional authorization of military commissions in all conflicts\xe2\x80\x94quite the contrary, the language of Article 21 presupposes the existence of military commissions under an independent basis of authorization.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Indeed, consistent with <em>Hamdi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the AUMF itself authorizes the trial of unlawful combatants, the original sanction for military commissions historically derived from congressional authorization of \xe2\x80\x9cthe initiation of war\xe2\x80\x9d with its attendant authorization of \xe2\x80\x9cthe employment of all necessary and proper agencies for its due prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).  Accordingly, congressional authorization for military commissions pertaining to the instant conflict derives not only from Article 21 of the UCMJ, but also from the more recent, and broader, authorization contained in the AUMF.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I note the Court\xe2\x80\x99s error respecting the AUMF not because it is necessary to my resolution of this case\xe2\x80\x94Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s military commission can plainly be sustained solely under Article 21\xe2\x80\x94but to emphasize the complete congressional sanction of the President\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of his commander-in-chief authority to conduct the present war.  In such circumstances, as previously noted, our duty to defer to the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s military and foreign policy judgment is at its zenith; it does not countenance the kind of second-guessing the Court repeatedly engages in today.  Military and foreign policy judgments </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98are and should be undertaken only by those directly responsible to the people whose welfare they advance or imperil.

Thus, I do not dispute that military commissions have historically been \xe2\x80\x9cused in three [different] situations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332, and that the only situation relevant to the instant case is the use of military commissions \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who \xe2\x80\xa6 have violated the law of war,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 32 (quoting <em>Quirin, supra</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329).  Similarly, I agree with the plurality that Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s treatise sets forth the four relevant considerations for determining the scope of a military commission\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, considerations relating to the (1) time and (2) place of the offense, (3) the status of the offender, and (4) the nature of the offense charged.  Winthrop 836\xe2\x80\x93840.  The Executive has easily satisfied these considerations here.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion rests upon an incomplete accounting and an unfaithful application of those considerations.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first two considerations are that a law-of-war military commission may only assume jurisdiction of \xe2\x80\x9coffences committed within the field of the command of the convening commander,\xe2\x80\x9d and that such offenses \xe2\x80\x9cmust have been committed within the period of the war.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 836, 837; <em>ante</em>, at 33.  Here, as evidenced by Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s charging document, the Executive has determined that the theater of the present conflict includes \xe2\x80\x9cAfghanistan, Pakistan and other countries\xe2\x80\x9d where al Qaeda has established training camps, App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a, and that the duration of that conflict dates back (at least) to Usama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s August 1996 \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Declaration of Jihad Against the Americans</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  Under the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s description of the conflict, then, every aspect of the charge, which alleges overt acts in \xe2\x80\x9cAfghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and other countries\xe2\x80\x9d taking place from 1996 to 2001, satisfies the temporal and geographic prerequisites for the exercise of law-of-war military commission jurisdiction.  <em>Id</em>., at 65a\xe2\x80\x9367a.  And these judgments pertaining to the scope of the theater and duration of the present conflict are committed solely to the President in the exercise of his commander-in-chief authority.  See <em>Prize Cases,</em> 2 Black, at 670 (concluding that the President\xe2\x80\x99s commander-in-chief judgment about the nature of a particular conflict was \xe2\x80\x9ca question to be decided <em>by him</em>, and this Court must be governed by the decisions and acts of the political department of the Government to which this power was entrusted\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, the plurality concludes that the legality of the charge against Hamdan is doubtful because \xe2\x80\x9cHamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a theater of war \xe2\x80\xa6 but with an <em>agreement</em> the inception of which long predated \xe2\x80\xa6 the [relevant armed conflict].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 48 (emphasis in original).  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to second-guess the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s judgments in this context, based upon little more than its unsupported assertions, constitutes an unprecedented departure from the traditionally limited role of the courts with respect to war and an unwarranted intrusion on executive authority.  And even if such second-guessing were appropriate, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to do so is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, the plurality relies upon the date of the AUMF\xe2\x80\x99s enactment to determine the beginning point for the \xe2\x80\x9cperiod of the war,\xe2\x80\x9d Winthrop 836, thereby suggesting that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s commission does not have jurisdiction to try him for offenses committed prior to the AUMF\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  <em>Ante</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9336, 48.  But this suggestion betrays the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s unfamiliarity with the realities of warfare and its willful blindness to our precedents.  The starting point of the present conflict (or indeed any conflict) is not determined by congressional enactment, but rather by the initiation of hostilities.  See <em>Prize Cases, supra,</em> at 668 (recognizing that war may be initiated by \xe2\x80\x9cinvasion of a foreign nation,\xe2\x80\x9d and that such initiation, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s response, usually <em>precedes</em> congressional action).  Thus, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of the AUMF did not mark the beginning of this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s conflict with al Qaeda, but instead authorized the President to use force in the midst of an ongoing conflict.  Moreover, while the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwar powers\xe2\x80\x9d may not have been activated until the AUMF was passed, <em>ante</em>, 35, n. 31, the date of such activation has never been used to determine the scope of a military commission\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Instead, the traditional rule is that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ffenses committed before a formal declaration of war or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  Green, The Military Commission, 42 Am.

Consistent with this principle, on facts virtually identical to those here, a military commission tried Julius Otto Kuehn for conspiring with Japanese officials to betray the United States Fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government prior to its attack on Pearl Harbor.  Green 848.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the present conflict dates at least to 1996 is supported by overwhelming evidence.  According to the State Department, al Qaeda <em>declared war</em> on the United States as early as August 1996.  See Dept. of State Fact Sheet: Usama bin Ladin (Aug. 21, 1998); Dept. of State Fact Sheet: The Charges against International Terrorist Usama Bin Laden (Dec. 20, 2000); cf. <em>Prize Cases</em>, 2 Black, at 668 (recognizing that a state of war exists even if \xe2\x80\x9cthe declaration of it be <em>unilateral</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).  In February 1998, al Qaeda leadership issued another statement ordering the indiscriminate\xe2\x80\x94and, even under the laws of war as applied to legitimate nation-states, plainly illegal\xe2\x80\x94killing of American civilians and military personnel alike.  See Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders: World Islamic Front Statement 2 (Feb. 23, 1998), in Y. Alexander &amp; M. Swetnam, Usama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s al-Qaida: Profile of a Terrorist Network, App. 1B (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe ruling to kill the Americans and their allies\xe2\x80\x94civilians and military\xe2\x80\x94is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it\xe2\x80\x9d).  This was not mere rhetoric; even before September 11, 2001, al Qaeda was involved in the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City in 1993, the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996, the bombing of the U. S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and the attack on the U. S.\xc2\xa0S. <em>Cole</em> in Yemen in 2000.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1.  In response to these incidents, the United States \xe2\x80\x9cattack[ed] facilities belonging to Usama bin Ladin\xe2\x80\x99s network\xe2\x80\x9d as early as 1998.  Dept. of State Fact Sheet: Usama bin Ladin (Aug. 21, 1998).  Based on the foregoing, the President\xe2\x80\x99s judgment\xe2\x80\x94that the present conflict substantially predates the AUMF, extending at least as far back as al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s 1996 declaration of war on our Nation, and that the theater of war extends at least as far as the localities of al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s principal bases of operations\xe2\x80\x94is beyond judicial reproach.  And the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s unsupportable contrary determination merely confirms that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for making military or foreign affairs judgments.  <em>Hamdi</em>, 542 U.

Law-of-war military commissions have jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98individuals of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s army who have been guilty of illegitimate warfare or other offences in violation of the laws of war,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 33-34 (quoting Winthrop 838).  They also have jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9c[i]rregular armed bodies or persons not forming part of the organized forces of a belligerent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwho would not be likely to respect the laws of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 783, 784.  Indeed, according to Winthrop, such persons are not \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the protection of the laws of war\xe2\x80\x9d and were \xe2\x80\x9cliable to be shot, imprisoned, or banished, either summarily where their guilt was clear or upon trial and conviction by military commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 784.  This consideration is easily satisfied here, as Hamdan is an unlawful combatant charged with joining and conspiring with a terrorist network dedicated to flouting the laws of war.  344 F. Supp. 2d 152, 161 (DC 2004); App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a\xe2\x80\x9367a.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fourth consideration relevant to the jurisdiction of law-of-war military commissions relates to the nature of the offense charged.  As relevant here, such commissions have jurisdiction to try \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[v]iolations of the laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribunals only,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 34 (quoting Winthrop 839).  In contrast to the preceding considerations, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents establish that judicial review of \xe2\x80\x9cwhether any of the acts charged is an offense against the law of war cognizable before a military tribunal\xe2\x80\x9d is appropriate.  <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 29.  However, \xe2\x80\x9ccharges of violations of the law of war triable before a military tribunal need not be stated with the precision of a common law indictment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U. S., at 17.  And whether an offense is a violation of the law of war cognizable before a military commission must be determined pursuant to \xe2\x80\x9cthe system of common law applied by military tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Q<em>uirin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 30; <em>Yamashita</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common law of war as it pertains to offenses triable by military commission is derived from the \xe2\x80\x9cexperience of our wars\xe2\x80\x9d and our wartime tribunals, Winthrop 839, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe laws and usages of war as understood and practiced by the civilized nations of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d 11 Op. Atty. Gen. 297, 310 (1865).  Moreover, the common law of war is marked by two important features.  First, as with the common law generally, it is flexible and evolutionary in nature, building upon the experience of the past and taking account of the exigencies of the present.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he law of war, like every other code of laws, declares what shall not be done, and does not say what may be done.  The legitimate use of the great power of war, or rather the prohibitions upon the use of that power, increase or diminish as the necessity of the case demands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 300.  Accordingly, this Court has recognized that the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cour common-law war courts\xe2\x80\x9d has not been \xe2\x80\x9cprescribed by statute,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9chas been adapted in each instance to the need that called it forth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 346\xe2\x80\x93348.  Second, the common law of war affords a measure of respect for the judgment of military commanders.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he commander of an army in time of war has the same power to organize military tribunals and execute their judgments that he has to set his squadrons in the field and fight battles.  His authority in each case is from the law and usage of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 Op. Atty. Gen., at 305.  In recognition of these principles, Congress has generally \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98left it to the President, and the military commanders representing him, to employ the commission, <em>as occasion may require</em>, for the investigation and punishment of violations of the law of war.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Madsen,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 347, n. 9 (quoting Winthrop 831; emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In one key respect, the plurality departs from the proper framework for evaluating the adequacy of the charge against Hamdan under the laws of war.  The plurality holds that where, as here, \xe2\x80\x9cneither the elements of the offense nor the range of permissible punishments is defined by statute or treaty, the precedent [establishing whether an offense is triable by military commission] must be plain and unambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 38.  This is a pure contrivance, and a bad one at that.  It is contrary to the presumption we acknowledged in <em>Quirin</em>, namely, that the actions of military commissions are \xe2\x80\x9cnot to be set aside by the courts without the <em>clear conviction</em> that they are\xe2\x80\x9d unlawful, 317 U. S., at 25 (emphasis added).  It is also contrary to <em>Yamashita</em>, which recognized the legitimacy of that military commission notwithstanding a substantial disagreement pertaining to whether Yamashita had been charged with a violation of the law of war.  Compare 327 U. S., at 17 (noting that the allegations were \xe2\x80\x9cadequat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be stated with \xe2\x80\xa6 precision\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>id</em>., at 35 (Murphy, J., dissenting) (arguing that the charge was inadequate).  Nor does it find support from the separation of powers authority cited by the plurality.  Indeed, Madison\xe2\x80\x99s praise of the separation of powers in The Federalist No. 47, quoted <em>ante</em>, at 38-39, if it has any relevance at all, merely highlights the illegitimacy of today\xe2\x80\x99s judicial intrusion onto core executive prerogatives in the waging of war, where executive competence is at its zenith and judicial competence at its nadir.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s newly minted clear-statement rule is also fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of the common law which, by definition, evolves and develops over time and does not, in all cases, \xe2\x80\x9csay what may be done.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 Op. Atty. Gen., at 300.  Similarly, it is inconsistent with the nature of warfare, which also evolves and changes over time, and for which a flexible, evolutionary common-law system is uniquely appropriate.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Though the charge against Hamdan easily satisfies even the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s manufactured rule, see <em>supra</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9328, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s inflexible approach has dangerous implications for the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s ability to discharge his duties as Commander in Chief in future cases.  We should undertake to determine whether an unlawful combatant has been charged with an offense against the law of war with an understanding that the common law of war is flexible, responsive to the exigencies of the present conflict, and deferential to the judgment of military commanders.</p>\n<p>\n\n1</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under either the correct, flexible approach to evaluating the adequacy of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s charge, or under the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s new, clear-statement approach, Hamdan has been charged with conduct constituting two distinct violations of the law of war cognizable before a military commission: membership in a war-criminal enterprise and conspiracy to commit war crimes.  The charging section of the indictment alleges both that Hamdan \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, and that he \xe2\x80\x9cconspired and agreed with [al Qaeda] to commit \xe2\x80\xa6 offenses triable by military commission,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common law of war establishes that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s willful and knowing membership in al Qaeda is a war crime chargeable before a military commission.  Hamdan, a confirmed enemy combatant and member or affiliate of al Qaeda, has been charged with willfully and knowingly joining a group (al Qaeda) whose purpose is \xe2\x80\x9cto support violent attacks against property and nationals (both military and civilian) of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 64a;<em> </em>344 F.

The IMT designated various components of four Nazi groups\xe2\x80\x94the Leadership Corps, Gestapo, SD, and SS\xe2\x80\x94as criminal organizations.  22 IMT, Trial of the Major War Criminals 505, 511, 517 (1948); see also T.

Under this authority, the United States Military Tribunal at Nuremberg convicted numerous individuals for the act of knowing and voluntary membership in these organizations.  For example, in Military Tribunal Case No. 1, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brandt,</em> Karl Brandt, Karl Gebhardt, Rudolf Brandt, Joachim Mrugowsky, Wolfram Sievers, Viktor Brack, and Waldemar Hoven, were convicted and sentenced to death for the crime of, <em>inter alia</em>,<em> </em>membership in an organization declared criminal by the IMT; Karl Genzken and Fritz Fischer were sentenced to life imprisonment for the same; and Helmut Poppendick was convicted of no other offense than membership in a criminal organization and sentenced to a 10-year term of imprisonment.  2 Trials 180\xe2\x80\x93300.

World War II provides the most recent examples of the use of American military commissions to try offenses pertaining to violations of the laws of war.  In that conflict, the orders establishing the jurisdiction of military commissions in various theaters of operation provided that conspiracy to violate the laws of war was a cognizable offense.  See Letter, General Headquarters, United States Army Forces, Pacific (Sept. 24, 1945), Record in <em>Yamashita</em> v. <em>Styer</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1945, No. 672, pp.\xc2\xa014, 16 (Exh.

And conspiracy to violate the laws of war was charged in the highest profile case tried before a World War II military commission, see <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Colepaugh </em>v. <em>Looney</em>, 235 F.\xc2\xa02d 429, 431 (CA10 1956); Green 848 (describing the conspiracy trial of Julius Otto Kuehn).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To support its contrary conclusion, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 35\xe2\x80\x9336, the plurality attempts to evade the import of <em>Quirin</em> (and the other World War II authorities) by resting upon this Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to address the sufficiency of the conspiracy charge in the <em>Quirin</em> case, <em>ante</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9343.  But the common law of war cannot be ascertained from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pass upon an issue, or indeed to even mention the issue in its opinion;[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] rather, it is ascertained by the practice and usage of war.

The plurality attempts to explain these examples away by suggesting that the conspiracies listed by Winthrop are best understood as \xe2\x80\x9ca species of compound offense,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, violations both of the law of war and ordinary criminal laws, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cstand-alone offense[s] against the law of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 44\xe2\x80\x9345 (citing, as an example, murder in violation of the laws of war).

Rather, if anything, and consistent with the principle that the common law of war is flexible and affords some level of deference to the judgments of military commanders, it establishes that military commissions would have the discretion to try the offense as (1) one against the law of war, or (2) one against the ordinary criminal laws, or (3) both.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s effort to avoid the import of Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s footnote through the smokescreen of its \xe2\x80\x9ccompound offense\xe2\x80\x9d theory, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 44\xe2\x80\x9345, cannot be reconciled with the particular charges that sustained military commission jurisdiction in the cases that Winthrop cites.

These examples provide incontrovertible support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the common law of war permits military commission trials for conspiracy to violate the law of war.  And they specifically contradict the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion to the contrary, thereby easily satisfying its requirement that the Government \xe2\x80\x9cmake a substantial showing that the crime for which it seeks to try a defendant by military commission is acknowledged to be an offense against the law of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 39-40.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality further contends, in reliance upon Winthrop, that conspiracy is not an offense cognizable before a law-of-war military commission because \xe2\x80\x9cit is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt<em>.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <em>Ibid</em>.  But Winthrop does not support the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  The passage in Winthrop cited by the plurality states only that \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in <em>overt acts</em>, <em>i.e.</em> in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions merely.\xe2\x80\x9d  Winthrop 841 (emphasis in original).  This passage would be helpful to the plurality if its subject were \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracy,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction of the military commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  Winthrop is not speaking here of the requirements for a conspiracy charge, but of the requirements for <em>all </em>charges.  Intentions do not suffice.  An unlawful act\xe2\x80\x94such as committing the crime of conspiracy\xe2\x80\x94is necessary.  Winthrop says nothing to exclude either conspiracy or membership in a criminal enterprise, both of which go beyond \xe2\x80\x9cintentions merely\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconsis[t] of <em>overt acts,</em> <em>i.e.</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit,\xe2\x80\x9d and both of which are <em>expressly </em>recognized by Winthrop as crimes against the law of war triable by military commissions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 784; <em>id.</em>, at 839, and n.\xc2\xa05, 840.  Indeed, the commission of an <em>\xe2\x80\x9covert ac[t]\xe2\x80\x9d</em> is the traditional requirement for the completion of the crime of conspiracy, and the charge against Hamdan alleges numerous such overt acts.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach, unsupported by Winthrop, requires that any overt act to further a conspiracy must <em>itself</em> be a completed war crime <em>distinct from conspiracy</em>\xe2\x80\x94which merely begs the question the plurality sets out to answer, namely, whether conspiracy itself may constitute a violation of the law of war.  And, even the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s unsupported standard is satisfied here.  Hamdan has been charged with the overt acts of providing protection, transportation, weapons, and other services to the enemy, <em>id.</em>, at 65a\xe2\x80\x9367a, acts which in and of themselves are violations of the laws of war.  See <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 20\xe2\x80\x9321; Winthrop 839\xe2\x80\x93840.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Hamdan has not been charged with an offense triable before a military commission rests not upon any historical example or authority, but upon the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s raw judgment of the \xe2\x80\x9cinability on the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition \xe2\x80\xa6 for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This judgment starkly confirms that the plurality has appointed itself the ultimate arbiter of what is quintessentially a policy and military judgment, namely, the appropriate military measures to take against those who \xe2\x80\x9caided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\xe2\x80\x9d  AUMF \xc2\xa72(a), 115 Stat. 224.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission is illegitimate because it is not dispensing swift justice on the battlefield is unsupportable.  <em>Ante</em>, at 43.  Even a cursory review of the authorities confirms that law-of-war military commissions have wide-ranging jurisdiction to try offenses against the law of war in exigent and nonexigent circumstances alike.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Winthrop 839\xe2\x80\x93840; see also <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U. S., at 5 (military commission trial after the cessation of hostilities in the Philippines); <em>Quirin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/1/index.html">317 U. S. 1</a> (military commission trial in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.).  Traditionally, retributive justice for heinous war crimes is as much a \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary necessity\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cdemands\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary efficiency\xe2\x80\x9d touted by the plurality, and swift military retribution is precisely what Congress authorized the President to impose on the September 11 attackers in the AUMF.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today a plurality of this Court would hold that conspiracy to massacre innocent civilians does not violate the laws of war.  This determination is unsustainable.  The judgment of the political branches that Hamdan, and others like him, must be held accountable before military commissions for their involvement with and membership in an unlawful organization dedicated to inflicting massive civilian casualties is supported by virtually every relevant authority, including all of the authorities invoked by the plurality today.  It is also supported by the nature of the present conflict.  We are not engaged in a traditional battle with a nation-state, but with a worldwide, hydra-headed enemy, who lurks in the shadows conspiring to reproduce the atrocities of September 11, 2001, and who has boasted of sending suicide bombers into civilian gatherings, has proudly distributed videotapes of beheadings of civilian workers, and has tortured and dismembered captured American soldiers.  But according to the plurality, when our Armed Forces capture those who are plotting terrorist atrocities like the bombing of the Khobar Towers, the bombing of the U. S.\xc2\xa0S. <em>Cole,</em> and the attacks of September 11\xe2\x80\x94even if their plots are advanced to the very brink of fulfillment\xe2\x80\x94our military cannot charge those criminals with any offense against the laws of war.  Instead, our troops must catch the terrorists \xe2\x80\x9credhanded,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 48, in the midst of <em>the attack itself</em>, in order to bring them to justice.  Not only is this conclusion fundamentally inconsistent with the cardinal principal of the law of war, namely protecting non-combatants, but it would sorely hamper the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to confront and defeat a new and deadly enemy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After seeing the plurality overturn longstanding precedents in order to seize jurisdiction over this case, <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934 (Scalia, J., dissenting), and after seeing them disregard the clear prudential counsel that they abstain in these circumstances from using equitable powers, <em>ante, </em>at 19\xe2\x80\x9324, it is no surprise to see them go on to overrule one after another of the President\xe2\x80\x99s judgments pertaining to the conduct of an ongoing war.  Those Justices who today disregard the commander-in-chief\xe2\x80\x99s wartime decisions, only 10 days ago deferred to the judgment of the Corps of Engineers with regard to a matter much more within the competence of lawyers, upholding that agency\xe2\x80\x99s wildly implausible conclusion that a storm drain is a tributary of the waters of the United States.  See <em>Rapanos </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 547 U. S. ___(2006).  It goes without saying that there is much more at stake here than storm drains.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to second-guess the determination of the political branches that  these conspirators must be brought to justice is both unprecedented and dangerous.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court holds that even if \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government has charged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission, the commission lacks power to proceed\xe2\x80\x9d because of its failure to comply with the terms of the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  <em>Ante</em>, at 49.  This position is untenable.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As with the jurisdiction of military commissions, the procedure of such commissions \xe2\x80\x9chas [not] been prescribed by statute,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9chas been adapted in each instance to the need that called it forth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 347\xe2\x80\x93348.  Indeed, this Court has concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the absence of attempts by Congress to limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s power, it appears that, as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, he may, in time of war, establish and prescribe the jurisdiction and procedure of military commissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 348.  This conclusion is consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that military commissions are \xe2\x80\x9cour common-law war courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 346\xe2\x80\x93347.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  As such, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]hould the conduct of those who compose martial-law tribunals become [a] matter of judicial determination subsequently before the civil courts, those courts will give great weight to the opinions of the officers as to what the customs of war in any case justify and render necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Birkhimer 534.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nevertheless concludes that at least one provision of the UCMJ amounts to an attempt by Congress to limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s power.  This conclusion is not only contrary to the text and structure of the UCMJ, but it is also inconsistent with precedent of this Court.  Consistent with <em>Madsen</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion pertaining to the common-law nature of military commissions and the President\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to prescribe their procedures, Article 36 of the UCMJ authorizes the President to establish procedures for military commissions \xe2\x80\x9cwhich shall, <em>so far as he considers practicable</em>, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836(a) (emphasis added).  Far from constraining the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority, Article 36 recognizes the President\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative to depart from the procedures applicable in criminal cases whenever <em>he alone</em> does not deem such procedures \xe2\x80\x9cpracticable.\xe2\x80\x9d  While the procedural regulations promulgated by the Executive must not be \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d the UCMJ, only a few provisions of the UCMJ mention \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary commissions,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>ante</em>, at 58, n.\xc2\xa049, and there is no suggestion that the procedures to be employed by Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission implicate any of those provisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court concludes that Article 36(b) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836(b), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]ll rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 57, requires the President to employ the same rules and procedures in military commissions as are employed by courts-martial <em>\xe2\x80\x9cinsofar as practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <em>Ante</em>, at 59.  The Court further concludes that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission is unlawful because the President has not explained why it is not practicable to apply the same rules and procedures to Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission as would be applied in a trial by court martial.  <em>Ante</em>, at 60.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation of \xc2\xa7836(b) is unconvincing.  As an initial matter, the Court fails to account for our cases interpreting the predecessor to Article 21 of the UCMJ\xe2\x80\x94Article 15 of the Articles of War\xe2\x80\x94which provides crucial context that bears directly on the proper interpretation of Article 36(b).  Article 15 of the Articles of War provided that:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of these articles conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offences that by statute or by the law of war may be triable by such military commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn <em>Yamashita</em>, this Court concluded that Article 15 of the Articles of War preserved the President\xe2\x80\x99s unfettered authority to prescribe military commission procedure.  The Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y thus recognizing military commissions in order to preserve their traditional jurisdiction over enemy combatants unimpaired by the Articles, Congress gave sanction \xe2\x80\xa6 to <em>any use</em> of the military commission contemplated by the common law of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  327 U. S., at 20 (emphasis added)[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]; see also <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28; <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 355.  In reaching this conclusion, this Court treated as authoritative the congressional testimony of Judge Advocate General Crowder, who testified that Article 15 of the Articles of War was enacted to preserve the military commission as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98our common-law war court.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Yamashita, supra</em>, at 19, n.\xc2\xa07.  And this Court recognized that Article 15\xe2\x80\x99s preservation of military commissions as common-law war courts preserved the President\xe2\x80\x99s commander-in-chief authority to both \xe2\x80\x9cestablish\xe2\x80\x9d military commissions and to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe [their] procedure[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 348; <em>id</em>., at 348\xe2\x80\x93349 (explaining that Congress had \xe2\x80\x9crefrain[ed] from legislating\xe2\x80\x9d in the area of military commission procedures, in \xe2\x80\x9ccontras[t] with its traditional readiness to \xe2\x80\xa6 prescrib[e], with particularity, the jurisdiction and procedure of United States courts-martial\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. Green 834 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe military commission exercising jurisdiction under common law authority is usually appointed by a superior military commander and is limited in its procedure only by the will of that commander.  Like any other common law court, in the absence of directive of superior authority to the contrary, the military commission is free to formulate its own rules of procedure\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given these precedents, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Article 36(b) requires the President to apply the same rules and procedures to military commissions as are applicable to courts-martial is unsustainable.  When Congress codified Article 15 of the Articles of War in Article 21 of the UCMJ it was \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed to be aware of \xe2\x80\xa6 and to adopt\xe2\x80\x9d this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of that provision as preserving the common-law status of military commissions, inclusive of the President\xe2\x80\x99s unfettered authority to prescribe their procedures.  <em>Lorillard</em> v. <em>Pons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U. S. 575</a>, 580 (1978).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Article 36(b) repudiates this settled meaning of Article 21 is not based upon a specific textual reference to military commissions, but rather on a one-sentence subsection providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7836(b).  This is little more than an impermissible repeal by implication.  See <em>Branch</em> v. <em>Smith, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/254/index.html">538 U. S. 254</a>, 273 (2003).  (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have repeatedly stated \xe2\x80\xa6 that absent a clearly expressed congressional intention, repeals by implication are not favored\xe2\x80\x9d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).  Moreover, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is flatly contrary to its duty not to set aside Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission \xe2\x80\x9cwithout the <em>clear</em> conviction that [it is] in conflict with the \xe2\x80\xa6 laws of Congress constitutionally enacted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Quirin, supra</em>, at 25 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the text of Article 36(b) supports the Court\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping conclusion that it represents an unprecedented congressional effort to change the nature of military commissions from common-law war courts to tribunals that must presumptively function like courts-martial.  And such an interpretation would be strange indeed.  The vision of uniformity that motivated the adoption of the UCMJ, embodied specifically in Article 36(b), is nothing more than uniformity across the separate branches of the armed services.  See ch. 169, 64 Stat. 107 (preamble to the UCMJ explaining that the UCMJ is an act \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o unify, consolidate, revise, and codify the Articles of War, the Articles for the Government of the Navy, and the disciplinary laws of the Coast Guard\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is no indication that the UCMJ was intended to require uniformity in procedure between courts-martial and military commissions, tribunals that the UCMJ itself recognizes are different.  To the contrary, the UCMJ expressly recognizes that different tribunals will be constituted in different manners and employ different procedures.  See  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7866 (providing for three different types of courts-martial\xe2\x80\x94 general, special, and summary\xe2\x80\x94constituted in different manners and employing different procedures).  Thus, Article 36(b) is best understood as establishing that, so far as practicable, the rules and regulations governing tribunals convened by the Navy must be uniform with the rules and regulations governing tribunals convened by the Army.  But, consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior interpretations of Article 21 and over a century of historical practice, it cannot be understood to require the President to conform the procedures employed by military commissions to those employed by courts-martial.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if Article 36(b) could be construed to require procedural uniformity among the various tribunals contemplated by the UCMJ, Hamdan would not be entitled to relief.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the President is entitled to prescribe different rules for military commissions than for courts-martial when he determines that it is not \xe2\x80\x9cpracticable\xe2\x80\x9d to prescribe uniform rules.  The Court does not resolve the level of deference such determinations would be owed, however, because, in its view, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he President has not . . . [determined] that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 60.  This is simply not the case.  On the same day that the President issued Military Commission Order No. 1, the Secretary of Defense explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe president decided to establish military commissions because he wanted the option of a process that is different from those processes which we already have, namely the federal court system . . . and the military court system,\xe2\x80\x9d Dept. of Defense News Briefing on Military Commissions (Mar. 21, 2002) (remarks of Donald Rumsfeld), available at http://www.dod.gov/transcrips/\n2002/t03212002_t0321sd.html (as visited June 26, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (hereinafter News Briefing), and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he commissions are intended to be different . . . because the [P]resident recognized that there had to be differences to deal with the unusual situation we face and that a different approach was needed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The President reached this conclusion because</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of a war, and . . . had to design a procedure that would allow us to pursue justice for these individuals while at the same time prosecuting the war most effectively.  And that means setting rules that would allow us to preserve our intelligence secrets, develop more information about terrorist activities that might be planned for the future so that we can take action to prevent terrorist attacks against the United States. . . . [T]here was a constant balancing of the requirements of our war policy and the importance of providing justice for individuals . . . and <em>each </em>deviation from the standard kinds of rules that we have in our criminal courts was motivated by the desire to strike the balance between individual justice and the broader war policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (remarks of Douglas J. Feith, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court provides no explanation why the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination that employing court-martial procedures in the military commissions established pursuant to Military Commission Order No. 1 would hamper our war effort is in any way inadequate to satisfy its newly minted \xe2\x80\x9cpracticability\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  On the contrary, this determination is precisely the kind for which the \xe2\x80\x9cJudiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility and which has long been held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Waterman S.

And, in the context of the present conflict, it is exactly the kind of determination Congress countenanced when it authorized the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against our enemies.  Accordingly, the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination is sufficient to satisfy any practicability requirement imposed by Article 36(b).     </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality further contends that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission is unlawful because it fails to provide him the right to be present at his trial, as recognized in 10 U.

Section 839(c) simply does not address the procedural requirements of military commissions.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court contends that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s military commission is also unlawful because it violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, see <em>ante</em>, at 65\xe2\x80\x9372.  Furthermore, Hamdan contends that his commission is unlawful because it violates various provisions of the Third Geneva Convention.  These contentions are untenable.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, and as the Court of Appeals concluded, both of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s Geneva Convention claims are foreclosed by <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/index.html">339 U. S. 763</a> (1950).  In that case the respondents claimed, <em>inter alia</em>, that their military commission lacked jurisdiction because it failed to provide them with certain procedural safeguards that they argued were required under the Geneva Conventions.  <em>Id</em>., at 789\xe2\x80\x93790.  While this Court rejected the underlying merits of the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Geneva Convention claims, <em>id</em>., at 790, it also held, in the alternative, that the respondents could \xe2\x80\x9cnot assert \xe2\x80\xa6 that anything in the Geneva Convention makes them immune from prosecution or punishment for war crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 789.  The Court explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not holding that these prisoners have no right which the military authorities are bound to respect.  The United States, by the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929, 47 Stat. 2021, concluded with forty-six other countries, including the German Reich, an agreement upon the treatment to be accorded captives.  These prisoners claim to be and are entitled to its protection.  It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.  Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential intervention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 789, n.\xc2\xa014.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis alternative holding is no less binding than if it were the exclusive basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  See <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/611/index.html">333 U. S. 611</a>, 623 (1948).  While the Court attempts to cast <em>Eisentrager</em>\xe2\x80\x99s unqualified, alternative holding as footnote dictum, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 63\xe2\x80\x9364, it does not dispute the correctness of its conclusion, namely, that the provisions of the 1929 Geneva Convention were not judicially enforceable because that Convention contemplated that diplomatic measures by political and military authorities were the exclusive mechanisms for such enforcement.  Nor does the Court suggest that the 1949 Geneva Conventions departed from this framework.  See <em>ante</em>, at 64 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe may assume that \xe2\x80\x98the obvious scheme\xe2\x80\x99 of the 1949 Conventions is identical in all relevant respects to that of the 1929 Convention\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the Court concludes that petitioner may seek judicial enforcement of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions because \xe2\x80\x9cthey are \xe2\x80\xa6 part of the law of war.  And compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 65 (citation omitted).  But Article 21 authorizes the use of military commissions; it does not purport to render judicially enforceable aspects of the law of war that are not so enforceable of their own accord.  See <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28 (by enacting Article 21, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has explicitly provided, so far as it may constitutionally do so, that military tribunals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses against the law of war\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court cannot escape <em>Eisentrager</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding merely by observing that Article 21 mentions the law of war; indeed, though <em>Eisentrager</em> did not specifically consider the Court\xe2\x80\x99s novel interpretation of Article 21, <em>Eisentrager</em> involved a challenge to the legality of a World War II military commission, which, like all such commissions, found its authorization in Article 15 of the Articles of War, the predecessor to Article 21 of the UCMJ.  Thus, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Article 21 is foreclosed by <em>Eisentrager</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument is too clever by half.  The judicial nonenforceability of the Geneva Conventions derives from the fact that those Conventions have exclusive enforcement mechanisms, see <em>Eisentrager</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 789, n.\xc2\xa014, and this, too, is part of the law of war.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s position thus rests on the assumption that Article 21\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the \xe2\x80\x9claws of war\xe2\x80\x9d selectively incorporates only those aspects of the Geneva Conventions that the Court finds convenient, namely, the substantive requirements of Common Article 3, and not those aspects of the Conventions that the Court, for whatever reason, disfavors, namely the Conventions\xe2\x80\x99 exclusive diplomatic enforcement scheme.  The Court provides no account of why the <em>partial</em> incorporation of the Geneva Conventions should extend only so far\xe2\x80\x94and no further\xe2\x80\x94because none is available beyond its evident preference to adjudicate those matters that the law of war, through the Geneva Conventions, consigns exclusively to the political branches.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the Court were correct that Article 21 of the UCMJ renders judicially enforceable aspects of the law of war that are not so enforceable by their own terms, Article 21 simply cannot be interpreted to render judicially enforceable the particular provision of the law of war at issue here, namely Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.  As relevant, Article 21 provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he provisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial do not deprive military commissions \xe2\x80\xa6 of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to <em>offenders or offenses </em>that by statute <em>or by the law of war</em> may be tried by military commissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821 (emphasis added).  Thus, to the extent Article 21 can be interpreted as authorizing judicial enforcement of aspects of the law of war that are not otherwise judicially enforceable, that authorization only extends to provisions of the law of war that relate to whether a particular \xe2\x80\x9coffender\xe2\x80\x9d or a particular \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d is triable by military commission.  Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, the sole provision of the Geneva Conventions relevant to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, relates to neither.  Rather, it relates exclusively to the particulars of the tribunal itself, namely, whether it is \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d and whether it \xe2\x80\x9cafford[s] all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d  Third Geneva Convention, Art. 3, \xc2\xb61<em>(d), </em>Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S No. 3364.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to being foreclosed by <em>Eisentrager</em>, Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s claim under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is meritless.  Common Article 3 applies to \xe2\x80\x9carmed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 3318.  \xe2\x80\x9cPursuant to [his] authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d the President has \xe2\x80\x9caccept[ed] the legal conclusion of the Department of Justice \xe2\x80\xa6 that common Article 3 of Geneva does not apply to \xe2\x80\xa6 al Qaeda \xe2\x80\xa6 detainees, because, among other reasons, the relevant conflicts are international in scope and common Article 3 applies only to \xe2\x80\x98armed conflict not of an international character.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 35.  Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, \xe2\x80\x9cthe meaning attributed to treaty provisions by the Government agencies charged with their negotiation and enforcement is entitled to great weight.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Avagliano,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/176/index.html">457 U. S. 176</a>, 184\xe2\x80\x93185 (1982); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stuart,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/353/index.html">489 U. S. 353</a>, 369 (1989).  Our duty to defer to the President\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the provision at issue here is only heightened by the fact that he is acting pursuant to his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and by the fact that the subject matter of Common Article 3 calls for a judgment about the nature and character of an armed conflict.  See generally <em>United States</em> v. <em>Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/304/index.html">299 U. S. 304</a>, 320 (1936).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Common Article 3 is reasonable and should be sustained.  The conflict with al Qaeda is international in character in the sense that it is occurring in various nations around the globe.  Thus, it is also \xe2\x80\x9coccurring in the territory of\xe2\x80\x9d more than \xe2\x80\x9cone of the High Contracting Parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court does not dispute the President\xe2\x80\x99s judgments respecting the nature of our conflict with al Qaeda, nor does it suggest that the President\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Common Article 3 is implausible or foreclosed by the text of the treaty.  Indeed, the Court concedes that Common Article 3 is principally concerned with \xe2\x80\x9cfurnish[ing] minimal protection to rebels involved in \xe2\x80\xa6 a civil war,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 68, precisely the type of conflict the President\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation envisions to be subject to Common Article 3.  Instead, the Court, without acknowledging its duty to defer to the President, adopts its own, admittedly plausible, reading of Common Article 3.  But where, as here, an ambiguous treaty provision (\xe2\x80\x9cnot of an international character\xe2\x80\x9d) is susceptible of two plausible, and reasonable, interpretations, our precedents require us to defer to the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if Common Article 3 were judicially enforceable and applicable to the present conflict, petitioner would not be entitled to relief.  As an initial matter, any claim petitioner has under Common Article 3 is not ripe.  The only relevant \xe2\x80\x9cacts\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9care and shall remain prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d under Common Article 3 are \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>passing of sentences</em> and the <em>carrying out of executions</em> without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 3, \xc2\xb61<em>(d)</em>, 6 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 1318, 1320 (emphases added).  As its terms make clear, Common Article 3 is only violated, as relevant here, by the act of \xe2\x80\x9cpassing of sentenc[e],\xe2\x80\x9d and thus Hamdan will only have a claim <em>if</em> his military commission convicts him and imposes a sentence.  Accordingly, as Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s claim is \xe2\x80\x9ccontingent [upon] future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all,\xe2\x80\x9d it is not ripe for adjudication.  <em>Texas</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/296/index.html">523 U. S. 296</a>, 300 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Indeed, even if we assume he will be convicted and sentenced, whether his trial will be conducted in a manner so as to deprive him of \xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples\xe2\x80\x9d is entirely speculative.  And premature adjudication of Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s claim is especially inappropriate here because \xe2\x80\x9creaching the merits of the dispute would force us to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Raines</em> v. <em>Byrd,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/811/index.html">521 U. S. 811</a>, 819\xe2\x80\x93820 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s military commission complies with the requirements of Common Article 3.  It is plainly \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted\xe2\x80\x9d because such commissions have been employed throughout our history to try unlawful combatants for crimes against the law of war.  This Court has recounted that history as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98By a practice dating from 1847 and renewed and firmly established during the Civil War, military commissions have become adopted as authorized tribunals in this country in time of war\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Their competency has been recognized not only in acts of Congress, but in executive proclamations, in rulings of the courts, and in the opinions of the Attorneys General.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 346, n.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p align="left">\nHamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission has been constituted in accordance with these historical precedents.  As I have previously explained, the procedures to be employed by that commission, and the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s authority to alter those procedures, are consistent with the practice of previous American military commissions.  See <em>supra</em>, at 30\xe2\x80\x9334 , and n. 15.<font super="1"> </font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court concludes Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission fails to satisfy the requirements of Common Article 3 not because it differs from the practice of previous military commissions but because it \xe2\x80\x9cdeviate[s] from [the procedures] governing courts-martial.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 71.  But there is neither a statutory nor historical requirement that military commissions conform to the structure and practice of courts-martial.  A military commission is a different tribunal, serving a different function, and thus operates pursuant to different procedures.  The 150-year pedigree of the military commission is itself sufficient to establish that such tribunals are \xe2\x80\x9cregularly constituted court[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 3, \xc2\xb61<em>(d),</em> 6 U. S. T., at 3320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, the procedures to be employed by Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission afford \xe2\x80\x9call the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d  Neither the Court nor petitioner disputes the Government\xe2\x80\x99s description of those procedures.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cPetitioner is entitled to appointed military legal counsel, 32 C.F.R. 9.4(c)(2), and may retain a civilian attorney (which he has done), 32 C.F.R. 9.4(c)(2)(iii)(B).

He may confront witnesses against him, 32 C.F.R. 9.5(i), and may subpoena his own witnesses, if reasonably available, 32 C.F.R. 9.5(h).  Petitioner may personally be present at every stage of the trial unless he engages in disruptive conduct or the prosecution introduces classified or otherwise protected information for which no adequate substitute is available and whose admission will not deprive him of a full and fair trial, 32 C.F.R. 9.5(k); Military Commission Order No. 1 (Dep\xe2\x80\x99t of Defense Aug. 31, 2005) \xc2\xa76(B)(3) and (D)(5)(b).  If petitioner is found guilty, the judgment will be reviewed by a review panel, the Secretary of Defense, and the President, if he does not designate the Secretary as the final decisionmaker.  32 C.F.R. 9.6(h).  The final judgment is subject to review in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and ultimately in this Court.  See DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743; 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 1254(1).\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 4.</p>\n<p align="left">\nNotwithstanding these provisions, which in my judgment easily satisfy the nebulous standards of Common Article 3,[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] the plurality concludes that Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s commission is unlawful because of the possibility that Hamdan will be barred from proceedings and denied access to evidence that may be used to convict him.  <em>Ante</em>, at 70\xe2\x80\x9372.  But, under the commissions\xe2\x80\x99 rules, the Government may not impose such bar or denial on Hamdan if it would render his trial unfair, a question that is clearly within the scope of the appellate review contemplated by regulation and statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, while the Executive is surely not required to offer a particularized defense of these procedures prior to their application, the procedures themselves make clear that Hamdan would only be excluded (other than for disruption) if it were necessary to protect classified (or classifiable) intelligence, Dept. of Defense, Military Commission Order No. 1, \xc2\xa76(B)(3) (Aug. 31, 2005), including the sources and methods for gathering such intelligence.  The Government has explained that \xe2\x80\x9cwe want to make sure that these proceedings, which are going on in the middle of the war, do not interfere with our war effort and \xe2\x80\xa6 because of the way we would be able to handle interrogations and intelligence information, may actually assist us in promoting our war aims.\xe2\x80\x9d  News Briefing (remarks of Douglas J.

According to the Government, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause al Qaeda operates as a clandestine force relying on sleeper agents to mount surprise attacks, one of the most critical fronts in the current war involves gathering intelligence about future terrorist attacks and how the terrorist network operates\xe2\x80\x94identifying where its operatives are, how it plans attacks, who directs operations, and how they communicate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States in No. 03\xe2\x80\x934792, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moussaoui</em> (CA4), p. 9.

See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 34\xe2\x80\x9336, 48.  The text of the AUMF is backward looking, authorizing the use of \xe2\x80\x9call necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to try Hamdan by military commission\xe2\x80\x94a use of force authorized by the AUMF\xe2\x80\x94for Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s involvement with al Qaeda prior to September 11, 2001, fits comfortably within the framework of the AUMF.  In fact, bringing the September 11 conspirators to justice is the <em>primary point</em> of the AUMF.  By contrast, on the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s logic, the AUMF would not grant the President the authority to try Usama bin Laden himself for his involvement in the events of September 11, 2001.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The plurality suggests these authorities are inapplicable because nothing in its \xe2\x80\x9canalysis turns on the admitted absence of either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law.  Our focus instead is on the \xe2\x80\xa6 AUMF.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 35, n.\xc2\xa031.  The difference identified by the plurality is purely semantic.

Here the AUMF serves the same function as the declaration of martial law in Hawaii in 1941, establishing legal authority for the constitution of military commissions.  Moreover, Kuehn was not tried and punished \xe2\x80\x9cby statute, but by the laws and usages of war.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bernard Julius Otto Kuehn</em>, Board of Review 5 (Office of the Military Governor, Hawaii 1942).  Indeed, in upholding the imposition of the death penalty, a sentence \xe2\x80\x9cnot authorized by the Espionage statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., Kuehn\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Review explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that persons may be tried and punished \xe2\x80\xa6 by a military commission for committing acts defined as offenses by \xe2\x80\xa6 federal statutes does not mean that such persons are being tried for violations of such \xe2\x80\xa6 statutes; they are, instead, being tried for acts made offenses only by orders of the \xe2\x80\xa6  commanding general.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 6.

But that position is demonstrably wrong.

Moreover, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s contention that we may only look to the label affixed to the charge to determine if the charging document alleges an offense triable by military commission is flatly inconsistent with its treatment of the Civil War cases\xe2\x80\x94where it accepts as valid charges that did not appear in the heading or title of the charging document, or even the listed charge itself, but only in the supporting specification.   See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante</em>, at 45\xe2\x80\x9346 (discussing the military commission trial of Wirz).  For example, in the Wirz case, Wirz was charged with conspiring to violate the laws of war, and that charge was supported with allegations that he personally committed a number of atrocities.  The plurality concludes that military commission jurisdiction was appropriate in that case not based upon the charge of conspiracy, but rather based upon the allegations of various atrocities in the specification which were <em>not</em> separately charged.  <em>Ante, </em>at 45.<em> </em>Just as these atrocities, not separately charged, were independent violations of the law of war supporting Wirz\xe2\x80\x99s trial by military commission, so too here Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s membership in al Qaeda and his provision of various forms of assistance to al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s top leadership are independent violations of the law of war supporting his trial by military commission.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0These observations respecting the law of war were made by the Attorney General in defense of the military commission trial of the Lincoln conspirators\xe2\x80\x99.

Moreover, though I agree that the allegations pertaining to these overt acts provided an independent basis for the military commission\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction in that case, that merely confirms the propriety of examining all the acts alleged\xe2\x80\x94whether or not they are labeled as separate offenses\xe2\x80\x94to determine if a defendant has been charged with a violation of the law of war.  As I have already explained, Hamdan has been charged with violating the law of war not only by participating in a conspiracy to violate the law of war, but also by joining a war criminal enterprise and by supplying provisions and assistance to that enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s top leadership.</p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to undermine the significance of these cases is unpersuasive.  The plurality suggests the Wirz case is not relevant because the specification supporting his conspiracy charge alleged that he \xe2\x80\x9c<em>personally committed</em> a number of atrocities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 45.  But this does not establish that conspiracy to violate the laws of war, the very crime with which Wirz was charged, is not itself a violation of the law of war.  Rather, at best, it establishes that in addition to conspiracy Wirz violated the laws of war by committing various atrocities, just as Hamdan violated the laws of war not only by conspiring to do so, but also by joining al Qaeda and providing provisions and services to its top leadership.  Moreover, the fact that Wirz was charged with overt acts that are more severe than the overt acts with which Hamdan has been charged does not establish that conspiracy is not an offense cognizable before military commission; rather it merely establishes that Wirz\xe2\x80\x99s offenses may have been comparably worse than Hamdan\xe2\x80\x99s offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the charge against Lenger Grenfel supports its compound offense theory is similarly unsupportable.

Taylor, Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 36 (1992)).  But while the IMT did not criminalize all conspiracies to violate the law of war, it did criminalize \xe2\x80\x9cparticipation in a common plan or conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d to wage aggressive war.  See 1 Trials, pp. XI\xe2\x80\x93XII.  Moreover, the World War II military tribunals of several European nations recognized conspiracy to violate the laws of war as an offense triable before military commissions.  See 15  U.\xc2\xa0N. Commission 90\xe2\x80\x9391 (noting that the French Military Tribunal at Marseilles found Henri Georges Stadelhofer \xe2\x80\x9cguilty of the crime of <em>association de malfaiteurs</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d namely of \xe2\x80\x9chaving formed with various members of the German Gestapo an association with the aim of preparing or committing crimes against persons or property, without justification under the laws and usages of war\xe2\x80\x9d); 11 <em>id.,</em> at 98 (noting that the Netherlands\xe2\x80\x99 military tribunals were authorized to try conspiracy to violate the laws of war).  Thus, the European legal systems\xe2\x80\x99 approach to domestic conspiracy law has not prevented European nations from recognizing conspiracy offenses as violations of the law of war.  This is unsurprising, as the law of war is derived not from domestic law but from the wartime practices of civilized nations, including the United States, which has consistently recognized that conspiracy to violate the laws of war is an offense triable by military commission.</p>\n<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Though it does not constitute a basis for any holding of the Court, the Court maintains that, as a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe procedures governing trials by military commission historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 54, 53.

Moreover, such a requirement would conflict with the settled understanding of the flexible and responsive nature of military commissions and the President\xe2\x80\x99s wartime authority to employ such tribunals as he sees fit.

It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, \xe2\x80\x9cno court, justice, or judge\xe2\x80\x9d shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute\xe2\x80\x99s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> \xe2\x80\x9ccourt, justice, or judge\xe2\x80\x9d before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The DTA provides: \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision \xe2\x80\x9ct[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to \xe2\x80\x9chear or consider\xe2\x80\x9d the merits of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cno court, <em>justice</em>, or judge\xe2\x80\x9d includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are \xe2\x80\x9chear[ing] or consider[ing] \xe2\x80\xa6 an application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/112/index.html">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952), we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by \xe2\x80\x9cofficers\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98employees\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts \xe2\x80\x9cbecame effective\xe2\x80\x9d while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute \xe2\x80\x9cdid not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis rule\xe2\x80\x94that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law\xe2\x80\x94has been adhered to consistently by this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 116\xe2\x80\x93117.  See also <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/244/index.html">511 U. S. 244</a>, 274 (1994) (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption against jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment\xe2\x80\x94in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7\xc2\xa0Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made \xe2\x80\x9cany reservation as to pending cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  343 U. S., at 116\xe2\x80\x93117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/239/506/index.html">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916), Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision \xe2\x80\x9cmade no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 5 Wall. 541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made \xe2\x80\x9cwithout any saving of such causes as that before us,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA\xe2\x80\x99s directive that \xe2\x80\x9cno court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742, is made \xe2\x80\x9cwithout any reservation as to pending cases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpurport[s] to be universal.\xe2\x80\x9d  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] \xe2\x80\xa6 to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/98/398/index.html">98 U. S. 398</a>, 403 (1879).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court claims that I \xe2\x80\x9crea[d] too much into\xe2\x80\x9d the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa07, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>Bruner</em> rule\xe2\x80\x9d has never been \xe2\x80\x9can inflexible trump,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>\xe2\x80\x94as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/320/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997), resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified \xe2\x80\x9crule,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9chas been adhered to consistently by this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  343 U. S., at 116\xe2\x80\x93117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n.\xc2\xa07, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544\xe2\x80\x93545).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98presumption\xe2\x80\x99 [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption\xe2\x80\x94viz., the presumption against retroactivity\xe2\x80\x94in certain limited circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are \xe2\x80\x9ceffective\xe2\x80\x9d upon the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like \xc2\xa71005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[S]hall take effect upon enactment\xe2\x80\x99 is presumed to mean \xe2\x80\x98shall have prospective effect upon enactment,\xe2\x80\x99 and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgments).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnonapplication of \xe2\x80\xa6 the presumption against retroactivity\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an \xe2\x80\x9cinflexible trump,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

Specifically, it appeals to the fact that \xc2\xa71005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by \xc2\xa71005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the \xe2\x80\x9cnegative inference\xe2\x80\x9d from \xc2\xa71005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption against jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from \xc2\xa71005(h)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from \xc2\xa71005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/320/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997), is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326\xe2\x80\x93327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154\xe2\x80\x99s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 \xe2\x80\x9cwill have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step\xe2\x80\x94and the critical step\xe2\x80\x94in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing \xe2\x80\xa6 but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/939/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/939/index.html">520 U. S. 939</a>, 951 (1997), that a statute \xe2\x80\x9cthat <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cas much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/677/index.html">541 U. S. 677</a>, 695 (2004) (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that \xe2\x80\x9csubsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) \xe2\x80\x98confer\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author\xe2\x80\x99s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe conclusion that a particular rule operates \xe2\x80\x98retroactively\xe2\x80\x99 comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have \xe2\x80\x98sound \xe2\x80\xa6 instinct[s],\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe only \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creasonable reliance,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csettled expectation\xe2\x80\x9d I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>\xe2\x80\x94applicable to \xc2\xa71005(e)(1), but not to \xc2\xa71005(e)(2) and (3)\xe2\x80\x94which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that \xc2\xa71005(e)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s and (3)\xe2\x80\x99s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as \xc2\xa71005(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98confer\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>\xe2\x80\x99s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived \xe2\x80\x9cthe wisdom of being explicit\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them\xe2\x80\x94not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, it is simply untrue that Congress \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98should have been just as concerned about\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d specifying the application of \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from \xc2\xa71005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, \xc2\xa71005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction in the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318.  By drawing a negative inference <em>\xc3\x80</em> <em>la</em> <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>\xe2\x80\x99s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Worst of all is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of \xc2\xa71005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some \xe2\x80\x9cstatements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to\xe2\x80\x9d the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15\xe2\x80\x9316, n.\xc2\xa010.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because \xe2\x80\x9cthose statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes\xe2\x80\x99 practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  And at least one opponent of the DTA unmistakably expressed his understanding that it would terminate our jurisdiction in this very case.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  (Of course in its discussion of legislative history the Court wholly ignores the President\xe2\x80\x99s signing statement, which explicitly set forth <em>his</em> understanding that the DTA ousted jurisdiction over pending cases.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>])</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s use of floor statements to resolve today\xe2\x80\x99s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257\xe2\x80\x93S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would \xe2\x80\x9cstri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion has written for the Court that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not \xe2\x80\x9creflec[t] any general agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  They reflect the now-common tactic\xe2\x80\x94which the Court once again rewards\xe2\x80\x94of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cshall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe status determination \xe2\x80\xa6 was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> not whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of such standards and procedures \xe2\x80\xa6 is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 119 Stat. 2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the \xe2\x80\x9caction that is pending\xe2\x80\x9d provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court\xe2\x80\x99s greatest Justices.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always\xe2\x80\x94but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation\xe2\x80\x94the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> \xe2\x80\x9capplication for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\xe2\x80\x9d  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of \xe2\x80\x9cdetention\xe2\x80\x9d such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/466/index.html">542 U. S. 466</a>, 498 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that \xe2\x80\x9c[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,\xe2\x80\x9d including one that \xe2\x80\x9cseek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,\xe2\x80\x9d Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n.\xc2\xa010 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I would hold that \xc2\xa71005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to \xe2\x80\x9chear or consider\xe2\x80\x9d pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/index.html"></a><a href="/us/339/763/index.html">339 U. S. 763</a>, 768 (1950):</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction.  Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nNotwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U. S., at 480\xe2\x80\x93481, it is clear that Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is outside the sovereign \xe2\x80\x9cterritorial jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States.  See <em>id.</em>, at 500\xe2\x80\x93505 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Petitioner, an enemy alien detained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cthe substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person\xe2\x80\x99s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Pressley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/372/index.html"></a><a href="/us/430/372/index.html">430 U.

Circuit provided in \xc2\xa71005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 119 Stat. 2743.  That provision grants the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit authority to review, \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the quoted text, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csuch standards and procedures\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),\xe2\x80\x9d namely \xe2\x80\x9cMilitary Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).\xe2\x80\x9d  DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental implementing order for the President\xe2\x80\x99s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, \xc2\xa72; delineates their jurisdiction, \xc2\xa73; provides for their officers, \xc2\xa74(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, \xc2\xa74(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, \xc2\xa75(A)\xe2\x80\x93(P), \xc2\xa76(A)\xe2\x80\x93(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, \xc2\xa76(H).  In short, the \xe2\x80\x9cstandards and procedures specified in\xe2\x80\x9d Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of such standards and procedures,\xe2\x80\x9d as specified in Order No. 1, is \xe2\x80\x9c[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d DTA \xc2\xa71005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 119 Stat. 2743.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71254(1) to review the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.  Motion to Dismiss 16, n.\xc2\xa08.  Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.  It constitutes neither an \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate\xe2\x80\x9d nor an \xe2\x80\x9cineffective\xe2\x80\x9d substitute for petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s pending habeas application.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court hints ominously that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government\xe2\x80\x99s preferred reading\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9crais[e] grave questions about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to impinge upon this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (citing <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>, 8 Wall. 85 (1869); <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/651/index.html">518 U. S. 651</a> (1996); <em>Durousseau</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 6 Cranch 307 (1810); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Klein</em>, 13 Wall. 128 (1872); and <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506).  It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Exceptions</em> Clause\xe2\x80\x9d of Article III, \xc2\xa72, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to \xe2\x80\x9csuch Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,\xe2\x80\x9d explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as \xc2\xa71005(e)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/738/index.html">420 U. S. 738</a>, 754 (1975); <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Romero-Barcelo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/305/index.html">456 U. S. 305</a>, 311 (1982).  In light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims in \xc2\xa71005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cservice-connected\xe2\x80\x9d to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> \xe2\x80\x9cidentifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,\xe2\x80\x9d and concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cHamdan is not a member of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary necessities\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunique military exigencies,\xe2\x80\x9d 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739\xe2\x80\x93740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary necessities\xe2\x80\x9d counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reason for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cblinkered study\xe2\x80\x9d of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary necessity\xe2\x80\x9d <em>at all:</em> \xe2\x80\x9cThe charge\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings \xe2\x80\xa6 are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition \xe2\x80\xa6 for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d a joint session of Congress authorized the President to \xe2\x80\x9cuse all necessary and appropriate force,\xe2\x80\x9d including military commissions, \xe2\x80\x9cagainst those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\xe2\x80\x9d  Authorization for Use of Military Force, \xc2\xa72(a), 115 Stat. 224, note following 50 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71541 (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order \xe2\x80\xa6 to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR \xc2\xa7918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority\xe2\x80\x94or the audacity\xe2\x80\x94to contradict this determination.  If \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary necessities\xe2\x80\x9d relating to \xe2\x80\x9cduty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdiscipline\xe2\x80\x9d required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this \xe2\x80\x9cintegrated system\xe2\x80\x9d insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which \xe2\x80\x9cprovides that appeal of a review panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, \xc2\xa76(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, \xc2\xa76(H)(6).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if we were to accept the Court\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary assumption that the President \xe2\x80\x9clack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 23,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] the Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the \xe2\x80\x9cfina[l]\xe2\x80\x9d review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit pursuant to \xc2\xa71005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71254(1).  This provision for review by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review scheme <em>more</em> insulated from Executive control than that in <em>Councilman</em>.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not \xe2\x80\x9cconferred on any Art[icle]\xc2\xa0III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, \xc2\xa71.  See 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7867(a)(2) (1970 ed.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems\xe2\x80\x9d that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/37/index.html">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971), were inapplicable to courts-martial, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular demands of federalism are not implicated.\xe2\x80\x9d  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular demands of federalism,\xe2\x80\x9d considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d by the President \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR \xc2\xa7918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have \xe2\x80\x9cthe first opportunity to review\xe2\x80\x9d a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim, merely to \xe2\x80\x9creduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/838/index.html">526 U. S. 838</a>, 844, 845 (1999).  The \xe2\x80\x9cfriction\xe2\x80\x9d created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942): \xe2\x80\x9cFar from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/507/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/507/index.html">542 U. S. 507</a>, 569 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, n.\xc2\xa02.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would abstain from exercising our equity jurisdiction, as the Government requests.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</f></p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision means nothing at all.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to \xe2\x80\x98take effect on the date of enactment,\xe2\x80\x99 DTA \xc2\xa71005(h)(1), 119 Stat. 2743, is not dispositive,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa09.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority for this conclusion is its quote from <em>INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/289/index.html">533 U. S. 289</a>, 317 (2001), to the effect that \xe2\x80\x9ca statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct <em>that occurred at an earlier date</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa09 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct that occurred at an <em>earlier</em> date,\xe2\x80\x9d but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs <em>on the effective date and all future dates\xe2\x80\x94</em>such as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0A comparison with <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/320/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/320/index.html">521 U.

Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of \xc2\xa71005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in <em>Lindh </em>(whose retroactivity\nas applied to pending cases the <em>Lindh</em> majority did not rule upon,\nsee 521 U.

They impose novel and unprecedented disabilities on\nthe Executive Branch in its conduct of military affairs.  Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status Review\nTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject them\nto review by Article III courts.

Subsection (e)(3) authorizes the D.\xc2\xa0C.

Historically, federal courts have <em>never</em> reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clawful <em>authority</em> to hear, decide and condemn,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Yamashita</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/1/index.html">327 U.

Thus, contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>ante</em>, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.
