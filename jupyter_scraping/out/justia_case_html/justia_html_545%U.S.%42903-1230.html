Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7478.2(1), claiming that it discriminates against interstate carriers and imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate trade because trucks carrying both interstate and intrastate loads engage in less intrastate business than trucks carrying only intrastate loads.  The State Court of Claims rejected the claim, holding that, because the fee is regulatory and intended for the Michigan Motor Carrier Act\xe2\x80\x99s administration, it is not amenable to apportionment; that it is an appropriate exercise of the State\xe2\x80\x99s police power; and that it does not implicate the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrastate commerce.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, and the State Supreme Court declined review.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s fee does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.  That Clause prevents a State from \xe2\x80\x9cjeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cplac[ing] burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Jefferson Lines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/175/index.html">514 U. S. 175</a>, 180.  Applying this Court\xe2\x80\x99s dormant Commerce Clause principles and precedents here, nothing in \xc2\xa7478.2(1) offends the Commerce Clause.  The flat fee is imposed only on intrastate transactions.  It does not facially discriminate against interstate or out-of-state activities or enterprises.  It applies evenhandedly to all carriers making domestic journeys and does not reflect an effort to tax activity taking place outside of the State.  Nothing in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law suggests that such a neutral, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause.  That is not surprising, since States impose numerous flat fees on local business and service providers, <em>e.g., </em>insurers and auctioneers.  The Constitution neither displaces States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to shelter their people from health and safety menaces nor unduly curtails their power to lay taxes to support state government.  The record, moreover, shows no special circumstances suggesting that Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s fee operates as anything other than an unobjectionable exercise of the State\xe2\x80\x99s police power.  Neither does it show that the flat<em> </em>assessment unfairly discriminates against interstate truckers.  Because the costs the fee seeks to defray, <em>e.g.,</em> those of regulating vehicular size and weight, would seem more likely to vary per truck or per carrier than per-mile traveled, a per-truck, rather than a per-mile, assessment is likely fair.  And petitioners provide no details of their preferred alternative miles-traveled system or point to evidence of its practicality.  Nor is there any reason to infer that the State\xe2\x80\x99s lump-sum levy on purely local activity erects an impermissible discriminatory roadblock.  <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Scheiner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/266/index.html">483 U.

We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A subsection of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s Motor Carrier Act imposes upon each motor carrier \xe2\x80\x9cfor the administration of this act, an annual fee of $100.00 for each self-propelled motor vehicle operated by or on behalf of the motor carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7478.2(1) (West 2002).  The provision assesses the fee upon, and only upon, vehicles that engage in intrastate commercial operations\xe2\x80\x94that is, on trucks that undertake point-to-point hauls between Michigan cities.  See <em>Westlake Transp., Inc.</em> v. <em>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 255 Mich. App. 589, 592\xe2\x80\x93594, 662 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 784, 789 (2003).  Petitioners, USF Holland, Inc., a trucking company with trucks that engage in both interstate and intrastate hauling, and the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), asked the Michigan courts to invalidate the provision.  Both petitioners told those courts that trucks that carry <em>both</em> interstate <em>and</em> intrastate loads engage in intrastate business less than trucks that confine their operations to the Great Lakes State.  Hence, because Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s fee is flat, it discriminates against interstate carriers and imposes an unconstitutional burden upon interstate trade.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Court of Claims rejected the carriers\xe2\x80\x99 claim for three reasons.  First, the $100 fee \xe2\x80\x9cis regulatory and intended\xe2\x80\x9d for the Motor Carrier Act\xe2\x80\x99s administration, which includes \xe2\x80\x9cregulation of vehicular size and weight, insurance requirements and safety standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a.  Such a fee \xe2\x80\x9cis not amenable to a fee structure based on apportionment by usage rates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Second, the fee reflects a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate expression of the [S]tate\xe2\x80\x99s concern that the welfare of its citizens be protected,\xe2\x80\x9d and hence an appropriate exercise of the State\xe2\x80\x99s police power.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Third, the fee does not implicate the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrastate, not interstate, commerce.  <em>Id.</em>, at 45a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed.  It did not agree that the intrastate nature of \xc2\xa7478.2(1) sheltered the fee from Commerce Clause scrutiny.  255 Mich. App., at 617\xe2\x80\x93619<em>,</em> 662 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 802.  Nonetheless, the court rejected the truckers\xe2\x80\x99 claim because the statute \xe2\x80\x9cregulates evenhandedly,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 621, 662 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 804, and because the record lacked any \xe2\x80\x9cevidence that any trucking firm\xe2\x80\x99s route choices [were] affected by the imposition of the fee,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 621, 662 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 803\xe2\x80\x93804.  Rather, the record indicated that any \xe2\x80\x9ceffect . . . on interstate commerce is incidental,\xe2\x80\x9d rendering the truckers\xe2\x80\x99 claim of discrimination \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of pure speculation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Supreme Court denied petitioners leave to appeal.  <em>Westlake Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, ___ Mich. ___, 673 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 752 (2003).  We granted their petition for certiorari and consolidated the case with <em>Mid-Con Freight Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, No. 03\xe2\x80\x931234, a case in which interstate truckers sought review of a separate state motor carrier fee.  We now affirm the Michigan court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment sustaining \xc2\xa7478.2(1).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cwas framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Baldwin</em> v. <em>G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/294/511/index.html">294 U. S. 511</a>, 523 (1935).  Thus, this Court has consistently held that the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s express grant to Congress of the power to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate Commerce . . . among the several States,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03, contains \xe2\x80\x9ca further, negative command, known as the dormant Commerce Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n </em>v. <em>Jefferson Lines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/175/index.html">514 U. S. 175</a>, 179 (1995), that \xe2\x80\x9ccreate[s] an area of trade free from interference by the States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Boston Stock Exchange</em> v. <em>State Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/318/index.html">429 U. S. 318</a>, 328 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This negative command prevents a State from \xe2\x80\x9cjeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cplac[ing] burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jefferson Lines, supra</em>, at 180.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, we have found unconstitutional state regulations that unjustifiably discriminate on their face against out-of-state entities, see <em>Philadelphia</em> v. <em>New Jersey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/index.html">437 U. S. 617</a> (1978),<em> </em>or that impose burdens on interstate trade that are \xe2\x80\x9cclearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pike</em> v. <em>Bruce Church, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/index.html">397 U. S. 137</a>, 142 (1970).  We have held that States may not impose taxes that facially discriminate against interstate business and offer commercial advantage to local enterprises, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Department of Environmental Quality of Ore.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/93/index.html">511 U. S. 93</a>, 99\xe2\x80\x93100 (1994), that improperly apportion state assessments on transactions with out-of-state components, <em>Central Greyhound Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Mealey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/334/653/index.html">334 U. S. 653</a> (1948), or that have the \xe2\x80\x9cinevitable effect [of] threaten[ing] the free movement of commerce by placing a financial barrier around the State,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Scheiner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/266/index.html"></a><a href="/us/483/266/index.html">483 U. S. 266</a>, 284 (1987).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying these principles and precedents, we find nothing in \xc2\xa7478.2(1) that offends the Commerce Clause.  To begin with, Michigan imposes the flat $100 fee only upon intrastate transactions\xe2\x80\x94that is, upon activities taking place exclusively within the State\xe2\x80\x99s borders.  Section 478.2(1) does not facially discriminate against interstate or out-of-state activities or enterprises.  The statute applies evenhandedly to all carriers that make domestic journeys.  It does not reflect an effort to tax activity that takes place, in whole or in part, outside the State.  Nothing in our case law suggests that such a neutral, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This legal vacuum is not surprising.  States impose numerous flat fees upon local businesses and service providers, including, for example, upon insurers, auctioneers, ambulance operators, and hosts of others.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Wyo. Stat. \xc2\xa733\xe2\x80\x9336\xe2\x80\x93104 (Lexis 2003); S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa738\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x9310 (West 2002).  Although we have \xe2\x80\x9clong since rejected any suggestion that a state tax \xe2\x80\xa6 affecting interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a \xe2\x80\x98local\xe2\x80\x99 or intrastate activity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Commonwealth Edison Co.</em> v. <em>Montana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/609/index.html">453 U. S. 609</a>, 615 (1981), we have also made clear that the Constitution neither displaces States\xe2\x80\x99 authority \xe2\x80\x9cto shelter [their] people from menaces to their health or safety,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>D. H. Holmes Co.</em> v. <em>McNamara,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/24/index.html">486 U. S. 24</a>, 29 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted), nor \xe2\x80\x9cunduly curtail[s]\xe2\x80\x9d States\xe2\x80\x99 power \xe2\x80\x9cto lay taxes for the support of state government,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McGoldrick</em> v. <em>Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/309/33/index.html">309 U. S. 33</a>, 48 (1940).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record, moreover, shows no special circumstance suggesting that Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s fee operates in practice as anything other than an unobjectionable exercise of the State\xe2\x80\x99s police power.  To the contrary, as the Michigan Court of Appeals pointed out, the record contains little, if any, evidence that the $100 fee imposes any significant practical burden upon interstate trade.  See 255 Mich. App., at 620\xe2\x80\x93622<em>,</em> 662 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 803\xe2\x80\x93804.  The record does show, for example, that some interstate trucks \xe2\x80\x9ctop off\xe2\x80\x9d some interstate hauls with intrastate pickups and deliveries.  See Brief for Intervening Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226052, 226122 (Ct. App. Mich.), Exh. 3, Affidavit of James C. Crozier \xc2\xb67 (licensing and fuel manager of TNT Holland Motor Express, Inc. describing this practice).  But it does not tell us the answers to such questions as: How often does \xe2\x80\x9ctopping off\xe2\x80\x9d occur across the industry?  Does the $100 charge make a difference by significantly discouraging interstate carriers from engaging in \xe2\x80\x9ctopping off\xe2\x80\x9d?  Does the possibility of obtaining a 72-hour intrastate permit for $10 alleviate the alleged problem?  See \xc2\xa7478.2(3); see also Brief for Respondents 2, n.\xc2\xa03 (4,928 temporary permits were issued in 2004).  If the fees ($100 and $10) discourage \xe2\x80\x9ctopping off,\xe2\x80\x9d does that <em>local </em>commercial effect make a significant <em>interstate</em> difference?  Would a variable fee (of the kind the truckers advocate) eliminate such difference?  The minimal facts in the record tell us little about these matters.  Compare App. 60\xe2\x80\x9361, Supplemental Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan \xc2\xb610(e) (official of the Michigan Public Service Commission stating that topping off is rare for most interstate carriers because it disrupts schedules and shipping patterns), with Reply Brief for Intervening Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226122, 226137 (Ct. App. Mich.), Exh. A, Supplemental Affidavit of James C. Crozier \xc2\xb66 (TNT Holland frequently tops off interstate loads).  And at oral argument, ATA conceded the absence of record facts that empirically could show that the $100 fee significantly deters interstate trade.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither does the record show that the flat assessment unfairly discriminates against interstate truckers.  The fee seeks to defray costs such as those of regulating \xe2\x80\x9cvehicular size and weight,\xe2\x80\x9d of administering \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d and of applying \xe2\x80\x9csafety standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a.  The bulk of such costs would seem more likely to vary per truck or per carrier than to vary per-mile traveled.  See 255 Mich. App., at 612\xe2\x80\x93617, 662 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 799\xe2\x80\x93801.  And that fact means that a per-truck, rather than a per-mile, assessment is likely fair.  Cf. <em>Jefferson Lines</em>, 514 U. S., at 199 (rejecting taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination claim in part because \xe2\x80\x9cmiles traveled within the State simply are not a relevant proxy for the benefit conferred upon the parties to a sales transaction\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nothing in the record suggests the contrary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor would an effort to switch the manner of fee assessment\xe2\x80\x94from lump sum to, for example, miles traveled\xe2\x80\x94be burden free.  The record contains an affidavit, sworn by a Michigan Public Service Commission official, that states that to obtain the same revenue (about $3.5 million) through a per-mile fee would require the State to create a \xe2\x80\x9cdata accumulation system\xe2\x80\x9d capable of separating out intrastate hauls and determining their length, and to develop related liability, billing, and auditing mechanisms.  App. 64, Second Supplemental Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan \xc2\xb62.  This affidavit, on its face, suggests that the game is unlikely to be worth the candle.  While petitioners argue the contrary, they do not provide the details of their preferred alternative administrative system nor point to record evidence showing its practicality.  See <em>Jefferson Lines</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 195 (State is not required to use a particular apportionment formula just because it may be \xe2\x80\x9cpossible\xe2\x80\x9d to do so).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners insist that they do not need empirically to demonstrate the existence of a burdensome or discriminatory impact upon interstate trucking, or (presumably) the unfairness of the assessment in relation to defrayed costs,  or (presumably) the administrative practicality of the alternatives.  They say that our earlier case, <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Scheiner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/266/index.html"></a><a href="/us/483/266/index.html">483 U. S. 266</a> (1987), requires invalidation of the $100 flat fee, even in the absence of such proof.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Scheiner</em>,<em> </em>this Court invalidated a flat $25 \xe2\x80\x9cmarker fee\xe2\x80\x9d and a flat \xe2\x80\x9caxle tax\xe2\x80\x9d that Pennsylvania levied upon all trucks (interstate and intrastate) that used its roads, including trucks that merely crossed Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s borders to transport, say, Ohio goods to New Jersey customers.  See <em>id.,</em> at 273\xe2\x80\x93275.  Data showed that the fees imposed a cost per mile on interstate trucks that was approximately \xe2\x80\x9cfive times as heavy as the cost per mile borne by local trucks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 286.  The assessments largely helped to raise revenue \xe2\x80\x9cto improve and maintain [the State\xe2\x80\x99s] highways and bridges,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 270, thereby helping to cover costs likely to vary significantly with truck-miles traveled, see <em>ibid.</em>  And the assessments did \xe2\x80\x9cnot even purport to approximate fairly the cost or value of the use of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s roads.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 290.  In light of these considerations, Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s lump-sum taxes \xe2\x80\x9cthreaten[ed] the free movement of commerce by placing a financial barrier around the State of Pennsylvania.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 284.  We concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f each State imposed flat taxes for the privilege of making commercial entrances into its territory, there [was] no conceivable doubt that commerce among the States would be deterred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present fee, as we have said, taxes purely local activity; it does not tax an interstate truck\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the State nor does it tax transactions spanning multiple States.  See 255 Mich. App., at 592\xe2\x80\x93594, 662 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 789.  We lack convincing evidence showing that the tax deters, or for that matter discriminates against, interstate activities.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  Nor is the tax one that, on its face, would seem to call for an assessment measured per mile rather than per truck.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6.  Consequently, we lack any reason to infer that Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s lump-sum levy erects, as in <em>Scheiner,</em> an impermissible discriminatory road block.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners add that Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s fee fails the \xe2\x80\x9cinternal consistency\xe2\x80\x9d test\xe2\x80\x94a test that we have typically used where taxation of interstate transactions are at issue.  Generally speaking, that test asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would happen if all States did the same?\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Goldberg</em> v. <em>Sweet,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/252/index.html">488 U. S. 252</a>, 261 (1989); <em>Jefferson Lines</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 185 (test looks to the structure of the tax to see whether its identical application by every State \xe2\x80\x9cwould place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate\xe2\x80\x9d).  We must concede that here, as petitioners argue, if all States did the same, an interstate truck would have to pay fees totaling several hundred dollars, or even several thousand dollars, were it to \xe2\x80\x9ctop off\xe2\x80\x9d its business by carrying local loads in many (or even all) other States.  But it would have to do so only because it engages in <em>local</em> business in all those States.  An interstate firm with local outlets normally expects to pay local fees that are uniformly assessed upon all those who engage in local business, interstate and domestic firms alike.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Commonwealth Edison</em>, 453 U. S., at 623\xe2\x80\x93624 (dormant Commerce Clause does not seek \xe2\x80\x9cto relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <em>Jefferson Lines</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 187\xe2\x80\x93188 (in context of sales tax, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Commerce Clause does not forbid the actual assessment of a succession of taxes by different States on distinct events as the same tangible object flows along\xe2\x80\x9d).  A motor carrier is not special in this respect.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, petitioners have failed to show that Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s fee, which does not seek to tax a share of interstate transactions, which focuses upon local activity, and which is assessed evenhandedly, either burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce, or violates the Commerce Clause in any other relevant way.  See <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc.</em> v. <em>Brady</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/274/index.html">430 U. S. 274</a>, 279 (1977) (noting that a tax will be sustained where it is applied to an activity with a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial nexus\xe2\x80\x9d to the taxing State; where, if applied to interstate activity, it is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly apportioned\xe2\x80\x9d; where it does not discriminate; and where it is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly related to the services provided\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961854">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n545 U.

Instead, I ask whether the fee \xe2\x80\x9cfacially discriminates against interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d and whether it is \xe2\x80\x9cindistinguishable from a type of law previously held unconstitutional by this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>West Lynn Creamery, Inc.</em> v. <em>Healy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/186/index.html">512 U.
