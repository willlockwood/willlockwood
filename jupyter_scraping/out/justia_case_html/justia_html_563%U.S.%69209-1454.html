They did not have a warrant or parental consent to conduct the interview.  S.\xc2\xa0G. eventually stated that she had been abused.  Her father stood trial for that abuse, but the jury failed to reach a verdict and the charges were later dismissed.  S.\xc2\xa0G.\xe2\x80\x99s mother, respondent here (hereinafter S.\xc2\xa0G.), subsequently sued Camreta and Alford on S\xc2\xa0G.\xe2\x80\x99s behalf for damages under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that the in-school interview breached the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s proscription on unreasonable seizures.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the officials.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals first ruled that seizing S.\xc2\xa0G. absent a warrant, court order, parental consent, or exigent circumstances violated the Constitution.  But the court further held that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity from damages liability because no clearly established law had warned them of the illegality of their conduct.  The court explained that it had chosen to rule on the merits of the constitutional claim so that officials would be on notice that they could not dispense with traditional Fourth Amendment protections in this context.  Although the judgment entered was in their favor, Camreta and Alford petitioned this Court to review the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.  S.\xc2\xa0G. declined to cross-petition for review of the decision that the officials have immunity.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0This Court generally may review a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional ruling at the behest of government officials who have won final judgment on qualified immunity grounds.

To comply with that requirement, litigants must demonstrate a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal stake\xe2\x80\x9d in the suit.  <em>Summers</em> v. <em>Earth Island Institute</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/488/index.html">555 U. S. 488</a>, ___.  The petitioner has such a stake when he has \xe2\x80\x9csuffered an \xe2\x80\x98injury in fact\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that is caused by \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct complained of\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cwill be \xe2\x80\x98redressed by a favorable decision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560\xe2\x80\x93561.  And the opposing party also must have an ongoing interest in the dispute, so that the case features \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, 101.  The parties must have the necessary stake not only at the outset of litigation, but throughout its course.  <em>Arizonans for Official English</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/43/index.html">520 U. S. 43</a>, 67.  So long as the litigants possess the requisite personal stake, an appeal presents a case or controversy, no matter that the appealing party was the prevailing party below.  See <em>Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Roper</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/326/index.html">445 U. S. 326</a>, 332\xe2\x80\x93336; <em>Electrical Fittings Corp.</em> v. <em>Thomas &amp; Betts Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/307/241/index.html">307 U. S. 241</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Article III standard often will be met when immunized officials seek to challenge a determination that their conduct violated the Constitution because that ruling may have prospective effect on the parties.  So long as it remains good law, an official who regularly engages in the challenged conduct as part of his job (as Camreta does) must either change the way he performs his duties or risk a meritorious damages action.   The official thus can demonstrate injury, causation, and redressability.  And conversely, if the person who initially brought the suit may again be subject to the challenged conduct, she has a stake in preserving the court\xe2\x80\x99s holding so that she will have ongoing protection from the practice.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s prudential practice of declining to hear appeals by prevailing parties does not bar consideration of immunized officials\xe2\x80\x99 petitions.  The Court has recognized exceptions to this prudential rule when there has been a \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy reaso[n] \xe2\x80\xa6 of sufficient importance to allow an appeal\xe2\x80\x9d by the winner below.  <em>Deposit Guaranty</em>, 445 U. S., at 336, n.\xc2\xa07.  Just such a reason exists in qualified immunity cases.  The constitutional rulings that prevailing parties ask the Court to consider in these cases have a significant future effect on the conduct of public officials and the policies of the government units to which they belong.  The rulings are self-consciously designed to produce this effect by establishing controlling law and preventing invocations of immunity in later cases.  Moreover, they are so designed with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s permission, to promote clarity\xe2\x80\x94and observance\xe2\x80\x94of constitutional rules.  Taken together, these features of qualified immunity cases support bending the usual rule to permit consideration of immunized officials\xe2\x80\x99 petitions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with the nature of these suits: Under \xc2\xa71983 and <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a>, a plaintiff may seek money damages from government officials who have violated her constitutional or statutory rights.  But if those officials are entitled to qualified immunity, a court can dismiss the damages claim without ever deciding its merits\xe2\x80\x94and so the qualified immunity situation threatens to leave standards of official conduct permanently in limbo.  To prevent that problem, this Court has permitted lower courts to determine whether a right exists before examining whether it was clearly established.  See, <em>e.g<font b="1" i="1">., Pearson </font></em><font b="1" i="1">v. <em>Callahan, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/555/223/index.html">555 U. S. 223</a>, 237.  Here, the Ninth Circuit followed exactly this two-step process so that it could settle a question of constitutional law and thereby guide the future conduct of officials.</font></p><font b="1" i="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given its purpose and effect, such a decision is reviewable in this Court at an immunized official\xe2\x80\x99s behest.  If the Court\xe2\x80\x99s usual prevailing party rule applied, the official would either have to acquiesce in a ruling he had no opportunity to contest in this Court, or defy the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s view, adhere to what has been declared an illegal practice, and invite further law suits and possible punitive damages.  <em>Id., </em>at 240\xe2\x80\x93241.  And applying this Court\xe2\x80\x99s usual bar on review would undermine the purpose of the two-step process, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is to clarify constitutional rights without undue delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bunting </em>v.<em> Mellen, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/541/1019/index.html">541 U. S. 1019</a>,<em> </em>1024 (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Just as that purpose may justify an appellate court in reaching beyond an immunity defense to decide a constitutional issue, so too may it support this Court in reviewing the correctness of the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This holding is limited in two respects.  First, it addresses only this Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to review cases in this procedural posture.  The Court need not decide if an appellate court can also entertain an appeal from a party who has prevailed on immunity grounds.  Second, the holding concerns only what the Court may<em> </em>review, not what the Court actually will choose to review.  Going forward, the Court will consider prevailing parties\xe2\x80\x99 petitions one by one in accord with its usual standards for granting certiorari.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0A separate jurisdictional problem requires the Court to dismiss this case at the threshold: The case is moot.  In a dispute of this kind, both the plaintiff and the defendant ordinarily retain a stake in the outcome.  That is true of Camreta, who remains employed as a child protective services worker, and so has an interest in challenging the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling requiring him to obtain a warrant before conducting an in-school interview.  But S.\xc2\xa0G. can no longer claim the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s usual stake in preserving the court\xe2\x80\x99s holding because she no longer needs protection from the challenged practice.  She has moved to Florida and is only months away from her 18th birthday and, presumably, from her high school graduation.  When \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,\xe2\x80\x9d there is no live controversy to review.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/199/index.html">393 U. S. 199</a>, 203.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a civil suit becomes moot pending appeal, this Court has authority to \xe2\x80\x9cdirect the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 as may be just under the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72106.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d practice is to vacate the judgment below, see, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/36/index.html">340 U. S. 36</a>, 39, to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cthose who have been prevented from obtaining the review to which they are entitled [are] not \xe2\x80\xa6 treated as if there had been a review,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>The point of vacatur is to prevent an unreviewable decision \xe2\x80\x9cfrom spawning any legal consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  A constitutional ruling in a qualified immunity case is a legally consequential decision.  When happenstance prevents this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of that ruling, the normal rule should apply: Vacatur rightly \xe2\x80\x9cstrips the decision below of its binding effect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Deakins</em> v. <em>Monaghan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/193/index.html">484 U. S. 193</a>, 200, and clears \xe2\x80\x9cthe path for future relitigation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Munsingwear</em>, 340 U. S., at 40.  Because mootness has frustrated Camreta\xe2\x80\x99s ability to challenge the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that he must obtain a warrant before interviewing a suspected child abuse victim at school, that part of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision must be vacated.

The girl\xe2\x80\x99s mother subsequently sued the government officials on the child\xe2\x80\x99s behalf for damages under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, claiming that the interview infringed the Fourth Amendment.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed, ruling that the officials had violated the Constitution by failing to obtain a warrant to conduct the interview.  But the Court of Appeals further held that qualified immunity shielded the officials from monetary liability because the constitutional right at issue was not clearly established under existing law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The two officials sought this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on the Fourth Amendment.  We granted their petitions to examine two questions.  First, may gov-ernment officials who prevail on grounds of qualified im-munity obtain our review of a court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision that their conduct violated the Constitution?  And second, if we may consider cases in this procedural posture, did the Ninth Circuit correctly determine that this interview breached the Fourth Amendment?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that this Court generally may review a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional ruling at the behest of a government official granted immunity.  But we may not do so in this case for reasons peculiar to it.  The case has become moot because the child has grown up and moved across the country, and so will never again be subject to the Oregon in-school interviewing practices whose constitutionality is at issue.  We therefore do not reach the Fourth Amendment question in this case.  In line with our normal practice when mootness frustrates a party\xe2\x80\x99s right to appeal, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/36/index.html">340 U. S. 36</a>, 39 (1950), we vacate the part of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that decided the Fourth Amendment issue.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February 2003, police arrested Nimrod Greene for suspected sexual abuse of a young boy unrelated to him.  During the investigation of that offense, the boy\xe2\x80\x99s parents told police that they suspected Greene of molesting his 9-year-old daughter S.\xc2\xa0G.  The police reported this information to the Oregon Department of Human Services, which assigned petitioner Bob Camreta, a child protective services caseworker, to assess S.\xc2\xa0G.\xe2\x80\x99s safety.  Several days later, Camreta, accompanied by petitioner James Alford, a Deschutes County deputy sheriff, went to S. G.\xe2\x80\x99s elementary school and interviewed her about the allegations.  Cam-reta and Alford did not have a warrant, nor had they obtained parental consent to conduct the interview.  Although S.\xc2\xa0G. at first denied that her father had molested her, she eventually stated that she had been abused.  Greene was indicted and stood trial for sexually abusing S.\xc2\xa0G., but the jury failed to reach a verdict and the charges were later dismissed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Sarah Greene, S. G.\xe2\x80\x99s mother,  subsequently sued Camreta and Alford on S.\xc2\xa0G.\xe2\x80\x99s behalf\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] for damages under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, which authorizes suits against state officials for violations of constitutional rights.  S. G. alleged that the officials\xe2\x80\x99 in-school interview had breached the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s proscription on unreasonable seizures.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted summary judgment to Camreta and Alford, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals first ruled that the interview violated S.\xc2\xa0G.\xe2\x80\x99s rights because Camreta and Alford had \xe2\x80\x9cseize[d] and interrogate[d] S. G. in the absence of a warrant, a court order, exigent circumstances, or parental consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  588 F.\xc2\xa03d 1011, 1030 (2009) (footnote omitted).  But the court further held that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity from damages liability because no clearly established law had warned them of the illegality of their conduct.  <em>Id., </em>at 1031\xe2\x80\x931033.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit explained why it had chosen to rule on the merits of the constitutional claim, rather than merely hold that the officials were immune from suit.  By addressing the legality of the interview, the court said, it could \xe2\x80\x9cprovide guidance to those charged with the difficult task of protecting child welfare within the confines of\nthe Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1022.  That guidance came in no uncertain terms: \xe2\x80\x9c[G]overnment officials investigating allegations of child abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d the court warned, \xe2\x80\x9cshould cease operating on the assumption that a \xe2\x80\x98special need\xe2\x80\x99 automatically justifies dispensing with traditional Fourth Amendment protections in this context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1033.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the judgment entered was in their favor, Camreta and Alford petitioned this Court to review the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.  S. G. declined to cross-petition for review of the decision that the officials have immunity.  We granted certiorari.  562 U. S. ___ (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first consider our ability to act on a petition brought by government officials who have won final judgment on grounds of qualified immunity, but who object to an appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that they violated the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights.  Camreta and Alford are, without doubt, prevailing parties.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision shielded them from monetary liability, and S. G. chose not to contest that ruling.  So whatever else follows, they will not have to pay S. G. the damages she sought.  The question we confront is whether we may nonetheless review the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holding that the officials violated the Constitution.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute governing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction authorizes us to adjudicate a case in this posture, and S.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71254(1) (emphasis added).  That language covers petitions brought by litigants who have prevailed, as well as those who have\nlost, in the court below.  See E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, &amp; E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice 87 (9th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Stern &amp; Gressman).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0S. G., however, alleges two impediments to our exercise of statutory authority here, one constitutional and the other prudential.  First, she claims that Article III bars review because petitions submitted by immunized officials present no case or controversy.  See Brief for Respondent 31\xe2\x80\x9339.  Second, she argues that our settled practice of declining to hear appeals by prevailing parties should apply with full force when officials have obtained immunity.

To ensure a case remains \xe2\x80\x9cfit for federal-court adjudication,\xe2\x80\x9d the parties must have the necessary stake not only at the outset of litigation, but throughout its course.  <em>Arizonans for Official English</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/43/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/43/index.html">520 U. S. 43</a>, 67 (1997).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have previously recognized that an appeal brought by a prevailing party may satisfy Article III\xe2\x80\x99s case-or-controversy requirement.  See <em>Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Roper</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/326/index.html">445 U. S. 326</a>, 332\xe2\x80\x93336 (1980).  Indeed, we have twice before allowed a party for whom judgment was entered to challenge an unfavorable lower court ruling.  See <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Electrical Fittings Corp.</em> v. <em>Thomas &amp; Betts Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/307/241/index.html">307 U. S. 241</a> (1939).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In that context as in others, we stated, the critical question under Article III is whether the litigant retains the necessary personal stake in the appeal.  <em>Deposit Guaranty</em>, 445 U. S., at 334.  As we will explain, a court will usually invoke rules of \xe2\x80\x9cfederal appellate practice\xe2\x80\x9d to decline review of a prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s challenge even when he has the requisite stake.  <em>Id.</em>, at 333; see <em>infra</em>, at 8.  But in such a case, Article III is not what poses the bar; these rules of practice \xe2\x80\x9cd[o] not have [their] source in the jurisdictional limitations\xe2\x80\x9d of the Constitution.  <em>Deposit Guaranty</em>, 445 U. S., at 333\xe2\x80\x93334.  So long as the litigants possess the personal stake discussed above, an appeal presents a case or controversy, no matter that the appealing party was the prevailing party below.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Article III standard often will be met when immunized officials seek to challenge a ruling that their conduct violated the Constitution.  That is not because a court has made a retrospective judgment about the lawfulness of the officials\xe2\x80\x99 behavior, for that judgment is unaccompanied by any personal liability.  Rather, it is because the judgment may have prospective effect on the parties.  The court in such a case says: \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough this official is immune from damages today, what he did violates the Constitution and he or anyone else who does that thing again will be personally liable.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the official regularly engages in that conduct as part of his job (as Camreta does), he suffers injury caused by the adverse constitutional ruling.  So long as it continues in effect, he must either change the way he performs his duties or risk a meritorious damages action.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 337\xe2\x80\x93338 (discussing prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s stake in a ruling\xe2\x80\x99s prospective effects).  Only by overturning the ruling on appeal can the official gain clearance to engage in the conduct in the future.  He thus can demonstrate, as we demand, injury, causation, and redressability.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And conversely, if the person who initially brought the suit may again be subject to the challenged conduct, she has a stake in preserving the court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  See <em>Erie</em> v. <em>Pap\xe2\x80\x99s A.\xc2\xa0M.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/277/index.html">529 U.

Only if the ruling remains good law will she have ongoing protection from the practice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore reject S. G.\xe2\x80\x99s view that Article III bars\nus from adjudicating any and all challenges brought by government officials who have received immunity below.  That the victor has filed the appeal does not deprive us\nof jurisdiction.  The parties in such cases may yet have\na sufficient \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in the outcome of [a litigated] issue\xe2\x80\x9d to present a case or controversy.  <em>Deposit Guaranty</em>, 445 U.

As a matter of practice and prudence, we have generally declined to consider cases at the request of a prevailing party, even when the Constitution allowed us to do so.  See, <em>e.g., Gunn</em> v. <em>University Comm. to End War in Viet Nam</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/399/383/index.html">399 U. S. 383</a>, 390, n. 5 (1970); <em>New York Telephone Co.</em> v. <em>Maltbie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/291/645/index.html">291 U.

Our\nresources are not well spent superintending each word\na lower court utters en route to a final judgment in the petitioning party\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  See <em>California</em> v. <em>Rooney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/307/index.html">483 U.

We therefore have adhered with some rigor to the principle that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his Court reviews judgments, not statements in opinions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  On the few occasions when we have departed from that principle, we have pointed to a \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy reaso[n] \xe2\x80\xa6 of sufficient importance to allow an appeal\xe2\x80\x9d by the winner below.  <em>Deposit Guaranty</em>, 445 U. S., at 336, n.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think just such a reason places qualified immunity cases in a special category when it comes to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of appeals brought by winners.  The constitutional determinations that prevailing parties ask us to consider in these cases are not mere dicta<em> </em>or \xe2\x80\x9cstatements in opinions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rooney</em>, 483 U. S., at 311 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Bunting</em>, 541 U. S., at 1023 (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (stating that such a determination is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>not</em> mere dictum in the ordinary sense\xe2\x80\x9d).  They are rulings that have a significant future effect on the conduct of public officials\xe2\x80\x94both the prevailing parties and their co-workers\xe2\x80\x94and the policies of the government units to which they belong.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  And more: they are rulings self-consciously designed to produce this effect, by establishing controlling law and preventing invocations of immunity in later cases.  And still more: they are rulings designed this way with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s\npermission, to promote clarity\xe2\x80\x94and observance\xe2\x80\x94of constitutional rules.  We describe in more detail below these fea-tures of the qualified immunity world and why they came to be.  We hold that taken together, they support bending our usual rule to permit consideration of immunized officials\xe2\x80\x99 petitions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin, then, with the nature of these suits: Under \xc2\xa71983 (invoked in this case) and <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971), a plaintiff may seek money damages from government officials who have violated her constitutional or statutory rights.  But to ensure that fear of liability will not \xe2\x80\x9cunduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Creighton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/635/index.html">483 U. S. 635</a>, 638 (1987), the officials may claim qualified immunity; so long as they have not violated a \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d right, they are shielded from personal liability, <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U. S. 800</a>, 818 (1982).  That means a court can often avoid ruling on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim that a particular right exists.  If prior case law has not clearly settled the right, and so given officials fair notice of it, the court can simply dismiss the claim for money damages.  The court need never decide whether the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim, even though novel or otherwise unsettled, in fact has merit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And indeed, our usual adjudicatory rules suggest that\na court <em>should</em> forbear resolving this issue.  After all, a \xe2\x80\x9clongstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lyng</em> v. <em>Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/439/index.html">485 U. S. 439</a>, 445 (1988); see also<em> Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 346\xe2\x80\x93347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  In this category of qualified immunity cases, a court can enter judgment without ever ruling on the (perhaps difficult) constitutional claim the plaintiff has raised.  Small wonder, then, that a court might leave that issue for another day.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we have long recognized that this day may never come\xe2\x80\x94that our regular policy of avoidance sometimes does not fit the qualified immunity situation because it threatens to leave standards of official conduct permanently in limbo.  <em>County of Sacramento</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/833/index.html">523 U. S. 833</a>, 841, n. 5 (1998).  Consider a plausible but unsettled constitutional claim asserted against a government official in a suit for money damages.  The court does not resolve the claim because the official has immunity.  He thus persists in the challenged practice; he knows that he can avoid liability in any future damages action, because the law has still not been clearly established.  Another plaintiff brings suit, and another court both awards immunity and bypasses the claim.  And again, and again, and again.  So the moment of decision does not arrive.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Courts fail to clarify uncertain questions, fail to address novel claims, fail to give guidance to officials about how to comply with legal requirements.  See, <em>e.g., ibid.; Wilson</em> v. <em>Layne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/603/index.html">526 U. S. 603</a>, 609 (1999).  Qualified immunity thus may frustrate \xe2\x80\x9cthe development of constitutional precedent\xe2\x80\x9d and the promotion of law-abiding behavior.  <em>Pearson</em> v. <em>Callahan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/223/index.html"></a><a href="/us/555/223/index.html">555 U. S. 223</a>, 237 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For this reason, we have permitted lower courts to avoid avoidance\xe2\x80\x94that is, to determine whether a right exists before examining whether it was clearly established.  See, <em>e.g., ibid.;</em> <em>Lewis</em>, 523 U. S., at 841, n. 5.  Indeed, for some time we <em>required</em> courts considering qualified immunity claims to first address the constitutional question, so as to promote \xe2\x80\x9cthe law\xe2\x80\x99s elaboration from case to case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, 201 (2001).  More recently, we have left this matter to the discretion of lower courts, and indeed detailed a range of circumstances in which courts should address only the immunity question.  See <em>Pearson</em>, 555 U. S., at 236\xe2\x80\x93242.  In general, courts should think hard, and then think hard again, before turning small cases into large ones.  But it remains true that following the two-step sequence\xe2\x80\x94defining constitutional rights and only then conferring immunity\xe2\x80\x94is sometimes beneficial\nto clarify the legal standards governing public officials.  <em>Id., </em>at 236; see <em>id</em>., at 236\xe2\x80\x93242 (discussing factors courts should consider in making this determination).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the Court of Appeals followed exactly this two-step process, for exactly the reasons we have said may in select circumstances make it \xe2\x80\x9cadvantageous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 242.  The court, as noted earlier, explained that it was \xe2\x80\x9caddress[ing] both prongs of the qualified immunity inquiry \xe2\x80\xa6 to provide guidance to those charged with the difficult task of protecting child welfare within the confines of the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  588 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1022.  To that end, the court adopted constitutional standards to govern all in-school interviews of suspected child abuse victims.  See <em>id., </em>at 1030.  And the court specifically instructed government officials to follow those standards going forward\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9ccease operating on the assumption\xe2\x80\x9d that warrantless interviews are permitted.  See <em>id., </em>at 1033.  With the law thus clearly established, officials who conduct this kind of interview will not receive immunity in the Ninth Circuit.  And the State of Oregon has done just what we would expect in the wake of the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision: It has provided revised legal advice, consonant with the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, to child protective services workers wishing to interview children in schools.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.  The court thus accomplished what it set out to do: settle a question of constitutional law and thereby guide the conduct of officials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given its purpose and effect, such a decision is reviewable in this Court at the behest of an immunized official.  No mere dictum, a constitutional ruling preparatory to a grant of immunity creates law that governs the official\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.  If our usual rule pertaining to prevailing parties applied, the official would \xe2\x80\x9cfac[e] an unenviable choice\xe2\x80\x9d:  He must either acquiesce in a ruling he had no opportunity to contest in this Court, or \xe2\x80\x9cdefy the views of the lower court, adhere to practices that have been declared illegal, and thus invite new suits and potential punitive damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pearson</em>, 555 U. S., at 240\xe2\x80\x93241 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  And if our usual bar on review applied, it would undermine the very purpose served by the two-step process, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is to clarify constitutional rights without undue delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bunting</em>, 541 U. S., at 1024 (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  This Court, needless to say, also plays a role in clarifying rights.  Just as that purpose may justify an appellate court in reaching beyond an immunity defense to decide a constitutional issue, so too that purpose may support this Court in reviewing the correctness of the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We emphasize, however, two limits of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  First, it addresses only our own authority to review cases in this procedural posture.  The Ninth Circuit had no oc-casion to consider whether it could hear an appeal from\nan immunized official: In that court, after all, S. G. appealed the judgment in the officials\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  We therefore need not and do not decide if an appellate court, too, can entertain an appeal from a party who has prevailed on immunity grounds.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Second, our holding concerns only what this Court <em>may </em>review; what we actually will choose to review is a different matter.  That choice will be governed by the ordinary principles informing our decision whether to grant certiorari\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cpower [we] \xe2\x80\xa6 sparingly exercis[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Forsyth</em> v. <em>Hammond</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/166/506/index.html">166 U.

Our decision today does no more than exempt one special category of cases from our usual rule against considering prevailing parties\xe2\x80\x99 petitions.  Going forward, we will consider these petitions one by one in accord with our usual standards.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we reject S. G.\xe2\x80\x99s arguments for dismissing this case at the threshold, we find that a separate jurisdictional problem requires that result: This case, we conclude, is moot.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained above, <em>supra, </em>at 6\xe2\x80\x937, in a dispute of this kind, both the plaintiff and the defendant ordinarily retain a stake in the outcome.  That is true of one defendant here: Camreta remains employed as a child protective services worker, so he has an interest in challenging the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling requiring him to obtain a warrant before conducting an in-school interview.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]<f f="Times New Roman"> <f f="Century Schoolbook"> But S.\xc2\xa0G. can no longer claim the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s usual stake in preserving the court\xe2\x80\x99s holding because she is no longer in need\nof any protection from the challenged practice.

What is more, S.\xc2\xa0G. is now only months away from her 18th birthday\xe2\x80\x94and, presumably, from her high school graduation.  See <em>id.,\n</em>at 31.  S. G. therefore cannot be affected by the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling; she faces not the slightest possibility of being seized in a school in the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction as part of a child abuse investigation.  When \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,\xe2\x80\x9d we have no live controversy to review.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/199/index.html">393 U.

The point of vacatur is to prevent an unreviewable decision \xe2\x80\x9cfrom spawning any legal consequences,\xe2\x80\x9d so that no party is harmed by what we have called a \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary\xe2\x80\x9d adjudication.  <em>Munsingwear</em>, 340 U.

As we have just explained, a consti-tutional ruling in a qualified immunity case is a legally consequential decision; that is the very reason we think it appropriate for review even at the behest of a prevailing party.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9312.  When happenstance prevents that review from occurring, the normal rule should ap-\nply: Vacatur then rightly \xe2\x80\x9cstrips the decision below of its binding effect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Deakins</em> v. <em>Monaghan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/193/index.html">484 U.

Many Courts of Appeals therefore decline to consider district court precedent when determining if constitutional rights are clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity.

See Brief for Respondent 1, n. 2; Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 09\xe2\x80\x931478.  Because Alford will not again participate in a child abuse investigation, he has lost his interest in the Fourth Amendment ruling.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937; cf. <em>Arizonans for Official English</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/43/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/43/index.html">520 U.

But in light of Camreta\xe2\x80\x99s continuing stake, Alford\xe2\x80\x99s altered circumstances are immaterial to our resolution of this dispute, and we do not decide any questions that would arise if he were the only defendant.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Our analysis of the proper disposition of this case follows from our conclusion that government officials who secure a favorable judgment on immunity grounds may obtain our review of an adverse constitutional holding.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12.  As just noted, <em>Munsingwear</em> justified vacatur to protect a litigant who had the right to appeal but lost that opportunity due to happenstance.  340 U. S., at 39, 41.  We have therefore left lower court decisions intact when mootness did not deprive the appealing party of any review to which he was entitled.  See, <em>e.g., U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.</em>, 513 U. S., at 25 (holding that the appealing party had \xe2\x80\x9csurrender[ed] his claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur\xe2\x80\x9d by settling the case and thus \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily forfeit[ing] his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Karcher</em> v. <em>May</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/72/index.html">484 U. S. 72</a>, 83 (1987) (holding that vacatur in light of mootness was not warranted when the losing party declined to file an appeal).  So if immunized officials could not challenge an appellate decision in this Court, we would choose not to exercise our equitable authority to vacate that decision, even if the case later became moot.  But here, as we have just explained, the theory that underlies our prior cases applying <em>Munsingwear </em>is satisfied: Vacatur expunges an adverse decision that would be reviewable had this case not become moot.  See <em>Arizonans</em>, 520 U. S., at 74 (finding vacatur proper because, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the mooting event occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d the Arizona Attorney General was pursuing his \xe2\x80\x9cright to present argument on appeal\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Our disposition of this case differs slightly from the normal <em>Munsingwear</em> order vacating the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remanding the case with instructions to dismiss the relevant claim.  We leave untouched the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling on qualified immunity and its corresponding dismissal of S.\xc2\xa0G.\xe2\x80\x99s claim because S.\xc2\xa0G. chose not to challenge that ruling.  We vacate the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling addressing the merits of the Fourth Amendment issue because, as we have explained, <em>supra, </em>at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, that is the part of the decision that mootness prevents us from reviewing but that has prospective effects on Camreta.

The Court is correct to note the problem presented when, on the one hand, its precedents permit or invite courts to rule on the merits of a constitutional claim even when qualified immunity disposes of the matter; and, on the other hand, jurisdictional principles prevent us from reviewing those invited rulings.  It does seem that clarification is required.  In my view, however, the correct solution is not to override jurisdictional rules that are basic to the functioning of the Court and to the necessity of avoiding advisory opinions.  Dictum, though not precedent, may have its utility; but it ought not to be treated as a judgment standing on its own.

Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842, and n.\xc2\xa08 (1984) (collecting cases).  The rule has been noted and followed since the early years of this Court.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe question before an appellate Court is, was the <em>judgment </em>correct, not the <em>ground </em>on which the judgment professes to proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McClung</em> v. <em>Silliman</em>, 6 Wheat. 598, 603 (1821).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule against hearing appeals or accepting petitions for certiorari by prevailing parties is related to the Article III prohibition against issuing advisory opinions.  This principle underlies, for example, the settled rule against hearing cases involving a disputed judgment based on grounds of state law.  As Justice Jackson explained for the Court: \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur power is to correct wrong judgments, not to revise opinions.  We are not permitted to render an advisory opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered by the state court after we corrected its views of federal laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Herb</em> v. <em>Pitcairn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/324/117/index.html">324 U. S. 117</a>, 125\xe2\x80\x93126 (1945).  This point has been repeated with force and clarity.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Long</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U. S. 1032</a>, 1041\xe2\x80\x931042 (1983).  The \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judicial Power\xe2\x80\x99 is one to render dis-positive judgments,\xe2\x80\x9d not advisory opinions.  <em>Plaut</em> v. <em>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/211/index.html">514 U. S. 211</a>, 219 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule against hearing appeals by prevailing parties applies in countless situations, many involving government parties.  Deficient performance may not yield prejudice under <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  A defective warrant may be entitled to good-faith reliance under <em>United States</em> v. <em>Leon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html">468 U. S. 897</a> (1984).  An unreasonable search may be cured through the inevitable discovery doctrine of <em>Nix</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/431/index.html">467 U. S. 431</a> (1984).  In these and myriad other situations, an error is identified, but that conclusion does not affect the ultimate judgment entered.  In all these contexts, it is established that the prevailing party may not appeal.  This conclusion holds true even though a statement on the merits can have adverse consequences for the prevailing party.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s use of analysis that may have been adverse to the State\xe2\x80\x99s long-term interests does not allow the State to claim status as a losing party for purposes of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rooney</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nonetheless holds that defendants who prevail in the Courts of Appeals based on qualified immunity may still obtain review in this Court.  This point is put in perspective by the fact that the Court today, in an altogether unprecedented disposition, says that it vacates not a judgment but rather \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is unsettling in its implications.  Even on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of our cases, the almost invariable rule is that prevailing parties are not permitted to obtain a writ of certiorari.  Cf. <em>Kalka </em>v.<em> Hawk</em>, 215 F.\xc2\xa03d 90, 96, n.\xc2\xa09 (CADC 2000) (concluding that the Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9chas apparently never granted the certiorari petition of a party who prevailed in the appellate court\xe2\x80\x9d).  After today, however, it will be common for prevailing parties to seek certiorari based on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s newfound exception. And that will be so even though the \xe2\x80\x9cadmonition\xe2\x80\x9d against reviewing mere statements in opinions \xe2\x80\x9chas special force when the statements raise consti-tutional questions, for it is our settled practice to avoid \nthe unnecessary decision of such issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FCC</em> v. <em>Pacifica Foundation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/726/index.html">438 U. S. 726</a>, 734 (1978).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court defends its holding with citations to just two of our cases.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.<em> </em>Neither provides support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first case is <em>Electrical Fittings Corp.</em> v. <em>Thomas &amp; Betts Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/307/241/index.html">307 U. S. 241</a> (1939).  There, a plaintiff alleged the infringement of two patent claims.  The District Court found the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s first claim valid but not infringed and the second claim invalid.  Rather than issuing a judgment \xe2\x80\x9cdismissing the bill without more,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court instead \xe2\x80\x9centered a decree adjudging claim 1 valid\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdismissing the bill for failure to prove infringement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 241\xe2\x80\x93242.  The District Court thus issued a formal judgment regarding the validity of the first claim.  The defendant appealed to dispute that claim\xe2\x80\x99s validity.  This Court noted, without qualification, that a party \xe2\x80\x9cmay not appeal from a judgment or decree in his favor, for the purpose of obtaining a review of findings he deems erroneous which are not necessary to support the decree.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 242.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>this Court went on to explain, \xe2\x80\x9chere the decree itself purports to adjudge the validity of claim 1, and though \nthe adjudication was immaterial to the disposition of the cause, it stands as an adjudication of one of the issues litigated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>In other words, the District Court had entered an unnecessary legal conclusion into the terms of the judgment itself, making it possible, for example, that the decree would have estoppel effect as to an issue whose resolution was unnecessary to the proper judgment of dismissal.  <em>Electrical Fittings </em>therefore concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe petitioners were entitled to have this portion of the decree eliminated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The sole relief provided was \nan order for the \xe2\x80\x9creformation of the decree.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  That result accords with, indeed flows from, the settled rule that this Court reviews only judgments, not statements in opinions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second case is <em>Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Roper</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/326/index.html">445 U. S. 326</a> (1980).  In that case plaintiffs attempted to bring a class action against a bank.  After the District Court denied class certification, the defendant tendered to the plaintiffs the maximum value that they could recover as individuals.  Of course, that offer did \nnot amount to \xe2\x80\x9call that ha[d] been requested in the \ncomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x9crelief for the class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 341 (Rehnquist, J., concurring).  It is therefore no surprise that the plaintiffs responded with \xe2\x80\x9ca counteroffer of judgment in which they attempted to reserve the right to appeal the adverse class certification ruling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 329 (opinion of the Court).  But that proposal was denied.  \xe2\x80\x9cBased on the bank\xe2\x80\x99s offer, the District Court entered judgment in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 favor, over their objection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 330<em>.</em>  The District Court thus issued a judgment other than the one the plaintiffs had sought.  The would-be class plaintiffs appealed, and this Court later granted certiorari.  The Court held that appeal was not barred by the prevailing-party rule: \xe2\x80\x9cWe view the denial of class certification as \nan example of a procedural ruling, collateral to the merits of a litigation, that is appealable after the entry of final judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 336.  As the Court explained, the plaintiffs had obtained only a judgment in their individual capacities.  Yet the plaintiffs had \xe2\x80\x9casserted as their personal stake in the appeal their desire to shift to successful class litigants a portion of those fees and expenses that have been incurred in this litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 334, n.\xc2\xa06; see also <em>id</em>., at 336.  Because the purported prevailing parties were injured by their failure to obtain the class-based \njudgment they had sought, the Court held there was \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction to entertain the appeal only to review the asserted procedural error, not for the purpose of passing on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court<em> </em>was clear that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of class certification had a direct effect on the judgment: \xe2\x80\x9cAs in <em>Electrical Fittings</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the purported prevailing parties \xe2\x80\x9cwere entitled to have [a] portion of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment reviewed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither <em>Electrical Fittings </em>nor <em>Deposit Guaranty </em>provides support for the rule adopted today.  Those decisions instead held that, in the unusual circumstances presented, particular parties who at first appeared to have prevailed below had in fact failed to obtain the judgments they had sought.  This Court therefore had jurisdiction, including of course jurisdiction under Article III, to provide relief for the harm caused by the adverse judgments entered below.  The parties seeking appeal in <em>Electrical Fittings </em>and <em>Deposit Guaranty</em> might be compared with plaintiffs who have requested $1,000 in relief but obtained only $500.  Such parties have prevailed in part, but have not \xe2\x80\x9creceive[d] all that [they] ha[d] sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Deposit Guaranty</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 333.  In contrast the Court appears to assume that the petitioners in the present case are true prevailing parties.  They have obtained from the Court of Appeals the only formal judgment they requested: denial of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim for damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court points to policy concerns as the basis for its willingness to hear appeals by prevailing parties.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  But those concerns are unwarranted.  In only one dissenting opinion has it been suggested that certiorari should be granted to reach a merits determination \xe2\x80\x9clocked inside\xe2\x80\x9d a favorable qualified immunity ruling.  <em>Bunting </em>v.<em> Mellen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/1019/index.html">541 U. S. 1019</a>, 1024 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  That dissenting opinion was issued in response to the rule that constitutional issues should be decided in every case involving qualified immunity.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1025.  Yet that mandated rule of decision has now been disapproved, so the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument is no longer applicable.  See <em>Pearson</em> v. <em>Callahan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/223/index.html">555 U. S. 223</a> (2009).  Indeed, the Court today suggests that it still would not allow review of the merits even in the case that provoked the dissent.  Unlike petitioner Camreta, the petitioner in <em>Bunting</em> had left the Government\xe2\x80\x99s employ before filing a petition for certiorari and so lacked standing to obtain review in this Court.  Compare 541 U. S., at 1025, n., with <em>id.</em>, at 1021 (Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari), and <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, and n.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The instant case thus appears to be the first in which the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new exception to the prevailing party rule might have been applied.  And even here that exception is neither necessary nor sufficient for the merits to be adjudicated by this Court.  The Fourth Amendment question decided below is bound to arise again in future cases.  Indeed, the reasoning of the decision below implicates a number of decisions in other Courts of Appeals.  Cf. 588 F.\xc2\xa03d 1011, 1026, n.\xc2\xa011 (CA9 2009) (collecting cases).  Yet today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not supply the Courts of Appeals with guidance as to these merits issues.  The Court instead vacates part of the reasoning of the decision below, thereby leaving other decisions intact and unreviewed.  The Court thus resolves difficult constitutional issues and provides an unprecedented answer to \xe2\x80\x9can important question of judicial policy,\xe2\x80\x9d all to no end.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court errs in reading <em>Electrical Fittings </em>and <em>Deposit Guaranty </em>to permit review and, indeed, the provision of relief disconnected from any judgment.  The result is an erroneous and unbounded exception to an essential principle of judicial restraint.  Parties who have obtained all requested relief may not seek review here.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As today\xe2\x80\x99s decision illustrates, our recent qualified im-munity cases tend to produce decisions that are in ten-\nsion with conventional principles of case-or-controversy adjudication.  This Court has given the Courts of Appeals \xe2\x80\x9cpermission\xe2\x80\x9d to find constitutional violations when ordering dismissal or summary judgment based on qualified immunity.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9; see <em>Pearson</em>, <em>supra</em>.  This invitation, as the Court is correct to note, was intended to produce binding constitutional holdings on the merits.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  The goal was to make dictum precedent, in order to hasten the gradual process of constitutional interpretation and alter the behavior of government defendants.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The present case brings the difficulties of that objective into perspective.  In express reliance on the permission granted in <em>Pearson</em>, the Court of Appeals went out of its way to announce what may be an erroneous interpretation of the Constitution; and, under our case law, the Ninth Circuit must give that dictum legal effect as precedent in future cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this way unnecessary merits decisions in qualified immunity cases could come to resemble declaratory judgments or injunctions.  Indeed the United States as <em>amicus curiae </em>contends that the merits decision below \xe2\x80\x9chas an effect similar to an injunction or a declaratory judgment against the government as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 13.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion adopts that view, providing as relief the vacatur of \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, the part of the opinion that rules on the constitutional merits.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  For the first time, <em>obiter dictum</em> is treated not just as precedent for future cases but as a judgment in its own right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals in this case did not in fact issue a declaratory judgment or injunction embodying a determination on the merits, and it does not appear that a judgment of that kind could have issued.  Plaintiffs must establish standing as to each form of relief they request, yet the plaintiff in this case had no separate interest in obtaining a declaratory judgment.  See <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, 103\xe2\x80\x93105 (1983) (citing <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Mattis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/171/index.html">431 U. S. 171</a> (1977) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Golden</em> v. <em>Zwickler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/103/index.html">394 U. S. 103</a> (1969)); see also <em>MedImmune, Inc.</em> v. <em>Genentech, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/118/index.html">549 U. S. 118</a>, 127 (2007).  There was no likelihood that S.\xc2\xa0G., the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, would again be subjected to interrogation while at school, much less that she would be interrogated by petitioner-defendant Camreta, so S.\xc2\xa0G. would seem to have had no greater stake in obtaining a declaratory judgment than the plaintiff in <em>Lyons</em> had in obtaining an injunction.  See 461 U. S., at 104 (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cactual controversy that must exist for a declaratory judgment to be entered\xe2\x80\x9d).  Our qualified immunity cases should not permit plaintiffs in constitutional cases to make an end-run around established principles of justiciability.  In treating dictum as though it were a declaratory judgment or an injunction, the Court appears to approve the issuance of such judgments outside the bounds of Article III jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court creates an exception to the prevailing party rule in order to solve the difficulties created by our qualified immunity jurisprudence, but the Court\xe2\x80\x99s solution creates new problems.  Sometimes defendants in qualified immunity cases have no particular interest in disputing the constitutional merits.  Acknowledging as much, the Court notes that petitioner Alford no longer works for the government and so \xe2\x80\x9chas lost his interest in the Fourth Amendment ruling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa09.  In concluding that Alford lacks Article III standing, the Court suggests that \nit would lack jurisdiction to review and perhaps even to vacate the merits decision of the Court of Appeals if respondent had sued only Alford.  <em>Ibid</em>.<em>;</em> cf. <em>Arizonans for Official English</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/43/index.html">520 U. S. 43</a>, 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (1997) (discussing standing to obtain review in this Court as well as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction to vacate judgments issued without jurisdiction).<em> </em>That suggestion is disconcerting.  Under today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, it appears that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to review merits determinations in qualified immunity cases is contingent on the defendant who has been sued.  A defendant who has left the government\xe2\x80\x99s employ or otherwise lacks an interest in disputing the merits will \nbe unable to obtain further review.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa09 (discussing Article III limits on relief in this Court)<em>; ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa010 (discussing limitations on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable vacatur authority).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today avoids this difficulty by concluding that petitioner Camreta has suffered an Article III injury.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7; cf. <em>ante</em>, at 15, n.\xc2\xa09 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e do not decide any questions that would arise if [Alford] were the only defendant\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the Court can reach that conclusion only because, \xe2\x80\x9cas part of his job,\xe2\x80\x9d Camreta \xe2\x80\x9cregularly engages\xe2\x80\x9d in conduct made unlawful by the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  As discussed below, this conclusion is doubtful.  See <em>infra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  In any event the Court\xe2\x80\x99s standing analysis will be inapplicable in most qualified immunity cases.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 6 (asserting that the \xe2\x80\x9cArticle III standard often will be met\xe2\x80\x9d).<em> </em>When an officer is sued for taking an extraordinary action, such as using excessive force during a high-speed car chase, there is little possibility that a constitutional decision on the merits will again influence that officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  The officer, like petitioner Alford or the petitioner in <em>Bunting</em>,<em> </em>would have no interest in litigating the merits in the Court of Appeals and, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule, would seem unable to obtain review of a merits ruling by petitioning for certiorari.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937; <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa09,<em> ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa010; see also <em>Lyons</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 103\xe2\x80\x93105.  This problem will arise with great frequency in qualified immunity cases.  Once again, the decision today allows plaintiffs to obtain binding constitutional determinations on the merits that lie beyond this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction to review.  The Court thus fails to solve the problem it identifies. </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is most doubtful that Article III permits appeals by any officer to whom the reasoning of a judicial decision might be applied in a later suit.  Yet that appears to be \nthe implication of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  The favorable judg-ment of the Court of Appeals did not in itself cause petitioner Camreta to suffer an Article III injury entitling him to appeal.  Cf. <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x937 (discussing <em>Electrical Fittings </em>and <em>Deposit Guaranty</em>); <em>ASARCO Inc.</em> v. <em>Kadish</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/605/index.html">490 U. S. 605</a>, 619 (1989) (finding an Article III controversy where petitioner challenged \xe2\x80\x9ca final judgment altering tangible legal rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  On the contrary, Camreta has been injured by the decision below to no greater extent than have hundreds of other government officers who might argue that they too have been affected by the unnecessary statements made by the Court of Appeals.  The Court notes as a limit on its authority to entertain appeals from prevailing parties certain statutory directives, directives that can be interpreted or shaped to allow expanded powers of review.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.<em> </em>But even if Congress were to give explicit permission for certiorari petitions to be filed by \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d instead of by \xe2\x80\x9cany party,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71254(1), the constitutional definition of a case or controversy would still constrain this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis appears to rest on the premise that the reasoning of the decision below in itself causes Camreta injury.  Until today, however, precedential reasoning of general applicability divorced from a particular adverse judgment was not thought to yield \xe2\x80\x9cstanding to appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Parr</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/351/513/index.html">351 U.

It is revealing that the Court creates an exception to the prevailing party rule while making clear that the Courts of Appeals are not to follow suit, in any context.  See<em> ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that precedent of general applicability cannot in itself create standing to sue or appeal flows from basic principles.  Camreta\xe2\x80\x99s asserted injury is caused not by the Court of Appeals or by respondent but rather by \xe2\x80\x9cthe independent action of some third party not before the court\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, by the still-unidentified private plaintiffs whose lawsuits Camreta hopes to avoid.  <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560\xe2\x80\x93561 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This circumstance distinguishes the present case from requests for declaratory or injunctive relief filed against officeholders who threaten legal enforcement.  An inert rule of law does not cause particular, concrete injury; only the specific threat of its enforcement can do so.  That is why the proper defendant in a suit for prospective relief is the party prepared to enforce the relevant legal rule against the plaintiff.  See <em>MedImmune, Inc.</em>, 549 U. S., at 127 (explaining that declaratory relief requires a controversy \xe2\x80\x9cbetween parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Farm Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/289/index.html">442 U. S. 289</a>, 298\xe2\x80\x93299 (1979) (\xe2\x80\x9cA plaintiff who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s operation or enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d).  Without an adverse judgment from which to appeal, Camreta has in effect filed a new declaratory judgment action in this Court against the Court of Appeals.  This is no more consistent with Article III than filing a declaratory judgment action against this Court for its issuance of an adverse precedent or against Congress in response to its enactment of an unconstitutional law.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If today\xe2\x80\x99s decision proves to be more than an isolated anomaly, the Court might find it necessary to reconsider its special permission that the Courts of Appeals may issue unnecessary merits determinations in qualified im-munity cases with binding precedential effect.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other dynamics permit the law of the Constitution to be elaborated within the conventional framework of a case or controversy.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he development of constitutional law is by no means entirely dependent on cases in which the defendant may seek qualified immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pearson</em>, 555 U. S., at 242\xe2\x80\x93243.  For example, qualified immunity does not bar Fourth and Fifth Amendment suppression challenges.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kentucky</em> v. <em>King</em>, <em>ante</em>, p. ___.  Nor does it prevent invocation of the Constitution as a defense against criminal prosecution, civil suit, or cruel and unusual punishment.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Phelps</em>, 562 U. S. ___ (2011); <em>Graham</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, 560 U. S. ___ (2010); <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/558/index.html">539 U. S. 558</a> (2003).  Nor is qualified immunity available in constitutional suits against municipalities\xe2\x80\x94as this very case illustrates.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.<em> </em>Our cases make clear, moreover, that \xe2\x80\x9cofficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hope</em> v. <em>Pelzer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/730/index.html">536 U. S. 730</a>, 741 (2002).  That rule permits clearly established violations to be found when extreme though unheard-of actions violate the Constitution.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ibid.  </em>Furthermore, constitutional plaintiffs may seek declaratory or injunctive relief pursuant to standard principles of justiciability.  Those plaintiffs do not need <em>Pearson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s special rule.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Citizens United</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 558 U. S. ___ (2010); <em>McDonald</em> v. <em>Chicago</em>, 561 U. S. ___ (2010).  In any event, some incremental advance in the law occurs even when clearly established violations are found.  It is an inevitable aspect of judicial decisionmaking that the resolution of one legal question or factual dispute casts light on the next.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be preferable at least to explore refinements to our qualified immunity jurisprudence before altering basic principles of jurisdiction.  For instance, the objectives of qualified immunity might be satisfied if there were no bar to reaching the merits and issuing judgment when requested damages are nominal and substantial attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees are waived or not allowed.  Cf. <em>Farrar</em> v. <em>Hobby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/103/index.html">506 U. S. 103</a>, 112\xe2\x80\x93115 (1992) (discussing unavailability of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees where nominal damages are only relief); <em>Hewitt</em> v. <em>Helms</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/755/index.html">482 U. S. 755</a>, 761\xe2\x80\x93763 (1987); <em>Harlow</em> \nv. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U. S. 800</a>, 819, n. 34 (1982); <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Piphus</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/247/index.html">435 U. S. 247</a>, 266 (1978) (discussing the propriety of providing nominal damages as relief).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The desire to resolve more constitutional questions ought not lead to altering our jurisdictional rules.  That is the precise object that our legal tradition tells us we should resist.  Haste to resolve constitutional issues has never been thought advisable.  We instead have encouraged the Courts of Appeals to follow \xe2\x80\x9cthat older, wiser judicial counsel not to pass on questions of constitutionality \xe2\x80\xa6 unless such adjudication is unavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/372/index.html">550 U. S. 372</a>, 388 (2007) (Breyer, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted); see generally <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  Experience teaches that there is no persuasive reason to reverse normal principles of judicial review in qualified immunity cases.  Compare, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pearson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 236, and <em>Siegert</em> v. <em>Gilley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/226/index.html">500 U. S. 226</a>, 235 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t seems to reverse the usual ordering of issues to tell the trial and appellate courts that they should resolve the constitutional question first\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>id</em>., at 232 (opinion of the Court), and <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, 201 (2001).  Yet this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpuzzling misadventure in constitutional dictum\xe2\x80\x9d still has not come to an end.  Leval, Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta, 81 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1249, 1275 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There will be instances where courts discuss the merits in qualified immunity cases.  It is sometimes a better analytic approach and a preferred allocation of judicial time and resources to dismiss a claim on the merits rather than to dismiss based on qualified immunity.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t often may be difficult to decide whether a right is clearly established without deciding precisely what the existing constitutional right happens to be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pearson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 236 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court should not superintend the judicial decisionmaking process in qualified immunity cases under special rules, lest it make the judicial process more complex for civil rights suits than for other litigation.  It follows, however, that the Court should provide no special permission to reach the merits.  If qualified immunity cases were treated like other cases raising constitutional questions, settled principles of con-stitutional avoidance would apply.  So would conven-\ntional rules regarding dictum and holding.<em> </em>Judicial observations made in the course of explaining a case might give important instruction and be relevant when assessing a later claim of qualified immunity.  Cf. <em>Wilkinson </em>v.<em> Russell</em>, 182 F.\xc2\xa03d 89, 112, and n. 3 (CA2 1999) (Calabresi, J., concurring).  But as dicta<em> </em>those remarks would not establish law and would not qualify as binding precedent.  See <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla.</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/44/index.html">517 U. S. 44</a>, 67 (1996).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The distance our qualified immunity jurisprudence has taken us from foundational principles is made all the more apparent by today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The Court must construe two of its precedents in so broad a manner that they are taken out of their proper and logical confines.  To vacate the reasoning of the decision below, the Court accepts that <em>obiter dictum</em> is not just binding precedent but a judgment susceptible to plenary review.  I would dismiss this case and note that our jurisdictional rule against hearing appeals by prevailing parties precludes petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to obtain review of judicial reasoning disconnected from a judgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
