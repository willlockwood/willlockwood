The initial plan had a maximum population deviation from absolute equality of districts of 4.07%, but the Commission adopted a revised plan with an 8.8% deviation on a 3-to-2 vote, with the Republican members dissenting.  After the Department of Justice approved the revised plan as consistent with the Voting Rights Act, appellants filed suit, claiming that the plan\xe2\x80\x99s population variations were inconsistent with the\n \nFourteenth Amendment.  A three-judge Federal District Court entered judgment for the Commission, concluding that the \xe2\x80\x9cdeviations were primarily a result of good-faith efforts to comply with the Voting Rights Act .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. even though partisanship played some role.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The District Court did not err in upholding Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting plan.

Because the deviation here is under 10%, appellants cannot rely upon the numbers to show a constitutional violation.  Instead, they must show that it is more probable than not that the deviation reflects the predominance of illegitimate reapportionment factors rather than \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate considerations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Appellants have failed to meet that burden here, where the record supports the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the deviations predominantly reflected Commission efforts to achieve compliance with the Voting Rights Act, not to secure political advantage for the Democratic Party.  To meet the Voting Rights Act\xe2\x80\x99s nonretrogression requirement, a new plan, when compared to the current plan (benchmark plan), must not diminish the number of districts in which minority groups can \xe2\x80\x9celect their preferred candidates of choice\xe2\x80\x9d (ability-to-elect districts).  A State can obtain legal assurance that it has satisfied this requirement if it submits its proposed plan to the Justice Department and the Department does not object to the plan.  The record shows that the Commission redrew the initial map to ensure that the plan had 10 ability-to-elect districts, the same number as the benchmark plan.  But after a statistician reported that the Justice Department still might not agree with the plan, the Commission changed additional boundaries, causing District 8, a Republican leaning district, to become more politically competitive.  Because this record well supports the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the Commission was trying to comply with the Voting Rights Act, appellants have not shown that it is more probable than not that illegitimate considerations were the predominant motivation for the deviations.  They have thus failed to show that the plan violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 additional arguments are unpersuasive.  While Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic-leaning districts may be somewhat underpopulated and its Republican-leaning districts somewhat overpopulated, these variations may reflect only the tendency of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s 2010 minority populations to vote disproportionately for Democrats and thus can be explained by the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to maintain at least 10 ability-to-elect districts.  <i>Cox</i> v. <i>Larios</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 947\n, in which the Court affirmed a District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that a Georgia reapportionment plan violated the Equal Protection Clause where its deviation, though less than 10%, resulted from the use of illegitimate factors, is inapposite because appellants have not carried their burden of showing the use of illegitimate factors here.  And because <i>Shelby County </i>was decided after Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s plan was created, it has no bearing on the issue whether the State\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to comply with the Voting Rights Act is a legitimate state interest.

See <i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Sims</i>,\n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533,\n577 (1964)\n.  Because the maximum population deviation between the largest and the smallest district is less than 10%, the appellants cannot simply rely upon the numbers to show that the plan violates the Constitution.  See <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Thomson</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 835,\n842 (1983)\n.  Nor have appellants adequately supported their contentions with other evidence.  We consequently affirm a 3-judge Federal District Court decision upholding the plan.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In 2000, Arizona voters, using the initiative process, amended the Arizona Constitution to provide for an independent redistricting commission.  See<i> Arizona State Legislature</i> v. <i>Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 35) (upholding the amendment as consistent with federal constitutional and statutory law).  Each decade, the Arizona Commission on Appellate Court Appointments creates three slates of individuals: one slate of 10 Republicans, one slate of 10 Democrats, and one slate of 5 individuals not affiliated with any political party.  The majority and minority leader of the Arizona Legislature each select one Redistricting Commission member from the first two lists.  These four selected individuals in turn choose one member from the third, nonpartisan list.  See Ariz. Const., Art. IV, pt. 2, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71(5)\xe2\x80\x93(8).  Thus, the membership of the Commission consists of two Republicans, two Democrats, and one independent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After each decennial census, the Commission redraws Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s 30 legislative districts.  The first step in the process is to create \xe2\x80\x9cdistricts of equal population in a grid-like pattern across the state.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71(14).  It then adjusts the grid to \xe2\x80\x9cthe extent practicable\xe2\x80\x9d in order to take into account the need for population equality; to maintain geographic compactness and continuity; to show respect for \xe2\x80\x9ccommunities of interest\xe2\x80\x9d; to follow locality boundaries; and to use \xe2\x80\x9cvisible geographic features\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cundivided .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. tracts.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71(14)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(E).  The Commission will \xe2\x80\x9cfavo[r]\xe2\x80\x9d political \xe2\x80\x9ccompetitive[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d as long as its efforts to do so \xe2\x80\x9ccreate no significant detriment to the other goals.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Id.</i>, \xc2\xa71(14)(F).  Finally, it must adjust boundaries \xe2\x80\x9cas necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with the Federal Constitution and with the federal Voting Rights Act.  \xc2\xa71(14)(A). </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After the 2010 census, the legislative leadership selected the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s two Republican and two Democratic members, who in turn selected an independent member, Colleen Mathis.  Mathis was then elected chairwoman.  The Commission hired two counsel, one of whom they thought of as leaning Democrat and one as leaning Republican.  It also hired consultants, including mapping specialists, a statistician, and a Voting Rights Act specialist.  With the help of its staff, it drew an initial plan, based upon the gridlike map, with district boundaries that produced a maximum population deviation (calculated as the difference between the most populated and least populated district) of 4.07%.  After changing several boundaries, including those of Districts 8, 24, and 26, the Commission adopted a revised plan by a vote of 3 to 2, with the two Republican members voting against it.  In late April 2012, the Department of Justice approved the plan as consistent with the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The next day, appellants filed this lawsuit, primarily claiming that the plan\xe2\x80\x99s population variations were inconsistent with the\n \nFourteenth Amendment.  A 3-judge Federal District Court heard the case.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72284(a) (providing for the convention of such a court whenever an action is filed challenging the constitutional-ity of apportionment of legislative districts).  After a 5-day bench trial, the court, by a vote of 2 to 1, entered judgment for the Commission.  The majority found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe population deviations were primarily a result of good-faith efforts to comply with the Voting Rights Act .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. even though partisanship played some role.\xe2\x80\x9d  993 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1042, 1046 (Ariz. 2014).  Appellants sought direct review in this Court.  See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253.  We noted probable jurisdiction on June 30, 2015, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The\n \nFourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Equal Protection Clause requires States to \xe2\x80\x9cmake an honest and good faith effort to construct [legislative] districts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as nearly of equal population as is practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reynolds</i>, 377 U. S., at 577.  The Constitution, however, does not demand mathematical perfection.  In determining what is \xe2\x80\x9cpracticable,\xe2\x80\x9d we have recognized that the Constitution permits deviation when it is justified by \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 579.  In related contexts, we have made clear that in addition to the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional districting principles such as compactness [and] contiguity,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630,\n647 (1993)\n, those legitimate considerations can include a state interest in maintaining the integrity of political subdivisions, <i>Mahan</i> v. <i>Howell</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 315,\n328 (1973)\n, or the competitive balance among political parties, <i>Gaffney</i> v. <i>Cummings</i>,\n\n412 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735,\n752 (1973)\n.  In cases decided before <i>Shelby County </i>v. <i>Holder</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), Members of the Court expressed the view that compliance with \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act is also a legitimate state consideration that can justify some deviation from perfect equality of population.  See<i> League of United Latin American Citizens</i> v. <i>Perry</i>,\n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399,\n518 (2006)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part, joined in relevant part by Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., Thomas &amp; Alito, JJ.); <i>id</i>., at 475, n. 12 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part, joined in relevant part by Breyer, J.); <i>id</i>., at 485 n. 2 (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part, joined by Ginsburg, J.); see also <i>Vieth</i> v. <i>Jubelirer</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 267,\n284 (2004)\n (plurality opinion) (listing examples of traditional redistricting criteria, including \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance with requirements of the [Voting Rights Act]\xe2\x80\x9d). It was proper for the Commission to proceed on that basis here. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have further made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cminor deviations from mathematical equality\xe2\x80\x9d do not, by themselves, \xe2\x80\x9cmake out a prima facie case of invidious discrimination under the\n \nFourteenth Amendment so as to require justification by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gaffney</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 745.  We have defined as \xe2\x80\x9cminor deviations\xe2\x80\x9d those in \xe2\x80\x9can apportionment plan with a maximum population deviation under 10%.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Brown</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 842.  And we have refused to require States to justify deviations of 9.9%, <i>White</i> v. <i>Regester</i>,\n\n412 U.\xc2\xa0S. 755,\n764 (1973)\n, and 8%, <i>Gaffney</i>, 412 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 751.  See<i> </i>also <i>Fund for Accurate and Informed Representation, Inc. </i>v.<i> Weprin</i>,\n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1017 (1992)\n (summarily affirming a District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that there was no prima facie case where the maximum population deviation was 9.43%).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, in a case like this one, those attacking a state-approved plan must show that it is more probable than not that a deviation of less than 10% reflects the predominance of illegitimate reapportionment factors rather than the \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate considerations\xe2\x80\x9d to which we have referred in <i>Reynolds</i> and later cases.  Given the inherent difficulty of measuring and comparing factors that may legitimately account for small deviations from strict mathematical equality, we believe that attacks on deviations under 10% will succeed only rarely, in unusual cases.  And we are not surprised that the appellants have failed to meet their burden here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 basic claim is that deviations in their apportionment plan from absolute equality of population reflect the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s political efforts to help the Democratic Party.  We believe that appellants failed to prove this claim because, as the district court concluded, the deviations predominantly reflected Commission efforts to achieve compliance with the federal Voting Rights Act, not to secure political advantage for one party.  Appellants failed to show to the contrary.  And the record bears out this conclusion.  Cf<i>.</i> <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Bessemer City</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 564,\n573 (1985)\n (explaining that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s factual finding as to whether discrimination occurred will not be set aside by an appellate court unless clearly erroneous).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Voting Rights Act, among other things, forbids the use of new reapportionment plans that \xe2\x80\x9cwould lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reno</i> v. <i>Bossier Parish School Bd.</i>, 520. U.\xc2\xa0S. 471, 478 (1997).  A plan leads to impermissible retrogression when, compared to the plan currently in effect (typically called a \xe2\x80\x9cbenchmark plan\xe2\x80\x9d), the new plan diminishes the number of districts in which minority groups can \xe2\x80\x9celect their preferred candidates of choice\xe2\x80\x9d (often called \xe2\x80\x9cability-to-elect\xe2\x80\x9d districts).  See\n\n52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710304(b).  A State can obtain legal assurance that it has satisfied the non-retrogression requirement if it submits its proposed plan to the Federal Department of Justice, and the Department does not object to the plan within 60 days.  See<i> </i>28 <i>C.\xc2\xa0F.\xc2\xa0R.</i> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa751.9, 51.52(b) (2015). While <i>Shelby County </i>struck down the \xc2\xa74(b) coverage formula, that decision came after the maps in this case were drawn. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The record in this case shows that the gridlike map that emerged after the first step of the redistricting process had a maximum population deviation from absolute equality of districts of 4.07%.  After consulting with their Voting Rights Act expert, their mapping consultant, and their statisticians, all five Commissioners agreed that they must try to obtain Justice Department Voting Rights Act \xe2\x80\x9cpreclearance\xe2\x80\x9d and that the former benchmark plan contained 10 ability-to-elect districts.  They consequently set a goal of 10 such districts for the new plan.  They then went through an iterative process, involving further consultation, to adjust the plan\xe2\x80\x99s initial boundaries in order to enhance minority voting strength.  In October 2011 (by a vote of 4 to 1), they tentatively approved a draft plan with adjusted boundaries.  They believed it met their goal of 10 ability-to-elect districts.  And they published the plan for public comment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the meantime, however, the Commission received a report from one of its statisticians suggesting that the Department of Justice might not agree that the new proposed plan contained 10 ability-to-elect districts.  It was difficult to know for certain because the Justice Department did not tell States how many ability-to-elect districts it believed were present in a benchmark plan, and neither  did it typically explain precisely and specifically how it would calculate the number that exist in a newly submitted plan.  See<i> </i>76 Fed. Reg. 7470\xe2\x80\x937471 (2011).  At the same time, the ability-to-elect analysis was complex, involving more than simply adding up census figures.  The Department of Justice instead conducted a \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional analysis of the electoral behavior within the particular .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. election district,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id., </i>at 7471<i>,</i> and so might, for example, count as ability-to-elect districts \xe2\x80\x9ccrossover\xe2\x80\x9d districts in which white voters combine their votes with minorities, see<i> Bartlett</i> v. <i>Strickland</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9314 (2009).  Its calculations might take into account group voting patterns, electoral participation, election history, and voter turnout.  See 76 Fed. Reg., 7471.  The upshot was not randomdecision-making but the process did create an inevitable degree of uncertainty.  And that uncertainty could lead a redistricting commission, as it led Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s, to make serious efforts to make certain that the districts it believed were ability-to-elect districts did in fact meet the criteria that the Department might reasonably apply.  Cf<i>. Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 22) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe law cannot insist that a state legislature, when redistricting, determine <i>precisely</i> what percent minority population \xc2\xa75 demands [because] the standards of \xc2\xa75 are complex .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  [To do so would] lay a trap for an unwary legislature, condemning its redistricting plan as either .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unconstitutional racial gerrymandering [or] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. retrogressive under \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a result of the statistician\xe2\x80\x99s report, the Commission became concerned about certain of its proposed boundaries. One of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s counsel advised that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cprudent to stay the course in terms of the ten districts that are in the draft map and look to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. strengthen them if there is a way to strengthen them.\xe2\x80\x9d 993 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1058 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Subsequently, the Commission adopted several changes to the boundaries of Districts 24 and 26.  It reduced the populations of those districts, thereby increasing the percentage of Hispanic voters in each.  The Commission approved these changes unanimously.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Changes in the boundaries of District 8, however, proved more controversial.  District 8 leaned Republican.  A Democrat-appointed Commissioner asked the mapping specialist to look into modifications that might make District 8 politically more competitive.  The specialist returned with a draft that shifted the boundary line between District 8 and District 11 so as to keep several communities with high minority populations together in District 8.  The two Republican-appointed Commissioners objected that doing so would favor Democrats by \xe2\x80\x9chyperpacking\xe2\x80\x9d Republicans into other districts; they added that the Commission should either favor political competitiveness throughout the State or not at all.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1059 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Democrat-appointed proponent of the change replied that District 8 had historically provided minority groups a good opportunity to elect their candidate of choice\xe2\x80\x94an opportunity that the changes would preserve.  The Voting Rights Act specialist then said that by slightly increasing District 8\xe2\x80\x99s minority population, the Commission might be able to claim an 11th ability-to-elect district; and that fact would \xe2\x80\x9cunquestionably enhance the submission and enhance chances for preclearance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s counsel then added that having another possible ability-to-elect district could be helpful because District 26 was not as strong an ability-to-elect district as the others.  See<i> ibid</i>. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Only then, after the counsel and consultants argued for District 8 changes for the sake of Voting Rights Act preclearance, did Chairwoman Mathis support those changes.  On that basis, the Commission ultimately approved the changes to District 8 by a vote of 3 to 2 (with the two Republican-appointed commissioners dissenting).  The total population deviation among districts in this final map was 8.8%.  While the Commission ultimately concluded that District 8 was not a true ability-to-elect district, the State\xe2\x80\x99s submission to the Department of Justice cited the changes to District 8 in support of the argument for preclearance.  On April 26, 2012, the Department of Justice precleared the submitted plan.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the basis of the facts that we have summarized, the District Court majority found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe population deviations were primarily a result of good-faith efforts to comply with the Voting Rights Act .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. even though partisanship played some role.\xe2\x80\x9d  993 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1046.  This conclusion was well supported in the record.  And as a result, appellants have not shown that it is more probable than not that illegitimate considerations were the predominant motivation behind the plan\xe2\x80\x99s deviations from mathematically equal district populations\xe2\x80\x94deviations that were under 10%.  Consequently, they have failed to show that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s plan violates the Equal Protection Clause as interpreted in <i>Reynolds</i> and subsequent cases.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The appellants make three additional arguments.  First, they support their claim that the plan reflects unreason-able use of partisan considerations by pointing to the fact that almost all the Democratic-leaning districts are somewhat underpopulated and almost all the Republican-leaning districts are somewhat overpopulated.  That is likely true.  See 993 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1049 (providing a chart with percentage deviation figures by district).  But that fact may well reflect the tendency of minority populations in Arizona in 2010 to vote disproportionately for Democrats.  If so, the variations are explained by the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to maintain at least 10 ability-to-elect districts.  The Commission may have relied on data from its statisticians and Voting Rights Act expert to create districts tailored to achieve preclearance in which minority voters were a larger percentage of the district population.  That might have necessitated moving other voters out of those districts, thereby leaving them slightly underpopulated.  The appellants point to nothing in the record to suggest the contrary. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the appellants point to <i>Cox</i> v. <i>Larios</i>,\n\n542 U. S. 947 (2004)\n, in which we summarily affirmed a district court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s reapportionment of representatives to state legislative districts violated the Equal Protection Clause, even though the total population deviation was less than 10%.  In Cox, however, unlike the present case, the district court found that those attacking the plan had shown that it was more probable than not that the use of illegitimate factors significantly explained deviations from numerical equality among districts.  The district court produced many examples showing that population deviation as well as the shape of many districts \xe2\x80\x9cdid not result from any attempt to create districts that were compact or contiguous, or to keep counties whole, or to preserve the cores of prior districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 949.  No legitimate purposes could explain them.  It is appellants\xe2\x80\x99 inability to show that the present plan\xe2\x80\x99s deviations and boundary shapes result from the predominance of simi-larly illegitimate factors that makes Cox inapposite here. Even assuming, without deciding, that partisanship is an illegitimate redistricting factor, appellants have not carried their burden.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, appellants point to <i>Shelby County</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), in which this Court held unconstitutional sections of the Voting Rights Act that are relevant to this case.  Appellants contend that, as a result of that holding, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to comply with the Act could not have been a legitimate state interest.  The Court decided <i>Shelby County</i>, however, in 2013.  Arizona created the plan at issue here in 2010.  At the time, Arizona was subject tothe Voting Rights Act, and we have never suggested the contrary.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
