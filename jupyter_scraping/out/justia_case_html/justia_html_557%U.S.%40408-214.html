Townsend filed suit under the Jones Act and general maritime law, alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> arbitrary and willful failure to provide maintenance and cure.  He filed similar counterclaims in the declaratory judgment action, seeking punitive damages for the maintenance and cure claim.  The District Court denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim, but certified the question for interlocutory appeal.  Following its precedent, the Eleventh Circuit held that punitive damages may be awarded for the willful withholding of maintenance and cure.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because punitive damages have long been an accepted remedy under general maritime law, and because neither <em>Miles</em> v. <em>Apex Marine Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/19/index.html">498 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0Punitive damages have long been an available remedy at common law for wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct.  English law during the colonial era accorded juries the authority to award such damages when warranted.  And American courts have likewise permitted such damages since at least 1784.  This Court has also found punitive damages authorized as a matter of common-law doctrine.  See, <em>e.g., Day </em>v. <em>Woodworth</em>, 13 How. 363.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0The common-law punitive damages tradition extends to claims arising under federal maritime law.  See <em>Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern R. Co.</em> v. <em>Prentice</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/147/101/index.html">147 U. S. 101</a>, 108.  One of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s first cases so indicating involved an action for marine trespass.  See <em>The Amiable Nancy</em>, 3 Wheat. 546.  And lower federal courts have found punitive damages available in maritime actions for particularly egregious tortious acts.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii)\xc2\xa0Nothing in maritime law undermines this general rule\xe2\x80\x99s applicability in the maintenance and cure context.  The maintenance and cure obligation dates back centuries as an aspect of general maritime law, and the failure of a seaman\xe2\x80\x99s employers to provide adequate medical care was the basis for awarding punitive damages in cases decided in the 1800\xe2\x80\x99s.  This Court has since registered its agreement with such decisions and has subsequently found that in addition to wages, \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance\xe2\x80\x9d includes food and lodging at the ship\xe2\x80\x99s expense, and \xe2\x80\x9ccure\xe2\x80\x9d refers to medical treatment, <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/438/index.html">531 U. S. 438</a>, 441.  Moreover, an owner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide proper medical care for seamen has provided lower courts the impetus to award damages that appear to contain at least some punitive element.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iv)\xc2\xa0Under these settled legal principles, respondent is entitled to pursue punitive damages unless Congress has enacted legislation that departs from the common-law understanding.  P.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The plain language of the Jones Act does not provide a basis for overturning the common-law rule.  Congress enacted the Jones Act to overrule <em>The</em> <em>Osceola</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/189/158/index.html">189 U. S. 158</a>, where the Court prohibited a seaman or his family from recovering for injuries or death suffered due to his employers\xe2\x80\x99 negligence.  To that end, the Act created a statutory negligence cause of action, but it did not eliminate pre-existing remedies available to seamen for the separate common-law cause of action based on maintenance and cure.  The Act bestows the right to \xe2\x80\x9celect\xe2\x80\x9d to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby indicating a choice of actions for seamen\xe2\x80\x94not an exclusive remedy.  Because the then-accepted remedies arose from general maritime law, it necessarily follows that Congress envisioned their continued availability.  See <em>Chandris, Inc.</em> v. <em>Latsis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/347/index.html">515 U. S. 347</a>, 354.  Had the Jones Act been the only remaining remedy available, there would have been no election to make.  And, the only statutory restrictions on general maritime maintenance and cure claims were enacted long after the Jones Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage and limit availability for only two discrete classes:\xc2\xa0foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facilities and sailing school students and instructors.  This indicates that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress knows how to\xe2\x80\x9d restrict the traditional maintenance and cure remedy \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it wants to.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Omni Capital Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Rudolf Wolff &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/97/index.html">484 U. S. 97</a>, 106.  This Court has consistently observed that the Jones Act preserves common-law causes of action such as maintenance and cure, see. <em>e.g.,</em> <em>The Arizona</em> v. <em>Anelich</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/298/110/index.html">298 U. S. 110</a>, and its case law supports the view that punitive damages awards, in particular, continue to remain available in maintenance and cure actions, see <em>Vaughan</em> v. <em>Atkinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/527/index.html">369 U. S. 527</a>.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0Contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument, <em>Miles </em>does not limit recovery to the remedies available under the Jones Act.  <em>Miles </em>does not address either maintenance and cure actions in general or the availability of punitive damages for such actions.  Instead, it grappled with the entirely different question whether general maritime law should provide a cause of action for wrongful death based on unseaworthiness.  The Court found that the Jones Act and the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), along with state statutes, supported recognition of a general maritime rule for wrongful death of a seaman.  However, since Congress had chosen to limit the damages available in the Jones Act and DOHSA, excluding damages for loss of society or lost future earnings, 498 U. S., at 21, 31\xe2\x80\x9332, its judgment must control the availability of remedies for wrongful-death actions brought under general maritime law, <em>id.</em>, at 32\xe2\x80\x9336.  <em>Miles\xe2\x80\x99 </em>reasoning does not apply here.  Unlike Miles\xe2\x80\x99 situation<em>,</em> both the general maritime cause of action here (maintenance and cure) and the remedy (punitive damages) were well established before the Jones Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  And unlike <em>Miles\xe2\x80\x99 </em>facts, the Jones Act does not address the general maritime cause of action here or its remedy.  It is thus possible to adhere to the traditional understanding of maritime actions and remedies without abridging or violating the Jones Act; unlike wrongful-death actions, this traditional understanding is not a matter to which \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has spoken directly.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id., </em>at 31.  Moreover, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contrary view was directly rejected in <em>Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp.</em> v. <em>Garris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/811/index.html">532 U. S. 811</a>, 820.  If <em>Miles </em>presented no barrier to the <em>Garris </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of a previously unrecognized maritime cause of action for negligent wrongful death, there is no legitimate basis for a contrary conclusion here.  Like negligence, the duty of maintenance and cure and the general availability of punitive damages have been recognized \xe2\x80\x9cfor more than a century,\xe2\x80\x9d 532 U. S., at 820.  And because respondent does not ask this Court to alter statutory text or \xe2\x80\x9cexpand\xe2\x80\x9d the maritime tort law\xe2\x80\x99s general principles, <em>Miles </em>does not require eliminating the general maritime remedy of punitive damages for the willful or wanton failure to comply with the duty to pay maintenance and cure.  The fact that seamen commonly seek to recover under the Jones Act for maintenance and cure claims, does not mean that the Jones Act provides the only remedy.  See <em>Cortes</em> v. <em>Baltimore Insular Line, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/367/index.html">287 U. S. 367</a>, 374\xe2\x80\x93375.  The laudable quest for uniformity in admiralty does not require narrowing available damages to the lowest common denominator approved by Congress for distinct causes of action.

Petitioners argue that under <em>Miles</em> v. <em>Apex Marine Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/19/index.html"></a><a href="/us/498/19/index.html">498 U. S. 19</a> (1990), seamen may recover only those damages available under the Jones Act, 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa730104.  We disagree.  Historically, punitive damages have been available and awarded in general maritime actions,\nincluding some in maintenance and cure.  We find\nthat nothing in <em>Miles </em>or the Jones Act eliminates that availability.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Edgar L. Townsend was a crew member of the Motor Tug Thomas.  After falling on the steel deck of the tugboat and injuring his arm and shoulder, respondent claimed that petitioner Atlantic Sounding,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] the owner of the tugboat, advised him that it would not provide maintenance and cure.  See 496 F.\xc2\xa03d 1282, 1283 (CA11 2007).  \xe2\x80\x9cA claim for maintenance and cure concerns the vessel owner\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to provide food, lodging, and medical services to a seaman injured while serving the ship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/438/index.html">531 U. S. 438</a>, 441 (2001).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners thereafter filed an action for declaratory relief regarding their obligations with respect to maintenance and cure.  Respondent filed his own suit under the Jones Act and general maritime law, alleging negligence, unseaworthiness, arbitrary and willful failure to pay maintenance and cure, and wrongful termination.  In addition, respondent filed similar counterclaims in the declaratory judgment action, seeking punitive damages for the denial of maintenance and cure.  The District Court consolidated the cases.  See 496 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1283\xe2\x80\x931284.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners moved to dismiss respondent\xe2\x80\x99s punitive damages claim.  The District Court denied the motion, holding that it was bound by the determination in <em>Hines</em> v. <em>J.\xc2\xa0A. LaPorte, Inc.</em>, 820 F.\xc2\xa02d 1187, 1189 (CA11 1987) <em>(per curiam)</em>, that punitive damages were available in an action for maintenance and cure.  The court, however, agreed to certify the question for interlocutory appeal.  See 496 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1284.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that <em>Hines </em>controlled<em> </em>and held that respondent could pursue his punitive damages claim for the willful withholding of maintenance and cure.  496 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1285\xe2\x80\x931286.  The decision conflicted with those of other Courts of Appeals, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Guevara</em> v. <em>Maritime Overseas Corp.</em>, 59 F.\xc2\xa03d 1496 (CA5 1995) (en banc); <em>Glynn</em> v. <em>Roy Al Boat Management</em> <em>Corp.</em>, 57 F.\xc2\xa03d 1495 (CA9 1995), and we granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent claims that he is entitled to seek punitive damages as a result of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged breach of their \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance and cure\xe2\x80\x9d duty under general maritime law.  We find no legal obstacle to his doing so.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Punitive damages have long been an available remedy at common law for wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct.  Under English law during the colonial era, juries were accorded broad discretion to award damages as they saw fit.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lord Townsend </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>2 Mod. 150, 86 Eng. Rep. 994 (C.\xc2\xa0P. 1676) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n <em>civil actions</em> the plaintiff is to recover by way of compensation for the damages he hath sustained, and the jury are the proper judges thereof\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages \xc2\xa7349, p.\xc2\xa0688 (9th ed. 1912) (hereinafter Sedgwick) (\xe2\x80\x9cUntil comparatively recent times juries were as arbitrary judges of the amount of damages as of the facts\xe2\x80\x9d).  The common-law view \xe2\x80\x9cwas that \xe2\x80\x98in cases where the amount of damages was uncertain[,] their assessment was a matter so peculiarly within the province of the jury that the Court should not alter it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Feltner</em> v. <em>Columbia Pictures Television, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/340/index.html">523 U.

Just before the ratification of the Constitution, Lord Chief Justice Pratt explained that \xe2\x80\x9ca jury ha[s] it in [its] power to give damages for more than the injury received.  Damages are designed not only as a satisfaction to the injured person, but likewise as a punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding for the future, and as a proof of the detestation of the jury to the action itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Wood</em>, Lofft 1, 18\xe2\x80\x9319, 98 Eng. Rep. 489, 498\xe2\x80\x93499 (C.\xc2\xa0P. 1763); see also <em>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Haslip</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/1/index.html">499 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Genay </em>v. <em>Norris</em>, 1 S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0L. 6, 7 (C.\xc2\xa0P. and Gen.

Although some States elected not to allow juries to make such awards, the vast majority permitted them.  See 1 Sedgwick \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7352, 354, at 694, 700.  By the middle of the 19th century, \xe2\x80\x9cpunitive damages were undoubtedly an established part of the American common law of torts [and] no particular procedures were deemed necessary to circumscribe a jury\xe2\x80\x99s discretion regarding the award of such damages, or their amount.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Haslip</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 26\xe2\x80\x9327 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has also found the award of punitive damages to be authorized as a matter of common-law doctrine.  In <em>Day </em>v. <em>Woodworth</em>, 13 How. 363 (1852), for example, the Court recognized the \xe2\x80\x9cwell-established principle of the common law, that in actions of trespass and all actions on the case for torts, a jury may inflict what are called exemplary, punitive, or vindictive damages upon a defendant \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 371; see also <em>Philadelphia, W., &amp; B.\xc2\xa0R. Co. </em>v. <em>Quigley</em>, 21 How. 202, 214 (1859) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever the injury complained of has been inflicted maliciously or wantonly, and with circumstances of contumely or indignity, the jury are not limited to the ascertainment of a simple compensation for the wrong committed against the aggrieved person\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Barry</em> v. <em>Edmunds</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/550/index.html">116 U. S. 550</a>, 562 (1886) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ccording to the settled law of this court, [a plaintiff] might show himself, by proof of the circumstances, to be entitled to exemplary damages calculated to vindicate his right and protect it against future similar invasions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The general rule that punitive damages were available at common law extended to claims arising under federal maritime law.  See <em>Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern R. Co.</em> v. <em>Prentice</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/147/101/index.html">147 U. S. 101</a>, 108 (1893) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts of admiralty \xe2\x80\xa6 proceed, in cases of tort, upon the same principles as courts of common law, in allowing exemplary damages \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  One of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s first cases indicating that punitive damages were available involved an action for marine trespass.  See <em>The Amiable Nancy</em>, 3 Wheat. 546 (1818).  In the course of deciding whether to uphold the jury\xe2\x80\x99s award, Justice Story, writing for the Court, recognized that punitive damages are an available maritime remedy under the proper circumstances.  Although the Court found that the particular facts of the case did not warrant such an award against the named defendants, it explained that \xe2\x80\x9cif this were a suit against the original wrong-doers, it might be proper to \xe2\x80\xa6 visit upon them in the shape of exemplary damages, the proper punishment which belongs to such lawless misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 558; see also <em>Barry</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 563 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn <em>The Amiable Nancy</em>, which was the case of a marine tort, Mr. Justice Story spoke of exemplary damages as \xe2\x80\x98the proper punish-\nment which belongs to \xe2\x80\xa6 lawless misconduct\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lower federal courts followed suit, finding that punitive damages were available in maritime actions for tortious acts of a particularly egregious nature.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McGuire</em> v. <em>The Golden Gate</em>, 16 F. Cas. 141, 143 (No. 8,815) (CC ND Cal. 1856) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn an action against the perpetrator of the wrong, the aggrieved party would be entitled to recover not only actual damages but exemplary,\xe2\x80\x94such as would vindicate his wrongs, and teach the tort feasor the necessity of reform\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Ralston </em>v. <em>The State Rights</em>, 20 F.

In short, prior to enactment of the Jones Act in 1920, \xe2\x80\x9cmaritime jurisprudence was replete with judicial statements approving punitive damages, especially on behalf of passengers and seamen.\xe2\x80\x9d  Robertson, Punitive<em> </em>Damages in<em> </em>American Maritime Law, 28 J.

L. &amp; Comm. 73, 115 (1997) (hereinafter Robertson); see also 2 Sedgwick \xc2\xa7599b, at 1156 (\xe2\x80\x9cExemplary damages are awarded in Admiralty, as in other jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages \xc2\xa7392, p.\xc2\xa01272 (4th ed. 1916) (\xe2\x80\x9cAs a rule a court of equity will not award [punitive] damages, but courts of admiralty will \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in maritime law undermines the applicability of this general rule in the maintenance and cure context.  See G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, Law of Admiralty \xc2\xa76\xe2\x80\x9313, p.\xc2\xa0312 (2d ed. 1975) (hereinafter Gilmore &amp; Black) (explaining that a seaman denied maintenance and cure \xe2\x80\x9chas a free option to claim damages (including punitive damages) under a general maritime law count\xe2\x80\x9d); Robertson 163 (concluding that breach of maintenance and cure is one of the particular torts for which general maritime law would most likely permit the awarding of punitive damages \xe2\x80\x9cassuming \xe2\x80\xa6 the requisite level of blameworthiness\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the legal obligation to provide maintenance and cure dates back centuries as an aspect of general maritime law, and the failure of a seaman\xe2\x80\x99s employers to provide him with adequate medical care was the basis for awarding punitive damages in cases decided as early as the 1800\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The right to receive maintenance and cure was first recognized in this country in two lower court decisions authored by Justice Story.  See <em>Harden </em>v. <em>Gordon</em>, 11 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 480 (No. 6,047) (CC Me. 1823); <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Canfield</em>, 20 F. Cas. 426 (No. 11,641) (CC Mass. 1832).  According to Justice Story, this common-law obligation to seamen was justified on humanitarian and economic grounds: \xe2\x80\x9cIf some provision be not made for [seamen] in sickness at the expense of the ship, they must often in foreign ports suffer the accumulated evils of disease, and poverty, and sometimes perish from the want of suitable nourishment\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [T]he merchant himself derives an ultimate benefit [because i]t encourages seamen to engage in perilous voyages with more promptitude, and at lower wages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harden</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 483; see also <em>Reed</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 429 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe seaman is to be cured at the expense of the ship, of the sickness or injury sustained in the ship\xe2\x80\x99s service\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has since registered its agreement with these decisions.  \xe2\x80\x9cUpon a full review \xe2\x80\xa6 of English and American authorities,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe vessel and her owners are liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is wounded, in the service of the ship, to the extent of his maintenance and cure, and to his wages, at least so long as the voyage is continued.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>The Osceola</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/189/158/index.html">189 U. S. 158</a>, 175 (1903).  Decisions following <em>The Osceola </em>have explained that in addition to wages, \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance\xe2\x80\x9d includes food and lodging at the expense of their ship, and \xe2\x80\x9ccure\xe2\x80\x9d refers to medical treatment.  <em>Lewis</em>, 531 U. S., at 441; see also Gilmore &amp; Black \xc2\xa76\xe2\x80\x9312, at 267\xe2\x80\x93268 (describing \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance and cure\xe2\x80\x9d as including medical expenses, a living allowance, and unearned wages).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, the failure of a vessel owner to provide proper medical care for seamen has provided the impetus for damages awards that appear to contain at least some punitive element.  For example, in <em>The City of Carlisle</em>, 39 F. 807 (DC Ore. 1889), the court added $1,000 to its damages award to compensate an apprentice seaman for \xe2\x80\x9cgross neglect and cruel maltreatment of the [seaman] since his injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 809, 817.  The court reviewed the indignities to which the apprentice had been subjected as he recovered without any serious medical attention, see <em>id.</em>, at 810\xe2\x80\x93812, and explained that \xe2\x80\x9cif owners do not wish to be mulct in damages for such misconduct, they should be careful to select men worthy to command their vessels and fit to be trusted with the safety and welfare of their crews, and particularly apprentice boys.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 817; see also <em>The Troop</em>, 118 F. 769, 770\xe2\x80\x93771, 773 (DC Wash. 1902) (explaining that $4,000 was a reasonable award because the captain\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to observe the dictates of humanity\xe2\x80\x9d and obtain prompt medical care for an injured seaman constituted a \xe2\x80\x9cmonstrous wrong\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The settled legal principles discussed above establish three points central to resolving this case.  First, punitive damages have long been available at common law.  Second, the common-law tradition of punitive damages extends to maritime claims.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And third, there is no evidence that claims for maintenance and cure were excluded from this general admiralty rule.  Instead, the pre-Jones Act evidence indicates that punitive damages remain available for such claims under the appropriate factual circumstances.  As a result, respondent is entitled to pursue punitive damages unless Congress has enacted legislation departing from this common-law understanding.  As explained below, it has not.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only statute that could serve as a basis for overturning the common-law rule in this case is the Jones Act.  Congress enacted the Jones Act primarily to overrule <em>The</em> <em>Osceola</em>, <em>supra</em>, in which<em> </em>this Court prohibited a seaman or his family from recovering for injuries or death suffered due to his employers\xe2\x80\x99 negligence.  To this end, the statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA seaman injured in the course of employment or, if the seaman dies from the injury, the personal representative of the seaman may<em> </em>elect<em> </em>to<em> </em>bring a civil action at law, with the right of trial by jury, against the employer.  Laws of the United States regulating recovery for personal injury to, or death of, a railway employee apply to an action under this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa730104(a) (incorporating the Federal Employers\xe2\x80\x99 Liability Act, 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa751\xe2\x80\x9360).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Jones Act thus created a statutory cause of action for negligence, but it did not eliminate pre-existing remedies available to seamen for the separate common-law cause of action based on a seaman\xe2\x80\x99s right to maintenance and cure.  Section 30104 bestows upon the injured seaman the right to \xe2\x80\x9celect\xe2\x80\x9d to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby indicating a choice of actions for seamen\xe2\x80\x94not an exclusive remedy.  See Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 798 (1913) (defining \xe2\x80\x9celect\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o make choice of\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> </em>1 Bouvier\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary<em> </em>979 (8th ed. 1914) (defining \xe2\x80\x9celection\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[c]hoice; selection\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the then-accepted remedies for injured seamen arose from general maritime law, see <em>The Osceola</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 175, it necessarily follows that Congress was envisioning the continued availability of those common-law causes of action.  See <em>Chandris, Inc.</em> v. <em>Latsis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/347/index.html">515 U. S. 347</a>, 354 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to remove the bar to suit for negligence articulated in <em>The Osceola</em>, thereby completing the trilogy of heightened legal protections [including maintenance and cure] that seamen receive because of their exposure to the perils of the sea\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Stewart</em> v. <em>Dutra Constr. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/481/index.html">543 U. S. 481</a>, 487 (2005) (describing the Jones Act as \xe2\x80\x9cremov[ing] this bar to negligence suits by seamen\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the Jones Act had been the only remaining remedy available to injured seamen, there would have been no election to make.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, the only statutory restrictions expressly addressing general maritime claims for maintenance and cure were enacted long after the passage of the Jones Act.  They limit its availability for two discrete classes of people: foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facilities, see \xc2\xa7503(a)(2), 96 Stat. 1955, codified at 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa730105(b), and sailing school students and instructors, \xc2\xa7204, 96 Stat. 1589, codified at 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa750504(b).  These provisions indicate that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress knows how to\xe2\x80\x9d restrict the traditional remedy of maintenance and cure \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it wants to.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Omni Capital Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Rudolf Wolff &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/97/index.html">484 U. S. 97</a>, 106 (1987).  Thus, nothing in the statutory scheme for maritime recovery restricts the availability of punitive damages for maintenance and cure for those, like respondent, who are not precluded from asserting the general maritime claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further supporting this interpretation of the Jones Act, this Court has consistently recognized that the Act \xe2\x80\x9cwas remedial, for the benefit and protection of seamen who are peculiarly the wards of admiralty.  Its purpose was to enlarge that protection, not to narrow it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>The Arizona</em> v. <em>Anelich</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/298/110/index.html">298 U.

In <em>Vaughan</em> v. <em>Atkinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/527/index.html">369 U. S. 527</a> (1962), for example, the Court permitted the recovery of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for the \xe2\x80\x9ccallous\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwillful and persistent\xe2\x80\x9d refusal to pay maintenance and cure.  <em>Id.</em>, at 529\xe2\x80\x93531.  In fact, even the <em>Vaughan </em>dissenters, who believed that such fees were generally unavailable, agreed that a seaman \xe2\x80\x9cwould be entitled to exemplary damages in accord with traditional concepts of the law of damages\xe2\x80\x9d where a \xe2\x80\x9cshipowner\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay maintenance stemmed from a wanton and intentional disregard of the legal rights of the seaman.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 540 (opinion of Stewart, J.); see<em> </em>also<em> Fiske</em>, 3 F.\xc2\xa0Cas., at 957 (Story, J.) (arguing that counsel fees are awardable in \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ourts of admiralty \xe2\x80\xa6 not technically as costs, but upon the same principles, as they are often allowed damages in cases of torts, by courts of common law, as a recompense for injuries sustained, as exemplary damages, or as a remuneration for expences incurred, or losses sustained, by the misconduct of the other party\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the text of the Jones Act or this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions issued in the wake of its enactment undermines the continued existence of the common-law cause of action providing recovery for the delayed or improper provision of maintenance and cure.  Petitioners do not deny the availability of punitive damages in general maritime law, or identify any cases establishing that such damages were historically unavailable for breach of the duty of maintenance and cure.  The plain language of the Jones Act, then, does not provide the punitive damages bar that petitioners seek.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners nonetheless argue that the availability of punitive damages in this case is controlled by the Jones Act because of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Miles,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/19/index.html"></a><a href="/us/498/19/index.html">498 U. S. 19</a>; see also <em>post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (opinion of Alito, J.).  In <em>Miles</em>, petitioners argue, the Court limited recovery in maritime cases involving death or personal injury to the remedies available under the Jones Act and the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa730301\xe2\x80\x9330306.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading of <em>Miles </em>is far too broad.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Miles </em>does not address either maintenance and cure actions in general or the availability of punitive damages for such actions.  The decision instead grapples with the entirely different question whether general maritime law should provide a cause of action for wrongful death based on unseaworthiness.  By providing a remedy for wrongful death suffered on the high seas or in territorial waters, the Jones Act and DOHSA displaced a general maritime rule that denied any recovery for wrongful death.  See <em>Miles</em>, 498 U. S., at 23\xe2\x80\x9334.<em> </em>This Court, therefore, was called upon in <em>Miles </em>to decide whether these new statutes supported an expansion of the relief available under pre-existing general maritime law to harmonize it with a cause of action created by statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court in <em>Miles </em>first concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cunanimous legislative judgment behind the Jones Act, DOHSA, and the many state statutes\xe2\x80\x9d authorizing maritime wrongful-death actions, supported the recognition of a general maritime action for wrongful death of a seaman.  <em>Id.,</em> at 24<em> </em>(discussing <em>Moragne</em> v. <em>States Marine Lines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/index.html">398 U. S. 375</a> (1970), which overruled<em> The Harrisburg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/119/199/index.html">119 U. S. 199</a> (1886)).  Congress had chosen to limit, however, the damages available for wrongful-death actions under the Jones Act and DOHSA, such that damages were not statutorily available for loss of society or lost future earnings.  See <em>Miles, </em>498 U. S., at 21, 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  The Court thus concluded that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment must control the availability of remedies for wrongful-death actions brought under general maritime law, <em>id.</em>, at 32\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reasoning of <em>Miles </em>remains sound.  As the Court in that case explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress and the States have legislated extensively in these areas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 27.  Furthermore, it was only because of congressional action that a general federal cause of action for wrongful death on the high seas and in territorial waters even existed; until then, there was no general common-law doctrine providing for such an action.  As a result, to determine the remedies available under the common-law wrongful-death action, \xe2\x80\x9can admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  It would have been illegitimate to create common-law remedies that exceeded those remedies statutorily available under the Jones Act and DOHSA.  See <em>id.</em>, at 36 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not create, under our admiralty powers, a remedy \xe2\x80\xa6 that goes well beyond the limits of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ordered system of recovery for seamen\xe2\x80\x99s injury and death\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But application of that principle<em> </em>here does not lead to the outcome suggested by petitioners or the dissent.  See <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  Unlike the situation presented in <em>Miles</em>,<em> </em>both the general maritime cause of action (maintenance and cure) and the remedy (punitive damages) were well established before the passage of the Jones Act.  See <em>supra, </em>at<em> </em>3\xe2\x80\x938<em>.  </em>Also unlike the facts presented by <em>Miles</em>, the Jones Act does not address maintenance and cure or its remedy.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It is therefore possible to adhere to the traditional understanding of maritime actions and remedies without abridging or violating the Jones Act; unlike wrongful-death actions, this traditional understanding is not a matter to which \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has spoken directly.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Miles</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 31 (citing <em>Mobil Oil Corp.</em> v. <em>Higginbotham</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/618/index.html">436 U. S. 618</a>, 625 (1978)).  Indeed, the <em>Miles </em>Court itself acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Jones Act evinces no general hostility to recovery under maritime law,\xe2\x80\x9d 498 U. S., at 29, and noted that statutory remedy limitations \xe2\x80\x9cwould not necessarily deter us, if recovery \xe2\x80\xa6 were more consistent with the general principles of maritime tort law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 35.  The availability of punitive damages for maintenance and cure actions is entirely faithful to these \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral principles of maritime tort law,\xe2\x80\x9d and no statute casts doubt on their availability under general maritime law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contention that <em>Miles </em>precludes <em>any </em>action or remedy for personal injury beyond that made available under the Jones Act<em> </em>was directly rejected by this Court in <em>Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp.</em> v. <em>Garris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/811/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/811/index.html">532 U. S. 811</a>, 818 (2001).  That case involved the death of a harbor worker.  <em>Ibid. </em> There, the Court recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death attributable to negligence although neither the Jones Act (which applies only to seamen) nor DOHSA (which does not cover territorial waters) provided such a remedy.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 817\xe2\x80\x93818.  The Court acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cit will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 820.  But the Court concluded that the cause of action at issue there was \xe2\x80\x9cnew only in the most technical sense\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since <em>Moragne </em>that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court thus found that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99s occupation of this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already logically compelled by our precedents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because <em>Miles </em>presented no barrier to this endorsement of a previously unrecognized maritime cause of action for negligent wrongful death, we see no legitimate basis for a contrary conclusion in the present case.  Like negligence, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he general maritime law has recognized \xe2\x80\xa6 for more than a century\xe2\x80\x9d the duty of maintenance and cure and the general availability of punitive damages.  See <em>Garris, supra, </em>at 820; see also<em> supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x938.  And because respondent does not ask this Court to alter statutory text or \xe2\x80\x9cexpand\xe2\x80\x9d the general principles of maritime tort law, <em>Miles </em>does not require us to eliminate the general maritime remedy of punitive damages for the willful or wanton failure to comply with the duty to pay maintenance and cure.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miles</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 32, and the available history suggests that punitive damages were an established part of the maritime law in 1920, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x938.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It remains true, of course, that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]dmiralty is not created in a vacuum; legislation has always served as an important source of both common law and admiralty principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miles</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 24.  And it also is true that the negligent denial of maintenance and cure may also be the subject of a Jones Act claim.  See <em>Cortes</em> v. <em>Baltimore Insular Line, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/367/index.html"></a><a href="/us/287/367/index.html">287 U. S. 367</a> (1932).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  But the fact that seamen commonly seek to recover under the Jones Act for the wrongful withholding of maintenance and cure does not mean that the Jones Act provides the only remedy for maintenance and cure claims.  Indeed, contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view that the Jones Act replaced in their entirety the remedies available at common law for maintenance and cure, the <em>Cortes </em>decision explicitly acknowledged a seaman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose among overlapping statutory and common-law remedies for injuries sustained by the denial of maintenance and cure.  See 287 U.

S. 19</a> (1990), this Court provided a workable framework for analyzing the relief available on claims under general maritime law.  Today, the Court abruptly changes course.  I would apply the analytical framework adopted in <em>Miles</em>, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to understand our decision in <em>Miles</em>, it is necessary to appreciate the nature of the authority that the <em>Miles</em> Court was exercising.  The Constitution, by extending the judicial power of the United States to admiralty and maritime cases, impliedly empowered this Court to continue the development of maritime law \xe2\x80\x9cin the manner of a common law court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Exxon Shipping Co.</em> v. <em>Baker</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16); see also <em>Romero</em> v. <em>International Terminal Operating Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/354/index.html">358 U. S. 354</a>, 360\xe2\x80\x93361 (1959).  In <em>Miles</em>, this Court explained how that authority should be exercised in an era in which statutory law has become dominant.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Miles </em>presented two questions regarding the scope of relief permitted under general maritime law, the first of which was whether damages for loss of society may be recovered on a general maritime law wrongful-death claim.  In order to answer this question, the Court looked to the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa730301\n<em>et seq.,</em> and the Jones Act 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa730101 <em>et seq., </em>both of which created new statutory wrongful-death claims.  Because the relief available on these statutory claims does not include damages for loss of society, the Court concluded that it should not permit such damages on a wrongful-death claim brought under general maritime law.  The Court explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress and the States have legislated extensively in these areas<em>.  In this era, an admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  498 U. S., at 27 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court took a similar approach in answering the second question in <em>Miles</em>\xe2\x80\x94whether damages for loss of future income should be available in a general maritime law survival action.  The Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here are indeed strong policy arguments for allowing such recovery\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cadmiralty courts have always shown a special solicitude for the welfare of seamen and their families.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  But because the Jones Act survival provision \xe2\x80\x9climits recovery to losses suffered during the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held that a similar limitation should apply under general maritime law.  <em>Id., </em>at 36.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Miles</em> thus instructs that, in exercising our authority to develop general maritime law, we should be guided primarily by the policy choices reflected in statutes creating closely related claims.  Endorsing what has been termed a principle of uniformity, <em>Miles</em> teaches that if a form of relief is not available on a statutory claim, we should be reluctant to permit such relief on a similar claim brought under general maritime law.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The type of maintenance and cure claim that is most likely to include a request for punitive damages is a claim that a seaman suffered personal injury as a result of the willful refusal to provide maintenance and cure.  Such a claim may be brought under general maritime law.  See <em>Cortes </em>v.<em> Baltimore Insular Line</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/367/index.html">287 U. S. 367</a>, 374 (1932) (recognizing that a seaman may sue under general maritime law to recover for personal injury resulting from the denial of maintenance and cure).  And a similar claim may also be maintained under the Jones Act.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Guevara </em>v. <em>Maritime Overseas Corp., </em>59 F. 3d 1496, 1499\xe2\x80\x931500 (CA5 1995) (en banc); G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black,  Law of Admiralty \xc2\xa76\xe2\x80\x9313, p. 311 (2d ed. 1975).  To be sure, a seaman asserting a Jones Act claim must show that his employer was negligent, <em>ibid.</em>, while a seaman proceeding under general maritime law may recover compensatory damages without establishing fault, <em>id., </em>at 310.  But because the prevailing rule in American courts does not permit punitive damages without a showing of fault, see <em>Exxon Shipping</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 16, n.\xc2\xa02, it appears that any personal injury maintenance and cure claim in which punitive damages might be awarded could be brought equally under either general maritime law or the Jones Act.  The <em>Miles</em> uniformity therefore weighs strongly in favor of a rule that applies uniformly under general maritime law and the Jones Act.  I therefore turn to the question whether punitive damages may be awarded under the Jones Act.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Enacted in 1920, the Jones Act, 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa730104\xe2\x80\x9330105(b), makes applicable to seamen the substantive recovery provisions of the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa751 <em>et seq., </em>which became law in 1908.  FELA, in turn, \xe2\x80\x9crecites only that employers shall be liable in \xe2\x80\x98damages\xe2\x80\x99 for the injury or death of one protected under the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miles, supra, </em>at 32 (citing 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa751).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to the enactment of the Jones Act, however, this Court had decided several cases that explored the damages allowed under FELA.  In <em>Michigan Central R. Co.</em> v. <em>Vreeland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/227/59/index.html">227 U. S. 59</a> (1913), the Court dealt primarily with the damages that may be recovered under FELA\xe2\x80\x99s wrongful-death provision, but the Court also discussed the damages available in the case of injury.  The Court noted that if the worker in that case had not died from his injuries, \xe2\x80\x9che might have recovered such damages as would have compensated him for his expense, loss of time, suffering and diminished earning power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 65.  Two years later, in <em>St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. R. Co.</em> v. <em>Craft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/237/648/index.html">237 U. S. 648</a> (1915), the Court reiterated that an injured worker may recover only compensatory damages.  Addressing the damages available to a party bringing a survival claim, the Court explained that the party may recover only those damages that had accrued to the worker at the time of his death and was thus limited to \xe2\x80\x9csuch damages as will be reasonably compensatory for the loss and suffering of the injured person while he lived.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 658.  See also <em>ibid</em>. (damages \xe2\x80\x9cconfined to the [the worker\xe2\x80\x99s] personal loss and suffering before he died\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Miller </em>v.<em> American President Lines, Ltd</em>., 989 F.\xc2\xa02d 1450, 1457 (CA6), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/915/index.html">510 U. S. 915</a> (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been the unanimous judgment of the courts since before the enactment of the Jones Act that punitive damages are not recoverable under [FELA]).\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Congress incorporated FELA unaltered into the Jones Act, Congress must have intended to incorporate FELA\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on damages as well.  <em>Miles, </em>498 U. S., at 32.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (citing <em>Cannon</em> v. <em>University of Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/index.html">441 U. S. 677</a>, 696\xe2\x80\x93697 (1979)).  It is therefore reasonable to assume that only compensatory damages may be recovered under the Jones Act.  See <em>Pacific S. S. Co.</em> v. <em>Peterson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/278/130/index.html">278 U. S. 130</a>, 136\xe2\x80\x93.139 (1928) (under the Jones Act, a seaman may \xe2\x80\x9crecover compensatory damages for injuries caused by the negligence\xe2\x80\x9d).  And under <em>Mile</em>s\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning\xe2\x80\x94at least in the absence of some exceptionally strong countervailing considerations\xe2\x80\x94the rule should be the same when a seaman sues under general maritime law for personal injury resulting from the denial of maintenance and cure.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court reasons that: punitive damages were available on maintenance and cure claims prior to the enactment of the Jones Act and that the Jones Act was not intended to trim the relief available on such general maritime law claims.  This reasoning is flawed.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court proceeds as if the question here were whether the Jones Act was meant to preclude general maritime law claims and remedies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (Jones Act does not \xe2\x80\x9covertur[n]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9celiminate pre-existing remedies available to seamen\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 11 (Jones Act \xe2\x80\x9cpreserves common-law causes of action\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 15 (<em>Miles</em> does not \xe2\x80\x9cpreclud[e]\xe2\x80\x9d all claims and remedies beyond that made available under the Jones Act).  <em>Miles</em> explicitly rejected that argument.  See 498 U. S., at 29.  But just because the Jones Act was not meant to preclude general maritime claims or remedies, it does not follow that the Jones Act was meant to stop the development of general maritime law by the courts.  The Jones Act is significant because it created a statutory claim that is indistinguishable for present purposes from a general maritime law maintenance and cure claim based on personal injury and because this statutory claim does not permit the recovery of punitive damages.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress, in the exercise of its legislative powers, is free to say \xe2\x80\x98this much and no more,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9can admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miles</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 24, 27.  This policy embodied in the Jones Act thus constitutes a powerful argument in favor of the development of a similar rule under general maritime law.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That brings me to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the availability of punitive damages was established before the Jones Act was passed.  If punitive damages were a widely recognized and regularly employed feature of maintenance and cure claims during the pre-Jones Act era, I would not rule out the possibility that this history might be sufficient to outweigh the <em>Miles</em> uniformity principle.  But a search for cases in which punitive damages were awarded for the willful denial of maintenance of cure\xe2\x80\x94in an era when seamen were often treated with shocking callousness\xe2\x80\x94yields very little.  Although American courts have entertained maintenance and cure suits since the early 19th century, the Court points to only two reported cases\xe2\x80\x94<em>The City of Carlisle</em>, 39 F. 807 (DC Ore. 1889), and <em>The Troop</em>, 118 F. 769 (DC Wash. 1902)\xe2\x80\x94that, as the Court carefully puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cappear to contain at least some punitive element.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s choice of words is well advised, for it is not even clear that punitive damages were recovered in these two obscure cases.  In <em>The City of Carlisle, </em>a 16-year-old apprentice suffered a fractured skull.  The captain refused to put ashore.  Given little care, the apprentice spent the next six or seven weeks in his bunk, wracked with pain, and was then compelled to work 12 hours a day for the remaining three months of the voyage.  Upon landing, the captain made no arrangements for care and did not pay for the apprentice\xe2\x80\x99s brain surgery.  The apprentice received an award of $1,000; that may include some \xe2\x80\x9cpunitive element,\xe2\x80\x9d but it seems likely that much if not all of that sum represented compensation for the apprentice\xe2\x80\x99s months of agony and the lingering effects of his injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s second case, <em>The Troop</em>, <em>supra</em>, involved similarly brutal treatment.  The seaman fell from a mast and fractured an arm and a leg while his ship was six miles from its port of departure.  Refusing to return to port, the captain subjected the seaman to maltreatment for the remainder of the 36-day voyage.  As a result, he was required to undergo painful surgery, and his injuries permanently prevented him from returning to work as a mariner.  He received an undifferentiated award of $4,000, and while the court was sharply critical of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, it is far from clear that the award did not consist entirely of compensatory damages for medical expenses, lost future income, and pain and suffering.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the two cases cited by the Court, respondent and an <em>amicus</em> claim that punitive damages were awarded in a few additional cases.  See Brief for Respondent 13; Brief for <em>Amicus Curiae</em> American Assn. of Justice as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>10\xe2\x80\x9311.  Of these cases, <em>The Margharita,</em> 140 F. 820 (CA5 1905), is perhaps the most supportive.  There, the court explained that its award of $1,500 would not only \xe2\x80\x9ccompensate the seaman for his unnecessary and unmerited suffering\xe2\x80\x9d but would \xe2\x80\x9cemphasize the importance of humane and correct judgment under the circumstances on the part of the master.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 827.  While the court\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the message that the award embodied suggests that the award was in part punitive, it is also possible that the reference simply represented a restatement of one of the traditional rationales for maintenance and cure, <em>i.e.</em>, that it served the economic interests of shipowners and the general interests of the country by making service as a seaman more attractive.  See <em>Harden</em> v. <em>Gordon, </em>11 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 480, 485 (No. 6,047) (CC Me. 1823).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The remaining cases contain harsh criticism of the seamen\xe2\x80\x99s treatment but do not identify any portion of the award as punitive.  See <em>The Rolph</em>, 293 F.\xc2\xa0269 (ND Cal. 1923), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 299 F.\xc2\xa052 (CA9 1924) (undifferentiated award of $10,000 for a seaman rendered blind in both eyes); <em>Tomlinson</em> v<em>. Hewett</em>, 24 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 29, 32 (No. 14,087) (DC Cal. 1872).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the search for maintenance and cure cases in which punitive damages were awarded yields strikingly slim results.  The cases found are insufficient in number, clarity, and prominence to justify departure from the <em>Miles</em> uniformity principle.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is one remaining question in this case, namely, whether punitive damages are permitted when a seaman asserts a general maritime law maintenance and cure claim that is not based on personal injury.  In <em>Cortes, </em>287 U. S., at 371, the Court explained that the duty to furnish maintenance and cure \xe2\x80\x9cis one annexed to the employment. . . .  Contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a relation which is contractual in origin, but, given the relation, no agreement is competent to abrogate the incident.\xe2\x80\x9d  The duty is thus essentially quasicontractual, and therefore, in those instances in which the seaman does not suffer personal injury, recovery should be governed by the law of quasi-contract.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74b, 12f (1979); Restatement of Restitution \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113\xe2\x80\x93114 (1936); 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \xc2\xa74.2(3), pp 580 (2d ed. 1993).  Thus, an award of punitive damages is not appropriate.
