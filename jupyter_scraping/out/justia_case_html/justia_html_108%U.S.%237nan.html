The court denied the relief asked for, and ordered any surplus that might remain above the mortgage debt after sale or foreclosure, to be paid to the complainant.  The assignee appealed to the circuit court.  <em>Held</em> that the decree appealed from was a final decree, disposing of the litigation between the parties.</p>\n<p>This was an application for a writ of mandamus to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana, requiring that court to take jurisdiction of, and hear and determine an appeal by the petitioner, Emery E. Norton, from a decree of the district court of that district.</p>\n<p>The case as presented shows that Norton, being assignee in bankruptcy of Govy Hood, filed in the district court a bill in equity against Hood, the bankrupt, John Asberry, Sheriff of the Parish of East Carroll, and Henry Frellsen, setting forth that Hood, being insolvent, in April, 1866, confessed a judgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 108 U. S. 238</a></p><p> in favor of Frellsen for $39,319.49; that in July, 1868, execution was issued on this judgment and levied on three plantations belonging to Hood, known, respectively, as "Black Bayou," "Home Place," and "Hood and Wilson Place;" that on the 5th of September, 1868, there was a pretended sale of these plantations to Frellsen under an execution issued on his judgment, for the sum of $24,000; that on the 23d of November, 1868, another execution was issued on the judgment and levied on other property, which was also nominally sold under the execution to Frellsen; that in December, 1869, the Black Bayou Plantation was said to William Alling for $32,000, one-half of which was paid in cash, and for the other half Frellsen took from Alling a half interest in the land; that in January, 1869, Hood was adjudged a bankrupt on his own petition, and in January, 1871, received his discharge; that in May, 1871, Frellsen reconveyed to Hood all the property he had bought under the executions, except the Black Bayou Plantation, for $30,152, payable in seven installments, and evidenced by mortgage notes; that all these transactions, except the sale of the one-half of the Black Bayou Plantation to Alling, were a fraud upon the bankrupt law, and devised for the purpose of giving Frellsen an unlawful preference, and to keep the property from the other creditors; that from the beginning it was the understanding between Hood and Frellsen that Frellsen should buy the property under his judgment, hold it for Hood during the bankruptcy proceedings, and then reconvey it to Hood, subject only to any balance that might remain due upon the judgment, after deducting the rents and profits and the proceeds of any sales in the meantime received by Frellsen, and that all the facts were unknown to Norton, the assignee, until certain disclosures were made on the trial of a suit between Frellsen and Hood, in the Thirteenth District Court of the Parish of East Carroll, growing out of proceedings by Frellsen to foreclose his mortgage notes received on the reconveyance of the property.  It further appears that in the proceedings for foreclosure, Asberry, the sheriff, had been empowered to sell the property reconveyed to Hood to pay what remained due on the mortgage debt. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="239">Page 108 U.

Leave was granted the complainant to apply for further orders regulating the sale in respect to time, and appraisement and sale on credit, according to the laws of Louisiana.  The sheriff was directed to make a return of his sale to the district court of the United States, and the question of costs was reserved until the coming in of the return.</p>\n<p>From this decree an appeal was taken to the circuit court, where, on the 27th of May, 1882, the appeal was dismissed on the ground that the decree appealed from was not a final decree within the meaning of that term as used in the statute regulating appeals from the district to the circuit court.  The writ now asked for is to require the circuit court to set aside its order of dismissal and take jurisdiction. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 108 U.

CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We have had occasion at the present term, in <em>Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/3/case.html">106 U. S. 3</a></span>; <em>Grant v. Phoenix Mutual Life Ins.

The decree settled every question in dispute between the parties, and left nothing to be done but to complete the sale under the proceedings in the state court for foreclosure, and hand over to Norton any surplus of the proceeds there might be after satisfying the debt due Frellsen, as stated in the process under which the sale was made.  The case stands precisely as it would if Frellsen were proceeding in the district court for the foreclosure of his mortgage, and a decree had been entered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 108 U. S. 243</a></p><p> establishing his rights, ascertaining the amount due to him, and ordering a sale of the property and the payment to Norton of the surplus after discharging the mortgage debt.  Here, the bill was filed by Norton to set aside the proceedings for foreclosure and obtain a conveyance of the mortgaged property.  The court refused to set aside the proceedings or to order a conveyance, but did order the sale to go on, and that the proceeds, after the mortgage was satisfied, be paid to Norton.  It adjudged the case on the merits in favor of Frellsen as against Norton, and in favor of Norton as against Hood.  The bill was not dismissed in form because it asked relief both as against Frellsen and Hood, and relief was granted as against Hood.  It was in legal effect dismissed as to Frellsen when the decree was entered in his favor on all the questions in which he was interested.</p>\n<p><em>The writ of mandamus asked for is granted, but without costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
