S. 37</a></span>.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Florida, like many other States, rewards each convicted prisoner for good conduct and obedience to prison rules by using a statutory formula that reduces the portion of his sentence that he must serve.  In this case, we consider whether a Florida statute altering the availability of such "gain time for good conduct" [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] is unconstitutional as an <em>ex post facto</em> law when applied to petitioner, whose crime was committed before the statute\'s enactment.</p>\n<p>The relevant facts are undisputed.  Petitioner pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.  The crime charged occurred on January 31, 1976.  On May 13, 1976, petitioner was convicted and sentenced to a prison term of 15 years, less time </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 450 U. S. 26</a></p><p> already served.  The state statute in place on both the date of the offense and the date of sentencing provided a formula for deducting gain-time credits from the sentences</p>\n<p>"of every prisoner who has committed no infraction of the rules or regulations of the division, or of the laws of the state, and who has performed in a faithful, diligent, industrious, orderly and peaceful manner, the work, duties and tasks assigned to him."</p>\n<p>Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.27(1) (1975). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  According to the formula, gain-time credits were to be calculated by the month, and were to accumulate at an increasing rate the more time the prisoner had already served.  Thus, the statute directed that the authorities "shall grant the following deductions" from a prisoner\'s sentence as gain time for good conduct:</p>\n<p>"(a) Five days per month off the first and second years of his sentence;"</p>\n<p>"(b) Ten days per month off the third and fourth years of his sentence; and"</p>\n<p>"(c) Fifteen days per month off the fifth and all succeeding years of his sentence."</p>\n<p>Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.27(1) (1975).</p>\n<p>In 1978, the Florida Legislature repealed \xc2\xa7 944.27(1) and enacted a new formula for monthly gain-time deductions.  This new statute provided:</p>\n<p>"(a) Three days per month off the first and second years of the sentence;"</p>\n<p>"(b) Six days per month off the third and fourth years of the sentence; and"</p>\n<p>"(c) Nine days per month off the fifth and all succeeding years of the sentence."</p>\n<p>Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(1) (1979). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 450 U. S. 27</a></p><p> The new provision was implemented on January 1, 1979, and, since that time, the State has applied it not only to prisoners sentenced for crimes committed since its enactment in 1978, but also to all other prisoners, including petitioner, whose offenses took place before that date. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner, acting <em>pro se,</em> sought a writ of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court of Florida on the ground that the new statute, as applied to him, was an <em>ex post facto</em> law prohibited by the United States and the Florida Constitutions. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  He alleged that the reduced accumulation of monthly gain-time credits provided under the new statute would extend his required time in prison by over 2 years, or approximately 14 percent of his original 15-year sentence. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The State Supreme </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 450 U. S. 28</a></p><p> Court summarily denied the petition.  376 So.2d 855.

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>In accord with these purposes, our decisions prescribe that two critical elements must be present for a criminal or penal law to be <em>ex post facto:</em>  it must be retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.

Contrary to the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Florida, a law need not impair a "vested right" to violate the <em>ex post facto</em> prohibition. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Evaluating whether a right has vested </p><p><a class="page-number" name="30">Page 450 U. S. 30</a></p><p> is important for claims under the Contracts or Due Process Clauses, which solely protect preexisting entitlements.  <em>See, e.g., Wood v.

S. 174</a></span> (1980).  The presence or absence of an affirmative, enforceable right is not relevant, however, to the <em>ex post facto</em> prohibition, which forbids the imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred.  Critical to relief under the <em>Ex Post Facto</em> Clause is not an individual\'s right to less punishment, but the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated.  Thus, even if a statute merely alters penal provisions accorded by the grace of the legislature, it violates the Clause if it is both retrospective and more onerous than the law in effect on the date of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="31">Page 450 U. S. 31</a></p><p> the offense. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] We now consider the Florida statute in light of these two considerations.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The respondent maintains that Florida\'s 1978 law altering the availability of gain time is not retrospective, because, on its face, it applies only after its effective date.  Brief for Respondent 12, 116.  This argument fails to acknowledge that it is the effect, not the form, of the law that determines whether it is <em>ex post facto</em>. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The critical question is whether the law changes the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date.  In the context of this case, this question can be recast as asking whether Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(1) (1979) applies to prisoners convicted for acts committed before the provision\'s effective date.  Clearly, the answer is in the affirmative.  The respondent concedes that the State uses \xc2\xa7 944.275(1), which was implemented on January 1, 1979, to calculate the gain time available to petitioner, who was convicted of a crime occurring on January 31, 1976. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Thus, the provision attaches legal consequences to a crime committed before the law took effect.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, respondent contends that the State\'s revised gain-time provision is not retrospective, because its predecessor was "no part of the original sentence, and thus no part of the punishment annexed to the crime at the time petitioner was sentenced."  Brief for Respondent 12.  This contention </p><p><a class="page-number" name="32">Page 450 U. S. 32</a></p><p> is foreclosed by our precedents.  First, we need not determine whether the prospect of the gain time was, in some technical sense, part of the sentence to conclude that it, in fact, is one determinant of petitioner\'s prison term -- and that his effective sentence is altered once this determinant is changed.  <em>See Lindsey v. Washington,</em> 301 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/397/case.html#401">301 U. S. 401</a></span>-402; <em>Greenfield v.

S. 713</a></span> (1968).  <em>See also Rodriguez v. United States Parole Comm\'n,</em> 594 F.2d 170 (CA7 1979) (elimination of parole eligibility held an <em>ex post facto</em> violation).  We have previously recognized that a prisoner\'s eligibility for reduced imprisonment is a significant factor entering into both the defendant\'s decision to plea bargain and the judge\'s calculation of the sentence to be imposed.  <em>Wolff v. McDonnell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/539/case.html">418 U.

Second, we have held that a statute may be retrospective even if it alters punitive conditions outside the sentence.  Thus, we have concluded that a statute requiring solitary confinement prior to execution is <em>ex post facto</em> when applied to someone who committed a capital offense prior to its enactment, but not when applied only prospectively.  <em>Compare In re Medley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/1/case.html#16">134 U.

S. 325</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Under this inquiry, we conclude \xc2\xa7 944.275(1) is disadvantageous to petitioner and other similarly situated prisoners.  On its face, the statute reduces the number of monthly gain-time credits available to an inmate who abides by prison rules and adequately performs his assigned tasks.  By definition, this reduction in gain-time accumulation lengthens the period that someone in petitioner\'s position must spend in prison.  In <em>Lindsey v. Washington, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/397/case.html#401">301 U. S. 401</a></span>-402, we reasoned that</p>\n<p>"[i]t is plainly to the substantial disadvantage of petitioners to be deprived of all opportunity to receive a sentence which would give them freedom from custody and control prior to the expiration of the 15-year term."</p>\n<p>Here, petitioner is similarly disadvantaged by the reduced </p><p><a class="page-number" name="34">Page 450 U. S. 34</a></p><p> opportunity to shorten his time in prison simply through good conduct.  In <em>Greenfield v. Scafati, supra,</em> we affirmed the judgment of a three-judge District Court which found an <em>ex post facto</em> violation in the application of a statute denying any gain time for the first six months after parole revocation to an inmate whose crime occurred before the statute\'s enactment.  There, as here, the inmate was disadvantaged by new restrictions on eligibility for release.  In this vein, the three-judge court in <em>Greenfield</em> found</p>\n<p>"no distinction between depriving a prisoner of the right to earn good conduct deductions and the right to qualify for, and hence earn, parole.  Each . . . materially \'alters the situation of the accused to his disadvantage.\'"</p>\n<p>277 F.Supp. at 646 (quoting <em>In re Medley, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/160/case.html#171">134 U. S. 171</a></span>).  <em>See also Murphy v. Commonwealth,</em> 172 Mass. 264, 52 N.E. 505 (1899).</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that our inquiry should not end at this point, because Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(1) (1979) must be examined in conjunction with other provisions enacted with it.  Brief for Respondent 18-26.  Respondent claims that the net effect of all these provisions is increased availability of gain-time deductions. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  There can be no doubt that the legislature </p><p><a class="page-number" name="35">Page 450 U. S. 35</a></p><p> intended through these provisions to promote rehabilitation and to create incentives for specified productive conduct.  <em>See</em> Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.012 (1979).  But none of these provisions for extra gain time compensates for the reduction of gain time available solely for good conduct.  The fact remains that an inmate who performs satisfactory work and avoids disciplinary violations could obtain more gain time per month under the repealed provision, \xc2\xa7 944.27(1) (1975), than he could for the same conduct under the new provision, \xc2\xa7 944.275(1) (1979).  To make up the difference, the inmate has to satisfy the extra conditions specified by the discretionary gain-time provisions. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Even then, the award of the extra gain time is purely discretionary, contingent on both the wishes of the correctional authorities and special behavior by the inmate, such as saving a life or diligent performance in an academic program.  Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 944.275(3)(a), (b) (1979).  In contrast, under both the new and old statutes, an inmate is automatically entitled to the monthly gain time simply for avoiding disciplinary infractions and performing his assigned tasks.  <em>Compare</em> Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(1) (1979) <em>with</em> \xc2\xa7 944.27(1) (1975). [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Thus, the new provision constricts the inmate\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="36">Page 450 U. S. 36</a></p><p> opportunity to earn early release, and thereby makes more onerous the punishment for crimes committed before its enactment.  This result runs afoul of the prohibition against <em>ex post facto</em> laws. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We find Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(1) (1979) void as applied to petitioner, whose crime occurred before its effective date.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida and remand this case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(1) (1979); Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.27(1) (1975).  At the time of petitioner\'s offense, Florida used the term "good time," to refer to extra "allowance for meritorious conduct or exceptional industry."  Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.29 (1975).  The current Florida law adopts the phrase "gain time" to apply to various kinds of time credited to reduce a prisoner\'s prison term. <em>See, e.g.,</em> Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(3) (1979).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The statute also provided for extra discretionary good time, based on other factors.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F18" name="T18">n</a> 18, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>There are some minor language differences in the new provision directing the correctional authorities at the Department of Offender Rehabilitation to make the gain-time deductions.  The phrase "who has performed in a satisfactory and acceptable manner the work, duties, and tasks assigned," Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(1) (1979), replaces the former phrase, "who has performed in a faithful, diligent, industrious, orderly, and peaceful manner the work, duties, and tasks assigned," Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.27(1) (1975).  The new version also explicitly adds that the deductions are to be made "on a monthly basis, as earned," which appears to codify the previous practice.  The State Supreme Court assigned no significance to these differences in evaluating the <em>ex post facto</em> claim, nor does any party here assert that these minor language changes are relevant to our inquiry.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>No saving clause limiting the Act\'s application was included.  1978 Fla.

Discussion of vested rights has seldom appeared in <em>ex post facto</em> analysis, as in identifying whether the challenged change is substantive, rather than procedural.  <em>Hopt v.

When a court engages in <em>ex post facto</em> analysis, which is concerned solely with whether a statute assigns more disadvantageous criminal or penal consequences to an act than did the law in place when the act occurred, it is irrelevant whether the statutory change touches any vested rights.  Several state courts have properly distinguished vested rights from <em>ex post facto</em> concerns.  <em>E.g., State v. Curtis,</em> 363 So.2d 1375, 1379, 1382 (La.1978); <em>State ex rel.

Another provision specifies that an inmate "may be granted" one to six extra gain-time days per month if he "faithfully performs the assignments given to him in a conscientious manner over and above that which may normally be expected of him" and also either shows "his desire to be a better than average inmate" or "diligently participates in an approved course of academic or vocation study."  \xc2\xa7 944.275 (3)(a).

Finally, for inmates unable to qualify under this previous provision due to "age, illness, infirmity, or confinement for reasons other than discipline," additional gain time of up to six days per month may be granted for "constructive utilization of time."  \xc2\xa7 944.275(2)(e).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, few of the "new" sources for extra gain time do more than reiterate previous opportunities provided by statute or state regulation.  <em>Compare</em> Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(3)(a) (1979) <em>with</em> \xc2\xa7 944.29 (1975) ("an extra good-time allowance for meritorious conduct or exceptional industry"); Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(2)(b) (1979) <em>with</em> \xc2\xa7 944.27 (1975) (authorizing administrative rules governing additional gain time) and Fla.Admin.

S. </a></span>  Respondent\'s reliance on a general statement of legislative intent unrelated to the gain-time provision, <em>see</em> Brief for Respondent 17 (citing Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.012(6) (1979)), is also unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>The proper relief upon a conclusion that a state prisoner is being treated under an <em>ex post facto</em> law is to remand to permit the state court to apply, if possible, the law in place when his crime occurred.  <em>See Lindsey v. Washington, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/402/case.html">301 U.

In remanding for this relief, we note that only the <em>ex post facto</em> portion of the new law is void as to petitioner, and therefore any severable provisions which are not <em>ex post facto</em> may still be applied to him.  <em>See</em> 2 C. Sands, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \xc2\xa7 44.04 (4th ed.1973).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Were the Court writing on a clean slate, I would vote to affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida.  My </p><p><a class="page-number" name="37">Page 450 U. S. 37</a></p><p> thesis would be:  (a) the 1978 Florida statute operates only prospectively, and does not affect petitioner\'s credits earned and accumulated prior to the effective date of the statute; (b) "good time" or "gain time" is something to be earned, and is not part of, or inherent in, the sentence imposed; (c) all the new statute did was to remove some of petitioner\'s hope and a portion of his opportunity; and (d) his sentence therefore was not enhanced by the statute.  In addition, as the Court\'s 18th footnote reveals, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/24/case.html#34">450 U. S. 34</a></span>-35, the statutory change by no means was entirely restrictive; in certain respects it was more lenient, as the Court\'s careful preservation for this prisoner of the new statute\'s other provisions clearly implies.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/24/case.html#36">450 U. S. 36</a></span> and this page,  <a href="#F22" name="T22">n</a> 22.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s precedents, however, particularly <em>Lindsey v. Washington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/397/case.html">301 U. S. 397</a></span> (1937), and the summary disposition of <em>Greenfield v.

S. 713</a></span> (1968), although not warmly persuasive for me, look the other way, and I thus must accede to the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I find this case a close one.  As the Court recently noted:  "It is axiomatic that, for a law to be <em>ex post facto,</em> it must be more onerous than the prior law." ,<em>Dobbert v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/282/case.html">432 U. S. 282</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/282/case.html#294">432 U. S. 294</a></span> (1977).  Petitioner was clearly disadvantaged by the loss of the opportunity to accrue gain time through good conduct pursuant to the 5-10-15 formula when the legislature changed to a 3-6-9 formula.  The new statute, however, also afforded petitioner opportunities not available </p><p><a class="page-number" name="38">Page 450 U. S. 38</a></p><p> under prior law to earn additional gain time beyond the good conduct formula. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/24/case.html">*</a></span>  The case is not resolved simply by comparing the 5-10-15 formula with the 3-6-9 formula.  "We must compare the two statutory procedures <em>in toto</em> to determine if the new may be fairly characterized as more onerous."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>I am persuaded in this case, albeit not without doubt, that the new statute is more onerous than the old, because the amount of gain time which is accrued automatically solely through good conduct is substantially reduced, and this reduction is not offset by the availability of discretionary awards of gain time for activities extending beyond simply "staying out of trouble."  This is not to say, however, that no reduction in automatic gain time, however slight, can ever be offset by increases in the availability of discretionary gain time, however great, or that reductions in the amount of credit for good conduct can never be offset by increases in the availability of credit which can be earned by more than merely good conduct.</p>\n<p>Since the availability of new opportunities for discretionary gain time and the reduction in the amount of automatic gain time can be viewed as a total package, it must be emphasized </p><p><a class="page-number" name="39">Page 450 U. S. 39</a></p><p> that nothing in today\'s decision compels Florida to provide prisoners in petitioner\'s position with the benefits of the new provisions when this Court has held that Florida may not require such prisoners to pay the price.  It is not at all clear that the Florida Legislature would have intended to make available the new discretionary gain time to prisoners earning automatic gain time under the old 5-10-15 formula, when the legislature, in fact, reduced the 5-10-15 formula when it enacted the new provisions.  The question is, of course, one for Florida to resolve.</p>\n<p>* While the Court points out that gain time was available under the old scheme beyond the 5-10-15 formula, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/24/case.html#35">450 U. S. 35</a></span>, n.19, I am not convinced that the new sources simply "reiterate[d]" opportunities previously available.  There is, for example, no dispute that several of the new sources of gain time have no analogues in the previous statutory or administrative scheme.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(2)(e) (1979) (up to six days of gain time per month because of age, illness, infirmity, or confinement for reasons other than discipline); \xc2\xa7 944.275(3)(a) (up to six days per month for inmates who diligently participate in an approved course of academic or vocational study).  Other new statutory provisions which had only administrative counterparts improved substantially on the availability of gain time.  For example, under the old administrative system, an inmate could receive from 1 to 15 days of gain time per month for constructive labor, Fla.Admin.Code, Rule 10B-20.04(1) (1975), while, under the new statutory scheme, an inmate can receive up to 1 day of gain time for every day of constructive labor, Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 944.275(2)(b) (1979).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
