After petitioner Trident\xe2\x80\x99s infringement action was dismissed, respondent filed suit seeking a judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of Trident\xe2\x80\x99s patents on the ground that petitioners are engaged in illegal \xe2\x80\x9ctying\xe2\x80\x9d and monopolization in violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  Granting petitioners summary judgment, the District Court rejected respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that petitioners necessarily have market power as a matter of law by virtue of the patent on their printhead system, thereby rendering the tying arrangements <em>per se</em> violations of the antitrust laws.  After carefully reviewing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s tying-arrangements decisions, the Federal Circuit reversed as to the \xc2\xa71 claim, concluding that it had to follow this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents until overruled by this Court. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because a patent does not necessarily confer market power upon the patentee, in all cases involving a tying arrangement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has market power in the tying product.

At the same time that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s antitrust jurisprudence continued to rely on the assumption that tying arrangements generally serve no legitimate business purpose, Congress began chipping away at that assumption in the patent misuse context from whence it came.  Then, four years after <em>Jefferson Parish</em> repeated the presumption that patents confer market power, Congress amended the Patent Code to eliminate it in the patent misuse context.  While that amendment does not expressly refer to the antitrust laws, it invites reappraisal of <em>International Salt</em>\xe2\x80\x99s <em>per se</em> rule.  After considering the congressional judgment reflected in the amendment, this Court concludes that tying arrangements involving patented products should be evaluated under the standards of cases like <em>Fortner II </em>and <em>Jefferson Parish</em> rather than the <em>per se</em> rule in <em>Morton Salt </em>and <em>Loew</em>\xe2\x80\x99s.

S. 2</a> (1984), we repeated the well-settled proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cif the Government has granted the seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that the inability to buy the product elsewhere gives the seller market power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 16.  This presumption of market power, applicable in the antitrust context when a seller conditions its sale of a patented product (the \xe2\x80\x9ctying\xe2\x80\x9d product) on the purchase of a second product (the \xe2\x80\x9ctied\xe2\x80\x9d product), has its foundation in the judicially created patent misuse doctrine.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Loew\xe2\x80\x99s</em> <em>Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/38/index.html"></a><a href="/us/371/38/index.html"></a><a href="/us/371/38/index.html">371 U. S. 38</a>, 46 (1962).  In 1988, Congress substantially undermined that foundation, amending the Patent Act to eliminate the market power presumption in patent misuse cases.  See 102 Stat. 4674, codified at 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7271(d).  The question presented to us today is whether the presumption of market power in a patented product should survive as a matter of antitrust law despite its demise in patent law.  We conclude that the mere fact that a tying product is patented does not support such a presumption.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, Trident, Inc., and its parent, Illinois Tool Works Inc., manufacture and market printing systems that include three relevant components: (1) a patented piezoelectric impulse ink jet printhead; (2) a patented ink container, consisting of a bottle and valved cap, which attaches to the printhead; and (3) specially designed, but unpatented, ink.  Petitioners sell their systems to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are licensed to incorporate the printheads and containers into printers that are in turn sold to companies for use in printing barcodes on cartons and packaging materials.  The OEMs agree that they will purchase their ink exclusively from petitioners, and that neither they nor their customers will refill the patented containers with ink of any kind.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent, Independent Ink, Inc., has developed an ink with the same chemical composition as the ink sold by petitioners.  After an infringement action brought by Trident against Independent was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, Independent filed suit against Trident seeking a judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of Trident\xe2\x80\x99s patents.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In an amended complaint, it alleged that petitioners are engaged in illegal tying and monopolization in violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  15 U.

Finding that respondent had submitted no affirmative evidence defining the relevant market or establishing petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 power within it, the court concluded that respondent could not prevail on either antitrust claim.  <em>Id</em>., at 1167, 1173, 1177.  The parties settled their other claims, and respondent appealed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a careful review of the \xe2\x80\x9clong history of Supreme Court consideration of the legality of tying arrangements,\xe2\x80\x9d 396 F. 3d 1342, 1346 (2005), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision as to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71 claim, <em>id</em>., at 1354.

See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastening Co.</em> v. <em>Eureka Specialty Co.</em>, 77 F. 288 (CA6 1896).  Such a case came before this Court in <em>Henry</em> v. <em>A. B. Dick Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/224/1/index.html">224 U. S. 1</a> (1912), in which, as in the case we decide today, unpatented ink was the product that was \xe2\x80\x9ctied\xe2\x80\x9d to the use of a patented product through the use of a licensing agreement.  Without commenting on the tying arrangement, the Court held that use of a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s ink in violation of a condition of the agreement\xe2\x80\x94that the rotary mimeograph \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98may be used only with the stencil, paper, ink and other supplies made by A.

Two years later, Congress endorsed Chief Justice White\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval of tying arrangements, enacting \xc2\xa73 of the Clayton Act.  See 38 Stat. 731 (applying to \xe2\x80\x9cpatented or unpatented\xe2\x80\x9d products); see also <em>Motion Picture Patents Co. </em>v. <em>Universal Film Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/243/502/index.html"></a><a href="/us/243/502/index.html"></a><a href="/us/243/502/index.html">243 U.

And in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent cases reviewing the legality of tying arrangements we, too, embraced Chief Justice White\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval of those arrangements.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Standard Oil Co. of Cal.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/293/index.html">337 U. S. 293</a>, 305\xe2\x80\x93306 (1949); <em>Mercoid Corp. </em>v. <em>Mid-Continent Investment Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/320/661/index.html">320 U. S. 661</a>, 664\xe2\x80\x93665 (1944).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the years since <em>A.\xc2\xa0B. Dick</em>, four different rules of law have supported challenges to tying arrangements.  They have been condemned as improper extensions of the patent monopoly under the patent misuse doctrine, as unfair methods of competition under \xc2\xa75 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa745, as contracts tending to create a monopoly under \xc2\xa73 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713a, and as contracts in restraint of trade under \xc2\xa71 of the Sherman Act.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In all of those instances, the justification for the challenge rested on either an assumption or a showing that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s position of power in the market for the tying product was being used to restrain competition in the market for the tied product.  As we explained in <em>Jefferson Parish</em>, 466 U. S., at 12, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur cases have concluded that the essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller\xe2\x80\x99s exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the years, however, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s strong disapproval of tying arrangements has substantially diminished.  Rather than relying on assumptions, in its more recent opinions the Court has required a showing of market power in the tying product.  Our early opinions consistently assumed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ying arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Standard Oil Co.</em>, 337 U. S., at 305\xe2\x80\x93306. <em> </em>In 1962, in <em>Loew\xe2\x80\x99s</em>, 371 U. S., at 47\xe2\x80\x9348, the Court relied on this assumption despite evidence of significant competition in the market for the tying product.  And as recently as 1969, Justice Black, writing for the majority, relied on the assumption as support for the proposition \xe2\x80\x9cthat, at least when certain prerequisites are met, arrangements of this kind are illegal in and of themselves, and no specific showing of unreasonable competitive effect is required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fortner</em> <em>Enterprises, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States Steel Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/495/index.html">394 U. S. 495</a>, 498\xe2\x80\x93499 <em>(Fortner I)</em>.  Explaining the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to allow the suit to proceed to trial, he stated that \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions rejecting the need for proof of truly dominant power over the tying product have all been based on a recognition that because tying arrangements generally serve no legitimate business purpose that cannot be achieved in some less restrictive way, the presence of any appreciable restraint on competition provides a sufficient reason for invalidating the tie.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 503.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reflecting a changing view of tying arrangements, four Justices dissented in <em>Fortner I</em>, arguing that the challenged \xe2\x80\x9ctie\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the extension of a $2 million line of credit on condition that the borrower purchase prefabricated houses from the defendant\xe2\x80\x94might well have served a legitimate purpose.  <em>Id</em>., at 510 (opinion of White, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 520 (opinion of Fortas, J.).  In his opinion, Justice White noted that promotional tie-ins may provide \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely advantageous deals\xe2\x80\x9d to purchasers.  <em>Id</em>., at 519.  And Justice Fortas concluded that the arrangement was best characterized as \xe2\x80\x9ca sale of a single product with the incidental provision of financing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 522.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 view that tying arrangements may well be procompetitive ultimately prevailed; indeed, it did so in the very same lawsuit.  After the Court remanded the suit in <em>Fortner I</em>, a bench trial resulted in judgment for the plaintiff, and the case eventually made its way back to this Court.  Upon return, we unanimously held that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s failure of proof on the issue of market power was fatal to its case\xe2\x80\x94the plaintiff had proved \xe2\x80\x9cnothing more than a willingness to provide cheap financing in order to sell expensive houses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States Steel Corp.</em> v. <em>Fortner Enterprises, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/610/index.html">429 U. S. 610</a>, 622 (1977) <em>(Fortner II)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The assumption that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ying arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition,\xe2\x80\x9d rejected in <em>Fortner II</em>, has not been endorsed in any opinion since.  Instead, it was again rejected just seven years later in <em>Jefferson Parish</em>, where, as in <em>Fortner II</em>, we unanimously reversed a Court of Appeals judgment holding that an alleged tying arrangement constituted a <em>per se</em> violation of \xc2\xa71 of the Sherman Act.  466 U. S., at 5.  Like the product at issue in the <em>Fortner</em> cases, the tying product in <em>Jefferson Parish</em>\xe2\x80\x94hospital services\xe2\x80\x94was unpatented, and our holding again rested on the conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to prove sufficient power in the tying product market to restrain competition in the market for the tied product\xe2\x80\x94services of anesthesiologists.  466 U. S., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In rejecting the application of a <em>per se </em>rule that all tying arrangements constitute antitrust violations, we\nexplained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have condemned tying arrangements when the seller has some special ability\xe2\x80\x94usually called \xe2\x80\x98market power\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94to force a purchaser to do something that he would not do in a competitive market. . . . </p>\n<p align="left">.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Per se</em> condemnation\xe2\x80\x94condemnation without inquiry into actual market conditions\xe2\x80\x94is only appropriate if the existence of forcing is probable.  Thus, application of the <em>per se </em>rule focuses on the probability of anticompetitive consequences. . . .</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor example, if the Government has granted the seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that the inability to buy the product elsewhere gives the seller market power. <em> United States </em>v. <em>Loew\xe2\x80\x99s Inc.</em>, 371 U. S., at 45\xe2\x80\x9347.  Any effort to enlarge the scope of the patent monopoly by using the market power it confers to restrain competition in the market for a second product will undermine competition on the merits in that second market.  Thus, the sale or lease of a patented item on condition that the buyer make all his purchases of a separate tied product from the patentee is unlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 13\xe2\x80\x9316 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nNotably, nothing in our opinion suggested a rebuttable presumption of market power applicable to tying arrangements involving a patent on the tying good.  See <em>infra</em>, at 14; cf. 396 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1352.

In her opinion, she questioned not only the propriety of treating any tying arrangement as a <em>per se</em> violation of the Sherman Act, <em>id</em>., at 35, but also the validity of the presumption that a patent always gives the patentee significant market power, observing that the presumption was actually a product of our patent misuse cases rather than our antitrust jurisprudence, <em>id</em>., at 37\xe2\x80\x9338, n.\xc2\xa07.  It is that presumption, a vestige of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s historical distrust of tying arrangements, that we address squarely today.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor was, of course, correct in her assertion that the presumption that a patent confers market power arose outside the antitrust context as part of the patent misuse doctrine.  That doctrine had its origins in <em>Motion Picture Patents Co.</em> v. <em>Universal Film Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/243/502/index.html"></a><a href="/us/243/502/index.html"></a><a href="/us/243/502/index.html">243 U.

Although <em>Motion Picture Patents Co.</em> simply narrowed the scope of possible patent infringement claims, it formed the basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent decisions creating a patent misuse defense to infringement claims when a patentee uses its patent \xe2\x80\x9cas the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morton Salt Co.</em> v. <em>G.

In other words, these decisions presumed \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he requisite economic power\xe2\x80\x9d over the tying product such that the patentee could \xe2\x80\x9cextend [its] economic control to unpatented products.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Loew\xe2\x80\x99s</em>, 371 U.

In that case, we affirmed a District Court decision holding that leases of patented machines requiring the lessees to use the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unpatented salt products violated \xc2\xa71 of the Sherman Act and \xc2\xa73 of the Clayton Act as a matter of law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 396.  Although the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not discuss market power or the patent misuse doctrine, it assumes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he volume of business affected by these contracts cannot be said to be insignificant or insubstantial and the tendency of the arrangement to accomplishment of monopoly seems obvious.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The assumption that tying contracts \xe2\x80\x9cten[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 to accomplishment of monopoly\xe2\x80\x9d can be traced to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief in <em>International Salt</em>, which relied heavily on our earlier patent misuse decision in <em>Morton Salt</em>.  The Government described <em>Morton Salt</em> as \xe2\x80\x9cpresent[ing] a factual situation almost identical with the instant case,\xe2\x80\x9d and it asserted that \xe2\x80\x9calthough the Court in that case did not find it necessary to decide whether the antitrust laws were violated, its language, its reasoning, and its citations indicate that the policy underlying the decision was the same as that of the Sherman Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States in <em>International Salt Co. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, O. T. 1947, No. 46, p. 19 (United States Brief).  Building on its assertion that <em>International Salt</em> was logically indistinguishable from <em>Morton Salt</em>, the Government argued that this Court should place tying arrangements involving patented products in the category of <em>per se</em> violations of the Sherman Act.  United States Brief 26\xe2\x80\x9333.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our opinion in <em>International Salt</em> clearly shows that we accepted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to import the presumption of market power in a patented product into our antitrust jurisprudence.  While we cited <em>Morton Salt</em> only for the narrower proposition that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s patents did not confer any right to restrain competition in unpatented salt or afford the defendant any immunity from the antitrust laws, <em>International Salt</em>, 332 U. S., at 395\xe2\x80\x93396, given the fact that the defendant was selling its unpatented salt at competitive prices, <em>id</em>., at 396\xe2\x80\x93397,<em> </em>the rule adopted in <em>International Salt</em> necessarily accepted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s submission that the earlier patent misuse cases supported the broader proposition \xe2\x80\x9cthat this type of restraint is unlawful on its face under the Sherman Act,\xe2\x80\x9d United States Brief 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, later in the same Term we cited <em>International Salt </em>for the proposition that the license of \xe2\x80\x9ca patented device on condition that unpatented materials be employed in conjunction with the patented device\xe2\x80\x9d is an example of a restraint that is \xe2\x80\x9cillegal <em>per se</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Columbia Steel Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/334/495/index.html">334 U. S. 495</a>, 522\xe2\x80\x93523, and n. 22 (1948).  And in subsequent cases we have repeatedly grounded the presumption of market power over a patented device in <em>International Salt</em>.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Loew</em>\xe2\x80\x99<em>s</em>, 371 U.

This process has ultimately led to today\xe2\x80\x99s reexamination of the presumption of <em>per se </em>illegality of a tying arrangement involving a patented product, the first case since 1947 in which we have granted review to consider the presumption\xe2\x80\x99s continuing validity.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three years before we decided <em>International Salt</em>, this Court had expanded the scope of the patent misuse doctrine to include not only supplies or materials used by a patented device, but also tying arrangements involving a combination patent and \xe2\x80\x9cunpatented material or [a] device [that] is itself an integral part of the structure embodying the patent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mercoid</em>, 320 U. S., at 665; see also <em>Dawson Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Rohm &amp; Haas Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/176/index.html">448 U. S. 176</a>, 188\xe2\x80\x93198 (1980) (describing in detail <em>Mercoid</em> and the cases leading up to it).  In reaching this conclusion, the Court explained that it could see \xe2\x80\x9cno difference in principle\xe2\x80\x9d between cases involving elements essential to the inventive character of the patent and elements peripheral to it; both, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, were attempts to \xe2\x80\x9cexpan[d] the patent beyond the legitimate scope of its monopoly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mercoid</em>, 320 U. S., at 665.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly thereafter, Congress codified the patent laws for the first time.  See 66 Stat. 792, codified as 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 <em>et seq</em>. (2000 ed. and Supp. III).  At least partly in response to our <em>Mercoid</em> decision, Congress included a provision in its codification that excluded some conduct, such as a tying arrangement involving the sale of a patented product tied to an \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnonstaple\xe2\x80\x9d product that has no use except as part of the patented product or method, from the scope of the patent misuse doctrine.  \xc2\xa7271(d); see also <em>Dawson</em>, 448 U. S., at 214.  Thus, at the same time that our antitrust jurisprudence continued to rely on the assumption that \xe2\x80\x9ctying arrangements generally serve no legitimate business purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fortner I</em>, 394 U. S., at 503, Congress began chipping away at the assumption in the patent misuse context from whence it came.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is Congress\xe2\x80\x99 most recent narrowing of the patent misuse defense, however, that is directly relevant to this case.  Four years after our decision in <em>Jefferson Parish </em>repeated the patent\xe2\x80\x93equals\xe2\x80\x93market\xe2\x80\x93power presumption, 466 U. S., at 16, Congress amended the Patent Code to eliminate that presumption in the patent misuse context, 102 Stat. 4674.  The relevant provision reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement or contributory infringement of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his having done one or more of the following: \xe2\x80\xa6 (5) conditioned the license of any rights to the patent or the sale of the patented product on the acquisition of a license to rights in another patent or purchase of a separate product, <em>unless, in view of the circumstances, the patent owner has market power in the relevant market for the patent or patented product on which the license or sale is conditioned</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7271(d)(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe italicized clause makes it clear that Congress did not intend the mere existence of a patent to constitute the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cmarket power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, fairly read, it provides that without proof that Trident had market power in the relevant market, its conduct at issue in this case was neither \xe2\x80\x9cmisuse\xe2\x80\x9d nor an \xe2\x80\x9cillegal extension of the patent right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the 1988 amendment does not expressly refer to the antitrust laws, it certainly invites a reappraisal of the <em>per se</em> rule announced in <em>International Salt</em>.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  A rule denying a patentee the right to enjoin an infringer is significantly less severe than a rule that makes the conduct at issue a federal crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison.  See 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71.   It would be absurd to assume that Congress intended to provide that the use of a patent that merited punishment as a felony would not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cmisuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, given the fact that the patent misuse doctrine provided the basis for the market power presumption, it would be anomalous to preserve the presumption in antitrust after Congress has eliminated its foundation.  Cf. 10 P. Areeda, H. Hovenkamp, &amp; E. Elhauge, Antitrust Law \xc2\xb61737c (2d ed. 2004) (hereinafter Areeda).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After considering the congressional judgment reflected in the 1988 amendment, we conclude that tying arrangements involving patented products should be evaluated under the standards applied in cases like <em>Fortner II </em>and<em> Jefferson Parish</em> rather than under the <em>per se</em> rule applied in <em>Morton Salt</em> and <em>Loew\xe2\x80\x99s</em>.  While some such arrangements are still unlawful, such as those that are the product of a true monopoly or a marketwide conspiracy, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Paramount Pictures, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/334/131/index.html">334 U. S. 131</a>, 145\xe2\x80\x93146 (1948), that conclusion must be supported by proof of power in the relevant market rather than by a mere presumption thereof.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than arguing that we should retain the rule of <em>per se</em> illegality, respondent contends that we should endorse a rebuttable presumption that patentees possess market power when they condition the purchase of the patented product on an agreement to buy unpatented goods exclusively from the patentee.  Cf. <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Respondent recognizes that a large number of valid patents have little, if any, commercial significance, but submits that those that are used to impose tying arrangements on unwilling purchasers likely do exert significant market power.  Hence, in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s view, the presumption would have no impact on patents of only slight value and would be justified, subject to being rebutted by evidence offered by the patentee, in cases in which the patent has sufficient value to enable the patentee to insist on acceptance of the tie.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent also offers a narrower alternative, suggesting that we differentiate between tying arrangements involving the simultaneous purchase of two products that are arguably two components of a single product\xe2\x80\x94such as the provision of surgical services and anesthesiology in the same operation, <em>Jefferson Parish</em>, 466 U. S., at 43 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment), or the licensing of one copyrighted film on condition that the licensee take a package of several films in the same transaction, <em>Loew\xe2\x80\x99s</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/38/index.html"></a><a href="/us/371/38/index.html"></a><a href="/us/371/38/index.html">371 U. S. 38</a>\xe2\x80\x94and a tying arrangement involving the purchase of unpatented goods over a period of time, a so-called \xe2\x80\x9crequirements tie.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also Brief for Barry Nalebuff et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em>.  According to respondent, we should recognize a presumption of market power when faced with the latter type of arrangements because they provide a means for charging large volume purchasers a higher royalty for use of the patent than small purchasers must pay, a form of discrimination that \xe2\x80\x9cis strong evidence of market power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 27; see generally <em>Jefferson Parish</em>, 466 U. S., at 15, n. 23 (discussing price discrimination of this sort and citing sources).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The opinion that imported the \xe2\x80\x9cpatent equals market power\xe2\x80\x9d presumption into our antitrust jurisprudence, however, provides no support for respondent\xe2\x80\x99s proposed alternative.  In <em>International Salt</em>, it was the existence of the patent on the tying product, rather than the use of a requirements tie, that led the Court to presume market power.  332 U. S., at 395 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe appellant\xe2\x80\x99s patents confer a limited monopoly of the invention they reward\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, the requirements tie in that case did not involve any price discrimination between large volume and small volume purchasers or evidence of noncompetitive pricing.  Instead, the leases at issue provided that if any competitor offered salt, the tied product, at a lower price, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lessee should be free to buy in the open market, unless appellant would furnish the salt at an equal price.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 396.</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have already noted, the vast majority of academic literature recognizes that a patent does not necessarily confer market power.  See n.\xc2\xa04, <em>supra.</em>  Similarly, while price discrimination may provide evidence of market power, particularly if buttressed by evidence that the patentee has charged an above-market price for the tied package, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 10 Areeda \xc2\xb61769c, it is generally recognized that it also occurs in fully competitive markets, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Baumol &amp; Swanson, The New Economy and Ubiquitous Competitive Price Discrimination: Identifying Defensible Criteria of Market Power, 70 Antitrust L.\xc2\xa0J. 661, 666 (2003); 9 Areeda \xc2\xb61711; Landes &amp; Posner 374\xe2\x80\x93375.  We are not persuaded that the combination of these two factors should give rise to a presumption of market power when neither is sufficient to do so standing alone.  Rather, the lesson to be learned from <em>International Salt</em> and the academic commentary is the same: Many tying arrangements, even those involving patents and requirements ties, are fully consistent with a free, competitive market.  For this reason, we reject both respondent\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rebuttable presumption and their narrower alternative.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no doubt the virtual consensus among economists that has persuaded the enforcement agencies to reject the position that the Government took when it supported the <em>per se </em>rule that the Court adopted in the 1940\xe2\x80\x99s.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8.  In antitrust guidelines issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in 1995, the enforcement agencies stated that in the exercise of their prosecutorial discretion they \xe2\x80\x9cwill not presume that a patent, copyright, or trade secret necessarily confers market power upon its owner.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Dept. of Justice and FTC, Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property \xc2\xa72.2 (Apr. 6, 1995), available at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/guidelines/0558.pdf (as visited Feb. 24, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  While that choice is not binding on the Court, it would be unusual for the Judiciary to replace the normal rule of lenity that is applied in criminal cases with a rule of severity for a special category of antitrust cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress, the antitrust enforcement agencies, and most economists have all reached the conclusion that a patent does not necessarily confer market power upon the patentee.  Today, we reach the same conclusion, and therefore hold that, in all cases involving a tying arrangement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has market power in the tying product.</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, respondent reasonably relied on our prior opinions in moving for summary judgment without offering evidence defining the relevant market or proving that petitioners possess power within it.  When the case returns to the District Court, respondent should therefore be given a fair opportunity to develop and introduce evidence on that issue, as well as any other issues that are relevant to its remaining \xc2\xa71 claims.
