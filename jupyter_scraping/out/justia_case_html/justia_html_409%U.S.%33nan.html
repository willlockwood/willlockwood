The Supreme Court of California affirmed the superior court\'s judgment of dismissal and order suppressing the evidence on the grounds that, under the circumstances of this case, respondents</p>\n<p>"had a reasonable expectation that their trash would not be rummaged through and picked over by police officers acting without a search warrant."</p>\n<p><em>People v.

In reaching its result in this case, the California court cited pertinent excerpts from its earlier decision in <em>People v. Edwards,</em> 71 Cal.2d 1096, 458 P.2d 713 (1969) (en banc), which relied specifically upon both the state and federal provisions.  5 Cal. 3d at 367, 486 P.2d, at 1269.  Thus, as in <em>Mental Hygiene Dept. v. Kirchner,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/194/case.html">380 U.
