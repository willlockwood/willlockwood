The reason for this seemed to be that the contest between him and Samson was prosecuted immediately from the register and receiver\'s decision to the commissioner, and from the commissioner\'s decision affirming that of the register and receiver to the secretary, so that there was no period until the final decision of the latter when either party could have been permitted to make the entry, but the record showed that, on a full and thorough investigation, all the officers of the land department decided that Smiley had established his right of preemption, and the secretary overruled this on the sole ground that he had filed a declaratory statement for another tract of land.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1967291">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Samson v.

M. H. Carpenter, J. M. Woolworth and A. J. Poppleton, <em>contra,</em> the judgment of the court was delivered by MR. JUSTICE MILLER, to the effect that the land in question, having never been subject to private entry, the construction of the statute made by the secretary was erroneous, and operated to deprive Smiley of his right, otherwise perfect, to the land, and to vest the legal title, which he ought to have received, in Samson.  The case came, therefore, as the Court considered, within the principle just decided in <em>Towsley v. Johnson</em> and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska was accordingly</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
