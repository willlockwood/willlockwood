The Act, as relevant here, provides that the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwhether to institute an inter partes review .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be final and non-appealable,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7314(d), and grants the Patent Office authority to issue \xe2\x80\x9cregulations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. establishing and governing inter partes review,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7316(a)(4).

The Patent Office agreed to review claim 17.  It also decided to reexamine claims 10 and 14 on that same ground because it determined those claims to be logically linked to the obviousness challenge to claim 17.  The Patent Office, through its Patent Trial and Appeal Board, concluded that the claims were obvious in light of prior art, denied for reasons of futility Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s motion to amend the claims, and canceled all three claims.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Cuozzo appealed to the Federal Circuit.  Cuozzo claimed that the Patent Office improperly instituted inter partes review with respect to claims 10 and 14, and it alleged that the Board improperly used the \xe2\x80\x9cbroadest reasonable construction\xe2\x80\x9d standard to interpret the claims rather than the standard used by courts, which gives claims their \xe2\x80\x9cordinary meaning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as understood by a person of skill in the art,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Phillips </i>v. <i>AWH Corp.,</i> 415 F.\xc2\xa03d 1303, 1314.  The Federal Circuit rejected both arguments.  It reasoned that \xc2\xa7314(d) made the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s decision to institute inter partes review \xe2\x80\x9cnonappealable,\xe2\x80\x9d and it concluded that the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s regulation was a reasonable exercise of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s rulemaking authority.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0Section 314(d) bars Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s decision to institute inter partes review.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a) The text of \xc2\xa7314(d) expressly states that the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s determinations whether to institute inter partes review \xe2\x80\x9cshall be <i>final and nonappealable</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, construing \xc2\xa7314(d) to permit judicial review of the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary decision to institute inter partes review undercuts the important congressional objective of giving the agency significant power to revisit and revise earlier patent grants.  Past practice in respect to related proceedings, including the predecessor to inter partes review, also supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend for courts to review these initial determinations.  Finally, reading \xc2\xa7314(d) as limited to interlocutory appeals would render the provision largely superfluous in light of the Administrative Procedure Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cstrong presumption\xe2\x80\x9d favoring judicial review, <i>Mach Mining, LLC</i> v. <i>EEOC</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, is overcome here by these \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clear and convincing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d indications that Congress intended to bar review, <i>Block</i> v. <i>Community Nutrition Institute</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 340\n.  Given that presumption, however, the interpretation adopted here applies to cases in which the challenge is to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s determination \xe2\x80\x9cto initiate an inter partes review <i>under this section</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d or where the challenge consists of questions closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to that determination.  Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s claim does not implicate a constitutional question, nor does it present other questions of interpretation that reach well beyond \xe2\x80\x9cthis section\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of scope and impact.  Rather, Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that Garmin\xe2\x80\x99s petition did not plead \xe2\x80\x9cwith particularity\xe2\x80\x9d the challenge to claims 10 and 14 as required by \xc2\xa7312 is little more than a challenge to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion under \xc2\xa7314(a) that the \xe2\x80\x9cinformation presented in the petition\xe2\x80\x9d warranted review.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The Patent Office regulation requiring the Board to apply the broadest reasonable construction standard to interpret patent claims is a reasonable exercise of the rulemaking authority granted to the Patent Office by statute.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Where a statute leaves a gap or is ambiguous, this Court typically interprets a congressional grant of rulemaking authority as giving the agency leeway to enact rules that are reasonable in light of the text, nature, and purpose of the statute.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mead Corp.</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n; <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n\xe2\x80\x93843.  Here, the statute grants the Patent Office the authority to issue regulations \xe2\x80\x9cgoverning inter partes review,\xe2\x80\x9d and no statutory provision unambiguously mandates a particular claim construction standard.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s rulemaking authority is not limited to procedural regulations.  Analogies to interpretations of other congressional grants of rulemaking authority in other statutes, which themselves do not unambiguously contain a limitation to procedural rules, cannot magically render unambiguous the different language in the different statutory grant of rulemaking authority at issue.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The nature and purpose of inter partes review does not unambiguously require the Patent Office to apply one particular claim construction standard.  Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the purpose of inter partes review\xe2\x80\x94to establish trial-like procedures for reviewing previously issued patents\xe2\x80\x94supports the application of the ordinary meaning standard ignores the fact that in other significant respects, inter partes review is less like a judicial proceeding and more like a specialized agency proceeding.  This indicates that Congress designed a hybrid proceeding.  The purpose of inter partes review is not only to resolve patent-related disputes among parties, but also to protect the public\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cparamount interest in seeing that patent monopolies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are kept within their legitimate scope.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Precision Instrument Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co.</i>,\n\n324 U.\xc2\xa0S. 806\n.  Neither the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, nor its purpose, nor its legislative history suggests that Congress decided what standard should apply in inter partes review.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The regulation is a reasonable exercise of the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s rulemaking authority.  The broadest reasonable construction standard helps ensure precision in drafting claims and prevents a patent from tying up too much knowledge, which, in turn, helps members of the public draw useful information from the disclosed invention and understand the lawful limits of the claim.  The Patent Office has used this standard for more than 100 years and has applied it in proceedings which, as here, resemble district court litigation.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s two arguments in response are unavailing.  Applying the broadest reasonable construction standard in inter partes review is not, as Cuozzo suggests, unfair to a patent holder, who may move to amend at least once in the review process, and who has had several opportunities to amend in the original application process.  And though the application of one standard in inter partes review and another in district court proceedings may produce inconsistent outcomes, that structure is inherent to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory design, and it is also consistent with past practice, as the patent system has long provided different tracks for the review and adjudication of patent claims.  The Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s regulation is reasonable, and this Court does not decide whether a better alternative exists as a matter of policy.

We also conclude that the second provision authorizes the Patent Office to issue the regulation before us.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Mead Corp.</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218,\n229 (2001)\n; <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A.

A patent examiner with expertise in the relevant field reviews an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s patent claims, considers the prior art, and determines whether each claim meets the applicable patent law requirements.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101, 102, 103, 112.  Then, the examiner accepts a claim, or rejects it and explains why.  See \xc2\xa7132(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the examiner rejects a claim, the applicant can resubmit a narrowed (or otherwise modified) claim, which the examiner will consider anew, measuring the new claim against the same patent law requirements.  If the exam-iner rejects the new claim, the inventor typically has yet another chance to respond with yet another amended claim.  Ultimately, the Patent Office makes a final decision allowing or rejecting the application.  The applicant may seek judicial review of any final rejection.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7141(a), 145.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For several decades, the Patent Office has also possessed the authority to reexamine\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps cancel\xe2\x80\x94a patent claim that it had previously allowed.  In 1980, for example, Congress enacted a statute providing for \xe2\x80\x9cex parte reexamination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act to Amend the Patent and Trademark Laws,\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7301 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.  </i>That statute (which remains in effect) gives \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person at any time\xe2\x80\x9d the right to \xe2\x80\x9cfile a request for reexamination\xe2\x80\x9d on the basis of certain prior art \xe2\x80\x9cbearing on the patentability\xe2\x80\x9d of an already-issued patent.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301(a)(1), 302.  If the Patent Office concludes that the cited prior art raises \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial new question of patentability,\xe2\x80\x9d the agency can reexamine the patent.  \xc2\xa7303(a).  And that reexamination can lead the Patent Office to cancel the patent (or some of its claims).  Alternatively, the Director of the Patent Office can, on her \xe2\x80\x9cown initiative,\xe2\x80\x9d trigger such a proceeding.  <i>Ibid</i>.  And, as with examination, the patent holder can seek judicial review of an adverse final decision.  \xc2\xa7306.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1999 and 2002, Congress enacted statutes that established another, similar procedure, known as \xe2\x80\x9cinter partes <i>reexamination</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Those statutes granted third parties greater opportunities to participate in the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s reexamination proceedings as well as in any appeal of a Patent Office decision.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> American Inventors Protection Act of 1999, \xc2\xa7297 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq. </i>(2006 ed.) (superseded).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2011, Congress enacted the statute before us.

Like inter partes reexamination<i>, </i>any third party can ask the agency to initiate inter partes review of a patent claim.  But the new statute has changed the standard that governs the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s institution of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s process. Instead of requiring that a request for reexamination raise a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial new question of patentability,\xe2\x80\x9d it now requires that a petition show \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable likelihood that\xe2\x80\x9d the challenger \xe2\x80\x9cwould prevail.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare \xc2\xa7312(a) (2006 ed.) (repealed) with \xc2\xa7314(a) (2012 ed.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The new statute provides a challenger with broader participation rights.  It creates within the Patent Office a Patent Trial and Appeal Board (Board) composed of administrative patent judges, who are patent lawyers and former patent examiners, among others.  \xc2\xa76.  That Board conducts the proceedings, reaches a conclusion, and sets forth its reasons.  See <i>ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statute sets forth time limits for completing this review.  \xc2\xa7316(a)(11).  It grants the Patent Office the authority to issue rules.  \xc2\xa7316(a)(4).  Like its predecessors, the statute authorizes judicial review of a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal written decision\xe2\x80\x9d canceling a patent claim.  \xc2\xa7319.  And, the statute says that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s initial decision \xe2\x80\x9cwhether to institute an inter partes review\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cfinal and nonappealable.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7314(d); compare <i>ibid.</i> with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7312(a), (c) (2006 ed.)(repealed) (the \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination\xe2\x80\x9d that a petition forinter partes reexamination \xe2\x80\x9craise[s]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial new question of patentability\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cfinal and non-appealable\xe2\x80\x9d), and \xc2\xa7303(c) (2012 ed.)

Cuozzo applied for a patent covering a speedometer that will show a driver when he is driving above the speed limit.  To understand the basic idea, think of the fact that a white speedometer needle will look red when it passes under a translucent piece of red glass or the equivalent (say, red cellophane).  If you attach a piece of red glass or red cellophane to a speedometer beginning at 65 miles per hour, then, when the white needle passes that point, it will look red.  If we attach the red glass to a plate that can itself rotate, if we attach the plate to the speedometer, if we connect the plate to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and if we enter onto a chip or a disk all the speed limits on all the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s roads, then the GPS can signal where the car is, the chip or disk can signal the speed limit at that place, and the plate can rotate to the right number on the speedometer.  Thus, if the speed limit is 35 miles per hour, then the white speedometer needle will pass under the red plate at 35, not 65, and the driver will know if he is driving too fast.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2004, the Patent Office granted the patent.

Anyone, the Board reasoned, who is \xe2\x80\x9cnot an automaton\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94anyone with \xe2\x80\x9cordinary skill\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cordinary creativity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94could have taken the automated approach suggested by the Aumayer patent and applied it to the manually adjustable signals described in the Evans and Wendt patents.  <i>Id.,</i> at 147a.  The Board also concluded that Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s proposed amendments would not cure this defect, <i>id.,</i> at 164a\xe2\x80\x93166a, and it consequently denied Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s motion to amend its claims.  Ultimately, it ordered claims 10, 14, and 17 of the Cuozzo Patent canceled, <i>id.</i>, at 166a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cuozzo appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  Cuozzo argued that the Patent Office improperly instituted inter partes review, at least in respect to claims 10 and 14, because the agency found that Garmin had only <i>implicitly</i> challenged those two claims on the basis of the Aumayer, Evans, and Wendt patents, while the statute required petitions to set forth the grounds for challenge \xe2\x80\x9cwith particularity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7312(a)(3).  Cuozzo also argued that the Board, when construing the claims, improperly used the interpretive standard set forth in the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s regulation (<i>i.e.</i>, it gave those claims their \xe2\x80\x9cbroadest reasonable construction,\xe2\x80\x9d 37 CFR \xc2\xa742.100(b)), when it should have applied the standard that courts normally use when judging a patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity (<i>i.e.</i>, it should have given those claims their \xe2\x80\x9cordinary meaning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as understood by a person of skill in the art,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Phillips</i> v. <i>AWH Corp.</i>, 415 F.\xc2\xa03d 1303, 1314 (CA Fed. 2005)(en banc)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals rejected both arguments.  First, the panel majority pointed out that\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7314(d) made the decision to institute inter partes review \xe2\x80\x9cnonappealable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC</i>,<i> </i>793 F.\xc2\xa03d 1268, 1273 (CA Fed. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Second, the panel majority affirmed the application of the broadest reasonable construction standard on the ground (among others) that the regulation was a reasonable, and hence lawful, exercise of the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s statutorily granted rulemaking authority.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1278\xe2\x80\x931279; see \xc2\xa7314(a)(4).  By a vote of 6 to 5, the Court of Appeals denied Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s petition for rehearing en banc.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC</i>, 793 F.\xc2\xa03d 1297, 1298 (CA Fed. 2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari to review these two questions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Like the Court of Appeals, we believe that Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the Patent Office unlawfully initiated its agency review is not appealable.  For one thing, that is what \xc2\xa7314(d) says.  It states that the \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination by the [Patent Office] whether to institute an inter partes<i> </i>review under this section shall be <i>final and</i> <i>nonappealable.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For another, the legal dispute at issue is an ordinary dispute about the application of certain relevant patent statutes concerning the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s decision to institute inter partes review.  Cuozzo points to a related statutory section, \xc2\xa7312, which says that petitions must be pleaded \xe2\x80\x9cwith particularity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Those words, in its view, mean that the petition should have specifically said that claims 10 and 14 are also obvious in light of this same prior art.  Garmin\xe2\x80\x99s petition, the Government replies, need not have mentioned claims 10 and 14 separately, for claims 10, 14, and 17 are all logically linked; the claims \xe2\x80\x9crise and fall together,\xe2\x80\x9d and a petition need not simply repeat the same argument expressly when it is so obviously implied.  See 793 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1281.  In our view, the \xe2\x80\x9cNo Appeal\xe2\x80\x9d provision\xe2\x80\x99s language must, at the least, forbid an appeal that attacks a \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whether to institute\xe2\x80\x9d review by raising this kind of legal question and little more.  \xc2\xa7314(d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, a contrary holding would undercut one important congressional objective, namely, giving the Patent Office significant power to revisit and revise earlier patent grants.  See H. R. Rep., at 45, 48 (explaining that the statute seeks to \xe2\x80\x9cimprove patent quality and restore confidence in the presumption of validity that comes with issued patents\xe2\x80\x9d); 157 Cong. Rec. 9778 (2011) (remarks of Rep. Goodlatte) (noting that inter partes review \xe2\x80\x9cscreen[s] out bad patents while bolstering valid ones\xe2\x80\x9d).  We doubt that Congress would have granted the Patent Office this authority, including, for example, the ability to continue proceedings even after the original petitioner settles and drops out, \xc2\xa7317(a), if it had thought that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s final decision could be unwound under some minor statutory technicality related to its preliminary decision to institute inter partes review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Further, the existence of similar provisions in this, and related, patent statutes reinforces our conclusion.  See \xc2\xa7319 (limiting appellate review to the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal written decision\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7312(c) (2006 ed.)

We cannot accept this interpretation.  It reads into the provision a limitation (to interlocutory decisions) that the language nowhere mentions and that is unnecessary.  The Administrative Procedure Act already limits review to final agency decisions.\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7704.  The Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s decision to initiate inter partes review is \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cfinal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  And the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny a petition is a matter committed to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  See \xc2\xa7701(a)(2);\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7314(a) (no mandate to institute review); see also <i>post, </i>at 9, and n.\xc2\xa06.  So, read as limited to such preliminary and discretionary decisions, the \xe2\x80\x9cNo Appeal\xe2\x80\x9d provision would seem superfluous.  The dissent also suggests that its approach is a \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar practice,\xe2\x80\x9d consistent with other areas of law.  <i>Post</i>, at 8.  But the kind of initial determination at issue here\xe2\x80\x94that there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d that the claims are unpatentable on the grounds asserted\xe2\x80\x94is akin to decisions which, in other contexts, we have held to be unreviewable.  See <i>Kaley</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe grand jury gets to say\xe2\x80\x94without any review, oversight, or second-guessing\xe2\x80\x94whether probable cause exists to think that a person committed a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We recognize the \xe2\x80\x9cstrong presumption\xe2\x80\x9d in favor of judicial review that we apply when we interpret statutes, including statutes that may limit or preclude review.  <i>Mach Mining, LLC </i>v. <i>EEOC</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This presumption, however, may be overcome by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clear and convincing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d indications, drawn from \xe2\x80\x9cspecific language,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cspecific legislative history,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended to bar review.  <i>Block</i> v. <i>Community Nutrition Institute</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 340\n\xe2\x80\x93350 (1984).  That standard is met here.  The dissent disagrees, and it points to <i>Lindahl</i> v. <i>Office of Personnel Management</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 768 (1985)\n, to support its view that, in light of this presumption, \xc2\xa7314(d) should be read to permit judicial review of any issue bearing on the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary decision to institute inter partes review.  See <i>post</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  <i>Lindahl</i> is a case about the judicial review of disability determinations for federal employees.  We explained that a statute directing the Office of Personnel Management to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98determine questions of disability,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and making those decisions \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98final,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conclusive,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not subject to review,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d barred a court from revisiting the \xe2\x80\x9cfactual underpinnings of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. disability determinations\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94though it permitted courts to consider claims alleging, for example, that the Office of Personnel Management \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial[ly] depart[ed] from important procedural rights.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 771, 791.  Thus, <i>Lindahl</i>\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of that statute preserved the agency\xe2\x80\x99s primacy over its core statutory function in accord with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  Our interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9cNo Appeal\xe2\x80\x9d provision here has the same effect.  Congress has told the <i>Patent Office</i> to determine whether inter partes review should proceed, and it has made the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnonappealable.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7314(d).  Our conclusion that courts may not revisit this initial determination gives effect to this statutory command.  Moreover, <i>Lindahl</i>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion was consistent with prior judicial practice in respect to those factual agency determinations, and legislative history \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly suggest[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended to preserve this prior practice.  <i>Id.,</i> at 780.  These features, as explained above, also support our interpretation: The text of the \xe2\x80\x9cNo Appeal\xe2\x80\x9d provision, along with its place in the overall statutory scheme, its role alongside the Administrative Procedure Act, the prior interpretation of similar patent statutes, and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose in crafting inter partes review, all point in favor of precluding review of the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s institution decisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nevertheless, in light of \xc2\xa7314(d)\xe2\x80\x99s own text and the presumption favoring review, we emphasize that our interpretation applies where the grounds for attacking the decision to institute inter partes review consist of questions that are closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s decision to initiate inter partes review.  See \xc2\xa7314(d) (barring appeals of \xe2\x80\x9cdeterminations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to initiate an inter partes review <i>under this section</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  This means that we need not, and do not, decide the precise effect of \xc2\xa7314(d) on appeals that implicate constitutional questions, that depend on other less closely related statutes, or that present other questions of interpretation that reach, in terms of scope and impact, well beyond \xe2\x80\x9cthis section.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Robison</i>,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 361,\n367 (1974)\n (statute precluding review of \xe2\x80\x9cany question of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans\xe2\x80\x99 Administration\xe2\x80\x9d does not bar review of constitutional challenges (emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Traynor</i> v. <i>Turnage</i>,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 535\n\xe2\x80\x93545 (1988) (that same statute does not bar review of decisions made under different statutes enacted at other times).  Thus, contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, we do not categorically preclude review of a final decision where a petition fails to give \xe2\x80\x9csufficient notice\xe2\x80\x9d such that there is a due process problem with the entire proceeding, nor does our interpretation enable the agency to act outside its statutory limits by, for example, canceling a patent claim for \xe2\x80\x9cindefiniteness under \xc2\xa7112\xe2\x80\x9d in inter partes review.  <i>Post</i>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9313.  Such \xe2\x80\x9cshenanigans\xe2\x80\x9d may be properly reviewable in the context of \xc2\xa7319 and under the Administrative Procedure Act, which enables reviewing courts to \xe2\x80\x9cset aside agency action\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to constitutional right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin excess of statutory jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary [and] capricious.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare <i>post</i>, at 13, with 5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7706(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(D).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By contrast, where a patent holder merely challenges the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdetermin[ation] that the information presented in the petition .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shows that there is a reasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d of success \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7314(a), or where a patent holder grounds its claim in a statute closely related to that decision to institute inter partes review, \xc2\xa7314(d) bars judicial review.  In this case, Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Garmin\xe2\x80\x99s petition was not pleaded \xe2\x80\x9cwith particularity\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7312 is little more than a challenge to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, under \xc2\xa7314(a), that the \xe2\x80\x9cinformation presented in the petition\xe2\x80\x9d warranted review.  Cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Williams</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36,\n54 (1992)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cA complaint about the quality or adequacy of the evidence can always be recast as a complaint that the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. presentation was \xe2\x80\x98incomplete\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98misleading\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  We therefore conclude that \xc2\xa7314(d) bars Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to attack the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s determination to institute inter partes review in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Cuozzo further argues that the Patent Office lacked the legal authority to issue its regulation requiring the agency, when conducting an inter partes<i> </i>review, to give apatent claim \xe2\x80\x9cits broadest reasonable construction in light of the specification of the patent in which it appears.\xe2\x80\x9d  37 CFR \xc2\xa742.100(b).  Instead, Cuozzo contends that the Patent Office should, like the courts, give claims their \xe2\x80\x9cordinary meaning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as understood by a person of skill in the art.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Phillips</i>, 415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1314.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statute, however, contains a provision that grants the Patent Office authority to issue \xe2\x80\x9cregulations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. establishing and governing inter partes review under this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7316(a)(4).  The Court of Appeals held that this statute gives the Patent Office the legal author-ity to issue its broadest reasonable construction regulation.  We agree.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We interpret Congress\xe2\x80\x99 grant of rulemaking authority in light of our decision in <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n.  Where a statute is clear, the agency must follow the statute.  <i>Id.,</i> at 842\xe2\x80\x93843.  But where a statute leaves a \xe2\x80\x9cgap\xe2\x80\x9d or is \xe2\x80\x9cambigu[ous],\xe2\x80\x9d we typically interpret it as granting the agency leeway to enact rules that are reasonable in light of the text, nature, and purpose of the statute.  <i>Mead Corp.</i>, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 229; <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 843.  The statute contains such a gap: No statutory provision unambiguously directs the agency to use one standard or the other.  And the statute \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[ly] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. authoriz[es] [the Patent Office] to engage in the process of rulemaking\xe2\x80\x9d to address that gap.  <i>Mead Corp.</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 229.  Indeed, the statute allows the Patent Office to issue rules \xe2\x80\x9cgoverning inter partes review,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7316(a)(4), and the broadest reasonable construction regulation is a rule that governs inter partes review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Both the dissenting judges in the Court of Appeals and Cuozzo believe that other ordinary tools of statutory interpretation, <i>INS</i> v. <i>Cardoza-Fonseca</i>,\n\n480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 421\n, and n.\xc2\xa012 (1987), lead to a different conclusion.  The dissenters, for example, point to cases in which the Circuit interpreted a grant of rulemaking authority in a different statute, \xc2\xa72(b)(2)(A), as limited to <i>procedural </i>rules.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Cooper Technologies Co.</i> v. <i>Dudas</i>, 536 F.\xc2\xa03d 1330, 1335 (CA Fed. 2008).  These cases, however, as we just said, interpret a different statute. That statute does not clearly contain the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s claimed limitation, nor is its language the same as that of \xc2\xa7316(a)(4).  Section 2(b)(2)(A) grants the Patent Office authority to issue \xe2\x80\x9cregulations\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhich .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall govern .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>proceedings in the Office</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  (emphasis added), but<i> </i>the statute before us, \xc2\xa7316(a)(4), does not refer to \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it refers more broadly to regulations \xe2\x80\x9cestablishing and governing inter partes review.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s prior interpretation of \xc2\xa72(b)(2)(A) cannot magically render unambiguous the different language in the different statute before us.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cuozzo and its supporting <i>amici</i> believe we will reach a different conclusion if we carefully examine the purpose of inter partes review.  That purpose, in their view, is to modify the previous reexamination procedures and to replace them with a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98trial, adjudicatory in nature.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 26 (quoting <i>Google Inc.</i> v. <i>Jongerius Panoramic Techs., LLC</i>, IPR 2013\xe2\x80\x9300191, Paper No. 50, p.\xc2\xa04 (PTAB, Feb. 13, 2014))).  They point out that, under the statute, an opposing party can trigger inter partes review.  Parties can engage in \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery of relevant evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cdeposition[s], .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. affidavits or declarations\xe2\x80\x9d as well as anything \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise necessary in the interest of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7316(a)(5).  Parties may present \xe2\x80\x9cfactual evidence and expert opinions\xe2\x80\x9d to support their arguments.  \xc2\xa7316(a)(8).  The challenger bears the burden of proving unpatentability.  \xc2\xa7318(e).  And, after oral argument before a panel of three of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s administrative patent judges, it issues a final written decision.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76, 316(a)(10), 318.  Perhaps most importantly, a decision to cancel a patent normally has the same effect as a district court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of a patent\xe2\x80\x99s invalidity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of these adjudicatory characteristics, which make these agency proceedings similar to court proceedings, Congress, in Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s view, must have designed inter partes review as a \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate for court proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 28.  Cuozzo points to various sources of legislative history in support of its argument.  See H. R.

Rep. No.110\xe2\x80\x93259, p. 20 (2008) (Inter partes review is \xe2\x80\x9ca quick, inexpensive, and reliable alternative to district court litigation\xe2\x80\x9d); 157 Cong. Rec. 3429\xe2\x80\x933430 (2011) (remarks of Sen. Kyl) (\xe2\x80\x9cAmong the reforms that are expected to expedite these proceedings [is] the shift from an examinational to an adjudicative model\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, if Congress intended to create a \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate\xe2\x80\x9d for court proceedings, why would Congress not also have intended the agency to use the claim construction standard that district courts apply (namely, the ordinary meaning standard), rather than the claim construction standard that patent examiners apply (namely, the broadest reasonable construction standard)?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The problem with Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s argument, however, is that, in other significant respects, inter partes review is less like a judicial proceeding and more like a specialized agency proceeding. Parties that initiate the proceeding need not have a concrete stake in the outcome; indeed, they may lack constitutional standing.  See \xc2\xa7311(a); cf. <i>Consumer Watchdog</i> v. <i>Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation</i>, 753 F.\xc2\xa03d 1258, 1261\xe2\x80\x931262 (CA Fed. 2014).  As explained above, challengers need not remain in the proceeding; rather, the Patent Office may continue to conduct an inter partes review even after the adverse party has settled.  \xc2\xa7317(a).  Moreover, as is the case here, the Patent Office may intervene in a later <i>judicial</i> proceeding to defend its decision\xe2\x80\x94even if the private challengers drop out.  And the burden of proof in inter partes review is different than in the district courts: In inter partes review, the challenger (or the Patent Office) must establish unpatentability \xe2\x80\x9cby a preponderance of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d; in district court, a challenger must prove invalidity by \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare \xc2\xa7316(e) with <i>Microsoft Corp.</i> v. <i>i4i Ltd. Partnership</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 91,\n95 (2011)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Most importantly, these features, as well as inter partes review\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors, indicate that the purpose of the proceeding is not quite the same as the purpose of district court litigation.  The proceeding involves what used to be called a <i>reexamination </i>(and, as noted above, a cousin of inter partes review, ex parte<i> </i>reexamination,\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7302 <i>et seq.</i>, still bears that name).  The name and accompanying procedures suggest that the proceeding offers a second look at an earlier administrative grant of a patent.  Although Congress changed the name from \xe2\x80\x9creexamination\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9creview,\xe2\x80\x9d nothing convinces us that, in doing so, Congress wanted to change its basic purposes, namely, to reexamine an earlier agency decision.  Thus, in addition to helping resolve concrete patent-related disputes among parties, inter partes review helps protect the public\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cparamount interest in seeing that patent monopolies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are kept within their legitimate scope.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Precision Instrument Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co.</i>,\n\n324 U.\xc2\xa0S. 806,\n816 (1945)\n; see H. R. Rep., at 39\xe2\x80\x9340 (Inter partes review is an \xe2\x80\x9cefficient system for challenging patents that should not have issued\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, neither the statutory language, its purpose, or its history suggest that Congress considered what standard the agency should apply when reviewing a patent claim in inter partes review.  Cuozzo contends that \xc2\xa7301(d), explaining that the Patent Office should \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine the proper meaning of a patent claim,\xe2\x80\x9d reinforces its conclusion that the ordinary meaning standard should apply.  But viewed against a background of language and practices indicating that Congress designed a hybrid proceeding, \xc2\xa7301(d)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cproper meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of a claim is ambiguous.  It leaves open the question of which claim construction standard is \xe2\x80\x9cproper.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is, whether we look at statutory language alone, or that language in context of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, we find an express delegation of rulemaking authority, a \xe2\x80\x9cgap\xe2\x80\x9d that rules might fill, and \xe2\x80\x9cambiguity\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to the boundaries of that gap.  <i>Mead Corp.</i>, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 229; see <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i>, 467 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 843.  We consequently turn to the question whether the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s regulation is a reasonable exercise of its rulemakingauthority.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We conclude that the regulation represents a reasonable exercise of the rulemaking authority that Congress delegated to the Patent Office.  For one thing, construing a patent claim according to its broadest reasonable construction helps to protect the public.  A reasonable, yet unlawfully broad claim might discourage the use of the invention by a member of the public.  Because an exam-iner\xe2\x80\x99s (or reexaminer\xe2\x80\x99s) use of the broadest reasonable construction standard increases the possibility that the examiner will find the claim too broad (and deny it), use of that standard encourages the applicant to draft narrowly.  This helps ensure precision while avoiding overly broad claims, and thereby helps prevent a patent from tying up too much knowledge, while helping members of the public draw useful information from the disclosed invention and better understand the lawful limits of the claim.  See \xc2\xa7112(a); <i>Nautilus, Inc.</i> v. <i>Biosig Instruments, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 10); see also <i>In\xc2\xa0re Yamamoto</i>, 740 F.\xc2\xa02d 1569, 1571 (CA Fed. 1984).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For another, past practice supports the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s regulation.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 48697 (2012).  The Patent Office has used this standard for more than 100 years.  793 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1276.  It has applied that standard in proceedings, which, as here, resemble district court litigation.  See <i>Bamberger</i> v. <i>Cheruvu</i>, 55 USPQ 2d 1523, 1527 (BPAI 1998) (broadest reasonable construction standard applies in interference proceedings); Brief for Generic Pharmaceutical Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7\xe2\x80\x9316 (describing similarities between interference proceedings and adjudicatory aspects of inter partes review); see also <i>In re</i> <i>Yamamoto</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 1571 (broadest reasonable construction standard applies in reexamination).  It also applies that standard in proceedings that may be consolidated with a concurrent inter partes review.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 48697\xe2\x80\x9348698.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cuozzo makes two arguments in response.  First, Cuozzo says that there is a critical difference between the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s initial <i>examination</i> of an application to determine if a patent should issue, and this proceeding, in which the agency <i>reviews</i> an already-issued patent.  In an initial examination of an application for a patent the examiner gives the claim its broadest reasonable construction.  But if the patent examiner rejects the claim, then, as described above, Part I\xe2\x80\x93A, <i>supra</i>, the applicant has a right to amend and resubmit the claim.  And the examiner and applicant may repeat this process at least once more.  This system\xe2\x80\x94broad construction with a chance to amend\xe2\x80\x94both protects the public from overly broad claims and gives the applicant a fair chance to draft a precise claim that will qualify for patent protection.  In inter partes review, however, the broadest reasonable construction standard may help protect certain public interests, but there is no absolute right to amend any challenged patent claims.  This, Cuozzo says, is unfair to the patent holder.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The process however, is not as unfair as Cuozzo suggests.  The patent holder may, at least once in the process, make a motion to do just what he would do in the examination process, namely, amend or narrow the claim.  \xc2\xa7316(d) (2012 ed.).  This opportunity to amend, together with the fact that the original application process may have presented several additional opportunities to amend the patent, means that use of the broadest reasonable construction standard is, as a general matter, not unfair to the patent holder in any obvious way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cuozzo adds that, as of June 30, 2015, only 5 out of 86 motions to amend have been granted.  Brief for Petitioner 30; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 30 (noting that a sixth motion had been granted by the time of oral argument in this case).  But these numbers may reflect the fact that no amendment could save the inventions at issue, <i>i.e.</i>, that the patent should have never issued at all.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To the extent Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s statistical argument takes aim at the manner in which the Patent Office has exercised its authority, that question is not before us.  Indeed, in this particular case, the agency determined that Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s proposed amendment \xe2\x80\x9cenlarge[d],\xe2\x80\x9d rather than narrowed, the challenged claims.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 165a\xe2\x80\x93166a; see \xc2\xa7316(d)(3).  Cuozzo does not contend that the decision not to allow its amendment is \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccapricious,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise [un]lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, Cuozzo says that the use of the broadest reasonable construction standard in inter partes review, together with use of an ordinary meaning standard in district court, may produce inconsistent results and cause added confusion.  A district court may find a patent claim to be valid, and the agency may later cancel that claim in its own review.  We recognize that that is so.  This possibility, however, has long been present in our patent system, which provides different tracks\xe2\x80\x94one in the Patent Office and one in the courts\xe2\x80\x94for the review and adjudication of patent claims.  As we have explained above, inter partes review imposes a different burden of proof on the challenger.  These different evidentiary burdens mean that the possibility of inconsistent results is inherent to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory design.  Cf. <i>One Lot Emerald Cut Stones</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n409 U.\xc2\xa0S. 232\n\xe2\x80\x93238 (1972) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, the Patent Office uses the broadest reasonable construction standard in other proceedings, including interference proceedings (described above), which may implicate patents that are later reviewed in district court.  The statute gives the Patent Office the power to consolidate these other proceedings with inter partes review.  To try to create uniformity of standards would consequently prove difficult.  And we cannot find unreasonable the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s decision to prefer a degree of inconsistency in the standards used between the courts and the agency, rather than among agency proceedings.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 48697\xe2\x80\x9348698.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, Cuozzo and its supporting <i>amici</i> offer various policy arguments in favor of the ordinary meaning standard.  The Patent Office is legally free to accept or reject such policy arguments on the basis of its own reasoned analysis.  Having concluded that the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s regulation, selecting the broadest reasonable construction standard, is reasonable in light of the rationales described above, we do not decide whether there is a better alternative as a policy matter.  That is a question that Congress left to the particular expertise of the Patent Office.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal">APPENDIX</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal"><b>SPEED LIMIT INDICATOR AND METHOD FOR DISPLAYING SPEED AND THE RELEVANT SPEED LIMIT</b></p>\n<p style="p-H1"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal">Figure 1</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-H2"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal">Figure 4</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-Normal">DESCRIPTION OF THE CURRENT EMBODIMENT</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\xe2\x80\x9cIn FIG. <b>1</b>, a new and improved speed limit indicator and method for displaying speed and the relevant speed limit <b>10</b> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is illustrated .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

A petition for inter partes review \xe2\x80\x9cmay be considered only if\xe2\x80\x9d the petition satisfies certain requirements, including (as relevant here) that the petition \xe2\x80\x9cidentif[y], in writing and with particularity, each claim challenged, the grounds on which the challenge to each claim is based, and the evidence that supports the grounds for the challenge to each claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7312(a)(3).  Additionally, \xe2\x80\x9cinter partes review may not be instituted\xe2\x80\x9d if the party challenging the patent previously filed a civil action challenging the patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity or was sued for infringing the patent more than a year before seeking inter partes review.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7315(a)(1), (b).

After trial, the Patent Office issued a final written decision holding those claims unpatentable, and Cuozzo appealed that decision to the Federal Circuit.

This Court now affirms.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I disagree.  We have long recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress rarely intends to prevent courts from enforcing its directives to federal agencies.

The statute at issue there provided that agency \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98decisions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. concerning [questions of disability and dependency] are final and conclusive and are not subject to review.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 771.  The Federal Circuit concluded that the statute cut off all judicial review of such decisions, stating that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]t is difficult to conceive of a more clear-cut statement of congressional intent to preclude review than one in which the concept of finality is thrice repeated in a single sentence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 779.  We reversed.

We observed that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen Congress intends to bar judicial review altogether, it typically employs language far more unambiguous and comprehensive,\xe2\x80\x9d giving as an example a statute that made an agency decision \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law or fact\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not subject to review by another official of the United States or by a court by mandamus or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 779\xe2\x80\x93780, and n.\xc2\xa013.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This is a far easier case than <i>Lindahl</i>.  There is no question that the statute now before us can naturally\xe2\x80\x94perhaps most naturally\xe2\x80\x94be read to permit judicial review of issues bearing on the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s institution of inter partes review.  Section 314(d) reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe determination by the Director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike the statutes we addressed in <i>Lindahl </i>(including the one we found to permit review), \xc2\xa7314(d) does not say that an institution decision is \xe2\x80\x9cnot subject to review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, it makes the institution decision \xe2\x80\x9cnonappealable.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is fairly interpreted to bar only an <i>appeal</i> from the in-stitution decision itself, while allowing <i>review</i> of institution-related issues in an appeal from the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99sfinal written decision at the end of the proceeding.  See \xc2\xa7319.  Our cases have used the term \xe2\x80\x9cnonappealable\xe2\x80\x9d in just this way\xe2\x80\x94to refer to matters that are not <i>immediately</i> or <i>independently</i> appealable, but which are subject to review at a later point.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Thus, while the decision to institute inter partes review is \xe2\x80\x9cfinal and nonappealable\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that a court cannot stop the proceeding from going forward,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>] the question whether it was lawful to institute review will not escape judicial scrutiny.  This approach is consistent with the normal rule that a party may challenge earlier agency rulings that are themselves \xe2\x80\x9cnot directly reviewable\xe2\x80\x9d when seeking review of a final, appealable decision.\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7704.  And it strikes a sensible balance: The Patent Office may proceed unimpeded with the inter partes review process (which must normally be completed within one year, see\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7316(a)(11)), but it will be held to account for its compliance with the law at the end of the day.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In rejecting this commonsense interpretation, the Court gives short shrift to the presumption in favor of judicial review.  Its primary reason for disregarding the presumption reduces to an assertion\xe2\x80\x94devoid of any textual analysis\xe2\x80\x94that <i>surely</i> \xc2\xa7314(d) must bar review of legal questions related to institution decisions.  <i>Ante,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  As Ihave explained, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text does not require that conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moving (further) away from the statutory text, the Court next objects that allowing judicial review \xe2\x80\x9cwould undercut one important congressional objective, namely, giving the Patent Office significant power to revisit and revise earlier patent grants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8.  I am not sure that the Court appreciates how remarkable this assertion is.  It would give us cause to do away with judicial review whenever<i> </i>we think that review makes it harder for an agency to carry out important work.  In any event, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s logic is flawed.  Judicial review enforces the limits that<i> Congress </i>has imposed<i> </i>on the agency\xe2\x80\x99s power.<i> </i>It thus serves to buttress, not \xe2\x80\x9cundercut,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.  By asserting otherwise, the majority loses sight of the principle that \xe2\x80\x9cno legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rodriguez</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522, 525\xe2\x80\x93526 (1987) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).  \xe2\x80\x9cEvery statute pur-poses, not only to achieve certain ends, but also to achieve them by particular means\xe2\x80\x94and there is often a consider-able legislative battle over what those means ought to be.  The withholding of agency authority is as significant as the granting of it, and we have no right to play favorites between the two.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Director, Office of Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Programs</i> v. <i>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 122,\n136 (1995)\n.  The inter partes review statute is no exception.  It empowers the Patent Office to clean up bad patents, but it expressly forbids the Patent Office to institute inter partes review\xe2\x80\x94or even consider petitions for inter partes review\xe2\x80\x94unless certain conditions are satisfied.  Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress wanted to improve patent quality at the cost of fidelity to the law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court also observes that the inter partes review appeal provision, \xc2\xa7319, \xe2\x80\x9climit[s] appellate review to the \xe2\x80\x98final written decision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8.  The majority reads too much into this provision.  Section 319 provides simply that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] party dissatisfied with the final written decision .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may appeal the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute does not restrict the issues that may be raised in such an appeal.  As the Patent Office once explained (before having a change of heart), the \xe2\x80\x9cplain language of the statutory text\xe2\x80\x9d recognizes a \xe2\x80\x9cright of judicial review .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for any party \xe2\x80\x98dissatisfied\xe2\x80\x99by the [Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s] ultimate \xe2\x80\x98written [decision],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the statutory scheme limits the reasons that a party might be so \xe2\x80\x98dissatisfied.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Motion to Dismiss in <i>Versata Development Group, Inc. </i>v. <i>Rea</i>, Civ. Action No. 1:13cv328 (ED Va., May 16, 2013), p.\xc2\xa016.  A party may be dissatisfied with a final written decision in an inter partes review because the Patent Office lacked authority to institute the proceeding in the first place, or because the Office committed some other error in the lead-up to its final decision.  Neither \xc2\xa7314(d) nor \xc2\xa7319 prevents a party from pressing such issues on an appeal from the final decision.  This is familiar practice under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291, which similarly limits appeals to \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decisions of the district courts\xe2\x80\x9d but allows appellants to challenge earlier rulings as part of those appeals.  See <i>Quackenbush</i> v. <i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 706,\n712 (1996)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe general rule is that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered, in which claims of district court error at any stage in the litigation may be ventilated\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); 15A C.

Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa73905.1, pp.\xc2\xa0250, 252 (2d ed. 1992) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cthe general rule that an appeal from final judgment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. permits review of all rulings that led up to the judgment\xe2\x80\x9d and observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he variety of orders open to review on subsequent appeal from a final judgment is enormous\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, as noted above, judicial review of \xe2\x80\x9cfinal agency action\xe2\x80\x9d likewise encompasses earlier rulings that are \xe2\x80\x9cnot directly reviewable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7704; see <i>supra, </i>at 6.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court next contends that my interpretation renders\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7314(d) \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  Reading the statute to defer review of institution decisions is \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court says, because the \xe2\x80\x9cAdministrative Procedure Act already limits review to final agency decisions\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cdecision to initiate inter partes review is \xe2\x80\x98preliminary,\xe2\x80\x99 not \xe2\x80\x98final.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>But Congress reasonably may have thought that the matter needed clarifying, given that \xc2\xa7314(d) itself calls such a decision \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d (albeit in a different sense, see <i>supra</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936).  Language is not superfluous when it \xe2\x80\x9cremove[s] any doubt\xe2\x80\x9d about a point that might otherwise be unclear.  <i>Ali</i> v. <i>Federal Bureau of Prisons</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214,\n226 (2008)\n.  More important, my reading prevents an appeal from a decision <i>not </i>to institute inter partes review, which is plainly final agency action and so\xe2\x80\x94absent \xc2\xa7314(d)\xe2\x80\x94might otherwise trigger immediate review.  The Court asserts that this too is unnecessary because, in its view, a decision to deny inter partes review is \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted to agency discretion by law\xe2\x80\x9d and so unreviewable under normal principles of administrative law.\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7701(a)(2); see <i>ante,</i> at 9.  I agree that one can infer from the statutory scheme that the Patent Office has discretion to deny inter partes review even if a challenger satisfies the threshold requirements for review.  But the law does not say so directly and Congress may not have thought the point self-evident.  Again,\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7314(d) plays a clarifying role.  This gives the provision plenty of work to do.  There is no need to read it more broadly.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">None of this is to say that courts must\xe2\x80\x94or should\xe2\x80\x94throw out an inter partes review decision whenever there is some technical deficiency in the challenger\xe2\x80\x99s petition or in the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s institution decision.  Although \xc2\xa7314(d) does not preclude review of issues bearing on institution, normal limits on judicial review still apply.  For example, errors that do not cause a patent owner prejudice may not warrant relief.  See\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]ue account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error\xe2\x80\x9d).  Some errors may also be superseded by later developments.  Most notably, once the Patent Office issues its final written decision, the probabilistic question whether a challenger is \xe2\x80\x9creasonabl[y] likel[y]\xe2\x80\x9d to prevail on the merits,\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7314(a), will be subsumed by the ultimate question whether the challenger <i>should in fact </i>prevail.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  And while I have no occasion here to decide the matter, it may be that courts owe some degree of deference to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s application of the statutory prerequisites to inter partes review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I would leave these considerations for the Court of Appeals to address in the first instance.  But I must confess doubts that Cuozzo could ultimately prevail.  As noted above, Cuozzo argues that the Patent Office improperly granted inter partes review of claims 10 and 14 on grounds not asserted in the petition for inter partes review, in violation of the statutory requirement that a petition must state the grounds for challenge \xe2\x80\x9cwith particularity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7312(a)(3).  The problem for Cuozzo is that claim 17\xe2\x80\x94which the petition properly challenged\xe2\x80\x94incorporates all of the elements of claims 10 and 14.  Accordingly, an assertion that claim 17 is unpatentable in light of certain prior art is necessarily an assertion that claims 10 and 14 are unpatentable as well.  Assuming that Cuozzo must show prejudice from the error it alleges, it is hard to see how Cuozzo could do so here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">But any perceived weakness in the merits of Cuozzo\xe2\x80\x99s appeal does not mean that such issues are unworthy of judicial review.  Section 312(a)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s particularity requirement is designed, at least in part, to ensure that a patent owner has sufficient notice of the challenge against which it must defend.  Once inter partes review is instituted, the patent owner\xe2\x80\x99s response\xe2\x80\x94its opening brief, essentially\xe2\x80\x94is filed as an opposition to the challenger\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  See \xc2\xa7316(a)(8); 37 CFR \xc2\xa742.120.  Thus, if a petition fails to state its challenge with particularity\xe2\x80\x94or if the Patent Office institutes review on claims or grounds not raised in the petition\xe2\x80\x94the patent owner is forced to shoot into the dark.  The potential for unfairness is obvious.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other problems arise if the Patent Office fails to enforce the prohibitions against instituting inter partes review at the behest of challengers that have already sued to invalidate the patent or that were sued for infringement more than a year before seeking inter partes review.  35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7315(a)(1), (b).  Allowing such a challenge exposes the patent owner to the burden of multiplicative proceedings\xe2\x80\x94including discovery in both forums, see \xc2\xa7316(a)(5)\xe2\x80\x94while permitting the challenger to exploit inter partes review\xe2\x80\x99s lower standard of proof and more favorable claim construction standard.  Congress understandably thought that the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s power should not be wielded in this way.  Yet, according to the Court, Congress made courts powerless to correct such abuses.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even more striking are the consequences that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision portends for the AIA\xe2\x80\x99s other patent review mechanisms, post-grant review and CBM review, see <i>supra</i>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, which are<i> </i>subject to a \xe2\x80\x9cno appeal\xe2\x80\x9d provision virtually identical to \xc2\xa7314(d).  See \xc2\xa7324(e) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe determination by the Director whether to institute a post-grant review under this section shall be final and nonappealable\xe2\x80\x9d); see AIA \xc2\xa718(a)(1),\n\n125Stat.\n329, note following 35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7321, p.\xc2\xa01442 (CBM review generally \xe2\x80\x9cshall be regarded as, and shall employ the standards and procedures of, a post-grant review\xe2\x80\x9d).  Post-grant review and CBM review allow for much broader review than inter partes review.  While inter partes review is limited to assessing patent-ability under \xc2\xa7102 and \xc2\xa7103, in post-grant review and CBM review, patent claims can also be scrutinized (and canceled) on any invalidity ground that may be raised as a defense to infringement, including such grounds as ineligible subject matter under \xc2\xa7101, indefiniteness under \xc2\xa7112, and improper enlargement of reissued claims under \xc2\xa7251.  See \xc2\xa7321(b); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7282(b)(2), (3).  But this broader review comes with its own strict limits.  A petition for post-grant review must be filed within nine months after a patent is granted.  \xc2\xa7321(c).  And while CBM review is not subject to this time limit, Congress imposed a subject-matter restriction: The Patent Office \xe2\x80\x9cmay institute a [CBM review] proceeding only for a patent that is a covered business method patent,\xe2\x80\x9d which Congress defined to cover certain patents with claims relating to \xe2\x80\x9ca financial product or service.\xe2\x80\x9d  AIA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa718(a)(1)(E), (d)(1), at 1442; see \xc2\xa718(a)(1)(A), <i>ibid.</i>[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress thus crafted a three-tiered framework for Patent Office review of issued patents: broad post-grant review in a patent\xe2\x80\x99s infancy, followed by narrower inter partes review thereafter, with a limited exception for broad review of older covered business method patents.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision threatens to undermine that carefully designed scheme.  Suppose that the Patent Office instituted post-grant review on a petition filed 12 months (or even12 years) after a patent was issued, and then invalidated a patent claim as indefinite under \xc2\xa7112\xe2\x80\x94a ground available in post-grant review but not in inter partes review.  This would grossly exceed the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s authority and would be manifestly prejudicial to the patent owner.  Can Congress really have intended to shield such shenanigans from judicial scrutiny?  The Court answers with a non sequitur: Of course the Patent Office cannot cancel a patent under \xc2\xa7112 \xe2\x80\x9cin inter partes review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  The Court seems to think that we could overturn the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s decision to institute \xe2\x80\x9cpost-grant review\xe2\x80\x9d based on an untimely petition and declare that the agency has <i>really </i>instituted only \xe2\x80\x9cinter partes review.\xe2\x80\x9d  But how is that possible under today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion?  After all, the petition\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness, no less than the particularity of its allegations, is \xe2\x80\x9cclosely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s decision to initiate .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. review,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court says that such questions are unreviewable.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see \xc2\xa7321(c); \xc2\xa7312(a)(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To take things a step further, suppose that the Patent Office purported to forgive the post-grant review petition\xe2\x80\x99s tardiness by declaring the challenged patent a \xe2\x80\x9ccovered business method patent,\xe2\x80\x9d even though the patent has nothing to do with financial products or services (it claims, say, a new kind of tempered glass).  Again, this involves the application of statutes related to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s institution decision.  See AIA \xc2\xa718(a)(1)(E), at 1442 (Patent Office \xe2\x80\x9cmay institute a [CBM review] proceeding only for a patent that is a covered business method patent\xe2\x80\x9d).  So is this specious determination immune from judicial scrutiny under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If judicial review of these issues is unavailable, then nothing would prevent the Patent Office from effectively collapsing Congress\xe2\x80\x99s three-tiered review structure and subjecting all patents to broad post-grant review at all times.  Congress cannot have intended that.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I take the Court at its word that today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will not permit the Patent Office \xe2\x80\x9cto act outside its statutory limits\xe2\x80\x9d in these ways.  <i>Ante, </i>at 11.  But how to get there from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning\xe2\x80\x94and how to determine which \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory limits\xe2\x80\x9d we should enforce and which we should not\xe2\x80\x94remains a mystery.  I would avoid the suspense and hold that\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7314(d) does not bar judicial review of the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with any of the limits Congress imposed on the institution of patent review proceedings.  That includes the statutory limit, \xc2\xa7312(a)(3), that Cuozzo alleges was violated here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In enacting the AIA, Congress entrusted the Patent Office with a leading role in combating the detrimental effect that bad patents can have on innovation.

A patent challenger does not have nearly as much to lose from an erroneous <i>denial </i>of inter partes review as a patent owner stands to lose from an erroneous <i>grant </i>of inter partes review.  Although such a challenger loses some of the advantages of inter partes review (such as a more favorable claim construction standard and a lower burden of proof), it remains free to challenge the patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity in litigation.
