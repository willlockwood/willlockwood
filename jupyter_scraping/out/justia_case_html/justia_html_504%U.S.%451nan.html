Pp. 481-482.</p><p>(b) As to the second element of a \xc2\xa7 2 claim, the willful use of monopoly power, respondents have presented evidence that Kodak took exclusionary action to maintain its parts monopoly and used its control over parts to strengthen its monopoly share of the service market. Thus, liability turns on whether valid business reasons can explain Kodak\'s actions. However, none of its asserted business justifications-a commitment to quality service, a need to control inventory costs, and a desire to prevent ISO\'s from free-riding on its capital investment-are sufficient to prove that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 (1988 ed., Supp. II). After truncated discovery, the District Court granted summary judgment for Kodak. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The appellate court found that respondents had presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue concerning Kodak\'s market power in the service and parts markets. It rejected Kodak\'s contention that lack of market power in service and parts must be assumed when such power is absent in the equipment market. Because of the importance of the issue, we granted certiorari. 501 U. S. 1216 (1991).</p><p align="center">\nI A</p><p>Because this case comes to us on petitioner Kodak\'s motion for summary judgment, "[t]he evidence of [respondents] is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [their] favor." <i>Anderson </i>v. <i>Liberty Lobby, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/242/case.html">477 U.

See App. 424-425, 487-489, 537. Kodak parts are not compatible with other manufacturers\' equipment, and vice versa. See <i>id., </i>at 432,413-415. Kodak equipment, although expensive when new, has little resale value. See <i>id., </i>at 358-359, 424-425,427-428,467,505-506,519-521.</p><p>Kodak provides service and parts for its machines to its customers. It produces some of the parts itself; the rest are made to order for Kodak by independent original-equipment manufacturers (OEM\'s). See <i>id., </i>at 429, 465, 490, 496. Kodak does not sell a complete system of original equipment, lifetime service, and lifetime parts for a single price. Instead, Kodak provides service after the initial warranty period either through annual service contracts, which include all necessary parts, or on a per-call basis. See <i>id., </i>at 98-99; Brief for Petitioner 3. It charges, through negotiations and bidding, different prices for equipment, service, and parts for different customers. See App. 420-421, 536. Kodak provides 80% to 95% of the service for Kodak machines. See <i>id., </i>at 430.</p><p>Beginning in the early 1980\'s, ISO\'s began repairing and servicing Kodak equipment. They also sold parts and reconditioned and sold used Kodak equipment. Their customers were federal, state, and local government agencies, banks, insurance companies, industrial enterprises, and providers of specialized copy and microfilming services. See <i>id., </i>at 417, 419-421, 492-493, 499, 516, 539. ISO\'s provide service at a price substantially lower than Kodak does.

See Lodging 144-147. Others choose ISO\'s to supply both service and parts. See <i>id., </i>at 133. ISO\'s keep an inventory of parts, purchased from Kodak or other sources, primarily the OEM\'s.2 See App. 99, 415-416, 490.</p><p>In 1985 and 1986, Kodak implemented a policy of selling replacement parts for micrographic and copying machines only to buyers of Kodak equipment who use Kodak service or repair their own machines. See Brief for Petitioner 6; App. 91-92, 98-100, 140-141, 171-172, 190, 442-447, 455456, 483-484.</p><p>As part of the same policy, Kodak sought to limit ISO access to other sources of Kodak parts. Kodak and the OEM\'s agreed that the OEM\'s would not sell parts that fit Kodak equipment to anyone other than Kodak. See <i>id., </i>at 417, 428-429, 447, 468, 474, 496. Kodak also pressured Kodak equipment owners and independent parts distributors not to sell Kodak parts to ISO\'s. See <i>id., </i>at 419-420, 428-429, 483484, 517-518, 589-590. In addition, Kodak took steps to restrict the availability of used machines. See <i>id., </i>at 427-428, 465-466, 510-511, 520.</p><p>Kodak intended, through these policies, to make it more difficult for ISO\'s to sell service for Kodak machines. See <i>id., </i>at 106-107, 171,516. It succeeded. ISO\'s were unable to obtain parts from reliable sources, see <i>id., </i>at 429, 468, 496, and many were forced out of business, while others lost substantial revenue. See <i>id., </i>at 422, 458-459, 464, 468, 475477, 482-484, 495-496, 501, 521. Customers were forced to switch to Kodak service even though they preferred ISO service. See <i>id., </i>at 420-422.</p><p>2 In addition to the OEM\'s, other sources of Kodak parts include (1) brokers who would buy parts from Kodak, or strip used Kodak equipment to obtain the useful parts and resell them, (2) customers who buy parts from Kodak and make them available to ISO\'s, and (3) used equipment to be stripped for parts. See <i>id., </i>at 419, 517; Brief for Petitioner 38.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="459">459</a></p><p>B</p><p>In 1987, the ISO\'s filed the present action in the District Court, alleging, <i>inter alia, </i>that Kodak had unlawfully tied the sale of service for Kodak machines to the sale of parts, in violation of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, and had unlawfully monopolized and attempted to monopolize the sale of service for Kodak machines, in violation of \xc2\xa7 2 of that Act.3</p><p>Kodak filed a motion for summary judgment before respondents had initiated discovery. The District Court permitted respondents to file one set of interrogatories and one set of requests for production of documents and to take six depositions. Without a hearing, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Kodak. App. to Pet. for Cert.29B.</p><p>As to the \xc2\xa7 1 claim, the court found that respondents had provided no evidence of a tying arrangement between Kodak equipment and service or parts. See <i>id., </i>at 32B-33B. The court, however, did not address respondents\' \xc2\xa7 1 claim that is at issue here. Respondents allege a tying arrangement not between Kodak <i>equipment </i>and service, but between Kodak <i>parts </i>and service. As to the \xc2\xa7 2 claim, the District Court concluded that although Kodak had a "natural monopoly over the market for parts it sells under its name," a unilateral refusal to sell those parts to ISO\'s did not violate \xc2\xa7 2.</p><p>3 Section 1 of the Sherman Act states in relevant part: "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal." 15 U. S.

With respect to the \xc2\xa7 1 claim, the court first found that whether service and parts were distinct markets and whether a tying arrangement existed between them were disputed issues of fact. <i>Id., </i>at 615-616. Having found that a tying arrangement might exist, the Court of Appeals considered a question not decided by the District Court: Was there "an issue of material fact as to whether Kodak has sufficient economic power in the tying product market [parts] to restrain competition appreciably in the tied product market [service]." <i>Id., </i>at 616. The court agreed with Kodak that competition in the equipment market might prevent Kodak from possessing power in the parts market, but refused to uphold the District Court\'s grant of summary judgment "on this theoretical basis" because "market imperfections can keep economic theories about how consumers will act from mirroring reality." <i>Id., </i>at 617. Noting that the District Court had not considered the market power issue, and that the record was not fully developed through discovery, the court declined to require respondents to conduct market analysis or to pinpoint specific imperfections in order to withstand summary judgment.4 "It is enough that [respondents] have presented evidence of actual events from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that ... competition in the [equipment] market does not, in reality, curb Kodak\'s power in the parts market." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>4 Specifically, the Court of Appeals explained that the District Court had denied the request for further discovery made by respondents in their opposition to Kodak\'s summary judgment motion: "For example, [respondents] requested to depose two ISO customers who allegedly would not sign accurate statements concerning Kodak\'s market power in the parts market. Not finding it necessary to reach the market power issue in its decision, the district court, of course, had no reason to grant this request." 903 F. 2d, at 617, n. 4.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="461">461</a></p><p>The court then considered the three business justifications Kodak proffered for its restrictive parts policy: (1) to guard against inadequate service, (2) to lower inventory costs, and (3) to prevent ISO\'s from free-riding on Kodak\'s investment in the copier and micrographic industry. The court concluded that the trier of fact might find the product quality and inventory reasons to be pretextual and that there was a less restrictive alternative for achieving Kodak\'s qualityrelated goals. <i>Id., </i>at 618-619. The court also found Kodak\'s third justification, preventing ISO\'s from profiting on Kodak\'s investments in the equipment markets, legally insufficient. <i>Id., </i>at 619.</p><p>As to the \xc2\xa7 2 claim, the Court of Appeals concluded that sufficient evidence existed to support a finding that Kodak\'s implementation of its parts policy was "anticompetitive" and "exclusionary" and "involved a specific intent to monopolize." <i>Id., </i>at 620. It held that the ISO\'s had come forward with sufficient evidence, for summary judgment purposes, to disprove Kodak\'s business justifications. <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The dissent in the Court of Appeals, with respect to the \xc2\xa7 1 claim, accepted Kodak\'s argument that evidence of competition in the equipment market <i>"necessarily </i>precludes power in the derivative market." <i>Id., </i>at 622 (emphasis in original). With respect to the \xc2\xa7 2 monopolization claim, the dissent concluded that, entirely apart from market power considerations, Kodak was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of its first business justification because it had "submitted extensive and undisputed evidence of a marketing strategy based on high-quality service." <i>Id., </i>at 623.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>A tying arrangement is "an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier." <i>Northern Pacific R.

Buyers of such equipment regard an increase in the price of parts or service as an increase in the price of the equipment, and sellers recognize that the revenues from sales of parts and service are attributable to sales of the equipment. In such circumstances, it is not apparent how an equipment manufacturer such as Kodak could exercise power in the aftermarkets for parts and service." Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae 8.</i></p><p>17 It is clearly true, as the United States claims, that Kodak "cannot set service or parts prices without regard to the impact on the market for equipment." <i>Id., </i>at 20.

But there could easily be a middle, optimum price at which the increased revenues from the higher priced sales of service and parts would more than compensate for the lower revenues from lost equipment sales. The fact that the equipment market imposes a restraint on prices in the aftermarkets by no means disproves the existence of power in those markets. See Areeda &amp; Kaplow\' 340(b) ("[T]he existence of significant substitution in the event of <i>further </i>price increases or even at the <i>current </i>price does not tell us whether the defendant <i>already </i>exercises significant market power") (emphasis in original).

In <i>Continental </i><i>T. </i>v., the Court found that a manufacturer\'s policy restricting the number of retailers that were permitted to sell its product could have a procompetitive effect. See 433 U. S., at 55. The Court also noted that any negative effect of exploitation of the intrabrand market (the competition between retailers of the same product) would be checked by competition in the interbrand market (competition over the same generic product) because consumers would substitute a different brand of the same product. Unlike <i>Continental T. </i><i>v., </i>this case does not concern vertical relationships between parties on different levels of the same distribution chain. In the relevant market, service, Kodak and the ISO\'s are direct competitors; their relationship is horizontal. The interbrand competition at issue here is competition over the provision of service. Despite petitioner\'s best effort,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="472">472</a></p><p>To review Kodak\'s theory, it contends that higher service prices will lead to a disastrous drop in equipment sales. Presumably, the theory\'s corollary is to the effect that low service prices lead to a dramatic increase in equipment sales. According to the theory, one would have expected Kodak to take advantage of lower priced ISO service as an opportunity to expand equipment sales. Instead, Kodak adopted a restrictive sales policy consciously designed to eliminate the lower priced ISO service, an act that would be expected to devastate either Kodak\'s equipment sales or Kodak\'s faith in its theory. Yet, according to the record, it has done neither. Service prices have risen for Kodak customers, but there is no evidence or assertion that Kodak equipment sales have dropped.</p><p>Kodak and the United States attempt to reconcile Kodak\'s theory with the contrary actual results by describing a "marketing strategy of spreading over time the total cost to the buyer of Kodak equipment." Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>18; see also Brief for Petitioner 18. In other words, Kodak could charge subcompetitive prices for equipment and make up the difference with supracompetitive prices for service, resulting in an overall competitive price. This pricing strategy would provide an explanation for the theory\'s descriptive failings-if Kodak in fact had adopted it. But Kodak never has asserted that it prices its equipment or parts subcompetitively and recoups its profits through service. Instead, it claims that it prices its equipment comparably to its competitors and intends that both its equipment sales and service divisions be profitable. See App. 159-161, 170, 178, 188. Moreover, this hypothetical pricing strategy is inconsistent with Kodak\'s policy toward its self-service customers. If Kodak were underpricing its equipment, hoping to lock in customers and recover its losses in the service</p><p>repeating the mantra "interbrand competition" does not transform this case into one over an agreement the manufacturer has with its dealers that would fall under the rubric of <i>Continental T. V.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="473">473</a></p><p>market, it could not afford to sell customers parts without service. In sum, Kodak\'s theory does not explain the actual market behavior revealed in the record.</p><p>Respondents offer a forceful reason why Kodak\'s theory, although perhaps intuitively appealing, may not accurately explain the behavior of the primary and derivative markets for complex durable goods: the existence of significant information and switching costs. These costs could create a less responsive connection between service and parts prices and equipment sales.</p><p>For the service-market price to affect equipment demand, consumers must inform themselves of the total cost of the "package" -equipment, service, and parts-at the time of purchase; that is, consumers must engage in accurate lifecycle pricing.19 Life-cycle pricing of complex, durable equipment is difficult and costly. In order to arrive at an accurate price, a consumer must acquire a substantial amount of raw data and undertake sophisticated analysis. The necessary information would include data on price, quality, and availability of products needed to operate, upgrade, or enhance the initial equipment, as well as service and repair costs, including estimates of breakdown frequency, nature of repairs, price of service and parts, length of "downtime," and losses incurred from downtime.20</p><p>Much of this information is difficult-some of it impossible-to acquire at the time of purchase. During the life of a product, companies may change the service and parts prices, and develop products with more advanced features, a</p><p>19 See Craswell, Tying Requirements in Competitive Markets: The Consumer Protection Issues, 62 B. U. L. Rev. 661, 676 (1982); Beales, Craswell, &amp; Salop, The Efficient Regulation of Consumer Information, 24 J. Law &amp; Econ. 491, 509-511 (1981); <i>Jefferson Parish, </i>466 U. S., at 15.</p><p>20 In addition, of course, in order to price accurately the equipment, a consumer would need initial purchase information such as prices, features, quality, and available warranties for different machinery with different capabilities, and residual value information such as the longevity of product use and its potential resale or trade-in value.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="474">474</a></p><p>decreased need for repair, or new warranties. In addition, the information is likely to be customer specific; lifecycle costs will vary from customer to customer with the type of equipment, degrees of equipment use, and costs of downtime.</p><p>Kodak acknowledges the cost of information, but suggests, again without evidentiary support, that customer information needs will be satisfied by competitors in the equipment markets. Brief for Petitioner 26, n. 11. It is a question of fact, however, whether competitors would provide the necessary information. A competitor in the equipment market may not have reliable information about the lifecycle costs of complex equipment it does not service or the needs of customers it does not serve. Even if competitors had the relevant information, it is not clear that their interests would be advanced by providing such information to consumers. See 2 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, Antitrust Law\' <i>J"OJ"bl (1978).21</i></p><p>Moreover, even if consumers were capable of acquiring and processing the complex body of information, they may choose not to do so. Acquiring the information is expensive. If the costs of service are small relative to the equipment price, or if consumers are more concerned about equipment capabilities than service costs, they may not find it cost efficient to</p><p>21 To inform consumers about Kodak, the competitor must be willing to forgo the opportunity to reap supracompetitive prices in its own service and parts markets. The competitor may anticipate that charging lower service and parts prices and informing consumers about Kodak in the hopes of gaining future equipment sales will cause Kodak to lower the price on its service and parts, canceling any gains in equipment sales to the competitor and leaving both worse off. Thus, in an equipment market with relatively few sellers, competitors may find it more profitable to adopt Kodak\'s service and parts policy than to inform the consumers. See 2 Areeda &amp; Turner, Antitrust Law\' <i>404bl; </i>App. 177 (Kodak, Xerox, and IBM together have nearly 100% of relevant market).</p><p>Even in a market with many sellers, anyone competitor may not have sufficient incentive to inform consumers because the increased patronage attributable to the corrected consumer beliefs will be shared among other competitors. Beales, Craswell, &amp; Salop, 24 J. Law &amp; Econ., at 503-504, 506.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="475">475</a></p><p>compile the information. Similarly, some consumers, such as the Federal Government, have purchasing systems that make it difficult to consider the complete cost of the "package" at the time of purchase. State and local governments often treat service as an operating expense and equipment as a capital expense, delegating each to a different department. These governmental entities do not lifecycle price, but rather choose the lowest price in each market. See Brief for N ational Association of State Purchasing Officials et al. as <i>Amici Curiae; </i>Brief for State of Ohio et al. as <i>Amici Curiae; </i>App. 429-430.</p><p>As Kodak notes, there likely will be some large-volume, sophisticated purchasers who will undertake the comparative studies and insist, in return for their patronage, that Kodak charge them competitive lifecycle prices. Kodak contends that these knowledgeable customers will hold down the package price for all other customers. Brief for Petitioner 23, n. 9. There are reasons, however, to doubt that sophisticated purchasers will ensure that competitive prices are charged to unsophisticated purchasers, too. As an initial matter, if the number of sophisticated customers is relatively small, the amount of profits to be gained by supracompetitive pricing in the service market could make it profitable to let the knowledgeable consumers take their business elsewhere. More importantly, if a company is able to price discriminate between sophisticated and unsophisticated consumers, the sophisticated will be unable to prevent the exploitation of the uninformed. A seller could easily price discriminate by varying the equipment/parts/service package, developing different warranties, or offering price discounts on different components.</p><p>Given the potentially high cost of information and the possibility that a seller may be able to price discriminate between knowledgeable and unsophisticated consumers, it makes little sense to assume, in the absence of any evidentiary support, that equipment-purchasing decisions are based</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="476">476</a></p><p>on an accurate assessment of the total cost of equipment, service, and parts over the lifetime of the machine.22</p><p>Indeed, respondents have presented evidence that Kodak practices price discrimination by selling parts to customers who service their own equipment, but refusing to sell parts to customers who hire third-party service companies. Companies that have their own service staff are likely to be highvolume users, the same companies for whom it is most likely to be economically worthwhile to acquire the complex information needed for comparative lifecycle pricing.</p><p>A second factor undermining Kodak\'s claim that supracompetitive prices in the service market lead to ruinous losses in equipment sales is the cost to current owners of switching to a different product. See Areeda &amp; Turner\' 519a.23 If the cost of switching is high, consumers who already have purchased the equipment, and are thus "locked in," will tolerate some level of service-price increases before changing equipment brands. Under this scenario, a seller profitably could maintain supracompetitive prices in the aftermarket if the switching costs were high relative to the increase in service prices, and the number of locked-in customers were high relative to the number of new purchasers.</p><p>Moreover, if the seller can price discriminate between its locked-in customers and potential new customers, this strategy is even more likely to prove profitable. The seller could simply charge new customers below-marginal cost on the equipment and recoup the charges in service, or offer pack-</p><p>22 See Salop &amp; Stiglitz, Bargains and Ripoffs: A Model of Monopolistically Competitive Price Dispersion, 44 Rev.

And Kodak\'s own evidence confirms that it varies the package price of equipment/parts/service for different customers.</p><p>In sum, there is a question of fact whether information costs and switching costs foil the simple assumption that the equipment and service markets act as pure complements to one another.24</p><p>We conclude, then, that Kodak has failed to demonstrate that respondents\' inference of market power in the service and parts markets is unreasonable, and that, consequently, Kodak is entitled to summary judgment. It is clearly reasonable to infer that Kodak has market power to raise prices and drive out competition in the aftermarkets, since respondents offer direct evidence that Kodak did SO.25 It is also plausible, as discussed above, to infer that Kodak chose to gain immediate profits by exerting that market power where locked-in customers, high information costs, and discriminatory pricing limited and perhaps eliminated any long-</p><p>24 The dissent disagrees based on its hypothetical case of a tie between equipment and service. "The only thing lacking" to bring this case within the hypothetical case, states the dissent, "is concrete evidence that the restrictive parts policy was ... generally known." <i>Post, </i>at 492. But the dissent\'s "only thing lacking" is the crucial thing lacking-evidence. Whether a tie between parts and service should be treated identically to a tie between equipment and service, as the dissent and Kodak argue, depends on whether the equipment market prevents the exertion of market power in the parts market. Far from being "anomalous," <i>post, </i>at 492-493, requiring Kodak to provide evidence on this factual question is completely consistent with our prior precedent. See, <i>e. g., </i>n. 13, <i>supra.</i></p><p>25 Cf. <i>Instructional Systems, </i>817 F. 2d, at 646 (finding the conspiracy reasonable under <i>Matsushita </i>because its goals were in fact achieved).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="478">478</a></p><p>term loss. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to respondents, their allegations of market power "mak[e] ... economic sense." Cf. <i>Matsushita, </i>475 U. S., at 587.</p><p>Nor are we persuaded by Kodak\'s contention that it is entitled to a legal presumption on the lack of market power because, as in <i>Matsushita, </i>there is a significant risk of deterring procompetitive conduct. Plaintiffs in <i>Matsushita </i>attempted to prove the antitrust conspiracy "through evidence of rebates and other price-cutting activities." <i>Id., </i>at 594. Because cutting prices to increase business is "the very essence of competition," the Court was concerned that mistaken inferences would be "especially costly" and would "chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect." <i>Ibid. </i>See also <i>Monsanto Co. </i>v. <i>Spray-Rite Service Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/752/case.html">465 U. S. 752</a>, 763 (1984) (permitting inference of concerted action would "deter or penalize perfectly legitimate conduct"). But the facts in this case are just the opposite. The alleged conduct-higher service prices and market foreclosure-is facially anticompetitive and exactly the harm that antitrust laws aim to prevent. In this situation, <i>Matsushita </i>does not create any presumption in favor of summary judgment for the defendant.</p><p>Kodak contends that, despite the appearance of anticompetitiveness, its behavior actually favors competition because its ability to pursue innovative marketing plans will allow it to compete more effectively in the equipment market. Brief for Petitioner 40-41. A pricing strategy based on lower equipment prices and higher aftermarket prices could enhance equipment sales by making it easier for the buyer to finance the initial purchase.26 It is undisputed that competition is enhanced when a firm is able to offer various marketing options, including bundling of support and maintenance service with the sale of equipment. Nor do such ac-</p><p>26 It bears repeating that in this case Kodak has never claimed that it is in fact pursuing such a pricing strategy.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="479">479</a></p><p>tions run afoul of the antitrust laws.27 But the procompetitive effect of the specific conduct challenged here, eliminating all consumer parts and service options, is far less clear.28</p><p>We need not decide whether Kodak\'s behavior has any procompetitive effects and, if so, whether they outweigh the anticompetitive effects. We note only that Kodak\'s service and parts policy is simply not one that appears always or almost always to enhance competition, and therefore to warrant a legal presumption without any evidence of its actual economic impact. In this case, when we weigh the risk of deterring procompetitive behavior by proceeding to trial against the risk that illegal behavior will go unpunished, the balance tips against summary judgment. Cf. <i>Matsushita, </i>475 U. S., at 594-595.</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Kodak has not met the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). We therefore affirm the denial of summary judgment on respondents\' \xc2\xa7 1 claim.29</p><p>27 See <i>Jefferson Parish, </i>466 U.

It argues that because Kodak has only an "inherent" monopoly in parts for its equipment, <i>post, </i>at 489-490, the antitrust laws do not apply to its efforts to expand that power into other markets. The dissent\'s proposal to grant <i>per se </i>immunity to manufacturers competing in the service market would exempt a vast and growing sector of the economy from antitrust laws.

The Court has held many times that power gained through some natural and legal advantage such as a patent, copyright, or business acumen can give rise to liability if "a seller exploits his dominant position in one market to expand his empire into the next." <i>TimesPicayune Publishing Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/594/case.html">345 U.

Co. </i>v. <i>Barber Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/458/case.html">302 U. S. 458</a>, 463 (1938). Moreover, on the occasions when the Court has considered tying in derivative aftermarkets by manufacturers, it has not adopted any exception to the usual antitrust analysis, treating derivative aftermarkets as it has every other separate market. See <i>International Salt Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/392/case.html">332 U. S. 392</a> (1947); <i>International Business Machines Corp. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/298/131/case.html">298 U.

Our past decisions are reason enough to reject the dissent\'s proposal. See <i>Patterson </i>v. <i>McLean Credit Union, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/case.html">491 U.

The dissent urges its exemption because the tie here "does not permit the manufacturer to project power over a class of consumers distinct from that which it is already able to exploit (and fully) without the inconvenience of the tie." <i>Post, </i>at 498. Beyond the dissent\'s obvious difficulty in explaining why Kodak would adopt this expensive tying policy if it could achieve the same profits more conveniently through some other means, respondents offer an alternative theory, supported by the record, that suggests Kodak <i>is </i>able to exploit some customers who in the absence of the tie would be protected from increases in parts prices by knowledgeable customers.

"The offense of monopoly under \xc2\xa7 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Grinnell Corp., </i>384 U.

Kodak claims the exclusive-service contract is warranted because customers would otherwise blame Kodak equipment for breakdowns resulting from inferior ISO service. Thus, Kodak simultaneously claims that its customers are sophisticated enough to make complex and subtle life cycle-pricing decisions, and yet too obtuse to distinguish which breakdowns are due to bad equipment and which are due to bad service. Kodak has failed to offer any reason why informational sophistication should be present in one circumstance and absent in the other. In addition, because self-service customers are just as likely as others to blame Kodak equipment for breakdowns resulting from (their own) inferior service, Kodak\'s willingness to allow self-service casts doubt on its quality claim. In sum, we agree with the Court of Appeals that respondents "have presented evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Kodak\'s first reason is pretextual." 903 F.2d, at 618.</p><p>There is also a triable issue of fact on Kodak\'s second justification-controlling inventory costs. As respondents argue, Kodak\'s actions appear inconsistent with any need to control inventory costs. Presumably, the inventory of parts</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="485">485</a></p><p>needed to repair Kodak machines turns only on breakdown rates, and those rates should be the same whether Kodak or ISO\'s perform the repair. More importantly, the justification fails to explain respondents\' evidence that Kodak forced OEM\'s, equipment owners, and parts brokers not to sell parts to ISO\'s, actions that would have no effect on Kodak\'s inventory costs.</p><p>Nor does Kodak\'s final justification entitle it to summary judgment on respondents\' \xc2\xa7 2 claim. Kodak claims that its policies prevent ISO\'s from "exploit[ing] the investment Kodak has made in product development, manufacturing and equipment sales in order to take away Kodak\'s service revenues." Brief for Petitioner 7-8. Kodak does not dispute that respondents invest substantially in the service market, with training of repair workers and investment in parts inventory. Instead, according to Kodak, the ISO\'s are freeriding because they have failed to enter the equipment and parts markets. This understanding of free-riding has no support in our case law.33 To the contrary, as the Court of Appeals noted, one of the evils proscribed by the antitrust laws is the creation of entry barriers to potential competitors by requiring them to enter two markets simultaneously. <i>Jef</i>ferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 14; <i>Fortner, </i>394 U.

In <i>Continental T. V. </i>the relevant market level was retail sale of televisions and in <i>Monsanto </i>retail sales of herbicides. Some retailers were investing in those markets; others were not, relying, instead, on the investment of the other retailers. To be applicable to this case, the ISO\'s would have to be relying on Kodak\'s investment in the service market; that, however, is not Kodak\'s argument.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="486">486</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>a matter of law" on respondents\' \xc2\xa7 2 claim.

It may be that its parts, service, and equipment are components of one unified market, or that the equipment market does discipline the aftermarkets so that all three are priced competitively overall, or that any anticompetitive effects of Kodak\'s behavior are outweighed by its competitive effects.

Rather, the case presents a very narrow-but extremely important-question of substantive antitrust law: whether, for purposes of applying our <i>per se </i>rule condemning "ties," and for purposes of applying our exacting rules governing the behavior of would-be monopolists, a manufacturer\'s conceded lack of power in the interbrand market for its equipment is somehow consistent with its possession of "market," or even "monopoly," power in wholly derivative aftermarkets for that equipment.

The <i>per se </i>rule against tying is just such a rule: Where the conditions precedent to application of the rule are met, i. <i>e., </i>where the tying arrangement is backed up by the defendant\'s market power in the "tying" product, the arrangement is adjudged in violation of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.

When the defendant has genuine "market power" in the tying product-the power to raise price by reducing output-the tie potentially enables him to extend that power into a second distinct market, enhancing barriers to entry in each. In addition:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[T]ying arrangements may be used to evade price control in the tying product through clandestine transfer of the profit to the tied product; they may be used as a counting device to effect price discrimination; and they may be used to force a full line of products on the customer so as to extract more easily from him a monopoly return on one unique product in the line." <i>Fortner Enterprises, Inc. </i>v. <i>United States Steel Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/495/case.html">394 U.

Where a defendant maintains substantial market power, his activities are examined through a special lens: Behavior that might otherwise not be of concern to the antitrust laws-or that might even be viewed as procompetitive-can take on exclusionary connotations when practiced by a monopolist. 3 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, Antitrust Law , 813, pp. 300-302 (1978) (hereinafter 3 Areeda &amp; Turner).</p><p>The concerns, however, that have led the courts to heightened scrutiny both of the "exclusionary conduct" practiced by a monopolist and of tying arrangements subject to <i>per se </i>prohibition, are completely without force when the participants lack market power. As to the former, "[t]he [very] definition of exclusionary conduct," as practiced by a monopolist, is "predicated on the existence of substantial market power." <i>Id.,\' </i>813, at 301; see, <i>e. g., Walker Process Equipment, Inc. </i>v. <i>Food Machinery </i>&amp; <i>Chemical Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/172/case.html">382 U.

And with respect to tying, we have recognized that bundling arrangements not coerced by the heavy hand of market power can serve the procompetitive functions of facilitating new entry into cer-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="489">489</a></p><p>tain markets, see, <i>e. g., Brown Shoe Co. </i>v. <i>United States, 370 </i>U.

"Accordingly, we have [only] condemned tying arrangements [under the <i>per se </i>rule] when the seller has some special ability-usually called \'market power\' -to force a purchaser to do something that he would not do in a competitive market." <i>Jefferson Parish, supra, </i>at 13-14.</p><p>The Court today finds in the typical manufacturer\'s inherent power over its own brand of equipment-over the sale of distinctive repair parts for that equipment, for examplethe sort of "monopoly power" sufficient to bring the sledgehammer of \xc2\xa7 2 into play. And, not surprisingly in light of that insight, it readily labels single-brand power over aftermarket products "market power" sufficient to permit an antitrust plaintiff to invoke the <i>per se </i>rule against tying. In my opinion, this makes no economic sense. The holding that market power can be found on the present record causes these venerable rules of selective proscription to extend well beyond the point where the reasoning that supports them leaves off. Moreover, because the sort of power condemned by the Court today is possessed by every manufacturer of durable goods with distinctive parts, the Court\'s opinion threatens to release a torrent of litigation and a flood of commercial intimidation that will do much more harm than good to enforcement of the antitrust laws and to genuine competition.

As the Court observes, in order to survive Kodak\'s motion for summary judgment on this claim, respondents bore the burden of proffering evidence on which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Kodak possesses power in the market for the alleged "tying" product. See <i>ante, </i>at 464; <i>Jefferson Parish, </i>466 U. S., at 13-14.</p><p align="center">\nA</p><p>We must assume, for purposes of deciding this case, that petitioner is without market, much less monopoly, power in the interbrand markets for its micrographic and photocopying equipment.

In the District Court, respondents did, in fact, include in their complaint an allegation which posited the interbrand equipment markets as the relevant markets; in particular, they alleged a \xc2\xa7 1 "tie" of micrographic and photocopying equipment to the parts and service for those machines. App. 22-23. Though this allegation was apparently abandoned in pursuit of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 claims focused exclusively on the parts and service aftermarkets (about which more later), I think it helpful to analyze how that claim would have fared under the <i>per se </i>rule.</p><p>Had Kodak-from the date of its entry into the micrographic and photocopying equipment markets-included a lifetime parts and service warranty with all original equip-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="491">491</a></p><p>ment, or required consumers to purchase a lifetime parts and service contract with each machine, that bundling of equipment, parts, and service would no doubt constitute a tie under the tests enunciated in <i>Jefferson Parish, supra. </i>Nevertheless, it would be immune from <i>per se </i>scrutiny under the antitrust laws because the <i>tying </i>product would be <i>equipment, </i>a market in which (we assume) Kodak has no power to influence price or quantity. See <i>id., </i>at 13-14; <i>United States Steel Corp. </i>v. <i>Fortner Enterprises, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/610/case.html">429 U.

The same result would obtain, I think, had Kodak-from the date of its market entryconsistently pursued an announced policy of limiting parts sales in the manner alleged in this case, so that customers bought with the knowledge that aftermarket support could be obtained only from Kodak. The foreclosure of respondents from the business of servicing Kodak\'s micrographic and photocopying machines in these illustrations would be undeniably complete-as complete as the foreclosure described in respondents\' complaint. Nonetheless, we would inquire no further than to ask whether Kodak\'s <i>market power </i>in the equipment market effectively forced consumers to purchase Kodak micrographic or photocopying machines subject to the company\'s restrictive aftermarket practices. If not, that would end the case insofar as the <i>per se </i>rule was concerned. See <i>Jefferson Parish, supra, </i>at 13-14; 9 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law\' 1709c5, pp. 101-102 (1991); Klein &amp; Saft, The Law and Economics of Franchise Tying Contracts, 28 J. Law &amp; Econ. 345, 356 (1985). The evils against which the tying prohibition is directed would simply not be presented. lnterbrand competition would render Kodak powerless to gain economic power over an additional class of consumers, to price discriminate by charging each customer a "system" price equal to the system\'s economic value to that customer, or to raise barriers to entry in the interbrand equipment markets.

The record below is consistent-in large part-with just this sort of bundling of equipment on the one hand, with parts and service on the other. The restrictive parts policy, with respect to micrographic equipment at least, was not even alleged to be anything but prospective. 8ee App. 17. As respondents summarized their factual proffer below:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Under this policy, Kodak cut off parts on new products to Kodak micrographics [independent service organizations] 180s. The effect of this, of course, was that as customers of Kodak micrographics 180s obtained new equipment, the 180s were unable to service the equipment for that customer, and, service for these customers was lost by the Kodak 180s. Additionally, as equipment became obsolete, and the equipment population became all "new equipment" (post April 1985 models), Kodak micrographics 180s would be able to service no equipment at all." <i>Id., </i>at 360.</p></blockquote><p>As to Kodak copiers, Kodak\'s restrictive parts policy had a broader foundation: Considered in the light most favorable to respondents, see <i>Anderson, supra, </i>at 255, the record suggests that, from its inception, the policy was applied to new and existing copier customers alike. But at least all post1985 purchasers of micrographic equipment, like all post1985 purchasers of new Kodak copiers, could have been aware of Kodak\'s parts practices. The only thing lacking to bring all of these purchasers (accounting for the vast bulk of the commerce at issue here) squarely within the hypotheticals we have described is concrete evidence that the restrictive parts policy was announced or generally known. Thus, under the Court\'s approach the existence <i>vel non </i>of such evidence is determinative of the legal standard (the <i>per se </i>rule versus the rule of reason) under which the alleged tie is examined. In my judgment, this makes no sense. It is</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="493">493</a></p><p>quite simply anomalous that a manufacturer functioning in a competitive equipment market should be exempt from the <i>per se </i>rule when it bundles equipment with parts and service, but not when it bundles parts with service. This vast difference in the treatment of what will ordinarily be economically similar phenomena is alone enough to call today\'s decision into question.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>In the Court of Appeals, respondents sought to sidestep the impediment posed by interbrand competition to their invocation of the <i>per se </i>tying rule by zeroing in on the parts and service "aftermarkets" for Kodak equipment. By alleging a tie of <i>parts </i>to service, rather than of <i>equipment </i>to parts and service, they identified a tying product in which Kodak unquestionably held a near-monopoly share: the parts uniquely associated with Kodak\'s brand of machines. See <i>Jefferson Parish, </i>466 U. S., at 17. The Court today holds that such a facial showing of market share in a single-brand aftermarket is sufficient to invoke the <i>per se </i>rule. The existence of even vibrant interbrand competition is no defense. See <i>ante, </i>at 470-471.</p><p>I find this a curious form of market power on which to premise the application of a <i>per se </i>proscription. It is enjoyed by virtually every manufacturer of durable goods requiring aftermarket support with unique, or relatively unique, goods. See P. Areeda &amp; H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law\' 525.1, p. 563 (Supp. 1991). "[S]uch reasoning makes every maker of unique parts for its own product a holder of market power <i>no matter how unimportant its product might be in the market." Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).l Under</p><p>1 That there exist innumerable parts and service firms in such industries as the automobile industry, see Brief for Automotive Warehouse Distributors Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>2-3, does not detract from this point. The question whether power to control an aftermarket exists is quite distinct from the question whether the power has been exercised. Manufacturers in some markets have no doubt determined that exc1usion-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="494">494</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>the Court\'s analysis, the <i>per se </i>rule may now be applied to single-brand ties effected by the most insignificant players in fully competitive interbrand markets, as long as the arrangement forecloses aftermarket competitors from more than a <i>de minimis </i>amount of business, <i>Fortner I, </i>394 U. S., at 501. This seems to me quite wrong. A tying arrangement "forced" through the exercise of such power no more implicates the leveraging and price discrimination concerns behind the <i>per se </i>tying prohibition than does a tie of the foremarket brand to its aftermarket derivatives, which-as I have explained-would not be subject to <i>per se </i>condemnation.2 As implemented, the Kodak arrangement challenged</p><p>ary intrabrand conduct works to their disadvantage at the competitive interbrand level, but this in no way refutes the self-evident reality that control over unique replacement parts for single-branded goods is ordinarily available to such manufacturers for the taking. It confounds sound analysis to suggest, as respondents do, see Brief for Respondents 5, 37, that the asserted fact that Kodak manufactures only 10% of its replacement parts, and purchases the rest from original equipment manufacturers, casts doubt on Kodak\'s possession of an inherent advantage in the aftermarkets. It does no such thing, any more than Kodak\'s contracting with others for the manufacture of all constituent parts included in its original equipment would alone suggest that Kodak lacks power in the <i>interbrand </i>micrographic and photocopying equipment markets. The suggestion implicit in respondents\' analysis-that if a seller chooses to contract for the manufacture of its branded merchandise, it must permit the contractors to compete in the sale of that merchandise-is plainly unprecedented.</p><p>2 Even <i>with </i>interbrand power, I may observe, it is unlikely that Kodak could have incrementally exploited its position through the tie of parts to service alleged here. Most of the "service" at issue is inherently associated with the parts, i. <i>e., </i>that service involved in incorporating the parts into Kodak equipment, and the two items tend to be demanded by customers in fixed proportions (one part with one unit of service necessary to install the part). When that situation obtains, "\'no revenue can be derived from setting a higher price for the tied product which could not have been made by setting the optimum price for the tying product.\'\'\' P. Areeda &amp; L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis\' 426(a), p. 706 (4th ed. 1988) (quoting Bowman, Tying Arrangements and the Leverage Problem, 67 Yale L. J. 19 (1957)).

See, <i>e. g., Town Sound and Custom Tops, Inc. </i>v. <i>Chrysler Motors Corp., </i>959</p><p>In the absence of interbrand power, a seller\'s predominant or monopoly share of its single-brand derivative markets does not connote the power to raise derivative market prices <i>generally </i>by reducing quantity. As Kodak and its principal <i>amicus, </i>the United States, point out, a rational consumer considering the purchase of Kodak equipment will inevitably factor into his purchasing decision the expected cost of aftermarket support. "[B]oth the price of the equipment and the price of parts and service over the life of the equipment are expenditures that are necessary to obtain copying and micrographic services." Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>13. If Kodak set generally supracompetitive prices for either spare parts or repair services without making an offsetting reduction in the price of its machines, rational consumers would simply turn to Kodak\'s competitors for photocopying and micrographic systems. See, <i>e. g., Grappone, Inc. </i>v. <i>Subaru of New England, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/858/792/">858 F.2d 792</a>, 796-798 (CA1 1988). True, there are-as the Court notes, see <i>ante, </i>at 474-4 75-the occasional irrational consumers that consider only the hardware cost at the time of purchase (a category that regrettably includes the Federal Government, whose "purchasing system," we are told, assigns foremarket purchases and aftermarket purchases to different entities). But</p><p>parts and the service involved in installing them should not be treated as distinct products for antitrust tying purposes. See <i>Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist.

It says that there are "information costs" -the costs and inconvenience to the consumer of acquiring and processing life-cycle pricing data for Kodak machines-that "could create a less responsive connection between service and parts prices and equipment sales." <i>Ante, </i>at 473. But this truism about the functioning of markets for sophisticated equipment cannot create "market power" of concern to the antitrust laws where otherwise there is none. "Information costs," or, more accurately, gaps in the availability and quality of consumer information, pervade real-world markets; and because consumers generally make do with "rough cut" judgments about price in such circumstances, in virtually any market there are zones within which otherwise competitive suppliers may overprice their products without losing appreciable market share. We have never suggested that the principal players in a market with such commonplace informational deficiencies (and, thus, bands of apparent consumer pricing indifference) exercise market power in any sense relevant to the antitrust laws. "While [such] factors may generate \'market power\' in some abstract sense, they do not generate the kind of market power that justifies condemnation of tying." <i>Jefferson Parish, </i>466 U. S., at 27; see, <i>e. g., Town Sound and Custom Tops, Inc. </i>v. <i>Chrysler Motors Corp., supra.</i></p><p>Respondents suggest that, even if the existence of interbrand competition prevents Kodak from raising prices <i>generally </i>in its single-brand aftermarkets, there remain certain consumers who are necessarily subject to abusive Kodak pricing behavior by reason of their being "locked in" to their investments in Kodak machines. The Court agrees; indeed, it goes further by suggesting that even a <i>general </i>policy of supracompetitive aftermarket prices might be profitable over the long run because of the "lock-in" phenomenon. "[A]</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="497">497</a></p><p>seller profitably could maintain supracompetitive prices in the aftermarket," the Court explains, "if the switching costs were high relative to the increase in service prices, and the number of locked-in customers were high relative to the number of new purchasers." <i>Ante, </i>at 476. In speculating about this latter possibility, the Court is essentially repudiating the assumption on which we are bound to decide this case, viz., Kodak\'s lack of any power whatsoever in the interbrand market. If Kodak\'s <i>general </i>increase in aftermarket prices were to bring the total "system" price above competitive levels in the interbrand market, Kodak would be wholly unable to make further foremarket sales-and would find itself exploiting an ever-dwindling aftermarket, as those Kodak micrographic and photocopying machines already in circulation passed into disuse.</p><p>The Court\'s narrower point, however, is undeniably true.</p><p>There will be consumers who, because of their capital investment in Kodak equipment, "will tolerate some level of service-price increases before changing equipment brands," <i>ibid.; </i>this is <i>necessarily </i>true for "every maker of unique parts for its own product." Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law\' 525.1b, at 563. But this "circumstantial" leverage created by consumer investment regularly crops up in smoothly functioning, even perfectly competitive, markets, and in most-if not all-of its manifestations, it is of no concern to the antitrust laws. The leverage held by the manufacturer of a malfunctioning refrigerator (which is measured by the consumer\'s reluctance to walk away from his initial investment in that device) is no different in kind or degree from the leverage held by the swimming pool contractor when he discovers a 5-ton boulder in his customer\'s backyard and demands an additional sum of money to remove it; or the leverage held by an airplane manufacturer over an airline that has "standardized" its fleet around the manufacturer\'s models; or the leverage held by a drill press manufacturer whose customers have built their production lines around the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="498">498</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>manufacturer\'s particular style of drill press; or the leverage held by an insurance company over its independent sales force that has invested in company-specific paraphernalia; or the leverage held by a mobile home park owner over his tenants, who are unable to transfer their homes to a different park except at great expense, see generally <i>Yee </i>v. <i>Escondido, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/519/case.html">503 U. S. 519</a> (1992). Leverage, in the form of <i>circumstantial </i>power, plays a role in each of these relationships; but in none of them is the leverage attributable to the dominant party\'s <i>market </i>power in any relevant sense. Though that power can plainly work to the injury of certain consumers, it produces only "a brief perturbation in competitive conditions-not the sort of thing the antitrust laws do or should worry about." <i>Parts </i>&amp; <i>Elec. Motors, Inc. </i>v. <i>Sterling Elec., Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/866/228/">866 F.2d 228</a>, 236 (CA7 1988) (Posner, J., dissenting).</p><p>The Court correctly observes that the antitrust laws do not permit even a <i>natural </i>monopolist to project its monopoly power into another market, i. <i>e., </i>to "\'exploi[t] his dominant position in one market to expand his empire into the next.\'" <i>Ante, </i>at 480, n. 29 (quoting <i>Times-Picayune Publishing Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/594/case.html">345 U. S. 594</a>, 611 (1953)). However, when a manufacturer uses its control over single-branded parts to acquire influence in single-branded service, the monopoly "leverage" is almost invariably of no practical consequence, because of perfect identity between the consumers in each of the subject aftermarkets (those who need replacement parts for Kodak equipment and those who need servicing of Kodak equipment). When that condition exists, the tie does not permit the manufacturer to project power over a class of consumers distinct from that which it is already able to exploit (and fully) without the inconvenience of the tie. Cf., <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Bowman, Tying Arrangements and the Leverage Problem, 67 Yale L. J. 19, 21-27 (1957).</p><p>We have never before accepted the thesis the Court today embraces: that a seller\'s inherent control over the unique</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="499">499</a></p><p>parts for its own brand amounts to "market power" of a character sufficient to permit invocation of the <i>per se </i>rule against tying. As the Court observes, <i>ante, </i>at 479-481, n. 29, we have applied the <i>per se </i>rule to manufacturer ties of <i>foremar</i>ket equipment to aftermarket derivatives-but only when the manufacturer\'s monopoly power in the equipment, coupled with the use of derivative sales as "counting devices" to measure the intensity of customer equipment usage, enabled the manufacturer to engage in price discrimination, and thereby more fully exploit its interbrand power. See <i>International Salt Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/392/case.html">332 U. S. 392</a> (1947); <i>International Business Machines Corp. </i>v. <i>United States, 298 </i>U. S. 131 (1936); <i>United Shoe Machinery Corp. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/258/451/case.html">258 U. S. 451</a> (1922). That sort of enduring opportunity to engage in price discrimination is unavailable to a manufacturer-like Kodak-that lacks power at the interbrand level. A tie between two aftermarket derivatives does next to nothing to improve a competitive manufacturer\'s ability to extract monopoly rents from its consumers.3</p><p>3 The Court insists that the record in this case suggests otherwise, i. <i>e., </i>that a tie between parts and service somehow <i>does </i>enable Kodak to increase overall monopoly profits. See <i>ante, </i>at 479-481, n. 29. Although the Court does not identify the record evidence on which it relies, the suggestion, apparently, is that such a tie facilitates price discrimination between sophisticated, "high-volume" users of Kodak equipment and their unsophisticated counterparts. The sophisticated users (who, the Court presumes, invariably self-service their equipment) are permitted to buy Kodak parts without also purchasing supracompetitively priced Kodak service, while the unsophisticated are-through the imposition of the tiecompelled to buy both. See <i>ante, </i>at 475-476.</p><p>While superficially appealing, at bottom this explanation lacks coherence. Whether they self-service their equipment or not, rational foremarket consumers (those consumers who are not yet "locked in" to Kodak hardware) will be driven to Kodak\'s competitors if the price of Kodak equipment, together with the expected cost of aftermarket support, exceeds competitive levels. This will be true no matter how Kodak distributes the total system price among equipment, parts, and service. See</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="500">500</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>Nor has any court of appeals (save for the Ninth Circuit panel below) recognized single-branded aftermarket power as a basis for invoking the <i>per se </i>tying prohibition.

Thus, as to these consumers, Kodak\'s lack of interbrand power wholly prevents it from employing a tie between parts and service as a vehicle for price discrimination. Nor does a tie between parts and service offer Kodak incremental exploitative power over those consumers-sophisticated or not-who have the supposed misfortune of being "locked in" to Kodak equipment. If Kodak desired to exploit its circumstantial power over this wretched class by pressing them up to the point where the cost to each consumer of switching equipment brands barely exceeded the cost of retaining Kodak equipment and remaining subject to Kodak\'s abusive practices, it could plainly do so without the inconvenience of a tie, through supracompetitive parts pricing alone. Since the lockedin <i>sophisticated </i>parts purchaser is as helpless as the locked-in <i>unsophisticated </i>one, I see nothing to be gained by price discrimination in favor of the former. If such price discrimination were desired, however, it would not have to be accomplished indirectly, through a tie of parts to service. Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 13(a), would prevent giving lower parts prices to the sophisticated customers only "where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them ....

For instance, we have refused to apply a rule of <i>per se </i>illegality to vertical nonprice restraints "because of their potential for a simultaneous reduction of intrabrand competition and stimulation of interbrand competition," <i>Continental T. </i>V:, <i>Inc. </i>v. <i>GTE Sylvania Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/36/case.html">433 U. S. 36</a>, 51-52 (1977), the latter of which we described as "the primary concern of antitrust law," <i>id., </i>at 52, n. 19. We noted, for instance, that "new manufacturers and manufacturers entering new markets can use the restrictions in order to induce competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind of investment of capital and labor that is often required in the distribution of products unknown to the consumer," and that "[e]stablished manufacturers can use them</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="502">502</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>to induce retailers to engage in promotional activities or to provide service and repair facilities necessary to the efficient marketing of their products." <i>Id., </i>at 55.

The same assumptions, in my opinion, should govern our analysis of ties alleged to have been "forced" solely through intrabrand market power. In the absence of interbrand power, a manufacturer\'s bundling of aftermarket products may serve a multitude of legitimate purposes: It may facilitate manufacturer efforts to ensure that the equipment remains operable and thus protect the seller\'s business reputation, see <i>United States </i>v. <i>Jerrold Electronics Corp., </i>187 F. Supp., at 560; it may create the conditions for implicit consumer financing of the acquisition cost of the tying equipment through supracompetitively-priced aftermarket purchases, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>A. Oxenfeldt, Industrial Pricing and Market Practices 378 (1951); and it may, through the resultant manufacturer control of aftermarket activity, "yield valuable information about component or design weaknesses that will materially contribute to product improvement," 3 Areeda &amp; Turner\' 733c, at 258-259; see also <i>id., , </i>829d, at 331-332. Because the interbrand market will generally punish intrabrand restraints that consumers do not find in their interest, we should not-under the guise of a <i>per se </i>rule-condemn such potentially procompetitive arrangements simply because of the antitrust defendant\'s inherent power over the unique parts for its own brand.</p><p>I would instead evaluate the aftermarket tie alleged in this case under the rule of reason, where the tie\'s <i>actual </i>anticompetitive effect in the tied product market, together with its potential economic benefits, can be fully captured in the analysis, see, <i>e. g., Jefferson Parish, </i>466 U. S., at 41 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment). Disposition of this case does not require such an examination, however, as respondents apparently waived any rule-of-reason claim they</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="503">503</a></p><p>may have had in the District Court. I would thus reverse the Ninth Circuit\'s judgment on the tying claim outright.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>These considerations apply equally to respondents\' \xc2\xa7 2 claims. An antitrust defendant lacking relevant "market power" sufficient to permit invocation of the <i>per se </i>prohibition against tying <i>a fortiori </i>lacks the monopoly power that warrants heightened scrutiny of his allegedly exclusionary behavior. Without even so much as asking whether the purposes of \xc2\xa7 2 are implicated here, the Court points to Kodak\'s control of "100% of the parts market and 80% to 95% of the service market," markets with "no readily available substitutes," <i>ante, </i>at 481, and finds that the proffer of such statistics is sufficient to fend off summary judgment. But this showing could easily be made, as I have explained, with respect to virtually any manufacturer of differentiated products requiring aftermarket support. By permitting antitrust plaintiffs to invoke \xc2\xa7 2 simply upon the unexceptional demonstration that a manufacturer controls the supplies of its single-branded merchandise, the Court transforms \xc2\xa7 2 from a specialized mechanism for responding to extraordinary agglomerations (or threatened agglomerations) of economic power to an all-purpose remedy against run-of-themill business torts.</p><p>In my view, if the interbrand market is vibrant, it is simply not necessary to enlist \xc2\xa7 2\'s machinery to police a seller\'s intrabrand restraints. In such circumstances, the interbrand market functions as an infinitely more efficient and more precise corrective to such behavior, rewarding the seller whose intrabrand restraints enhance consumer welfare while punishing the seller whose control of the after markets is viewed unfavorably by interbrand consumers.
