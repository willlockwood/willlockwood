CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Montana to bring up for review the judgment in a suit where there was not a trial by jury.  Under the Act of April 7, 1874, c. 80, \xc2\xa7 2, 18 Stat. \xc2\xa7 8, p. 27, the case should have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 119 U. S. 237</a></p><p> been brought up by appeal, and the writ of error is therefore dismissed.  <em>Hecht v. Boughton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/105/235/case.html">105 U.
