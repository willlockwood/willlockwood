JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioner in this case presents a claim that evidence offered against him at his trial should have been suppressed because it was seized at night-time in violation of governing statutory provisions.  The search which led to the seizure was conducted by officers of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department at approximately 9:30 p.m. within the District of Columbia.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 416 U. S. 432</a></p><p> Armed with a search warrant, the officers entered petitioner\'s apartment for the purpose of discovering violations of a federal narcotics statute, and seized a substantial amount of contraband narcotics.  The parties urge upon us differing theories concerning which federal or District of Columbia statute bears on the legality of this search, and we must therefore interpret and reconcile several recent congressional enactments dealing with night-time searches which seem to embody somewhat inconsistent views. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court\'s description of this congeries of statutes as a "<em>bramblebush of uncertainties and contradictions,\'" [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and a mere summary of the statutes attests to the accuracy of that observation:\n</em></p>\n<p><em>District of Columbia Statutes:</em>  The older of the two conceivably relevant District of Columbia statutes, D.C.Code \xc2\xa7 33-414 (1973), [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] was enacted in 1956, and authorizes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 416 U. S. 433</a></p><p> search warrants for violations of the District of Columbia narcotics laws.  This section does not limit the time during which searches may be made, stating plainly that "[t]he judge or commissioner shall insert a direction in the warrant that it may be served at any time in the day or night."  This liberal time provision is in direct contrast to the more restrictive provisions of the second </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 416 U. S. 434</a></p><p> District of Columbia statute to be considered, D.C.Code 23-521(f)(5), [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] which specifically requires that search warrants be served in the daytime unless certain conditions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 416 U. S. 435</a></p><p> set forth in \xc2\xa7 23-522(c)(1) are met.  These conditions essentially require a showing of special need to search at night, and concededly have not been satisfied in this case. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 416 U. S. 436</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Federal Statutes and Rules:</em>  The general provision governing federal search warrants is found in Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 41. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  At the time the search in this case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 416 U. S. 437</a></p><p> took place, Rule 41(c) provided that warrants must be served in the daytime except where "the affidavits are positive that the property is on the person or in the place to be searched." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In such event, the warrant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 416 U. S. 438</a></p><p> could direct "that it be served at any time."  This provision was incorporated in the Rules in 1948 as a replacement for language previously contained in the Espionage Act of 1917. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  A second federal statute relating only to searches for "controlled substances" is found in 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a), [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] which was enacted in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 416 U. S. 439</a></p><p> 1970.  That section provides that a warrant may be served "at any time of the day or night" so long as the issuing authority "is satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that grounds exist for the warrant and for its service at such time."  This provision, in turn, is the successor to a provision in 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1405 (1964 ed.), [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] enacted in 1956 to relax the "positivity" test of Rule 41 in cases involving certain narcotic drugs. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Congress had passed this statute in response to the complaints of law enforcement officers that the positivity requirement gave commercial narcotics dealers a definite advantage over federal agents.  Rule 41 is therefore not applicable to searches governed by the more specific narcotic search statutes. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 416 U. S. 440</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The facts of this case must be understood in the context of these statutes.  On February 11, 1971, an Assistant United States Attorney applied to a United States Magistrate sitting in the District of Columbia for a warrant authorizing a search of petitioner\'s apartment for evidence of illegal narcotics.  The application included the brief notation:  "Violation:  U.S.C.; Title 26. Sections:  4704a."  In connection with the application, an officer of the Metropolitan Police Department vice squad appeared before the Magistrate and swore that he had reason to believe petitioner was concealing property held in violation of that same code provision. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4441">Page 416 U. S. 4441</a></p><p> The officer supplemented his personal testimony with a written affidavit, outlining the basis for the application in more detail and alleging specifically that "illegal drugs are sold and possessed in violation of the United States Code, Title 26, Section 4704a." [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The affidavit concluded with the language:   "I am positive that Lonnie Gooding is secreting narcotics inside his apartment at 1419 Chapin Street NW in violation of the US Code."</p>\n<p>The Magistrate then issued a warrant directing the Chief of Police or "any member of MPDC" to search petitioner\'s apartment. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The warrant specifically noted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 416 U. S. 442</a></p><p> that facts had been set forth in an affidavit alleging a violation of 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4704(a) (1964 ed.) and that those facts established probable cause to make the search.  The warrant also stated that the search could be made "at any time in the day or night."  This phrase was accompanied by a footnote reference to Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 41(c), presumably because the police officer had asserted he was "positive" the drugs were in petitioner\'s apartment.  One of the briefs filed in this case suggests that the warrant form was preprinted, and contemplated application of Rule 41 standards. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The search warrant was executed on February 12, 1971, at 9:30 p.m. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The officers engaged in the search were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 416 U. S. 443</a></p><p> all members of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, and the search uncovered a substantial quantity of contraband narcotic materials.  They were seized and formed the basis for charging petitioner with violations of 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4704(a) (1964 ed.) [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] and 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 174 (1964 ed.). [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Following his indictment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on April 6, 1971, petitioner filed a motion to suppress the evidence discovered in the February 12 search.</p>\n<p>Several grounds were asserted in support of the motion, particularly that</p>\n<p>"[t]he search warrant was executed at night, but the application for the warrant did not comply with the D.C.Code provisions for night-time search </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 416 U. S. 444</a></p><p> warrants. . . . [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]"</p>\n<p>Although no provisions of the D.C.Code were explicitly referred to, petitioner\'s argument apparently was that Title 23 of the D.C.Code, requiring that a special showing of need be made to justify a search at night, governed this search, and that its requirements had not been met.  The District Court found this reasoning persuasive and granted the motion to suppress.  Rejecting the Government\'s argument that the warrant was not issued under Title 23, but rather under 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a), the court stated:</p>\n<p>"Whatever be the standards generally for issuance of a night-time search warrant in federal narcotics cases in other parts of the country, however, the Court finds that the existence of 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a) does not remove such cases from the explicit requirements for search warrants in the District of Columbia under the newly enacted Title 23, D.C.Code. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]"</p>\n<p>Having decided that District of Columbia law applied, the District Court admitted to some uncertainty about the status of D.C.Code \xc2\xa7 33-414, the provision dealing specifically with violations of local drug laws.  The court noted with some puzzlement that no mention of this provision was found in the legislative history of Title 23, and that some language in the legislative history suggested that the provision had simply been overlooked. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Nevertheless, the court determined that</p>\n<p>"[p]ending prompt review of this determination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 416 U. S. 445</a></p><p> or congressional action, and pending interpretation of 33 D.C.Code \xc2\xa7 414(h) in light of the new Title 23 provisions, search warrants which are to be executed in the night-time should comply in all respects with 23 D.C.Code \xc2\xa7 523(b). [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]"</p>\n<p>Concededly the warrant issued in this case did not comply with the requirements of Title 23.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District Court, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] although none of the three judges who composed the panel completely agreed with any other on the proper rationale.  All three agreed, however, that 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a), rather than any provision of the District of Columbia Code, was the provision which determined the legality of this search.  All three likewise agreed that the affidavit submitted by the District of Columbia police officer satisfied the requirements of that section.  Judge Wilkey and Judge Fahy found that no greater showing for a night-time search was required by \xc2\xa7 879(a) than was required by its predecessor statute governing federal narcotics searches, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1405 (1964 ed.), and that the affidavit need establish only probable cause to believe that the property would be on the premises at the time of the search. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Judge Robinson believed that \xc2\xa7 879(a) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 416 U. S. 446</a></p><p> did require an additional showing for a night-time search, but concluded that such a showing had been made in this case. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner urges that we reverse the Court of Appeals on either or both of two alternative grounds.  First, petitioner repeats his assertion, sustained by the District Court, that Title 23 of the D.C.Code is the statute applicable to the search in this case and that, as the Government has conceded, the requirements of that title have not been satisfied.  Second, petitioner argues that, if 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a) is considered to be the applicable provision, a special showing for night-time searches must be made.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a) is the statute applicable to this case, and that its provisions have been satisfied here. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The unique situation of the District of Columbia, for which Congress legislates both specially and as a part </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 416 U. S. 447</a></p><p> of the Nation, gives rise to the principal difficulties in this case.  For we deal here not with statutory schemes enacted by independent legislative bodies, but with possibly overlapping schemes enacted by a single body.  Despite the potential overlap, however, we think that the operative facts surrounding this search strongly indicate that the standards for issuance of a warrant should be governed by the nationwide federal legislation enacted by Congress -- that is, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a) [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] -- rather than by the local D.C. laws.  To begin with, an Assistant United States Attorney, who had discretion to proceed either under federal or under local law, filed the application for the search warrant alleging a violation of the United States Code.  Application was made to a United States Magistrate located in the United States District Court building, and neither the application nor the supporting affidavits contained any mention of the local narcotics laws.  After the materials were seized, petitioner was indicted for violations of federal law.</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends, however, that Title 23 of the D.C.Code should apply to this case because the executing officers, as well as the officer swearing to the affidavit presented to the Magistrate, were not federal officers, but officers of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department.  He argues that the provisions of 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a) were intended to apply solely to agents of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, none of whom were involved here, whereas Title 23 of the D.C.Code was intended to provide comprehensive regulation of District of Columbia police officers investigating both local and federal offenses.  Petitioner reinforces his argument by noting that the former federal statute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 416 U. S. 448</a></p><p> regulating drug searches specifically provided that</p>\n<p>"a search warrant may be directed to any officer of the Metropolitan Police of the District of Columbia authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing a violation of any of such provisions, [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]"</p>\n<p>while no such section appears in 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879.  Therefore, says petitioner, the District of Columbia police were no longer to be considered federal agents for the purpose of enforcing federal drug laws.</p>\n<p>Although petitioner\'s arguments cannot be dismissed lightly, we find them ultimately unpersuasive.  Concededly there are hints in the statutory framework and legislative history of the Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, that indicate the policing function under those provisions would be the primary responsibility of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  But this focus on the Bureau\'s role seems entirely natural in view of one of the Act\'s stated purposes to</p>\n<p>"collect the diverse drug </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 416 U. S. 449</a></p><p> control and enforcement laws under one piece of legislation to facilitate law enforcement, drug research, educational and related control facilities. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]"</p>\n<p>In providing a comprehensive federal scheme for the control of drug abuse, Congress could be expected to pay special attention to the federal agency set up to enforce the laws.  But this attention does not mean that Congress at the same time wished to dispense with the aid of other enforcement personnel who had previously given assistance.</p>\n<p>The failure of Congress to include a special provision authorizing District of Columbia police officers to obtain search warrants for investigating federal offenses cannot be taken as a deliberate exclusion in view of the overall statutory framework.  The provision included in the previous federal statute may well have seemed unnecessary, both in light of the history of cooperation between the District of Columbia police and federal officers and in view of the provisions of D.C.Code \xc2\xa7 138, providing that</p>\n<p>"[a]ny warrant for search or arrest, issued by any magistrate of the District, may be executed in any part of the District by any member of the police force. . . . [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]"</p>\n<p>Thus, both custom and statute already assured the availability of District of Columbia police.  Furthermore, the legislative history relating to \xc2\xa7 879(a) stresses the need for stronger enforcement of the federal narcotics laws, a goal hardly advanced by reducing the forces available to execute those laws.  In fact, the provision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 416 U. S. 450</a></p><p> which is now \xc2\xa7 879(b), permitting "no-knock" searches under certain conditions, was one of the most controversial sections of the entire bill, and was defended primarily by the pressing need for added enforcement weapons to combat the increased drug traffic. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, the interpretation urged by petitioner would leave District of Columbia officers able to execute general federal search warrants under amended Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 41, but would deny them that authority under the federal drug search statute.  Rule 41 now provides that "a federal law enforcement officer" -- defined in the Rule to include "any category of officers authorized by the Attorney General to request the issuance of a search warrant" -- may make applications under the Rule.  The Attorney General has since listed the Metropolitan Police Department among those agencies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 416 U. S. 451</a></p><p> which are so authorized. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  If petitioner\'s contention were accepted, it would seemingly mean that the general search warrant statute applicable to the District of Columbia would govern District of Columbia police officers investigating federal drug cases, but would not govern them when investigating other federal crimes.  This result would obtain despite the fact that District of Columbia police officers historically played a prominent role in the enforcement of federal drug laws under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1405 (1964 ed.).</p>\n<p>There is little indication that Title 23 of the D.C.Code was intended to serve the sweeping purpose which petitioner attributes to it. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  The search warrant provisions upon which petitioner relies were part of the Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act, which substantially reorganized the District of Columbia court system, providing for a new local court of general jurisdiction and relieving the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of much of its local burden. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  Prior to that time, all local felonies had been tried in the United States District Court, and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, by their terms, had applied.  The creation of the new Superior Court created the need for a new set of procedural </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 416 U. S. 452</a></p><p> rules, and, though some important changes were made, the new rules quite closely tracked the Federal Rules.  It does not seem unreasonable, therefore, to suggest that the general provision relating to search warrants, found in D.C.Code \xc2\xa7 2521 <em>et seq.</em> and then incorporated in similar form into the rules [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>] promulgated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 416 U. S. 453</a></p><p> Feb. 1, 1971, for the new Superior Court, was intended to be a counterpart to Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 41.  The Federal Rule, as discussed <em>infra</em> did not apply to narcotics cases in the federal courts, since more specific provisions, first those of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1405 (1964 ed.) and then those of 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a) controlled. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Federal Rule 41 has been subsequently modified to more closely resemble the District of Columbia statute and rule.  The new Federal Rule, though less specific than the local rule, provides that a search warrant must be served in the daytime,</p>\n<p>"unless the issuing authority, by appropriate provision in the warrant, and for reasonable cause shown, authorizes its execution at times other than daytime,"</p>\n<p>and abandons the old, cumbersome positivity standard.  The concern for individual privacy revealed in the provisions of the District of Columbia search statute may thus be found in the new Federal Rule as well, but Congress, as it had in the earlier version of the Rule, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="454">Page 416 U. S. 454</a></p><p> nevertheless showed its clear intention to leave intact other special search warrant provisions, including, of course, the provisions relating to searches for controlled substances. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  In those limited cases, Congress has considered the need for privacy to be counterbalanced by the public need for more effective law enforcement.  We do not believe that Congress, by enacting a general search warrant provision for the District of Columbia, has struck a different balance in federal drug cases simply because District of Columbia police officers are involved.</p>\n<p>We therefore conclude, as did all the judges of the Court of Appeals, that the statute applicable to this case is 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a).  Our remaining task is to determine whether the requirements of that section have been met.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>"A search warrant relating to offenses involving controlled substances may be served at any time of the day or night if the judge or United States magistrate issuing the warrant is satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that grounds exist for the warrant and for its service at such time."</p>\n<p>21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a).</p>\n<p>Only the last seven words of the statute are really in controversy here.  Petitioner contends that this language, not found in the predecessor statute, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1405 (1964 ed.), was intended to require some special showing of need for searches conducted at night, rather than during the day.  His contention was adopted, at least in part, by Judge Robinson in the Court of Appeals.  The Government, on the other hand, contends that it must show only probable cause to believe that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 416 U. S. 455</a></p><p> sought-after property will be on the premises at the time of the search, and that, if there is probable cause to believe the property will be on the premises at night, such a showing sufficiently meets the requirement imposed by the last seven words of \xc2\xa7 879(a).</p>\n<p>The language of the statute by itself is not crystal clear on this issue.  Petitioner insists that the last phrase requires with unmistakable clarity a separate finding of probable cause to justify a night-time search.  Thus, according to petitioner, the issuing magistrate would have to satisfy himself that there was not only probable cause for the search, but also probable cause for believing that the search should be conducted at night-time, rather than during the daytime.  While this is a possible meaning, it is by no means the only possible meaning attributable to the words.</p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s interpretation really assumes that the statute reads:  "There is probable cause to believe that grounds exist for the warrant and, <em>if served at night,</em> for its service at such time."  But the statute does not include the italicized four words; it makes no distinction whatever between day and night, and, literally read, would apparently require that a special showing be made for a daytime search as well.  The idea that a particularized showing must be made for searches in the daytime is completely novel, and lacks even a single counterpart in other search statutes enacted by Congress.</p>\n<p>Petitioner suggests that, since Congress was concerned about the greater intrusion resulting from night-time searches, it would be logical to apply the language, "probable cause . . . for its service at such time," only to night-time searches.  But even this interpretation, which is by no means a literal reading of the language, is not wholly convincing.  The traditional limitation placed on night-time searches, as evident from the earlier </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 416 U. S. 456</a></p><p> language of Rule 41, is to require not that there be probable cause for searching at night, but that the affiant be positive that the property is, in fact, located on the property to be searched.  Thus, Congress\' very choice of the words "probable cause" would indicate that the earlier limitation of "positivity" was not to apply, while offering no other immediately ascertainable standard for what should constitute "probable cause" for executing a search warrant during the night.</p>\n<p>This roundabout way of limiting night-time searches, if that were, in fact, the statute\'s intent, would sharply contrast with the manner in which Congress has required special showings for night-time searches in other statutes.  For example, Title 23 of the D.C.Code, discussed <em>supra,</em> specifies that the warrant "be executed <em>during the hours of daylight</em>" (emphasis added) unless certain itemized conditions are met.   Federal Rule Crim.Proc. 41, as amended in 1972, states:</p>\n<p>"The warrant <em>shall be served in the daytime</em> unless the issuing authority, by appropriate provision in the warrant, and for reasonable cause shown, authorizes its execution at times other than daytime."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  The fact that Congress, when it has intended to require such special showings for night-time searches, has done so in language largely free from ambiguity militates against petitioner\'s assertion that the language of \xc2\xa7 879(a), on its face, supports his position.</p>\n<p>The legislative history lends no support to petitioner\'s interpretation, but, in fact, cuts the other way.  Both the House and the Senate Committee Reports on the bill incorporated a summary prepared by the Department of Justice, where much of the bill\'s drafting had taken place, which stated:</p>\n<p>"Section 702(a) [now \xc2\xa7 879(a)] incorporates 18 U.S.C. [\xc2\xa7] 1405 and authorizes service of a search </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 416 U. S. 457</a></p><p> warrant at any time of the day or night if probable cause has been established to the satisfaction of the judge or U.S. magistrate issuing the warrant. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]"</p>\n<p>As previously noted, \xc2\xa7 1405 provided that a search warrant could be served at any time of the day or night so long as the issuing officer was "satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that the grounds for the application exist. . . ."  Case law had uniformly interpreted the language to mean that probable cause for the warrant itself was all that was necessary for a night-time search. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  The officers or agents simply had to establish probable cause for believing that the sought-after property would be found in the place to be searched.</p>\n<p>There is no suggestion in any of the hearings or debates before Congress that a change from the prior law in this area was intended.  The provision itself went unmentioned in the debates and hearings on the bill, a surprising omission if the bill effected the cutback petitioner says it did.  Of like import is the fact that, in the long and heated discussions over \xc2\xa7 702(b), the so-called "no-knock" provision of the bill, no defender of the bill saw fit to argue that any greater intrusion caused by the no-knock provision would be partially offset by the greater difficulty in obtaining warrants executable at night. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  While congressional silence as to a particular provision of a bill during debates which give extensive consideration to neighboring provisions is not easy to interpret, it would be unusual for such a significant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 416 U. S. 458</a></p><p> change as that proposed by petitioner to have entirely escaped notice.</p>\n<p>Finally, it is important to note that the Department of Justice itself submitted this bill to Congress for enactment, including \xc2\xa7 879(a) in its present form.  Since the hearings and debates stress that a major purpose of the bill was to supply more effective enforcement tools to combat the increasing use of narcotic drugs, it seems totally illogical to suggest that the Department of Justice would submit a bill making it substantially more difficult to control the traffic in hard drugs.  Petitioner suggests that this surrender was necessary to convince Congress to bring additional drugs within the Controlled Substances Act, but that theory rests entirely on speculation.  There is absolutely no indication in the legislative history that any price had to be paid for what was thought to be a much-desired reorganization and expansion of the drug laws, much less the substantial price that petitioner argues had to be paid here.</p>\n<p>We therefore conclude that 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a) requires no special showing for a night-time search, other than a showing that the contraband is likely to be on the property or person to be searched at that time. [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  We believe that the showing was met in this case.  The affidavit submitted by the District of Columbia police officer suggested that there was a continuing traffic of drugs from petitioner\'s apartment, and a prior purchase through an informer had confirmed that drugs were available.  This was sufficient to satisfy 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a).  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="459">Page 416 U. S. 459</a></p><p></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government contends that, even though we were to determine that the applicable statutory provision was violated in this case, the evidence should nonetheless not be suppressed.

He moved the District Court to suppress certain evidence seized from his home pursuant to a search warrant secured by and directed to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia.  The District Court granted the suppression motion on the ground that the search was conducted at night in violation of D.C.Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 23-521523 (1973) which limit search warrant execution to daylight hours absent specific contrary authorization founded upon the judicial officer\'s determination</p>\n<p>"that (A) it cannot be executed during the hours of daylight, (B) the property sought is likely to be removed or destroyed if not seized forthwith, or (C) the property sought is not likely to be found except at certain times or in certain circumstances. . . ."</p>\n<p>D.C.Code \xc2\xa7 23-522(c)(1).

The police obtained the warrant on February 11, 1971, but they failed to execute it during the day of February 12, waiting instead until 9:30 p.m. on that date.  Since they delayed execution until well after the daylight hours had ended, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 416 U. S. 460</a></p><p> the seizure was invalid if governed by D.C.Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 23-521 to 23-523.</p>\n<p>The Court holds, however, that the D.C.Code provisions are inapplicable, and that the search is governed by 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a).  That section became effective October 27, 1970, as part of the Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 801 <em>et seq.;</em> it relates to search warrants issued in connection with offenses involving controlled substances.  The D.C.Code provisions, however became effective February 11, 1971, as part of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act.  The latter Act did not distinguish between local and federal prosecutions in its procedural innovations. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The purpose of the restriction upon night-time searches was to limit such intrusions to those instances where there is "some justification for it," [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] thus implementing the</p>\n<p>"policy generally disfavoring night-time executions, night-time intrusions, more characteristic of a \'police state\' lacking in the respect for due process and the right of privacy dictated by the U.S. Constitution and history. . . . [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]"</p>\n<p>Approximately 60% of the search warrants issued in the District of Columbia relate to narcotics violations.  Congress was aware of this, and, if it had intended to except federal narcotics search warrants from the protections against unnecessary night-time "police state" searches, one would expect an expression of such intent.  I agree with Judge Gesell that no such intent is indicated.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 416 U.

A majority of the Court, however, rejects this argument, and goes on to discuss the standards imposed by 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879(a) upon issuance of search warrants for night-time execution in federal narcotics cases.  Obviously, the Court\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 879(a) is of far greater significance, of national, rather than purely local, concern.  I cannot let the Court\'s construction of \xc2\xa7 879(a) pass without registering my dissent on this issue as well.</p>\n<p>The opinion of the Court, it seems to me, analyzes the \xc2\xa7 879(a) issue in a vacuum, without any discussion of some of the important policy considerations which underlie this question of statutory interpretation.  Perhaps a partial vacuum would be a more appropriate description, since the Court is obviously fully cognizant of the substantial governmental interest in enforcement of the narcotics laws, an interest which its interpretation of \xc2\xa7 879(a) so well serves.  But plainly there are other concerns implicated in our interpretation of this congressional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 416 U. S. 462</a></p><p> enactment restricting the issuance of search warrants -- the protection of individual privacy which is the very purpose of the statute\'s search warrant requirement and which of course is given constitutional recognition in the Fourth Amendment.  The Court seems totally oblivious to these constitutional considerations.  Taking them into account, I find that the only acceptable interpretation of the statute is one which requires some additional justification for authorizing a night-time search over and above the ordinary showing of probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that evidence of the crime will be found upon the search.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally at issue in this case is the extent of the protection which we will all enjoy from police intrusion into the privacy of our homes during the middle of the night.  The Fourth Amendment was intended to protect our reasonable expectations of privacy from unjustified governmental intrusion.  <em>Katz v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html">389 U. S. 347</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#360">389 U. S. 360</a></span>-362 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring).  In my view, there is no expectation of privacy more reasonable and more demanding of constitutional protection than our right to expect that we will be let alone in the privacy of our homes during the night.  The idea of the police unnecessarily forcing their way into the home in the middle of the night -- frequently, in narcotics cases, without knocking and announcing their purpose -- rousing the residents out of their beds and forcing them to stand by in indignity in their night clothes while the police rummage through their belongings, does indeed smack of a "<em>police state\' lacking in the respect for . . . the right of privacy dictated by the U.S. Constitution."

S. 479</a></span> (1965), was in large part based upon our revulsion at the thought of night-time searches of the marital bedroom to discover evidence of illegal contraceptive use.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#485">381 U. S. 485</a></span>-486.</p>\n<p>It is small wonder, then, that Congress has consistently required more stringent justification for night-time searches than that needed to authorize a search during the day.  The first congressional enactment setting out comprehensive search warrant procedures, \xc2\xa7 10 of Tit. XI of the Espionage Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 217, 229, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 620 (1940 ed.), required that the affiant must be "positive" that the property to be seized was on the premises to justify a night-time search.  When the provisions of the Espionage Act were replaced by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in 1946, this requirement of positivity was carried forward in Rule 41.  Despite the stringency of this requirement, it remained with us until very recently, until the 1972 amendments to Rule 41.  And although the Rule was then modified to require </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 416 U. S. 464</a></p><p> "reasonable cause" for night-time execution of a warrant, significantly, the amended Rule retained the principle that night-time searches require an additional showing of justification over and above probable cause.  Congress has also manifested its concern for protection of individual privacy against night-time searches in its legislation for the District of Columbia, as MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS\' opinion amply demonstrates with respect to enactment of the D.C. Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act in 1970.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/430/case.html#469">416 U. S. 460</a></span>. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The strong policy underlying these congressional enactments is clear.  As even the Government in this case concedes,</p>\n<p>"searches conducted in the middle of the night . . . involve a greater intrusion than ordinary searches and therefore require a greater justification."</p>\n<p>Brief for United States 14.  In my view, this principle may well be a constitutional imperative.  It is by now established Fourth Amendment doctrine that increasingly severe standards of probable cause are necessary to justify increasingly intrusive searches.  In <em>Camara v. Municipal Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html">387 U. S. 523</a></span> (1967), after holding that search warrants were required to authorize administrative inspections, we held that the quantum of probable cause required for issuance of an inspection warrant must be determined in part by the reasonableness of the proposed search.  As MR. JUSTICE WHITE stated,</p>\n<p>"there can be no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html#536">387 U. S. 536</a></span>-537. The Court in <em>Camara</em> thus approved the issuance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 416 U. S. 465</a></p><p> of area inspection warrants in part because such searches "involve a relatively limited invasion of the urban citizen\'s privacy."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html#537">387 U.

I do not regard this principle as a one-way street, to be used only to water down the requirement of probable cause when necessary to authorize governmental intrusions.  In some situations -- and the search of a private home during night-time would seem to be a paradigm -- this principle requires a showing of additional justification for a search over and above the ordinary showing of probable cause.  <em>Cf. Stanford v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/476/case.html">379 U. S. 476</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/476/case.html#485">379 U. S. 485</a></span>-486 (1965).</p>\n<p>Of course, this constitutional question is not presented in this case, and need not be resolved here.  But the long history of congressional authorization of night-time searches only upon a showing of additional justification, the strong constitutionally based policy which these statutes implement, and the substantial constitutional question posed by the majority\'s interpretation of \xc2\xa7 879(a) are surely relevant to the question of statutory interpretation with which we are faced.  Viewed against this background, I think it is plain that the majority\'s interpretation of the statute should be rejected.</p>\n<p>Section 879(a) provides that search warrants may be executed at night only if "there is probable cause to believe that grounds exist for the warrant and for its service at such time."  It seems to me quite clear that the statute, on its face, imposes two distinct requirements:  that there be probable cause for the issuance of the warrant and that there be cause "for its service at such time."  While the Court relies on legislative history which suggests that  879(a) merely "incorporates" the provisions of its predecessor, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1405 (1964 ed.), the plain </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 416 U. S. 466</a></p><p> fact is that \xc2\xa7 879(a) does far more than this:  it also adds to the language of \xc2\xa7 1405 the final clause "and for its service at such time" -- which is at the heart of the dispute in this case.  I can see no plausible interpretation of this final clause other than that it imposes an additional requirement of justification for a search at night over and above a showing of probable cause.</p>\n<p>The Court, while conceding this to be a "possible" meaning of the statute\'s final clause, argues that "it is by no means the only possible meaning attributable to the words."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/430/case.html#455">416 U. S. 455</a></span>.  Unfortunately, the Court then fails to come forward with any alternative interpretation of these final words of \xc2\xa7 879(a).  Instead, the Court simply reads the disputed language out of the statute entirely, and decrees that the statute shall be interpreted as if it were not there.  The Court holds that the statute requires only "a showing that the contraband is likely to be on the property or person to be searched at that time" to justify night-time execution of a search warrant.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/430/case.html#458">416 U. S. 458</a></span>.  But the showing of probable cause required for issuance of any warrant necessarily includes a showing that the objects to be seized will probably be found on the premises at the time of the search.  <em>See Sgro v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/206/case.html">287 U. S. 206</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/206/case.html#210">287 U. S. 210</a></span>-211 (1932); <em>Schoeneman v. United States,</em> 115 U.S.App.D.C. 110, 113, 317 F.2d 173, 176-177 (1963); <em>Rosencranz v. United States,</em> 356 F.2d 310, 315-318 (CA1 1966).  This requirement is clearly imposed by the Fourth Amendment itself.  It is also clearly mandated by the first part of the statutory language, which merely incorporates the constitutional requirement of probable cause for issuance of the warrant.  The majority\'s interpretation of the statute thus leaves the final clause of \xc2\xa7 879(a) -- the language in controversy here -- totally without meaning.  <em>See United States v. Thomas,</em> 294 A.2d 164, 170 (DC Ct.App.) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 416 U.

Gooding,</em> 155 U.S.App.D.C. 259, 273, 477 F.2d 428, 442 (1973) (Robinson, J., concurring in result).  I cannot subscribe to such an evisceration of the statute. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 416 U. S. 468</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court bases its holding upon the meager recorded legislative history of \xc2\xa7 879(a).  But when the language of a statute is as clear and unambiguous as it is here, it is neither helpful nor appropriate to look to its legislative history.  <em>Ex parte Collett,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/55/case.html">337 U. S. 55</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/55/case.html#61">337 U. S. 61</a></span> (1949); <em>United States v.

While committee reports in particular are often a helpful guide to the meaning of ambiguous statutory language, even they must be disregarded if inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.  <em>Helvering v. City Bank Farmers Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/85/case.html">296 U. S. 85</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/85/case.html#89">296 U. S. 89</a></span> (1935); <em>George Van Camp &amp; Sons Co. v.

It is the language of the statute, as enacted by the Congress, that is the law of the land, not the language of a committee report which may or may not represent accurately the views of the hundreds of other legislators who voted for the bill.</p>\n<p>In any event, even if resort to examination of the legislative history were appropriate here, I do not find it nearly so conclusive as does the majority of the Court.  The Court relies on a single brief statement on \xc2\xa7 879(a) in the committee report stating that the statute merely incorporated the provisions of \xc2\xa7 1405, which had been construed not to impose any requirement for a night-time search warrant over and above probable cause.  Yet this statement fails to provide any explanation for the language which Congress added to \xc2\xa7 1405, the language </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 416 U. S. 469</a></p><p> in controversy here.  As to the meaning -- or, as the Court would have it, the lack of meaning -- of this language, the Court relies basically upon the law enforcement goals of the Department of Justice and the silence of Congress.  But, as we have frequently warned, "[i]t is, at best, treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law."  <em>Girouard v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/61/case.html">328 U. S. 61</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/61/case.html#69">328 U. S. 69</a></span> (1946); <em>see</em> H. M. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process:Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 1395-1398 (tent.ed.1958), and cases there cited.  The Court in effect presumes from Congress\' failure to explain the meaning of the final clause of \xc2\xa7 879(a) its acquiescence in the Justice Department\'s apparent view that this language, in fact, serves no purpose.</p>\n<p>I would presume the contrary.  Congress\' consistent protection of night-time privacy by imposing restrictions upon the availability of warrants for night-time searches reinforces the unambiguous statutory language.  Both lead me to the conclusion that the final clause of 879(a) must be viewed as another congressional manifestation of its strong policy against night-time intrusions into the home.  I do not think that this interpretation is at all inconsistent with the narcotics law enforcement objectives which were the principal focus of this legislation.  The requirement that cause be shown for the necessity of a night-time search is still a substantial easing of the requirement of positivity which was then embodied in Rule 41, and which would otherwise have applied to many of the searches now covered by \xc2\xa7 879(a).  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Similarly, most of the States\' laws provide that search warrants may only be served during the day unless express authorization for a night-time search is obtained, and such authorization can generally be obtained only by meeting special requirements for a night-time search.  <em>See</em> L. Hall, Y. Kamisar, W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Modern Criminal Procedure 259 (3d ed.1969).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>In an effort to conjure up ambiguity in the statutory language, the Court argues that the statute could have been drawn with more precision, and specifically points out that, read literally, the statutory requirement of cause "for its service at such time" would seem to apply to daytime searches as well as those conducted at night.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/430/case.html#455">416 U. S. 455</a></span>-456.  I readily agree that the statute could have been more artfully drafted, but the fact that it could have been stated in different words hardly justifies disregarding the plain meaning of the statutory language with which we must deal.  It ill-suits the Court to suggest that this language is ambiguous when the Court is unable to come forward with any plausible alternative construction.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s suggestion that the statute is ambiguous because it could be literally applied to daytime searches as well as those during the night is wholly insubstantial.  As the Court well knows, no one has ever proposed that an additional burden of justification for daytime searches is necessary or appropriate; in sharp contrast, the Congress has consistently acted to protect night-time privacy through such an additional burden on night-time searches.  The Court\'s confusion arises only because the words "at such time" in the statute logically refer back to its authorization of service "at any time of the day or night."  But this latter phrase has consistently been used in congressional enactments as a shorthand expression for a warrant whose service at night is authorized, <em>see, e.g.,</em> D.C.Code \xc2\xa7 33-414(h), <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/430/case.html#433">416 U. S. 433</a></span> n. 3; \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 23-521(f)(5), 23-522(c)(1), <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/430/case.html#435">416 U.

S. 436</a></span>-437, n. 5, to distinguish such a warrant from any other warrant, which may be served only in the day.  Plainly the statute\'s requirement of cause "for its service at such time" was intended to apply only to night-time execution of search warrants.</p>\n<p>As for the Court\'s complaint that a requirement of cause for night-time service of a warrant is not the "traditional limitation" imposed upon night-time searches, it should suffice to point out that Congress became aware in its consideration of the D.C. Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act in 1969 that a requirement of cause would provide greater protection for night-time privacy than the old positivity test, by eliminating unnecessary night-time searches regardless of how sure police were of their basis for the search.  <em>See</em> Hearings on Crime in the National Capital before the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 4, p. 1404 (1969); Brief for United States 49-50.  This change was therefore incorporated into the D.C.Code, <em>see</em> D.C.Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 23-521 to 23-523.  It was also adopted in the 1972 amendment to Rule 41.  It would hardly be surprising for the Congress to introduce a modification along the same lines into \xc2\xa7 79(a).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
