The CWA defines "navigable waters" as "the waters of the United States," 33 U. S.

The Chicago Gravel Company informed the municipalities of the availability of a 533-acre parcel, bestriding the Illinois counties Cook and Kane, which had been the site of a sand and gravel pit mining operation for three decades up until about 1960. Long since abandoned, the old mining site eventually gave way to a successional stage forest, with its remnant excavation trenches evolving into a scattering of permanent and seasonal ponds of varying size (from under one-tenth of an acre to several acres) and depth (from several inches to several feet).</p><p>The municipalities decided to purchase the site for disposal of their baled nonhazardous solid waste. By law, SWANCC was required to file for various permits from Cook County and the State of Illinois before it could begin operation of its balefill project. In addition, because the operation called for the filling of some of the permanent and seasonal ponds, SWANCC contacted federal respondents (hereinafter respondents), including the Corps, to determine if a federal landfill permit was required under \xc2\xa7 404(a) of the CW A, 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1344(a).</p><p>Section 404(a) grants the Corps authority to issue permits "for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites." <i>Ibid. </i>The term "navigable waters" is defined under the Act as "the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas." \xc2\xa7 1362(7). The Corps has issued regulations defining the term "waters of the United States" to include</p><blockquote><p>\n"waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce ....

However, after the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission informed the Corps that a number of migratory bird species had been observed at the site, the Corps reconsidered and ultimately asserted jurisdiction over the balefill site pursuant to subpart (b) of the "Migratory Bird Rule." The Corps found that approximately 121 bird species had been observed at the site, including several known to depend upon aquatic environments for a significant portion of their life requirements. Thus, on November 16,1987, the Corps formally "determined that the seasonally ponded, abandoned gravel mining depressions located on the project site, while not wetlands, did qualify as \'waters of the United States\' ... based upon the following criteria: (1) the proposed site had been abandoned as a gravel mining operation; (2) the water areas and spoil piles had developed a natural character; and (3) the water areas</p><p>1 The Corps issued the "Migratory Bird Rule" without following the notice and comment procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.

Its balefill project ultimately received the necessary local and state approval. By 1993, SWANCC had received a special use planned development permit from the Cook County Board of Appeals, a landfill development permit from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and approval from the Illinois Department of Conservation.</p><p>Despite SWANCC\'s securing the required water quality certification from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the Corps refused to issue a \xc2\xa7 404(a) permit. The Corps found that SWANCC had not established that its proposal was the "least environmentally damaging, most practicable alternative" for disposal of nonhazardous solid waste; that SWANCC\'s failure to set aside sufficient funds to remediate leaks posed an "unacceptable risk to the public\'s drinking water supply"; and that the impact of the project upon area-sensitive species was "unmitigatable since a landfill surface cannot be redeveloped into a forested habitat." <i>Id., </i>at 87.</p><p>Petitioner filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 701 <i>et seq., </i>in the Northern District of Illinois challenging both the Corps\' jurisdiction over the site and the merits of its denial of the \xc2\xa7 404(a) permit. The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents on the jurisdictional issue, and petitioner abandoned its challenge to the Corps\' permit decision. On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, petitioner renewed its attack on respondents\' use of the "Migratory Bird Rule" to assert jurisdiction over the site. Petitioner argued that respondents had exceeded their statutory authority in interpreting</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="166">166</a></p><p>the CW A to cover nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters based upon the presence of migratory birds and, in the alternative, that Congress lacked the power under the Commerce Clause to grant such regulatory jurisdiction.</p><p>The Court of Appeals began its analysis with the constitutional question, holding that Congress has the authority to regulate such waters based upon "the cumulative impact doctrine, under which a single activity that itself has no discernible effect on interstate commerce may still be regulated if the aggregate effect of that class of activity has a substantial impact on interstate commerce." <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/191/845/">191 F.3d 845</a>, 850 (CA7 1999). The aggregate effect of the "destruction of the natural habitat of migratory birds" on interstate commerce, the court held, was substantial because each year millions of Americans cross state lines and spend over a billion dollars to hunt and observe migratory birds.2 <i>Ibid. </i>The Court of Appeals then turned to the regulatory question. The court held that the CW A reaches as many waters as the Commerce Clause allows and, given its earlier Commerce Clause ruling, it therefore followed that respondents\' "Migratory Bird Rule" was a reasonable interpretation of the Act.

Relevant here, \xc2\xa7 404(a) authorizes respondents to regulate the discharge of fill material into "navigable waters," 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1344(a), which the statute defines as "the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas," \xc2\xa7 1362(7). Respondents have interpreted these words to cover the abandoned gravel pit at issue here because it is used as habitat for migratory birds. We conclude that the "Migratory Bird Rule" is not fairly supported by the CW A.</p><p>This is not the first time we have been called upon to evaluate the meaning of \xc2\xa7 404(a). In <i>United States </i>v. <i>Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/121/case.html">474 U. S. 121</a> (1985), we held that the Corps had \xc2\xa7 404(a) jurisdiction over wetlands that actually abutted on a navigable waterway. In so doing, we noted that the term "navigable" is of "limited import" and that Congress evidenced its intent to "regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed \'navigable\' under the classical understanding of that term." <i>Id., </i>at 133.

But we conclude that the text of the statute will not allow this.</p><p>Indeed, the Corps\' <i>original </i>interpretation of the CW A, promulgated two years after its enactment, is inconsistent with that which it espouses here. Its 1974 regulations defined \xc2\xa7 404(a)\'s "navigable waters" to mean "those waters of the United States which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, and/or are presently, or have been in the past, or may be in the future susceptible for use for purposes of interstate or foreign commerce." 33 CFR \xc2\xa7 209.120(d)(1). The Corps emphasized that "[i]t is the water body\'s capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation or commerce which is the determinative factor." \xc2\xa7 209.260(e)(1). Respondents put forward no persuasive evidence that the Corps mistook Congress\' intent in 1974.3</p><p>Respondents next contend that whatever its original aim in 1972, Congress charted a new course five years later when it approved the more expansive definition of "navigable waters" found in the Corps\' 1977 regulations. In July 1977, the Corps formally adopted 33 CFR \xc2\xa7 323.2(a)(5) (1978), which defined "waters of the United States" to include "isolated wetlands and lakes, intermittent streams, prairie potholes, and other waters that are not part of a tributary system to interstate waters or to navigable waters of the United States, the degradation or destruction of which could affect</p><p>3 Respondents refer us to portions of the legislative history that they believe indicate Congress\' intent to expand the definition of "navigable waters." Although the Conference Report includes the statement that the conferees "intend that the term \'navigable waters\' be given the broadest possible constitutional interpretation," S. Conf. Rep. No. 92-1236, p. 144 (1972), neither this, nor anything else in the legislative history to which respondents point, signifies that Congress intended to exert anything more than its commerce power over navigation.

Respondents argue that Congress was aware of this more expansive interpretation during its 1977 amendments to the CW A. Specifically, respondents point to a failed House bill, H.

" 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1344(g)(1). The failure to pass legislation that would have overturned the Corps\' 1977 regulations and the extension of jurisdiction in \xc2\xa7 404(g) to waters "other than" traditional "navigable waters," respondents submit, indicate that Congress recognized and accepted a broad definition of "navigable waters" that includes nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters.</p><p>Although we have recognized congressional acquiescence to administrative interpretations of a statute in some situations, we have done so with extreme care.5 "[F]ailed legis-</p><p>4 While this bill passed in the House, a similarly worded amendment to a bill originating in the Senate, S. 1952, failed.

A bill can be proposed for any number of reasons, and it can be rejected for just as many others. The relationship between the actions and inactions of the 95th Congress and the intent of the 92d Congress in passing \xc2\xa7 404(a) is also considerably attenuated. Because "subsequent history is less illuminating than the contemporaneous evidence," <i>Hagen </i>v. <i>Utah, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/510/399/case.html">510 U.

Although respondents cite some legislative history showing Congress\' recognition of the Corps\' assertion of jurisdiction over "isolated waters,"6 as we explained in <i>Riverside Bayview Homes, </i>"[i]n both Chambers, debate on the proposals to narrow the definition of navigable waters centered largely on the issue of wetlands preservation." 474 U.

See S. Rep. No. 95370, p. 75 (1977). However, the same report reiterated that "[t]he committee amendment does not redefine navigable waters." <i>Ibid.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="171">171</a></p><p>late wetlands adjacent to "navigable waters," respondents point us to no persuasive evidence that the House bill was proposed in response to the Corps\' claim of jurisdiction over nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters or that its failure indicated congressional acquiescence to such jurisdiction.</p><p>Section 404(g) is equally unenlightening. In <i>Riverside Bayview Homes </i>we recognized that Congress intended the phrase "navigable waters" to include "at least some waters that would not be deemed \'navigable\' under the classical understanding of that term." <i>Id., </i>at 133. But \xc2\xa7 404(g) gives no intimation of what those waters might be; it simply refers to them as "other ... waters." Respondents conjecture that "other ... waters" must incorporate the Corps\' 1977 regulations, but it is also plausible, as petitioner contends, that Congress simply wanted to include all waters adjacent to "navigable waters," such as nonnavigable tributaries and streams. The exact meaning of \xc2\xa7 404(g) is not before us and we express no opinion on it, but for present purposes it is sufficient to say, as we did in <i>Riverside Bayview Homes, </i>that "\xc2\xa7 404(g)(1) does not conclusively determine the construction to be placed on the use of the term \'waters\' elsewhere in the Act (particularly in \xc2\xa7 502(7), which contains the relevant definition of \'navigable waters\') .... " <i>Id., </i>at 138, n. 11.7</p><p>We thus decline respondents\' invitation to take what they see as the next ineluctable step after <i>Riverside Bayview Homes: </i>holding that isolated ponds, some only seasonal, wholly located within two Illinois counties, fall under \xc2\xa7 404(a)\'s definition of "navigable waters" because they serve</p><p>7 Respondents also make a passing reference to Congress\' decision in 1977 to exempt certain types of discharges from \xc2\xa7 404(a), including, for example, "discharge of dredged or fill material ... for the purpose of construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, or the maintenance of drainage ditches." \xc2\xa7 67, 91 Stat. 1600, 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1344(f)(C). As \xc2\xa7 404(a) only regulates dredged or fill material that is discharged "into navigable waters," Congress\' decision to exempt certain types of these discharges does not affect, much less address, the definition of "navigable waters."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="172">172</a></p><p>as habitat for migratory birds. As counsel for respondents conceded at oral argument, such a ruling would assume that "the use of the word navigable in the statute ... does not have any independent significance." Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. We cannot agree that Congress\' separate definitional use of the phrase "waters of the United States" constitutes a basis for reading the term "navigable waters" out of the statute. We said in <i>Riverside Bayview Homes </i>that the word "navigable" in the statute was of "limited import," 474 U. S., at 133, and went on to hold that \xc2\xa7 404(a) extended to nonnavigable wetlands adjacent to open waters. But it is one thing to give a word limited effect and quite another to give it no effect whatever. The term "navigable" has at least the import of showing us what Congress had in mind as its authority for enacting the CW A: its traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made. See, <i>e. g., United States </i>v. <i>Appalachian Elec. Power Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/311/377/case.html">311 U. S. 377</a>, 407-408 (1940).</p><p>Respondents-relying upon all of the arguments addressed above-contend that, at the very least, it must be said that Congress did not address the precise question of \xc2\xa7 404(a)\'s scope with regard to nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters, and that, therefore, we should give deference to the "Migratory Bird Rule." See, <i>e. g., Chevron U. </i>S. <i>A. Inc. </i>v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984). We find \xc2\xa7 404(a) to be clear, but even were we to agree with respondents, we would not extend <i>Chevron </i>deference here.</p><p>Where an administrative interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress\' power, we expect a clear indication that Congress intended that result. See <i>Edward </i>J. <i>DeBartolo Corp. </i>v. <i>Florida Gulf Coast Building </i>&amp; <i>Constr. Trades Council, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/case.html">485 U. S. 568</a>, 575 (1988). This requirement stems from our prudential desire not to needlessly reach constitutional issues and our assumption that Congress does not casually authorize administrative agencies to interpret a</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="173">173</a></p><p>statute to push the limit of congressional authority. See <i>ibid. </i>This concern is heightened where the administrative interpretation alters the federal-state framework by permitting federal encroachment upon a traditional state power. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Bass, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/case.html">404 U. S. 336</a>, 349 (1971) ("[U]nless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance"). Thus, "where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress." <i>DeBartolo, supra, </i>at 575.</p><p>Twice in the past six years we have reaffirmed the proposition that the grant of authority to Congress under the Commerce Clause, though broad, is not unlimited. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Morrison, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/case.html">529 U. S. 598</a> (2000); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Lopez, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/case.html">514 U. S. 549</a> (1995). Respondents argue that the "Migratory Bird Rule" falls within Congress\' power to regulate intrastate activities that "substantially affect" interstate commerce. They note that the protection of migratory birds is a "national interest of very nearly the first magnitude," <i>Missouri </i>v. <i>Holland, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/252/416/case.html">252 U. S. 416</a>, 435 (1920), and that, as the Court of Appeals found, millions of people spend over a billion dollars annually on recreational pursuits relating to migratory birds. These arguments raise significant constitutional questions. For example, we would have to evaluate the precise object or activity that, in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. This is not clear, for although the Corps has claimed jurisdiction over petitioner\'s land because it contains water areas used as habitat by migratory birds, respondents now, <i>post litem motam, </i>focus upon the fact that the regulated activity is petitioner\'s municipal landfill, which is "plainly of a commercial nature." Brief for Federal Respondents 43. But this is a far cry, indeed, from the "navigable waters" and "waters of the United States" to which the statute by its terms extends.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="174">174</a></p><p>174 SOLID WASTE AGENCY OF NORTHERN COOK CTY. <i>v. </i>ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS</p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>These are significant constitutional questions raised by respondents\' application of their regulations, and yet we find nothing approaching a clear statement from Congress that it intended \xc2\xa7 404(a) to reach an abandoned sand and gravel pit such as we have here.

The Court\'s past interpretations of the CWA have been fully consistent with that goal. Although Congress\' vision of zero pollution remains unfulfilled, its pursuit has unquestionably retarded the destruction of the aquatic environment. Our Nation\'s waters no longer burn. Today, however, the Court takes an unfortunate step that needlessly weakens our principal safeguard against toxic water.</p><p>It is fair to characterize the Clean Water Act as "watershed" legislation. The statute endorsed fundamental changes in both the purpose and the scope of federal regulation of the Nation\'s waters. In \xc2\xa7 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (RHA), 30 Stat. 1152, as amended, 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 407, Congress had assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) the mission of regulating discharges into certain waters in order to protect their use as highways for the transportation of interstate and foreign commerce; the scope of the Corps\' jurisdiction under the RHA accordingly extended only to waters that were "navigable." In the CWA, however, Congress broadened the Corps\' mission to include the purpose of protecting the quality of our Nation\'s waters for esthetic, health, recreational, and environmental uses. The scope of its jurisdiction was therefore redefined to encompass all of "the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas." \xc2\xa7 1362(7).

App. to Pet. for Cert. in <i>Riverside Bayview </i>25a. The wetlands characteristics of the parcel were due, not to a surface or groundwater connection to any actually navigable water, but to "poor drainage" resulting from "the Lamson soil that underlay the property." Brief for Respondent in <i>Riverside Bayview </i>7. Nevertheless, this Court found occasional surface runoff from the property into nearby waters to constitute a meaningful connection. <i>Riverside Bayview, </i>474 U.

Of course, the <i>ecological </i>connection between the wetlands and the nearby waters also played a central role in this Court\'s decision. <i>Riverside Bayview, </i>474 U. S., at 134-135. Both types of connection are also present in many, and possibly most, "isolated" waters. Brief for Dr. Gene Likens et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>6-22.

Federal regulation of the Nation\'s waters began in the 19th century with efforts targeted exclusively at "promot[ing] water transportation and commerce." Kalen, Commerce to Conservation: The Call for a National Water Policy and the Evolution of Federal Jurisdiction Over Wetlands, 69 N. D. L. Rev. 873, 877 (1993). This goal was pursued through the various Rivers and Harbors Acts, the most comprehensive of which was the RHA of 1899.3 Section 13 of the 1899 RHA, commonly known as the Refuse Act, prohibited the discharge of "refuse" into any "navigable water" or its tributaries, as well as the deposit of "refuse" on the bank of a navigable water "whereby navigation shall or may be impeded or obstructed" without first obtaining a permit from the Secretary of the Army. 30 Stat. 1152.</p><p>3 See also Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1896, 29 Stat. 234; River and Harbor Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 363; River and Harbor Appropriations Act of 1890, 26 Stat. 426; The River and Harbor Appropriations Act of 1886, 24 Stat. 329.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="178">178</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>During the middle of the 20th century, the goals of federal water regulation began to shift away from an exclusive focus on protecting navigability and toward a concern for preventing environmental degradation. Kalen, 69 N. D. L. Rev., at 877-879, and n. 30. This awakening of interest in the use of federal power to protect the aquatic environment was helped along by efforts to reinterpret \xc2\xa7 13 of the RHA in order to apply its permit requirement to industrial discharges into navigable waters, even when such discharges did nothing to impede navigability. See, <i>e. g., United States </i>v. <i>Republic Steel Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/482/case.html">362 U. S. 482</a>, 490-491 (1960) (noting that the term "refuse" in \xc2\xa7 13 was broad enough to include industrial waste).4 Seeds of this nascent concern with pollution control can also be found in the FWPCA, which was first enacted in 1948 and then incrementally expanded in the following years.5</p><p>4 In 1970, the House Committee on Government Operations followed the Court\'s lead and advocated the use of \xc2\xa7 13 as a pollution control provision. H. R. Rep. No. 91-917, pp. 14-18 (1970). President Nixon responded by issuing Executive Order No. 11574,35 Fed. Reg. 19627 (1970) (revoked by Exec. Order No. 12553,51 Fed. Reg. 7237 (1986)), which created the Refuse Act Permit Program. Power, The Fox in the Chicken Coop: The Regulatory Program of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, 63 Va. L. Rev. 503, 512 (1977) (hereinafter Power). The program ended soon after it started, however, when a District Court, reading the language of \xc2\xa7 13 literally, held the permit program invalid. <i>Ibid.; </i>see <i>Kalur </i>v. <i>Resor, </i>335 F.

None of these early versions of the FWPCA could fairly be described as establishing a comprehensive approach to the problem, but they did contain within themselves several of the elements that would later be employed in the CWA. <i>Milwaukee </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html">451 U.

A House sponsor described the bill as "the most comprehensive and far-reaching water pollution bill we have ever drafted," 1 Leg. Hist. 369 (Rep. Mizell), and Senator Randolph, Chairman of the Committee on Public Works, stated: "It is perhaps the most comprehensive legislation that the Congress of the United States has ever developed in this particular field of the environment." 2 id., at 1269. This Court was therefore undoubtedly correct when it described the 1972 amendments as establishing "a comprehensive program for controlling and abating water pollution." <i>Train </i>v. <i>City of New York, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/35/case.html">420 U.

A comparison of the contents of the RHA and the 1972 Act vividly illustrates the fundamental difference between the purposes of the two provisions. The earlier statute contains pages of detailed appropriations for improvements in specific navigation facilities, 30 Stat. 1121-1149, for studies concerning the feasibility</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="180">180</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, id., at 1150, and for surveys of the advisability of harbor improvements at numerous other locations, id., at 1155-1161. Tellingly, \xc2\xa7 13, which broadly prohibits the discharge of refuse into navigable waters, contains an exception for refuse "flowing from streets and sewers ... in a liquid state." <i>Id., </i>at 1152.</p><p>The 1972 Act, in contrast, appropriated large sums of money for research and related programs for water pollution control, 86 Stat. 816-833, and for the construction of water treatment works, id., at 833-844. Strikingly absent from its declaration of "goals and policy" is <i>any </i>reference to avoiding or removing obstructions to navigation. Instead, the principal objective of the Act, as stated by Congress in \xc2\xa7 101, was "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\'s waters." 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1251. Congress therefore directed federal agencies in \xc2\xa7 102 to "develop comprehensive programs for preventing, reducing, or eliminating the pollution of the navigable waters and ground waters and improving the sanitary condition of surface and underground waters." 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1252. The CWA commands federal agencies to give "due regard," not to the interest of unobstructed navigation, but rather to "improvements which are necessary to conserve such waters for the protection and propagation of fish and aquatic life and wildlife [and] recreational purposes." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Because of the statute\'s ambitious and comprehensive goals, it was, of course, necessary to expand its jurisdictional scope. Thus, although Congress opted to carryover the traditional jurisdictional term "navigable waters" from the RHA and prior versions of the FWPCA, it broadened the definition of that term to encompass all "waters of the United States." \xc2\xa7 1362(7).6 Indeed, the 1972 conferees arrived at the final formulation by specifically deleting the</p><p>6 The definition of "navigable water" in earlier versions of the FWPCA had made express reference to navigability. \xc2\xa7 211, 80 Stat. 1253.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="181">181</a></p><p>word "navigable" from the definition that had originally appeared in the House version of the Act.7 The majority today undoes that deletion.</p><p>The Conference Report explained that the definition in \xc2\xa7 502(7) was intended to "be given the broadest possible constitutional interpretation."

The statement, it claims, "signifies that Congress intended to exert [nothing] more than its commerce power over navigation." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The majority\'s reading drains all meaning from the conference amendment. By 1972, Congress\' Commerce Clause power over "navigation" had long since been established. <i>The Daniel Ball, </i>10 Wall. 557 (1871); <i>Gilman </i>v. <i>Philadelphia, </i>3 Wall. 713 (1866); <i>Gibbons </i>v. <i>Ogden, </i>9 Wheat. 1 (1824). Why should Congress intend that its assertion of federal jurisdiction be given the "broadest possible constitutional interpretation" if it did not intend to reach beyond the very heartland of its commerce power? The activities regulated by the CWA have nothing to do with Congress\' "commerce power over navigation." Indeed, the goals of the 1972 statute have nothing to do with <i>navigation </i>at all.</p><p>As we recognized in <i>Riverside Bayview, </i>the interests served by the statute embrace the protection of " \'significant natural biological functions, including food chain production, general habitat, and nesting, spawning, rearing and resting sites\'" for various species of aquatic wildlife. 474 U.

Nothing in the text, the stated purposes, or the legislative history of the CW A supports the conclusion that in 1972 Congress contemplated-much less commanded-the odd jurisdictional line that the Court has drawn today.</p><p>The majority accuses respondents of reading the term "navigable" out of the statute. <i>Ante, </i>at 172. But that was accomplished by Congress when it deleted the word from the \xc2\xa7 502(7) definition. After all, it is the <i>definition </i>that is the appropriate focus of our attention. <i>Babbitt </i>v. <i>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/515/687/case.html">515 U. S. 687</a>, 697-698, n. 10 (1995) (refusing to be guided by the common-law definition of the term "take" when construing that term within the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and looking instead to the meaning of the terms contained in the definition of "take" supplied by the statute). Moreover, a proper understanding of the history of federal water pollution regulation makes clear that-even on respondents\' broad reading-the presence of the word "navigable" in the statute is not inexplicable. The term was initially used in the various Rivers and Harbors Acts because (1) at the time those statutes were first enacted, Congress\' power over the Nation\'s waters was viewed as extending only to "water bodies that were deemed \'navigable\' and therefore suitable for moving goods to or from markets," Power 513; and (2) those statutes had the primary purpose of protecting navigation. Congress\' choice to employ the term "navigable waters" in the 1972 Clean Water Act simply continued nearly a century of usage. Viewed in light of the history of federal water regulation, the broad \xc2\xa7 502(7) definition, and Congress\' unambiguous instructions in the Conference Report, it is clear that the term "navigable waters" operates in the statute as a shorthand for "waters over which federal authority may properly be asserted."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="183">183</a></p><p>II</p><p>As the majority correctly notes, <i>ante, </i>at 168, when the Corps first promulgated regulations pursuant to \xc2\xa7 404 of the 1972 Act, it construed its authority as being essentially the same as it had been under the 1899 RHA.8 The reaction to those regulations in the federal courts,9 in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),l0 and in Congress 11 convinced</p><p>8The Corps later acknowledged that the 1974 regulations "limited the Section 404 permit program to the same waters that were being regulated under the River and Harbor Act of 1899." 42 Fed.

Although refusing to defer to the Corps\' <i>present </i>interpretation of the statute, <i>ante, </i>at 172, the majority strangely attributes some significance to the Corps\' <i>initial </i>reluctance to read the 1972 Act as expanding its jurisdiction, <i>ante, </i>at 168 ("Respondents put forward no persuasive evidence that the Corps mistook Congress\' intent in 1974"). But, stranger still, by construing the statute as extending to nonnavigable tributaries and adjacent wetlands, the majority reads the statute more broadly than the 1974 regulations that it seems willing to accept as a correct construction of the Corps\' jurisdiction. As I make clear in the text, there is abundant evidence that the Corps was wrong in 1974 and that the Court is wrong today.</p><p>9 See, e. g., Natural Resources Defense Council v. Callaway, 392 F.

Reg. 31320 (1975).</p><p>In 1975, the Corps therefore adopted the interim regulations that we upheld in <i>Riverside Bayview. </i>As we noted in that case, the new regulations understood "the waters of the United States" to include, not only navigable waters and their tributaries, but also "nonnavigable intrastate waters whose use or misuse could affect interstate commerce." 474 U. S., at 123. The 1975 regulations provided that the new program would become effective in three phases: phase 1, which became effective immediately, encompassed the navigable waters covered by the 1974 regulation and the RHA; phase 2, effective after July 1, 1976, extended Corps jurisdiction to nonnavigable tributaries, freshwater wetlands adjacent to primary navigable waters, and lakes; and phase 3, effective after July 1, 1977, extended Corps jurisdiction to all other waters covered under the statute, including any waters not covered by phases 1 and 2 (such as "intermittent rivers, streams, tributaries, and perched wetlands that are not contiguous or adjacent to navigable waters") that "the District Engineer determines necessitate regulation for the protection of water quality." 40 Fed. Reg. 31325-31326 (1975). The final version of these regulations, adopted in 1977, made clear that the covered waters included "isolated lakes and wetlands, intermittent streams, prairie potholes, and other waters that are not part of a tributary system to interstate waters or to navigable waters of the United States, the degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate commerce." 12</p><p>1242 Fed.

As a result, in 1977, Congress considered a proposal that would have limited the Corps\' jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 404 to waters that are used, or by reasonable improvement could be used, as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce and their adjacent wetlands. H. R. 3199, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa7 16(f) (1977). A bill embodying that proposal passed the House but was defeated in the Senate. The debates demonstrate that Congress was fully aware of the Corps\' understanding of the scope of its jurisdiction under the 1972 Act. We summarized these debates in our opinion in <i>Riverside Bayview:</i></p><blockquote><p>\n"In both Chambers, debate on the proposals to narrow the definition of navigable waters centered largely on the issue of wetlands preservation. See [123 Congo Rec.], at 10426-10432 (House debate); id., at 26710-26729 (Senate debate). Proponents of a more limited \xc2\xa7 404 jurisdiction contended that the Corps\' assertion of jurisdiction over wetlands and other nonnavigable \'waters\' had far exceeded what Congress had intended in enacting \xc2\xa7 404. Opponents of the proposed changes argued that a narrower definition of \'navigable waters\' for purposes of \xc2\xa7 404 would exclude vast stretches of crucial wetlands from the Corps\' jurisdiction, with detrimental effects on wetlands ecosystems, water quality, and the aquatic environment generally. The debate, particularly in the Senate, was lengthy. In the House, the debate ended with the adoption of a narrowed definition of</p></blockquote><p>rules. The "rule," which operates as a rule of thumb for identifying the waters that fall within the Corps\' jurisdiction over phase 3 waters, first appeared in the preamble to a 1986 repromulgation of the Corps\' definition of "navigable waters." 51 Fed. Reg. 41217 (1986). As the Corps stated in the preamble, this repromulgation was not intended to alter its jurisdiction in any way. <i>Ibid. </i>Instead, the Corps indicated, the migratory bird rule was enacted simply to "clarif[y]" the scope of existing jurisdictional regulations. <i>Ibid.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="186">186</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><blockquote><p>\n\'waters\'; but in the Senate the limiting amendment was defeated and the old definition retained. The Conference Committee adopted the Senate\'s approach: efforts to narrow the definition of \'waters\' were abandoned; the legislation as ultimately passed, in the words of Senator Baker, \'retain[ed] the comprehensive jurisdiction over the Nation\'s waters exercised in the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\'" 474 U. S., at 136-137.</p></blockquote><p>The net result of that extensive debate was a congressional endorsement of the position that the Corps maintains today. We explained in <i>Riverside Bayview:</i></p><blockquote><p>\n"[T]he scope of the Corps\' asserted jurisdiction over wetlands was specifically brought to Congress\' attention, and Congress rejected measures designed to curb the Corps\' jurisdiction in large part because of its concern that protection of wetlands would be unduly hampered by a narrowed definition of \'navigable waters.\' Although we are chary of attributing significance to Congress\' failure to act, a refusal by Congress to overrule an agency\'s construction of legislation is at least some evidence of the reasonableness of that construction, particularly where the administrative construction has been brought to Congress\' attention through legislation specifically designed to supplant it." <i>Id., </i>at 137.</p></blockquote><p>Even if the majority were correct that Congress did not extend the Corps\' jurisdiction in the 1972 CW A to reach beyond navigable waters and their nonnavigable tributaries, Congress\' rejection of the House\'s efforts in 1977 to cut back on the Corps\' 1975 assertion of jurisdiction clearly indicates congressional acquiescence in that assertion. Indeed, our broad determination in <i>Riverside Bayview </i>that the 1977 Congress acquiesced in the very regulations at issue in this case should foreclose petitioner\'s present urgings to the contrary. The majority\'s refusal in today\'s decision to acknowledge the scope of our prior decision is troubling.

").13 Having already concluded that Congress acquiesced in the Corps\' regulatory definition of its jurisdiction, the Court is wrong to reverse course today. See <i>Dickerson </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/case.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 443 (2000) (REHNQUIST, C. J.)

Instead of agreeing with those who sought to withdraw the Corps\' jurisdiction over "isolated" waters,</p><p>13 The majority appears to believe that its position is consistent with <i>Riverside Bayview </i>because of that case\'s reservation of the question whether the Corps\' jurisdiction extends to "certain wetlands not necessarily adjacent to other waters," 474 U. S., at 124, n. 2. But it is clear from the context that the question reserved by <i>Riverside Bayview </i>did not concern "isolated" <i>waters, </i>such as those at issue in this case, but rather "isolated" <i>wetlands. </i>See <i>id., </i>at 131-132, n.8 ("We are not called upon to address the question of the authority of the Corps to regulate discharges of fill material into wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of open water ... "). Unlike the open waters present on petitioner\'s site, wetlands are <i>lands </i>"that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas." 33 CFR \xc2\xa7 328.3(b) (2000). If, as I believe, actually navigable waters lie at the very heart of Congress\' commerce power and "isolated," nonnavigable waters lie closer to (but well within) the margin, "isolated wetlands," which are themselves only marginally "waters," are the most marginal category of "waters of the United States" potentially covered by the statute. It was the question of the extension of federal jurisdiction to <i>that </i>category of "waters" that the <i>Riverside Bayview </i>Court reserved. That question is not presented in this case.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="188">188</a></p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>Congress opted to exempt several classes of such waters from federal control. \xc2\xa7 67, 91 Stat. 1601, 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1344(f). For example, the 1977 amendments expressly exclude from the Corps\' regulatory power the discharge of fill material "for the purpose of construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, or the maintenance of drainage ditches," and "for the purpose of construction of temporary sedimentation basins on a construction site which does not include placement of fill material into the navigable waters." <i>Ibid. </i>The specific exemption of these waters from the Corps\' jurisdiction indicates that the 1977 Congress recognized that similarly "isolated" waters not covered by the exceptions would fall within the statute\'s outer limits.</p><p>In addition to the enumerated exceptions, the 1977 amendments included a new section, \xc2\xa7 404(g), which authorized the States to administer their own permit programs over certain nonnavigable waters. Section 404(g)(1) provides, in relevant part:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The Governor of any State desiring to administer its own individual and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters (other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce ... , including wetlands adjacent thereto) within its jurisdiction may submit to the Administrator a full and complete description of the program it proposes to establish and administer under State law or under an interstate compact." 33 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1344(g)(1).</p></blockquote><p>Section 404(g)(1)\'s reference to navigable waters "other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use," for transporting commerce and their adjacent wetlands appears to suggest that Congress viewed (and accepted) the Act\'s regulations as covering more than naviga-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="189">189</a></p><p>ble waters in the traditional sense. The majority correctly points out that \xc2\xa7 404(g)(1) is itself ambiguous because it does not indicate precisely how far Congress considered federal jurisdiction to extend. <i>Ante, </i>at 171. But the Court ignores the provision\'s legislative history, which makes clear that Congress understood \xc2\xa7 404(g)(1)-and therefore federal jurisdiction-to extend, not only to navigable waters and nonnavigable tributaries, but also to "isolated" waters, such as those at issue in this case.</p><p>The Conference Report discussing the 1977 amendments, for example, states that \xc2\xa7 404(g) "establish[es] a process to allow the Governor of any State to administer an individual and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into <i>phase </i>;12 <i>and </i>3 <i>waters </i>after the approval of a program by the Administrator."

No. 95-14, p. 285 (emphasis added) (hereinafter Leg. Hist. of CW A). Similarly, a Senate Report discussing the 1977 amendments explains that, under \xc2\xa7 404(g), "the [C]orps will <i>continue </i>to administer the section 404 permit program in all navigable waters for a discharge of dredge or fill material until the approval of a State program <i>for phase </i>;12 <i>and </i>3 <i>waters." </i>S.

But the majority fails to point out that the quoted language appears in the course of an explanation of the Senate\'s refusal to go along with House efforts to <i>narrow the scope </i>of the Corps\' CW A jurisdiction to traditionally navigable waters. Thus, the immediately preceding sentence warns that "[t]o limit the jurisdiction of the [FWPCA] with reference to discharges of the pollutants of dredged or fill material would cripple efforts to achieve the act\'s objectives." 14 <i>Ibid. </i>The Court would do well to heed that warning.</p><p>The majority also places great weight, <i>ante, </i>at 171, on our statement in <i>Riverside Bayview </i>that \xc2\xa7 404(g) "does not <i>con-</i></p><p>14 In any event, to attach significance to the Report\'s statement that the committee amendments do not "redefine navigable waters," one must first accept the majority\'s erroneous interpretation of the 1972 Act.

Even if the Court\'s flawed reading of the earlier statute were correct, however, the language to which the Court points does not counsel against finding congressional acquiescence in the Corps\' 1975 regulations. Quite the contrary. From the perspective of the 1977 Congress, those regulations constituted the status quo that the proposed amendments sought to alter. Considering the Report\'s favorable references to the Corps\' "continu[ing]" jurisdiction over phase 2 and 3 waters, the language concerning the failure of the amendments to "redefine navigable waters" cuts strongly against the majority\'s position, which instead completely excises phase 3 waters from the scope of the Act. <i>Ibid.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="191">191</a></p><p><i>elusively </i>determine the construction to be placed on the use of the term \'waters\' elsewhere in the Act," 474 U.

Faced with calls to cut back on federal jurisdiction over water pollution, Congress rejected attempts to narrow the scope of that jurisdiction and, by incorporating \xc2\xa7 404(g), opted instead for a scheme that encouraged States to supplant federal control with their own regulatory programs. S. Rep. No. 95-370, at 75, reprinted in 4 Leg. Hist. of CWA 708 ("The committee amendment does not redefine navigable waters. Instead, the committee amendment intends to assure continued protection of <i>all the Nation\'s waters, </i>but allows States to assume the primary responsibility for protecting those lakes, rivers, streams, swamps, marshes, and other portions of the navigable waters outside the [C]orps program in the so-called phase I waters" (emphasis added)). Because Illinois could have taken advantage of the opportunities offered to it through \xc2\xa7 404(g), the federalism concerns to which the majority adverts are misplaced. The Corps\' interpretation of the statute as extending beyond navigable waters, tributaries of navigable waters, and wetlands adjacent to each is manifestly reasonable and therefore entitled to deference.</p><p align="center">\nIV</p><p>Because I am convinced that the Court\'s miserly construction of the statute is incorrect, I shall comment briefly on petitioner\'s argument that Congress is without power to prohibit it from filling any part of the 31 acres of ponds on its property in Cook County, Illinois. The Corps\' exercise of its \xc2\xa7 404 permitting power over "isolated" waters that serve as habitat for migratory birds falls well within the boundaries set by this Court\'s Commerce Clause jurisprudence.</p><p>In <i>United States </i>v. <i>Lopez, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/case.html">514 U. S. 549</a>, 558-559 (1995), this Court identified "three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power": (1) channels of interstate commerce; (2) instrumentalities of inter-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="193">193</a></p><p>state commerce, or persons and things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that "substantially affect" interstate commerce. <i>Ibid. </i>The migratory bird rule at issue here is properly analyzed under the third category. In order to constitute a proper exercise of Congress\' power over intrastate activities that "substantially affect" interstate commerce, it is not necessary that each individual instance of the activity substantially affect commerce; it is enough that, taken in the aggregate, the <i>class of activities </i>in question has such an effect. <i>Perez </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/146/case.html">402 U. S. 146</a> (1971) (noting that it is the "class" of regulated activities, not the individual instance, that is to be considered in the "affects" commerce analysis); see also <i>Hodel, </i>452 U. S., at <i>277; Wickard </i>v. <i>Filburn, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/111/case.html">317 U. S. 111</a>, 127-128 (1942).</p><p>The activity being regulated in this case (and by the Corps\' \xc2\xa7 404 regulations in general) is the discharge of fill material into water. The Corps did not assert jurisdiction over petitioner\'s land simply because the waters were "used as habitat by migratory birds." It asserted jurisdiction because petitioner planned to <i>discharge fill </i>into waters "used as habitat by migratory birds." Had petitioner intended to engage in some other activity besides discharging fill (i. <i>e., </i>had there been no activity to regulate), or, conversely, had the waters not been habitat for migratory birds (i. <i>e., </i>had there been no basis for federal jurisdiction), the Corps would never have become involved in petitioner\'s use of its land. There can be no doubt that, unlike the class of activities Congress was attempting to regulate in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Morrison, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/case.html">529 U. S. 598</a>, 613 (2000) ("[g]endermotivated crimes"), and <i>Lopez, </i>514 U. S., at 561 (possession of guns near school property), the discharge of fill material into the Nation\'s waters is almost always undertaken for economic reasons. See V. Albrecht &amp; B.

See, <i>e. </i>g., 1 Secretary of the Interior, Report to Congress, The Impact of Federal Programs on Wetlands: The Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain and the Prairie Pothole Region 79-80 (Oct. 1988) (noting that "isolated," phase 3 waters "are among the most important and also [the] most threatened ecosystems in the United States" because "[t]hey are prime nesting grounds for many species of North American waterfowl ... " and provide "[u]p to 50 percent of the [D. S.] production of migratory waterfowl"). Nor does petitioner dispute that the particular waters it seeks to fill are home to many important species of migratory birds, including the second-largest breeding colony of Great Blue Herons in northeastern Illinois, App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, and several species of waterfowl protected by international treaty and Illinois endangered species laws, Brief for Federal Respondents 7.16</p><p>In addition to the intrinsic value of migratory birds, see <i>Missouri </i>v. <i>Holland, </i>252 D.

As we observed in <i>Perez </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/146/case.html">402 U. S. 146</a> (1971), "[w]here the <i>class of activities </i>is regulated and that <i>class </i>is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to excise, as trivial, individual instances of the class." <i>Id., </i>at 154 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>16 Other bird species using petitioner\'s site as habitat include the" \'Great Egret, Green-backed Heron, Black-crowned Night Heron, Canada Goose, Wood Duck, Mallard, Greater Yellowlegs, Belted Kingfisher, Northern Waterthrush, Louisiana Waterthrush, Swamp Sparrow, and Red-winged Blackbird.\' " Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 3.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="195">195</a></p><p>literally millions of people regularly participate in birdwatching and hunting and that those activities generate a host of commercial activities of great valueP The causal connection between the filling of wetlands and the decline of commercial activities associated with migratory birds is not "attenuated," <i>Morrison, </i>529 U. S., at 612; it is direct and concrete. Cf. <i>Gibbs </i>v. <i>Babbitt, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/214/483/">214 F.3d 483</a>, 492-493 (CA4 2000) ("The relationship between red wolf takings and interstate commerce is quite direct-with no red wolves, there will be no red wolf related tourism ... ").</p><p>Finally, the migratory bird rule does not blur the "distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local." <i>Morrison, </i>529 U. S., at 617-618. Justice Holmes cogently observed in <i>Missouri </i>v. <i>Holland </i>that the protection of migratory birds is a textbook example of a <i>national </i>problem. 252 U. S., at 435 ("It is not sufficient to rely upon the States [to protect migratory birds]. The reliance is vain ... "). The destruction of aquatic migratory bird habitat, like so many other environmental problems, is an action in which the benefits (e. g., a new landfill) are disproportionately local, while many of the costs (e. g., fewer migratory birds) are widely dispersed and often borne by citizens living in other States. In such situations, described by economists as involving "externalities," federal regulation is both appropriate and necessary. Revesz, Rehabilitating Interstate</p><p>17 In 1984, the U. S.

Identifying the Corps\' jurisdiction by reference to waters that serve as habitat for birds that migrate over state lines also satisfies this Court\'s expressed desire for some "jurisdictional element" that limits federal activity to its proper scope. <i>Morrison, </i>529 U.

Migratory birds, and the waters on which they rely, are such resources. Moreover, the protection of migratory birds is a wellestablished federal responsibility. As Justice Holmes noted in <i>Missouri </i>v. <i>Holland, </i>the federal interest in protecting these birds is of "the first magnitude." 252 U. S., at 435.
