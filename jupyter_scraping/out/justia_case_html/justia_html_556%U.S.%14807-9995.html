ILLINOIS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">RIVERA <em>v</em>. ILLINOIS</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the supreme court of illinois</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x939995.\xe2\x80\x83Argued February 23, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 31, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">During jury selection in petitioner Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s state-court first-degree murder trial, his counsel sought to use a peremptory challenge to excuse venire member Deloris Gomez.  Rivera had already exercised two peremptory challenges against women, one of whom was African-American.  It is conceded that there was no basis to challenge Gomez for cause.  She met the requirements for jury service, and Rivera does not contend that she was biased against him.  The trial court rejected the peremptory challenge out of concern that it was discriminatory.  Under <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/index.html">476 U. S. 79</a>, and later decisions applying <em>Batson</em>, parties are constitutionally prohibited from exercising peremptory challenges to exclude jurors based on race, ethnicity, or sex.  At trial, the jury, with Gomez as its foreperson, found Rivera guilty of first-degree murder.  The Illinois Supreme Court subsequently affirmed the conviction, holding that the peremptory challenge should have been allowed, but rejecting Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the improper seating of Gomez was a reversible error.  Observing that the Constitution does not mandate peremptory challenges and that they are not necessary for a fair trial, the court held that the denial of Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenge was not a structural error requiring automatic reversal.  Nor, the court found, was the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  The court added that it did not need to decide whether the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial was \xe2\x80\x9can error of constitutional dimension\xe2\x80\x9d in the circumstances of Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s case, a comment that appears to be related to Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s arguments that, even absent a freestanding constitutional entitlement to peremptory challenges, the inclusion of Gomez on his jury violated the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Provided that all jurors seated in a criminal case are qualified and unbiased, the Due Process Clause does not require automatic reversal of a conviction because of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s good-faith error in denying the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenge to a juror.  Pp.  6\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Rivera maintains that due process requires reversal whenever a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenge is erroneously denied.  He asserts that a trial court that fails to dismiss a lawfully challenged juror commits structural error because the jury becomes an illegally constituted tribunal, whose verdict is <em>per se</em> invalid; that this is true even if the Constitution does not mandate peremptory challenges, since criminal defendants have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in their state-provided peremptory challenge rights; that the issue is not amenable to harmless-error analysis, as it is impossible to ascertain how a properly constituted jury would have decided his case; and that automatic reversal therefore must be the rule as a matter of federal law.  Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s arguments do not withstand scrutiny.  If a defendant is tried before a qualified jury composed of individuals not challengeable for cause, the loss of a peremptory challenge due to a state court\xe2\x80\x99s good-faith error is not a matter of federal constitutional concern.  Rather, it is a matter for the State to address under its own laws.  There is no freestanding constitutional right to peremptory challenges.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, 528 U.S. 304, 311.  They are \xe2\x80\x9ca creature of statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ross</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/81/index.html">487 U. S. 81</a>, 89, which a State may decline to offer at all, <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>McCollum</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/42/index.html">505 U. S. 42</a>, 57.  Thus, the mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, without more, violate the Federal Constitution.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Engle</em> v. <em>Isaac</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/107/index.html">456 U. S. 107</a>, 121, n. 21.  The Due Process Clause safeguards not the meticulous observance of state procedural prescriptions, but \xe2\x80\x9cthe fundamental elements of fairness in a criminal trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Spencer</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/554/index.html">385 U. S. 554</a>, 563\xe2\x80\x93564.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to excuse Gomez did not deprive Rivera of his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.  <em>Ross </em>is instructive.  There, a criminal defendant used a peremptory challenge to rectify an Oklahoma trial court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous denial of a for-cause challenge, leaving him with one fewer peremptory challenge to use at his discretion.  Even though the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error might \xe2\x80\x9chave resulted in a jury panel different from that which would otherwise have decided [Ross\xe2\x80\x99s] case,\xe2\x80\x9d 487 U. S., at 87, because no member of the jury as finally composed was removable for cause, there was no violation of his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury or his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, <em>id</em>., at 86\xe2\x80\x9391.  This Court reached the same conclusion with regard to a federal-court trial in <em>Martinez-Salazar, </em>528 U. S., at 316.  Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to distinguish <em>Ross </em>and <em>Martinez-Salazar</em> are unavailing.  First, although in contrast to Rivera, the <em>Ross </em>and <em>Martinez-Salazar </em>defendants did not challenge any of the jurors who were in fact seated, neither Gomez nor any other member of Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s jury was removable for cause.  Thus, like the <em>Ross </em>and <em>Martinez-Salazar </em>juries, Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s jury was impartial for Sixth Amendment purposes.  Rivera suggests that due process concerns persist because Gomez knew he did not want her on the panel, but this Court rejects the notion that a juror is constitutionally disqualified whenever she is aware of a challenge.  Second, it is not constitutionally significant that, in contrast to <em>Ross</em> and <em>Martinez-Salazar, </em>the seating of Gomez over Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenge was at odds with state law.  Errors of state law do not automatically become violations of due process.  As in <em>Ross </em>and <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, there is no suggestion here that the trial judge repeatedly or deliberately misapplied the law or acted in an arbitrary or irrational manner.  Rather, his conduct reflected a good-faith effort to enforce <em>Batson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidiscrimination requirements.  To hold that a one-time, good-faith misapplication of <em>Batson</em> violates due process would likely discourage trial courts and prosecutors from policing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory use of peremptory challenges.  The Fourteenth Amendment does not compel such a tradeoff.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Rivera errs in insisting that, even without a constitutional violation, the deprivation of a state-provided peremptory challenge requires reversal as a matter of federal law.  He relies on a suggestion in <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/index.html">380 U. S. 202</a>, 219, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he denial or impairment of the right [to exercise peremptory challenges] is reversible error without a showing of prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  This statement was disavowed in <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, see 528 U. S., at 317, n.\xc2\xa04.  Typically, an error is designated as \xe2\x80\x9cstructural,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] automatic reversal,\xe2\x80\x9d only when \xe2\x80\x9cthe error \xe2\x80\x98necessarily render[s] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Recuenco</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/212/index.html">548 U. S. 212</a>, 218\xe2\x80\x93219.  The mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, in the circumstances here, constitute such an error.  The automatic reversal precedents Rivera cites are inapposite.  One set of cases involves <em>constitutional</em> errors concerning the qualification of the jury or judge.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Batson</em>, 476 U. S., at 86, 87.  A second set of cases involves circumstances in which federal<em> </em>judges or tribunals lacked statutory authority to adjudicate the controversy, resulting in a judgment invalid as a matter of federal law.  See<em>, e.g.</em>, <em>Nguyen</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/69/index.html">539 U. S. 69</a>.  Nothing in those decisions suggests that federal law renders state-court judgments void whenever there is a state-law defect in a tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s composition.  Absent a federal constitutional violation, States are free to decide, as a matter of state law, that a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken denial of a peremptory challenge is reversible error <em>per se </em>or, as the Illinois Supreme Court implicitly held here, that the improper seating of a competent and unbiased juror could rank as a harmless error under state law.

If all seated jurors are qualified and unbiased, does the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nonetheless require automatic reversal of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following a jury trial in an Illinois state court, defendant-petitioner Michael Rivera was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to a prison term of 85 years.  On appeal, Rivera challenged the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of his peremptory challenge to venire member Deloris Gomez.  Gomez sat on Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s jury and indeed served as the jury\xe2\x80\x99s foreperson.  It is conceded that there was no basis to challenge Gomez for cause.  She met the requirements for jury service, and Rivera does not contend that she was in fact biased against him.  The Supreme Court of Illinois held that the peremptory challenge should have been allowed, but further held that the error was harmless and therefore did not warrant reversal of Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  We affirm the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The right to exercise peremptory challenges in state court is determined by state law.  This Court has \xe2\x80\x9clong recognized\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cperemptory challenges are not of federal constitutional dimension.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/304/index.html">528 U. S. 304</a>, 311 (2000).  States may withhold peremptory challenges \xe2\x80\x9caltogether without impairing the constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury and a fair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>McCollum</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/42/index.html">505 U. S. 42</a>, 57 (1992).  Just as state law controls the existence and exercise of peremptory challenges, so state law determines the consequences of an erroneous denial of such a challenge.  Accordingly, we have no cause to disturb the Illinois Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that, in the circumstances Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s case presents, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error did not warrant reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rivera was charged with first-degree murder in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.  The State alleged that Rivera, who is Hispanic, shot and killed Marcus Lee, a 16-year-old African-American, after mistaking Lee for a member of a rival gang.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During jury selection, Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s counsel questioned prospective juror Deloris Gomez, a business office supervisor at Cook County Hospital\xe2\x80\x99s outpatient orthopedic clinic.  App. 32\xe2\x80\x9333.  Gomez stated that she sometimes interacted with patients during the check-in process and acknowledged that Cook County Hospital treats many gunshot victims.  She maintained, however, that her work experience would not affect her ability to be impartial.  After questioning Gomez, Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s counsel sought to use a peremptory challenge to excuse her.  <em>Id.</em>, at 33.  At that point in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s selection, Rivera had already used three peremptory challenges.  Two of the three were exercised against women; one of the two women thus eliminated was African-American.  Illinois law affords each side seven peremptory challenges.  See Ill. Sup. Ct. Rule 434(d) (West 2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than dismissing Gomez, the trial judge called counsel to chambers, where he expressed concern that the defense was discriminating against Gomez.  App. 34\xe2\x80\x9336.  Under <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/index.html">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986), and later decisions building upon <em>Batson</em>, parties are constitutionally prohibited from exercising peremptory challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex.  Without specifying the type of discrimination he suspected or the reasons for his concern, the judge directed Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s counsel to state his reasons for excusing Gomez.  Counsel responded, first, that Gomez saw victims of violent crime on a daily basis.  Counsel next added that he was \xe2\x80\x9cpulled in two different ways\xe2\x80\x9d because Gomez had \xe2\x80\x9csome kind of Hispanic connection given her name.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 34.  At that point, the judge interjected that Gomez \xe2\x80\x9cappears to be an African American\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the second \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican American female\xe2\x80\x9d the defense had struck.  <em>Id</em>., at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  Dissatisfied with counsel\xe2\x80\x99s proffered reasons, the judge denied the challenge to Gomez, but agreed to allow counsel to question Gomez further.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After asking Gomez additional questions about her work at the hospital, Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s counsel renewed his challenge.  Counsel observed, outside the jury\xe2\x80\x99s presence, that most of the jurors already seated were women.  Counsel said he hoped to \xe2\x80\x9cget some impact from possibly other men in the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 39.  The court reaffirmed its earlier ruling, and Gomez was seated on the jury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s case proceeded to trial.  The jury, with Gomez as its foreperson, found Rivera guilty of first-degree murder.  A divided panel of the Appellate Court of Illinois rejected Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Batson </em>ruling and affirmed his conviction.  348 Ill. App. 3d 168, 810 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 129 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Supreme Court of Illinois accepted Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s petition for leave to appeal and remanded for further proceedings.  221 Ill. 2d 481, 852 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 771 (2006).  A trial judge, the court held, may raise a <em>Batson </em>issue <em>sU. S.onte</em> only when there is a prima facie case of discrimination.  Concluding that the record was insufficient to evaluate the existence of a prima facie<em> </em>case, the court instructed the trial judge to articulate the bases for his <em>Batson </em>ruling and, in particular, to clarify whether the alleged discrimination was on the basis of race, sex, or both.  221 Ill. 2d, at 515\xe2\x80\x93516, 852 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 791.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the trial judge stated that prima facie<em> </em>evidence of sex discrimination\xe2\x80\x94namely, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s two prior challenges to women and \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of [counsel\xe2\x80\x99s] questions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94had prompted him to raise the <em>Batson </em>issue.  App. 136.  Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s stated reasons for challenging Gomez, the judge reported, convinced him that that \xe2\x80\x9cthere had been a purposeful discrimination against Mrs. Gomez because of her gender.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 137.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case then returned to the Illinois Supreme Court. Although that court disagreed with the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s assessment, it affirmed Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  227 Ill. 2d 1, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 876 (2007).  The Illinois High Court concluded \xe2\x80\x9cthat the record fails to support a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination <em>of any kind</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 15, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 884.  Accordingly, the court determined, the trial judge erred, first in demanding an explanation from Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, and next, in denying Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenge of Gomez.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even so, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate argument that the improper seating of Gomez ranked as \xe2\x80\x9creversible error without a showing of prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 16, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 885 (quoting <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/index.html"></a><a href="/us/380/202/index.html">380 U. S. 202</a>, 219 (1965)).  Citing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s guiding decisions, the Illinois court observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution does not confer a right to peremptory challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d  227 Ill. 2d, at 17, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 885 (quoting <em>Batson</em>, 476 U. S., at 91).  Although \xe2\x80\x9cperemptory challenges are \xe2\x80\x98<em>one </em>means of assuring the selection of a qualified and unbiased jury,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained, they are not \xe2\x80\x9cindispensable to a fair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  227 Ill. 2d, at 16, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 885 (quoting <em>Batson</em>, 476 U. S., at 91).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the court held, the denial of Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenge did not qualify as a structural error requiring automatic reversal.  See 227 Ill. 2d, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 887 (citing <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Recuenco</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/212/index.html">548 U. S. 212</a>, 218\xe2\x80\x93219 (2006)).  The court saw no indication that Rivera had been \xe2\x80\x9ctried before a biased jury, or even <em>one </em>biased juror.\xe2\x80\x9d  227 Ill. 2d, at 20, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 887.  In that regard, the court stressed, Rivera did \xe2\x80\x9cnot suggest that Gomez was subject to excusal for cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on both federal and state precedents, the court proceeded to consider whether it was \xe2\x80\x9cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found [Rivera] guilty absent the error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 21, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 887 (quoting <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 18 (1999)).  After reviewing the trial record, the court concluded that Gomez\xe2\x80\x99s presence on the jury did not prejudice Rivera because \xe2\x80\x9cany rational trier of fact would have found [Rivera] guilty of murder on the evidence adduced at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  227 Ill. 2d, at 26, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 890.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having held the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the court added that it \xe2\x80\x9cneed not decide whether the erroneous denial of a peremptory challenge is an error of constitutional dimension in these circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 27, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 891.  This comment, it appears, related to Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s arguments that, even absent a freestanding constitutional entitlement to peremptory challenges, the inclusion of Gomez on his jury violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. __ (2008), to resolve an apparent conflict among state high courts over whether the erroneous denial of a peremptory challenge requires automatic reversal of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction as a matter of federal law.  Compare <em>Angus</em> v. <em>State</em>, 695 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 109, 118 (Minn. 2005) (applying automatic reversal rule); <em>State</em> v. <em>Vreen</em>, 143 Wash. 2d 923, 927\xe2\x80\x93932, 26 P.\xc2\xa03d 236, 238\xe2\x80\x93240 (2001) (same), with <em>People</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, 473 Mich. 275, 292\xe2\x80\x93299, 702 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 128, 138\xe2\x80\x93141 (2005) (rejecting automatic reversal rule and looking to state law to determine the consequences of an erroneous denial of a peremptory challenge); 227 Ill. 2d., at 15\xe2\x80\x9327, 879 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 884\xe2\x80\x93891 (case below).  We now affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Rivera maintains, requires reversal whenever a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenge is erroneously denied.  Rivera recalls the ancient lineage of the peremptory challenge and observes that the challenge has long been lauded as a means to guard against latent bias and to secure \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional end of an impartial jury and a fair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCollum</em>, 505 U. S., at 57.  When a trial court fails to dismiss a lawfully challenged juror, Rivera asserts, it commits structural error: the jury becomes an illegally constituted tribunal, and any verdict it renders is <em>per se</em> invalid.  According to Rivera, this holds true even if the Constitution does not itself mandate peremptory challenges, because criminal defendants have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in their state-provided peremptory challenge rights.  Cf. <em>Evitts</em> v. <em>Lucey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/387/index.html">469 U. S. 387</a>, 393 (1985) (although \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution does not require States to grant appeals as of right to criminal defendants,\xe2\x80\x9d States that provide such appeals \xe2\x80\x9cmust comport with the demands of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The improper seating of a juror, Rivera insists, is not amenable to harmless-error analysis because it is impossible to ascertain how a properly constituted jury\xe2\x80\x94here, one without juror Gomez\xe2\x80\x94would have decided his case.  Thus, he urges, whatever the constitutional status of peremptory challenges, automatic reversal must be the rule as a matter of federal law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s arguments do not withstand scrutiny.  If a defendant is tried before a qualified jury composed of individuals not challengeable for cause, the loss of a peremptory challenge due to a state court\xe2\x80\x99s good-faith error is not a matter of federal constitutional concern.  Rather, it is a matter for the State to address under its own laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Rivera acknowledges, Brief for Petitioner 38, this Court has consistently held that there is no freestanding constitutional right to peremptory challenges.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, 528 U. S., at 311.  We have characterized peremptory challenges as \xe2\x80\x9ca creature of statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ross</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/81/index.html">487 U. S. 81</a>, 89 (1988), and have made clear that a State may decline to offer them at all.  <em>McCollum</em>, 505 U. S., at 57.  See also <em>Holland</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/474/index.html">493 U. S. 474</a>, 482 (1990) (dismissing the notion \xe2\x80\x9cthat the requirement of an \xe2\x80\x98impartial jury\xe2\x80\x99 impliedly <em>compels</em> peremptory challenges\xe2\x80\x9d).  When States provide peremptory challenges (as all do in some form), they confer a benefit \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond the minimum requirements of fair [jury] selection,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Frazier</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/497/index.html">335 U. S. 497</a>, 506 (1948), and thus retain discretion to design and implement their own systems, <em>Ross</em>, 487 U. S., at 89.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because peremptory challenges are within the States\xe2\x80\x99 province to grant or withhold, the mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, without more, violate the Federal Constitution.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] mere error of state law,\xe2\x80\x9d we have noted, \xe2\x80\x9cis not a denial of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Engle</em> v. <em>Isaac</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/107/index.html">456 U. S. 107</a>, 121, n. 21 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>McGuire</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/62/index.html">502 U. S. 62</a>, 67, 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (1991).  The Due Process Clause, our decisions instruct, safeguards not the meticulous observance of state procedural prescriptions, but \xe2\x80\x9cthe fundamental elements of fairness in a criminal trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Spencer</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/554/index.html">385 U. S. 554</a>, 563\xe2\x80\x93564 (1967).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to excuse juror Gomez did not deprive Rivera of his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.  Our decision in <em>Ross </em>is instructive.  Ross, a criminal defendant in Oklahoma, used a peremptory challenge to rectify the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous denial of a for-cause challenge, leaving him with one fewer peremptory challenge to use at his discretion.  The trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error, we acknowledged, \xe2\x80\x9cmay have resulted in a jury panel different from that which would otherwise have decided [Ross\xe2\x80\x99s] case.\xe2\x80\x9d  487 U. S., at 87.  But because no member of the jury as finally composed was removable for cause, we found no violation of Ross\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury or his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.  <em>Id</em>., at 86\xe2\x80\x9391.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We encountered a similar situation in <em>Martinez-Salazar </em>and reached the same conclusion.  Martinez-Salazar, who was tried in federal court, was entitled to exercise peremptory challenges pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(b).  His decision to use one of his peremptory challenges to cure the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous denial of a for-cause challenge, we held, did not impair his rights under that Rule.   \xe2\x80\x9c[A] principal reason for peremptories,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, is \xe2\x80\x9cto help secure the constitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 U. S., at 316.  Having \xe2\x80\x9creceived precisely what federal law provided,\xe2\x80\x9d and having been tried \xe2\x80\x9cby a jury on which no biased juror sat,\xe2\x80\x9d Martinez-Salazar could not \xe2\x80\x9ctenably assert any violation of his \xe2\x80\xa6 right to due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 307, 317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to distinguish <em>Ross </em>and <em>Martinez-Salazar</em> are unavailing.  First, Rivera observes, the defendants in <em>Ross </em>and <em>Martinez-Salazar </em>did not challenge any of the jurors who were in fact seated.  In contrast, Rivera attempted to exercise a peremptory challenge against a specific person\xe2\x80\x94Gomez\xe2\x80\x94whom he perceived to be unfavorable to his cause.  But, as Rivera recognizes, neither Gomez nor any other member of his jury was removable for cause.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  Thus, like the juries in <em>Ross </em>and <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s jury was impartial for Sixth Amendment purposes.  Rivera suggests that due process concerns persist because Gomez knew he did not want her on the panel.  Gomez, however, was not privy to the <em>in camera </em>discussions concerning Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to exercise a peremptory strike against her.  See, <em>supra</em>, at 3.  We reject the notion that a juror is constitutionally disqualified whenever she is aware that a party has challenged her.  Were the rule otherwise, a party could circumvent <em>Batson</em> by insisting in open court that a trial court dismiss a juror even though the party\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenge was discriminatory.  Or a party could obtain a juror\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal simply by making in her presence a baseless for-cause challenge.  Due process does not require such counterintuitive results.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, it is not constitutionally significant that the seating of Gomez over Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenge was at odds with state law.  The defendants in <em>Ross </em>and <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, Rivera emphasizes, were not denied their peremptory-challenge rights under applicable law\xe2\x80\x94state law in <em>Ross</em> and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>.  But as we have already explained, <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, errors of state law do not automatically become violations of due process.  As in <em>Ross </em>and <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, there is no suggestion here that the trial judge repeatedly or deliberately misapplied the law or acted in an arbitrary or irrational manner.  <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, 528 U. S., at 316; <em>Ross</em>, 487 U. S., at 91, n.\xc2\xa05.  Rather, the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s conduct reflected a good-faith, if arguably overzealous, effort to enforce the antidiscrimination requirements of our <em>Batson</em>-related precedents.  To hold that a one-time, good-faith misapplication of <em>Batson</em> violates due process would likely discourage trial courts and prosecutors from policing a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory use of peremptory challenges.  The Fourteenth Amendment does not compel such a tradeoff.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rivera insists that, even without a constitutional violation, the deprivation of a state-provided peremptory challenge requires reversal as a matter of federal law.  We disagree.  Rivera relies in part on <em>Swain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/index.html"></a><a href="/us/380/202/index.html">380 U. S. 202</a>, which suggested that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he denial or impairment of the right [to exercise peremptory challenges] is reversible error without a showing of prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 219.  We disavowed this statement in <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, observing, albeit in dicta, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the oft-quoted language in <em>Swain</em> was not only unnecessary to the decision in that case . . . but was founded on a series of our early cases decided long before the adoption of harmless-error review.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 U. S., at 317, n.\xc2\xa04.  As our recent decisions make clear, we typically designate an error as \xe2\x80\x9cstructural,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] automatic reversal,\xe2\x80\x9d only when \xe2\x80\x9cthe error \xe2\x80\x98necessarily render[s] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Recuenco</em>, 548 U. S., at 218\xe2\x80\x93219 (quoting <em>Neder</em>, 527 U. S., at 9).  The mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, at least in the circumstances we confront here, constitute an error of that character.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The automatic reversal precedents Rivera cites are inapposite.  One set of cases involves <em>constitutional</em> errors concerning the qualification of the jury or judge.  In <em>Batson</em>, for example, we held that the unlawful exclusion of jurors based on race requires reversal because it \xe2\x80\x9cviolates a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to equal protection,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutionally discriminate[s] against the excluded juror,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cundermine[s] public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U. S., at 86, 87.  Similarly, dismissal of a juror in violation of <em>Witherspoon</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/510/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/510/index.html">391 U. S. 510</a> (1968),[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] we have held, is constitutional error that requires vacation of a death sentence.  See <em>Gray</em> v. <em>Mississippi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/648/index.html">481 U. S. 648</a> (1987).  See also <em>Gomez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/858/index.html">490 U. S. 858</a>, 876 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cAmong those basic fair trial rights that can never be treated as harmless is a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to an impartial adjudicator, be it judge or jury.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A second set of cases involves circumstances in which federal<em> </em>judges or tribunals lacked statutory authority to adjudicate the controversy.  We have held the resulting judgment in such cases invalid as a matter of federal law.  See<em>, e.g.</em>, <em>Nguyen</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/69/index.html">539 U. S. 69</a> (2003); <em>Wingo</em> v. <em>Wedding</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/index.html">418 U. S. 461</a> (1974).  Nothing in these decisions suggests that federal law renders state-court judgments void whenever there is a state-law defect in a tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s composition.  Absent a federal constitutional violation, States retain the prerogative to decide whether such errors deprive a tribunal of its lawful authority and thus require automatic reversal.  States are free to decide, as a matter of state law, that a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken denial of a peremptory challenge is reversible error <em>per se</em>.  Or they may conclude, as the Supreme Court of Illinois implicitly did here, that the improper seating of a competent and unbiased juror does not convert the jury into an ultra vires<em> </em>tribunal; therefore the error could rank as harmless under state law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, Rivera received precisely what due process required: a fair trial before an impartial and properly instructed jury, which found him guilty of every element of the charged offense.</p>\n<p align="left">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*</f></f></f></f></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is</p>\n<p align="left">Affirmed.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, State Court Organization 2004, pp. 228\xe2\x80\x93232 (2006) (Table 41), http://www.ojp.usdoj.\ngov/bjs/pub/pdf/sco04.pdf (as visited Mar. 27, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (detailing peremptory challenge rules by State).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Under <em>Witherspoon</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/510/index.html"></a><a href="/us/391/510/index.html">391 U.
