For the first, possession of a small amount of marijuana, he received 20 days in jail.  For the second, possession without a prescription of one antianxiety tablet, he received 10 days.  Texas law, like federal law, authorized a sentencing enhancement if the State proved that petitioner had been previously convicted of a similar offense, but Texas did not seek such an enhancement here.  After the second conviction, the Federal Government initiated removal proceedings.  Petitioner conceded that he was removable, but claimed that he was eligible for discretionary cancellation of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) because he had not been convicted of any \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  Section 1101(a)(43)(B) defines that term to include, <em>inter alia, </em>\xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance \xe2\x80\xa6 including a drug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c), which, in turn, defines a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Controlled Substances Act (21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 801 et seq<em>.</em>).\xe2\x80\x9d  A felony is a crime for which the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment authorized\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cmore than one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73559(a).  Simple possession offenses are ordinarily misdemeanors punishable with shorter sentences, but a conviction \xe2\x80\x9cafter a prior conviction under this subchapter [or] the law of any State \xe2\x80\xa6 has become final\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9crecidivist\xe2\x80\x9d simple possession offense\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) and subject to a 2-year sentence.  Only this \xe2\x80\x9crecidivist\xe2\x80\x9d simple possession category might be an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).  A prosecutor must charge the existence of the prior conviction.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7851(a)(1).  Notice and an opportunity to challenge its validity, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7851(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c), are mandatory prerequisites to obtaining a punishment based on the fact of the prior conviction and necessary prerequisites to \xe2\x80\x9cauthorize\xe2\x80\x9d a felony punishment, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(a), for the simple possession offense at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the Immigration Judge held that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s second simple possession conviction was an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d that made him ineligible for cancellation of removal.  The Board of Immigration Appeals and Fifth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on the holding in <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/47/index.html">549 U. S. 47</a>, 56\xe2\x80\x94that to be an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d for immigration law purposes, a state drug conviction must be punishable as a felony under federal law\xe2\x80\x94the court used a \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d concluding that because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d could have been prosecuted as a recidivist simple possession under state law, it could have also been punished as a felony under federal law.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Second or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated felonies under \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state conviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Considering the disputed provisions\xe2\x80\x99 terms and their \xe2\x80\x9ccommonsense conception,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lopez</em>, 549 U. S., at 53, it would be counterintuitive and \xe2\x80\x9cunorthodox\xe2\x80\x9d to apply an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d label to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s recidivist possession, see <em>id., </em>at 54.  The same is true for his penalty.  One does not usually think of a 10-day sentence for unauthorized possession of one prescription pill as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court must be very wary in this case because the Government seeks a result that \xe2\x80\x9cthe English language tells [the Court] not to expect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cconduct punishable as a felony\xe2\x80\x9d should be treated as the equivalent of a felony conviction when the underlying conduct could have been a felony under federal law\xe2\x80\x94is unpersuasive.  First, it ignores the INA\xe2\x80\x99s text, which limits the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s cancellation power only when, <em>inter alia</em>, a noncitizen \xe2\x80\x9chas \xe2\x80\xa6 been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  Thus, the conviction itself is the starting place, not what might have or could have been charged.  Under the Controlled Substances Act, simple possession offenses carry only a 1-year sentence unless a prosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidivist and the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to defend against that charge.  Here, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s record of conviction contains no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.  An immigration court cannot, <em>ex\xc2\xa0post</em>, enhance the state offense of record just because facts known to it would have authorized a greater penalty.  The Government contends that had petitioner been prosecuted in federal court under identical circumstances, he would have committed an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d for immigration law purposes.  But his circumstances were not identical to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s hypothesis.  And the Government\xe2\x80\x99s approach cannot be reconciled with 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3), which requires an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d conviction\xe2\x80\x94not that the noncitizen merely could have been convicted of a felony but was not.  Second, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position fails to effectuate 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7851\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory notice and process requirements, which have great practical significance with respect to the conviction itself and are integral to the structure and design of federal drug laws.  They authorize prosecutors to exercise discretion when electing whether to pursue a recidivist enhancement.  So do many state criminal codes, including Texas\xe2\x80\x99.  Permitting an immigration judge to apply his own recidivist enhancement after the fact would denigrate state prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 independent judgment to execute such laws.  Third, the Fifth Circuit misread <em>Lopez.</em>  This Court never used a \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical approach\xe2\x80\x9d in its analysis.  By focusing on facts known to the immigration court that could have <em>but did not</em> serve as the basis for the state conviction and punishment, the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach introduces a level of conjecture that has no basis in <em>Lopez.  </em>Fourth, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument is inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts, for it is quite unlikely that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conduct would have been punished as a felony in federal court.  Finally, as the Court noted in <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 11, n.\xc2\xa08, ambiguities in criminal statutes referenced in immigration laws should be construed in the noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  Notably, here, the question whether petitioner has committed an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d is relevant to the type of relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to whether he is in fact removable.  Thus, any relief he may obtain still depends on the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.

For the first, possession of less than two ounces of marijuana, he received 20 days in jail.  For the second, possession without a prescription of one tablet of a common antianxiety medication, he received 10 days in jail.  After this second offense, the Federal Government initiated removal proceedings against him.  He conceded that he was removable, but claimed he was eligible for discretionary relief from removal under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To decide whether Carachuri-Rosendo is eligible to seek cancellation of removal or waiver of inadmissibility under \xc2\xa71229b(a), we must decide whether he has been convicted of an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3), a category of crimes singled out for the harshest deportation consequences.  The Court of Appeals held that a simple drug possession offense, committed after the conviction for a first possession offense became final, is always an aggravated felony.  We now reverse and hold that second or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated felonies under \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) when, as in this case, the state conviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101 <em>et seq., </em>a lawful permanent resident subject to removal from the United States may apply for discretionary cancellation of removal if, <em>inter alia</em>, he \xe2\x80\x9chas not been convicted of any aggravated felony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  The statutory definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d includes a list of numerous federal offenses,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] one of which is \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance . . . including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  Section 924(c)(2), in turn, defines a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany felony punishable under,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Controlled Substances Act (21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 801 et seq<em>.</em>).\xe2\x80\x9d  A felony is a crime for which the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment authorized\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cmore than one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(a).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The maze of statutory cross-references continues.  Section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act criminalizes simple possession offenses, the type of offense at issue in this case.  But it prescribes punishment for both misdemeanor and felony offenses.  Except for simple possession of crack cocaine or flunitrazepam, a first-time simple possession offense is a federal misdemeanor; the maximum term authorized for such a conviction is less than one year.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a).  However, a conviction for a simple possession offense \xe2\x80\x9cafter a prior conviction under this subchapter [or] under the law of any State . . . has become final\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what we will call recidivist simple possession[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]\xe2\x80\x94may be punished as a felony, with a prison sentence of up to two years.  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</em>  Thus, except for simple possession offenses involving isolated categories of drugs not presently at issue, only <em>recidivist</em> simple possession offenses are \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d as a federal \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d under the Controlled Substances Act, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).  And thus only a conviction within this particular category of simple possession offenses might, conceivably, be an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For a subsequent simple possession offense to be eligible for an enhanced punishment, <em>i.e.</em>, to be punishable as a felony, the Controlled Substances Act requires that a prosecutor charge the existence of the prior simple possession conviction before trial, or before a guilty plea.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7851(a)(1).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Notice, plus an opportunity to challenge the validity of the prior conviction used to enhance the current conviction, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7851(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c), are mandatory prerequisites to obtaining a punishment based on the fact of a prior conviction.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  And they are also necessary prerequisites under federal law to \xe2\x80\x9cauthorize\xe2\x80\x9d a felony punishment, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(a), for the type of simple possession offense at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither the definition of an \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d offense under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B) nor that of a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) describes or references any state offenses.  The \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition does explain that the term applies \xe2\x80\x9cto an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).  But in <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/47/index.html">549 U. S. 47</a>, 56 (2006), we determined that, in order to be an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d for immigration law purposes, a state drug conviction must be punishable as a felony under <em>federal</em> law.  We held that \xe2\x80\x9ca state offense constitutes a \xe2\x80\x98felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x99 only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 60.  Despite the fact that the <em>Lopez </em>petitioner had been punished as a felon under state<em> </em>law\xe2\x80\x94and, indeed, received a 5-year sentence\xe2\x80\x94the conduct of his offense was not punishable as a felony under federal law, and this prevented the state conviction from qualifying as an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes. <em>Id.,</em> at 55 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnless a state offense is punishable as a federal felony it does not count\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us, the Government argues that Carachuri-Rosendo, despite having received only a 10-day sentence for his Texas misdemeanor simple possession offense, nevertheless has been \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted\xe2\x80\x9d of an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the INA.  This is so, the Government contends, because had Carachuri-Rosendo been prosecuted in federal court instead of state court, he <em>could</em> <em>have been</em> prosecuted as a felon and received a 2-year sentence based on the fact of his prior simple possession offense.  Our holding in <em>Lopez </em>teaches that, for a state conviction to qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the INA, it is necessary for the underlying conduct to be punishable as a federal felony.  <em>Id.,</em> at 60.  We now must determine whether the mere possibility, no matter how remote, that a 2-year sentence might have been imposed in a federal trial is a sufficient<em> </em>basis for concluding that a state misdemeanant who was not charged as a recidivist has been \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted\xe2\x80\x9d of an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Carachuri-Rosendo<em> </em>was born in Mexico in 1978.  He came to the United States with his parents in 1983 and has been a lawful permanent resident of Texas ever since.  His common-law wife and four children are American citizens, as are his mother and two sisters.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like so many in this country, Carachuri-Rosendo has gotten into some trouble with our drug laws.  In 2004, he pleaded guilty to possessing less than two ounces of marijuana, a Class B misdemeanor, and was sentenced to confinement for 20 days by a Texas court.  See App. 19a\xe2\x80\x9322a; Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7481.121(a) and (b)(1) (West 2003).  In 2005, he pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to possessing less than 28 grams\xe2\x80\x94one tablet\xe2\x80\x94of alprazolam (known commercially as Xanax) without a prescription, a Class A misdemeanor.  See App. 31a\xe2\x80\x9334a; Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7481.117(a) and (b).  Although Texas law, like federal law, authorized a sentencing enhancement if the prosecutor proved that Carachuri-Rosendo had been previously convicted of an offense of a similar class, the State did not elect to seek an enhancement based on his criminal history.  App. 32a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2006, on the basis of Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s second possession offense, the Federal Government initiated removal proceedings against him.  Appearing <em>pro se</em> before the Immigration Judge, Carachuri-Rosendo did not dispute that his conviction for possessing one tablet of Xanax without a prescription made him removable,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] but he applied for a discretionary cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a).  Under that statutory provision, the Attorney General may cancel an order of removal or an order of inadmissibility so long as, <em>inter alia</em>, the noncitizen \xe2\x80\x9chas not been convicted of a[n] aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  The Immigration Judge held that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s second simple possession conviction was an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d that made him ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) followed Circuit precedent and affirmed that decision, but it disagreed with the Immigration Judge\xe2\x80\x99s legal analysis.  In its en banc opinion, the BIA ruled that in cases arising in Circuits in which the question had not yet been decided, the BIA would not treat a second or successive misdemeanor conviction as an aggravated felony unless the conviction contained a finding that the offender was a recidivist.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 382, 387, 391 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The BIA explained that the statutory question is complicated by the fact that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98recidivist possession\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is not a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete offense under Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 388.  While most federal offenses are defined by elements that must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, recidivist possession is an \xe2\x80\x9camalgam of elements, substantive sentencing factors, and procedural safeguards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 389.  Section 844(a) defines simple possession by reference to statutory elements, but \xe2\x80\x9cfacts leading to recidivist felony <em>punishment, </em>such as the existence of a prior conviction, do not qualify as \xe2\x80\x98elements\xe2\x80\x99 in the traditional sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The BIA observed, however, that \xe2\x80\x9c21 U.

The court deemed its analysis \xe2\x80\x9cthe hypothetical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d a term it derived from its understanding of our method of analysis in <em>Lopez</em>.  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 266, and n.\xc2\xa03; see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Pacheco-Diaz</em>, 513 F.\xc2\xa03d 776, 779 (CA7 2008) <em>(per curiam) </em>(employing the \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical-federal-felony approach\xe2\x80\x9d).

Accordingly, any \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9chypothetically\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccould have been punished as a felony\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chad [it] been prosecuted in federal court\xe2\x80\x9d is an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d for federal immigration law purposes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 265.  In applying this hypothetical approach, the Court of Appeals did not discuss the \xc2\xa7851 procedural requirements.  Instead, it concluded that because Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d could have been prosecuted as simple possession with a recidivist enhancement under state law\xe2\x80\x94even though it was not\xe2\x80\x94it could have also been punished as a felony under federal law.  Thus, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, his conviction for simple possession under state law, without a recidivist enhancement, was an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d for immigration law purposes.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether subsequent simple possession offenses are aggravated felonies.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  558 U.

S., at 53.  This type of petty simple possession offense is not typically thought of as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d or as \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking.\xe2\x80\x9d  We explained in <em>Lopez</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily \xe2\x80\x98trafficking\xe2\x80\x99 means some sort of commercial dealing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 53\xe2\x80\x9354 (citing Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1534 (8th ed. 2004)).  And just as in <em>Lopez</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ommerce . . . was no part of\xe2\x80\x9d Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s possessing a single tablet of Xanax, \xe2\x80\x9cand certainly it is no element of simple possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  549 U. S., at 54.  As an initial matter, then, we observe that a reading of this statutory scheme that would apply an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking\xe2\x80\x9d label to <em>any </em>simple possession offense is, to say the least, counterintuitive and \xe2\x80\x9cunorthodox,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same is true for the type of penalty at issue.  We do not usually think of a 10-day sentence for the unauthorized possession of a trivial amount of a prescription drug as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  A \xe2\x80\x9cfelony,\xe2\x80\x9d we have come to understand, is a \xe2\x80\x9cserious crime usu[ally] punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or by death.\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 694 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s).  An \xe2\x80\x9caggravated\xe2\x80\x9d offense is one \xe2\x80\x9cmade worse or more serious by circumstances such as violence, the presence of a deadly weapon, or the intent to commit another crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 75.  The term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d is unique to Title 8, which covers immigration matters; it is not a term used elsewhere within the United States Code.  Our statutory criminal law classifies the most insignificant of federal felonies\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cClass E\xe2\x80\x9d felonies\xe2\x80\x94as carrying a sentence of \xe2\x80\x9cless than five years but more than one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(a)(5).  While it is true that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history might be seen to make an offense \xe2\x80\x9cworse\xe2\x80\x9d by virtue thereof, Black\xe2\x80\x99s 75, it is nevertheless unorthodox to classify this type of petty simple possession recidivism as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, as Justice Souter observed in his opinion for the Court in <em>Lopez, </em>Congress, like \xe2\x80\x9cHumpty Dumpty,\xe2\x80\x9d has the power to give words unorthodox meanings.  549 U.

But in this case the Government argues for a result that \xe2\x80\x9cthe English language tells us not to expect,\xe2\x80\x9d so we must be \xe2\x80\x9cvery wary of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Because the English language tells us that most aggravated felonies are punishable by sentences far longer than 10 days, and that mere possession of one tablet of Xanax does not constitute \xe2\x80\x9ctrafficking<em>,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <em>Lopez</em> instructs us to be doubly wary of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position in this case.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position, like the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d would treat all \xe2\x80\x9cconduct punishable as a felony\xe2\x80\x9d as the equivalent of a \xe2\x80\x9cconviction\xe2\x80\x9d of a felony whenever, hypothetically speaking, the underlying conduct could have received felony treatment under federal law.  We find this reasoning\xe2\x80\x94and the \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical approach\xe2\x80\x9d itself\xe2\x80\x94unpersuasive for the following reasons.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, and most fundamentally, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position ignores the text of the INA, which limits the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s cancellation power only when, <em>inter alia</em>, a noncitizen \xe2\x80\x9chas . . . been <em>convicted</em> of a[n] aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3) (emphasis added).  The text thus indicates that we are to look to the conviction itself as our starting place, not to what might have or could have been charged.  And to be convicted of an aggravated felony punishable as such under the Controlled Substances Act, the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment authorized\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9cmore than one year,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(a)(5).  Congress, recall, chose to authorize only a 1-year sentence for nearly all simple possession offenses, but it created a narrow exception for those cases in which a prosecutor elects to charge the defendant as a recidivist and the defendant receives notice and an opportunity to defend against that charge.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7851; Part I, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indisputably, Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s record of conviction contains no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.  Carachuri-Rosendo argues that even such a finding would be insufficient, and that a prosecutorial charge of recidivism and an opportunity to defend against that charge also would be required before he could be deemed \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted\xe2\x80\x9d of a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.  In the absence of any finding of recidivism, we need not, and do not, decide whether these additional procedures would be necessary.  Although a federal immigration court may have the power to make a recidivist finding in the first instance, see<em>,</em> <em>e.g</em>., <em>Almendarez-Torres</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/224/index.html"></a><a href="/us/523/224/index.html">523 U. S. 224</a>, 247 (1998), it cannot, <em>ex\xc2\xa0post</em>, enhance the state offense of record just because facts known to it would have authorized a greater penalty under either state or federal law.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Carachuri-Rosendo was not actually \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3), of a drug possession offense committed \xe2\x80\x9cafter a prior conviction . . . has become final,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7844(a), and no subsequent development can undo that history.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends that if Carachuri-Rosendo had been prosecuted in federal court for simple possession under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a) under identical circumstances, he would have committed an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d for immigration law purposes.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  This is so, the Government suggests, because the only statutory text that matters is the word \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2): Whatever conduct might be \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d as a felony, regardless of whether it actually is so punished or not, is a felony for immigration law purposes.  But for the reasons just stated, the circumstances of Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution were not identical to those hypothesized by the Government.  And the Government\xe2\x80\x99s abstracted approach to \xc2\xa7924(c)(2) cannot be reconciled with the more concrete guidance of 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3), which limits the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s cancellation authority only when the noncitizen has actually been \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of a[n] aggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not when he merely could have been convicted of a felony but was not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, and relatedly, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position fails to give effect to the mandatory notice and process requirements contained in 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7851.  For federal law purposes, a simple possession offense is not \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d as a felony unless a federal prosecutor first elects to charge a defendant as a recidivist in the criminal information.  The statute, as described in Part I, <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, speaks in mandatory terms, permitting \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person\xe2\x80\x9d to be subject to a recidivist enhancement\xe2\x80\x94and therefore, in this case, a felony sentence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d he has been given notice of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s intent to prove the fact of a prior conviction.  Federal law also gives the defendant an opportunity to challenge the fact of the prior conviction itself.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7851(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c).  The Government would dismiss these procedures as meaningless, so long as they may be satisfied during the immigration proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But these procedural requirements have great practical significance with respect to the conviction itself and are integral to the structure and design of our drug laws.  They authorize prosecutors to exercise discretion when electing whether to pursue a recidivist enhancement.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dodson</em>, 288 F.\xc2\xa03d 153, 159 (CA5 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhereas the prior version of [\xc2\xa7851(a)] made enhancements for prior offenses mandatory, the new statutory scheme gave prosecutors discretion whether to seek enhancements based on prior convictions\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the procedures are prerequisites to an enhanced sentence, \xc2\xa7851 allows federal prosecutors to choose whether to seek a conviction that is \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d as a felony under \xc2\xa7844(a).  Underscoring the significance of the \xc2\xa7851 procedures,\nthe United States Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Manual places decisions\nwith respect to seeking recidivist enhancements on\npar with the filing of a criminal charge against a\ndefendant.  See Dept. of Justice, United States Attor-\nneys\xe2\x80\x99 Manual \xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x9327.300(B) comment. (1997), online\nat http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/ usam/title9/27mcrm.htm#9-27.300 (as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file). (\xe2\x80\x9cEvery prosecutor should regard the filing of an information under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7851 . . . as equivalent to the filing of charges\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many state criminal codes, like the federal scheme, afford similar deference to prosecutorial discretion when prescribing recidivist enhancements.  Texas is one such State.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Tex. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712.42, 12.43 (West 2003) (recidivist enhancement is available \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f it is shown on the trial\xe2\x80\x9d that defendant was previously convicted of identified categories of felonies and misdemeanors).  And, in this case, the prosecutor specifically elected to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bandon\xe2\x80\x9d a recidivist enhancement under state law.  App. 32a (reproducing state judgment).  Were we to permit a federal immigration judge to apply his own recidivist enhancement after the fact so as to make the noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s offense \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d as a felony for immigration law purposes, we would denigrate the independent judgment of state prosecutors to execute the laws of those sovereigns.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 hypothetical felony approach is based on a misreading of our decision in <em>Lopez</em>.  We never used the term \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d to describe our analysis in that case.  We did look to the \xe2\x80\x9cproscribe[d] conduct\xe2\x80\x9d of a state offense to determine whether it is \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable as a felony under that federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  549 U. S., at 60.  But the \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical approach\xe2\x80\x9d employed by the Court of Appeals introduces a level of conjecture at the outset of this inquiry that has no basis in <em>Lopez</em>.  It ignores both the conviction (the relevant statutory hook), and the conduct actually punished by the state offense.  Instead, it focuses on facts known to the immigration court that could have <em>but did not</em> serve as the basis for the state conviction and punishment.  As the Sixth Circuit has explained, this approach is really a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98hypothetical to a hypothetical.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rashid </em>v. <em>Mukasey</em>, 531 F. 3d 438, 445 (2008).  Not only does the Government wish us to consider a fictional federal felony\xe2\x80\x94whether the crime for which Carachuri-Rosendo was actually convicted would be a felony under the Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x94but the Government also wants us to consider facts not at issue in the crime of conviction (<em>i.e.</em>, the existence of a prior conviction) to determine whether Carachuri-Rosendo <em>could have </em>been charged with a federal felony.  This methodology is far removed from the more focused, categorical inquiry employed in <em>Lopez</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, it seems clear that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument is inconsistent with common practice in the federal courts.  It is quite unlikely that the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d that gave rise to Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s conviction would have been punished as a felony in federal court.  Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s recommended sentence, based on the type of controlled substance at issue, would not have exceeded one year and very likely would have been less than 6 months.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72D2.1(a)(3) (Nov. 2009) (base offense level of 4).  And as was true in <em>Lopez, </em>the Government has provided us with no empirical data suggesting that \xe2\x80\x9ceven a single eager Assistant United States Attorney\xe2\x80\x9d has ever sought to prosecute a comparable federal defendant as a felon.  549 U. S., at 57\xe2\x80\x9358.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d approach to this case is therefore misleading as well as speculative, in that Carachuri-Rosendo\xe2\x80\x99s federal-court counterpart would <em>not</em>, in actuality, have faced any felony charge.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, as we noted in <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 11, n. 8 (2004), ambiguities in criminal statutes referenced in immigration laws should be construed in the noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  And here the critical language appears in a criminal statute, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note that whether a noncitizen has committed an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d is relevant, <em>inter alia</em>, to the type of relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to whether he is in fact removable.  In other words, to the extent that our rejection of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s broad understanding of the scope of \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d may have any practical effect on policing our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders, it is a limited one.  Carachuri-Rosendo, and others in his position, may now seek cancellation of removal and thereby avoid the harsh consequence of mandatory removal.  But he will not avoid the fact that his conviction makes him, in the first instance, removable.  Any relief he may obtain depends upon the discretion of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Government is correct that to qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the INA, the conduct prohibited by state law must be punishable as a felony under federal law.  See <em>Lopez</em>, 549 U. S., at 60.  But as the text and structure of the relevant statutory provisions demonstrate, the defendant must <em>also</em> have been<em> actually convicted</em> of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under federal law.  The mere possibility that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, coupled with facts outside of the record of conviction, could have authorized a felony conviction under federal law is insufficient to satisfy the statutory command that a noncitizen be \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of a[n] aggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d before he loses the opportunity to seek cancellation of removal.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).

What we had no occasion to decide in <em>Lopez</em>, and what we now address, is what it means to be <em>convicted </em>of an aggravated felony.  <em>Lopez</em> teaches us that it is necessary that the conduct punished under state law correspond to a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act to be an aggravated felony under \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).

To the extent that <em>Rodriquez</em> is relevant to the issue at hand, we think the contrary is true.  In that decision we considered whether a recidivist finding under state law that had the effect of increasing the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d to 10 years, irrespective of the actual sentence imposed, made the offense a \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of 18 U.

Indeed, we specifically observed that \xe2\x80\x9cin those cases in which the records that may properly be consulted do not show that the defendant faced the possibility<em> </em>of a recidivist enhancement, it may well be that the Government will be precluded from establishing that a conviction was for a qualifying offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In other words, when the recidivist finding giving rise to a 10-year sentence is not apparent from the sentence itself, or appears neither as part of the \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment of conviction\xe2\x80\x9d nor the \xe2\x80\x9cformal charging document,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, the Government will not have established that the defendant had a prior conviction for which the maximum term of imprisonment was 10 years or more (assuming the recidivist finding is a necessary precursor to such a sentence).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963334">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nCARACHURI-ROSENDO V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  But my reasoning is more straightforward than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s, and so I concur only in the judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attorney General may cancel the removal of an alien from the United States provided the alien \xe2\x80\x9chas not been convicted of any aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  There is no statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted,\xe2\x80\x9d but a \xe2\x80\x9cconviction\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to mean a \xe2\x80\x9cformal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(48)(A).  The term \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d includes, among many other offenses, \xe2\x80\x9ca drug trafficking crime (as defined in [18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)]).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  A \xe2\x80\x9cdrug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x9d is in turn defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It could be concluded from the provisions discussed above that only a <em>federal</em> conviction for a felony offense under the Controlled Substances Act would qualify under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B).  But the penultimate sentence in \xc2\xa71101(a)(43) provides that the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9capplies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  This language, we have said, confirms that \xe2\x80\x9ca state offense whose elements include the elements of a felony punishable under the [Controlled Substances Act] is an aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/47/index.html">549 U. S. 47</a>, 57 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conceptual problem in the present case is that the only crime defined by 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a) of the Controlled Substances Act, simple possession of prohibited drugs, is a misdemeanor.  That misdemeanor becomes a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x9d only because the sentencing factor of recidivism authorizes additional punishment beyond one year, the criterion for a felony.  We held in <em>Almendarez-Torres</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/224/index.html">523 U. S. 224</a> (1998), that recidivism can constitutionally be made a sentencing factor rather than an element of the crime, despite the fact that it is used to increase the allowable sentence.  And we said in <em>Lopez</em> that a \xe2\x80\x9cstate possession crim[e] that correspond[s] to\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cfelony violatio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9crecidivist possession\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7844(a) \xe2\x80\x9cclearly fall[s] within the definitions used by Congress \xe2\x80\xa6 in \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B) and \xe2\x80\xa6 \xc2\xa7924(c)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  549 U. S., at 55, n.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But to say all that is not to say that an alien has been \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of\xe2\x80\x9d an aggravated felony (which is what \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3) requires) when he has been convicted of nothing more than a second state misdemeanor violation, the punishment for which could, because of recidivism, be extended beyond one year.  Just because, by reason of <em>Almendarez-Torres</em>,<em> </em>the federal misdemeanor offense has been raised to a felony offense without changing its elements, solely by increasing its penalty pursuant to a recidivist \xe2\x80\x9csentencing factor\xe2\x80\x9d; it does not follow that when the question is asked whether someone has been \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of\xe2\x80\x9d a state offense that \xe2\x80\x9ccorresponds\xe2\x80\x9d to the federal misdemeanor-become-felony, the answer can be sought in sentencing factors.  A defendant is not \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted\xe2\x80\x9d of sentencing factors, but only of the elements of the crime charged in the indictment.  In other words, a misdemeanor offense with a sentencing factor that raises its punishment to the felony level qualifies for purposes of establishing the elements of a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\xe2\x80\x9d; but does <em>not </em>qualify for purposes of determining what elements the alien has been \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, Carachuri-Rosendo was only \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of\xe2\x80\x9d the crime of knowing possession of a controlled substance without a valid prescription, a Class A misdemeanor under Texas law.  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7481.117(a) and (b) (West Supp. 2009).  Since the elements of that crime did not include recidivism, the crime of his conviction did not \xe2\x80\x9ccorrespond\xe2\x80\x9d to the Controlled Substances Act felony of possession-plus-recidivism under 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963333">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n560 U.
