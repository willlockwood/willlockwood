That shortly after his removal to Philadelphia, <em>viz.,</em> on or about the 7 June, 1792, a commission of bankruptcy was awarded and issued forth against him in pursuance of two certain acts or statutes of the said State of Pennsylvania, the one entitled \'An act for the regulation of bankruptcy,\' the other entitled, \'An act to amend an act entitled, an act for the regulation of bankruptcy.\'   And in pursuance of which said statutes the defendant did actually deliver, assign, and transfer to the commissioners appointed under the said commission the whole of his effects, as well in the State of Pennsylvania as elsewhere, which consisted principally of credits due to the said defendant in the State of New York.  It is further admitted that the said John Dewhurst in all things complied with the said statutes of bankruptcy before referred to, and that on 11 August, 1792, he obtained a certificate of bankruptcy duly executed."</p>\n<p>"Upon the above state of the case, it is submitted to the Supreme Court of the United States to determine whether the certificate issued under the laws of Pennsylvania operates as a discharge of the said debt notwithstanding its being contracted in another state, where there was no bankrupt laws and while the defendant was resident in the said State of New York.  If the court should be of opinion that it does, it is agreed that judgment be entered for the defendant; otherwise for the plaintiff, for $1,120 damages and six cents costs."</p>\n<p>The Court, on the ensuing morning, returned the state of the case, declaring that it could not take cognizance of any suit or controversy which was not brought before them by the regular process of the law.</p>\n<p><em>Motion refused.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
