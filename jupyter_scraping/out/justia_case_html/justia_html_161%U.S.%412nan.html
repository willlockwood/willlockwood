JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The United States seeks by this suit to establish a claim against the estate of Leland Stanford for $15,237,000.</p>\n<p>The deceased held and owned a large number of the shares of the capital stock of the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California and the Western Pacific Railroad Company, corporations that were organized under the laws of California, and which subsequently were consolidated and became the Central Pacific Railroad Company.</p>\n<p>Those companies received bonds of the United States that were issued, under the acts of Congress known as the "Pacific Railroad Acts," in aid of the construction of a railroad and telegraph line extending from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean.  The present demand of the government arises out of the obligation which, it is alleged, rested upon the companies receiving such bonds to pay the principal at maturity, and to reimburse the United States for all interest paid thereon. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="414">Page 161 U. S. 414</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The bill proceeds upon the ground that, by the Constitution and laws of California at the time the above corporations were organized, as well as when they received the bonds of the United States, each stockholder of a railroad corporation was liable, in proportion to the stock owned and held by him, for all of its debts and liabilities, and consequently that the estate of Stanford is liable to the United States in proportion to the stock owned and held by him in the corporations named.</p>\n<p>The principal contention of the defendant is that the question of the liability of stockholders for the debts and obligations of companies receiving bonds of the United States under the Pacific Railroad acts does not depend upon the laws of California, but is governed by the acts of Congress under which such bonds were issued; that, by its legislation in aid of the construction of the Union and Central Pacific Railroads, Congress intended to define, control, and regulate the entire relations of the government to all of the companies receiving subsidy bonds, without reference to the laws of any state; that those companies were respectively created or adopted as agencies for a great national purpose, in the accomplishment of which they were to be subject to the exclusive control of the general government; that the functions, obligations, and liabilities of all the companies participating in the bounty of the United States were to be equal and identical, and that, as to each company, the government looked to it alone for the performance of all that the acts imposed upon it, and did not contemplate nor intend that there should be any individual liability of stockholders in respect of the subsidy bonds issued by the United States.</p>\n<p>If these acts of Congress have the scope and effect attributed to them by the defendant, the decree may be affirmed, without any expression of opinion by this Court upon other questions discussed at the bar, and which, if considered, would require a construction of the laws of California relating to the personal liability of stockholders for the debts of railroad corporations.</p>\n<p>Was it part of the contract between the United States and the corporations receiving its subsidy bonds that the stockholders </p><p><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 161 U. S. 415</a></p><p> of such corporations, respectively, should be personally liable for the principal and interest of those bonds?  Or did the United States make provision in the acts of Congress for all the security intended to be taken for their payment?  These questions cannot be answered by referring to any one section of either act, but only by examining the provisions of all of those acts in the light of the circumstances under which the United States made grants of public lands and provided for the issuing of bonds in aid of the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>By the Act of July 1, 1862, c. 120, 12 Stat. 489, entitled</p>\n<p>"An act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military and other purposes,"</p>\n<p>the Union Pacific Railroad Company was incorporated, with power to lay out, locate, maintain, and enjoy a continuous railroad and telegraph from a named point in what was then the Territory of Nebraska to the western boundary of what at that time was the Territory of Nevada.</p>\n<p>That company was given the right of way through the public lands for the construction of its railroad and telegraph line, as well as the power and authority to take, from those lands adjacent to the line of the road, earth, stone, and timber, and other materials required in the work of construction, and, so far as it was necessary to do so, to occupy the public lands for stations, buildings, workshops, depots, machine shops, switches, sidetracks, turntables, and water stations; the United States to extinguish the Indian titles to all lands falling under the operation of the act and required for the right of way and grants made.</p>\n<p>"For the purpose of aiding in the construction of said railroad and telegraph line, and to secure the safe and speedy transportation of the mails, troops, munitions of war, and public stores,"</p>\n<p>a large grant of lands was made, for which patents were directed to be issued as each forty consecutive miles of railroad and telegraph were completed and equipped in all respects as required.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2-4.</p>\n<p>The fifth section provided that, for the purposes mentioned, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="416">Page 161 U. S. 416</a></p><p> the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the completion and equipment of forty consecutive miles of railroad and telegraph, should issue to the company bonds of the United States, of one thousand dollars each, payable in thirty years after date, bearing six percentum per annum interest, to the amount of sixteen of said bonds per mile for such section of forty miles, and</p>\n<p>"<em>to secure the repayment</em> to the United States, as hereinafter provided, of the amount of said bonds so issued and delivered to said company, together with all interest thereon which shall have been paid by the United States, the issue of said bonds and delivery to the company shall <em>ipso facto constitute a mortgage on the whole line of the railroad and telegraph, together with the rolling stock, fixtures and property of every kind and description, and in consideration of which said bonds may be issued,</em> and on the refusal or failure of said company to redeem said bonds, or any part of them, when required so to do by the Secretary of the Treasury, in accordance with the provisions of this act, <em>the said road, with all the rights, junctions, immunities and appurtenances thereunto belonging, and also all lands granted to the said company, by the United States, which at the time of said default shall remain in the ownership of said company, may be taken possession of by the Secretary of the Treasury for the use and benefit of the United States.</em>"</p>\n<p>The grants referred to were made</p>\n<p>"upon condition that said company shall pay said bonds at maturity, and shall keep said railroad and telegraph line in repair and use, and shall at all times transmit dispatches over said telegraph line, and transport mails, troops and munitions of war, supplies and public stores upon said railroad for the government whenever required to do so by any department thereof, and that the government shall at all times have the preference in the use of the same for all the purposes aforesaid (at fair and reasonable rates of compensation, not to exceed the amounts paid by private parties for the same kind of service), and <em>all compensation for services rendered for the government shall be applied to the payment of said bonds and interest until the whole amount is fully paid.</em>"</p>\n<p>The company was entitled to pay </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 161 U.

By the same section it was declared that</p>\n<p>"the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California, a corporation existing under the laws of the State of California, are hereby authorized to construct a railroad and telegraph line from the Pacific Coast at or near San Francisco, or the navigable waters of the Sacramento River, to the eastern boundary of California, <em>upon the same terms and conditions in all respects,</em> as are contained in this act for the construction of said railroad and telegraph line first mentioned, and to meet and connect with the first-mentioned railroad and telegraph line on the eastern boundary of California.

"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 161 U.

S. 427</a></p><p> should be regarded as one enactment.  What that object was is no longer a subject of inquiry in this Court.  In <em>United States v. Union Pacific Railroad Company,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/91/92/case.html">91 U. S. 92</a></span>, this Court, speaking by Mr. Justice Davis, held that the construction of a railroad connecting the Missouri River with the Pacific Ocean was a national work, because such a road would be a great national highway, under national control; that the scheme for establishing that highway originated in national necessities, the country being involved at the time in a civil war which threatened the disruption of the Union, and endangered the safety of our possessions on the Pacific, and that the enterprise required national assistance because private capital was inadequate for an undertaking of such magnitude.  It appears upon the face of the act of 1862 as amended by the act of 1864 that Congress had in view the promotion of the public interest and welfare by the construction of a railroad and telegraph line that could be used by the government at all times, but particularly in time of war, for postal, military, and other purposes, and that, so far as the government and the public were concerned, such road and telegraph were to be operated as one continuous line.  These ends were to be attained through the agency of a corporation created by Congress, and of certain corporations, organized under state laws, which Congress selected as instruments to be employed in accomplishing the public objects specified in its legislation.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the next inquiry is whether Congress made any, and, if any, what, provision to secure the United States against liability on account of its bonds issued in aid of the construction of this national highway?  The acts of 1862 and 1864 furnish the answer to this question.  By the act of 1862, as we have seen, it is provided that the issuing of bonds, and their delivery to the railroad company entitled to receive them, should <em>ipso facto</em> constitute a mortgage on the whole line of the railroad and telegraph constructed by the company receiving the bonds, together with its rolling stock, fixtures, and property of every kind and description, and in consideration of which the bonds were issued, and upon the refusal or failure of the company to redeem the bonds, or any part of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 161 U. S. 428</a></p><p> them, when required so to do by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with the act, the railroad, with all the rights, functions, immunities, and appurtenances appertaining thereto, and all lands granted to the company, could be taken possession of by that officer for the use and benefit of the United States.  The same act also authorized the government to retain all sums due as compensation for services rendered in its behalf by the railroad company.</p>\n<p>These provisions were so far altered by the act of 1864 as to authorize the Union Pacific Railroad Company, or any company authorized to participate in the construction of the road from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, to place a first mortgage on their railroad and telegraph lines, respectively (to an amount not exceeding the bonds of the United States), to which mortgage the lien of the United States bonds was made subordinate, saving the right of the government, reserved in the act of 1862, to be preferred in the use of the railroad and telegraph for the transportation of the mails, troops, and munitions of war and the transmission of telegraphic dispatches.  The act of 1864 also provided that only one-half of the compensation due from the government for services rendered should be retained and applied to the payment of the bonds issued by the United States.  But the Act of May 7, 1878, c. 96, \xc2\xa7 2, known as the "Thurman Act,"  provided that the whole of such compensation might be retained, one-half to be applied to the payment of interest on the bonds issued by the United States and the other half to be turned into the sinking fund established by that act.</p>\n<p>These and other provisions indicate the extent to which Congress deemed it necessary to make provision for the protection of the United States against liability on its bonds loaned to railroad companies for the purposes indicated in the act of 1862.  The security taken by the government was, of course, impaired by the act of 1864, which subordinated the lien of the United States, as originally declared, to the first mortgages executed by the respective companies under the authority of that act.  But if the act of 1862, fairly interpreted, excludes the idea that stockholders of the companies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 161 U. S. 429</a></p><p> receiving subsidy bonds were to be personally liable to the United States for the principal and interest accruing on those bonds, the legislation of 1864, however unwise, did not have the effect of imposing such liability.</p>\n<p>Now the important fact disclosed by the Pacific Railroad Acts is that no one of them contains any clause imposing upon the stockholders of a corporation receiving subsidy bonds personal responsibility for any debt due to the United States from such corporation by reason of its failure to pay those bonds at maturity.  It was, of course, competent for Congress, when incorporating the Union Pacific Railroad Company, to impose such liability upon the stockholders of that corporation.  But as it did not do so, as the personal liability of stockholders for the debts of the corporation arises only from statute, it cannot be claimed, nor is it claimed, that the stockholders of that corporation incurred by their subscriptions of stock any liability to the United States or to any other creditor for the debts of that company.  They were bound, of course, to make good the amount of their subscriptions; but, that being done, their personal responsibility to creditors of the corporate body ceased.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/520/case.html">Pollard v.

Corp. \xc2\xa7 2925, and authorities there cited.  Congress, by its legislation, encouraged and invited the investment of private capital in the construction of a highway which at that time was deemed of vital importance to the whole country.  As the stockholder of a corporation is not liable beyond the amount of his unpaid subscription for its debts unless such liability is imposed by statute, and as the acts of Congress in question are silent upon that subject, every subscriber to the stock of the Union Pacific Railroad Company must be deemed to have become such upon the condition, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 161 U. S. 430</a></p><p> implied by law, that he should not be personally liable for the debts of the corporation.  It is not too much to say that if the acts of 1862 and 1864 had made the stockholders of the corporations therein named personally liable in proportion to their stock for the repayment of the principal and interest of the bonds issued and delivered to such corporation, the accomplishing of the objects Congress had in view would have been seriously retarded, if not wholly defeated.</p>\n<p>It is said, however, that these principles have no application to stockholders of California corporations that came into existence under constitutional and statutory provisions making a stockholder of a railroad corporation liable in proportion to his stock for its debts and obligations.</p>\n<p>This position cannot be sustained except upon the theory that Congress intended to take a larger security in respect of that part of the Pacific Road which the California company undertook to construct and maintain than it took in respect of the Union Pacific Railroad.  But it cannot be inferred from the legislation of Congress that it intended, for the protection of the interests of the United States, to impose a heavier liability upon the stockholders of the California company than was imposed upon the stockholders of the Union Pacific Railroad Company.  Why should it have so intended?  Why should it be supposed that Congress would purposely make it more difficult to construct one part of the proposed national highway than another?  The supreme end sought to be attained was, by means of private capital and governmental aid, to secure the construction of the whole line, for the benefit, primarily, of the United States and for the use of all the people.  If, instead of making use of the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California, Congress had itself created a corporation, with authority to construct a road from San Francisco through the territories of the United States to meet the Union Pacific Railroad Company, no one would suggest that the stockholders of such a corporation would have been liable for its debts unless Congress expressly imposed liability upon them.  In respect of the liability of stockholders to the United States on account of its subsidy bonds, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 161 U. S. 431</a></p><p> we cannot believe that Congress intended to apply to the stockholders of the state corporation, selected to participate in the great work of establishing railroad and telegraphic communication between the Missouri River and the Pacific Ocean, any rule that it did not prescribe for stockholders of a national corporation created for the purpose of accomplishing the same object.</p>\n<p>As Congress contemplated the construction of one connected, continuous line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, to be used for governmental and public purposes; as it recognized "the necessity of uniting, by iron bands, the destiny of the Pacific and Atlantic states;" as its enactments disclose an intention to grant national aid to the corporations named, upon terms and conditions applicable alike to all of them -- we cannot impute to it the purpose to make a discrimination against one part of that line that would necessarily have retarded the accomplishment of the important public object which it had in view.  Throughout the whole of the acts referred to is manifest the purpose that the California corporation and other state corporations named should enjoy the rights, immunities, benefits, and privileges given to them upon the same terms and conditions as were prescribed for the Union Pacific Railroad Company.  But the imposition of liability upon the stockholders of the California corporation for the debt of that corporation arising out of the bonds it received from the United States, when no such liability was imposed upon the stockholders of the Union Pacific Railroad corporation on account of like bonds received by it, would be inconsistent with that equality in terms and conditions which Congress prescribed for the corporations that were invited or permitted to participate in the grants, rights, benefits, privileges, and immunities granted by the general government to the corporation created by it.</p>\n<p>It should be remembered that the question here is not whether the stockholders of the California company can be made liable for its debts to the United States arising in some other way than under the Pacific Railroad Acts, and by the acceptance of United States bonds in aid of the construction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 161 U. S. 432</a></p><p> of its road.  Nor are are now to decide whether the adoption of the California corporation as an instrument of the national government in accomplishing a national object exempted its stockholders from liability under the Constitution and laws of California to ordinary creditors.  The question before us relates only to the liability of the stockholders of the California corporation on account of a claim of the United States, arising out of particular acts of Congress which authorized the issuing and delivery of bonds to that corporation and made such provision for the security of the United States as Congress deemed necessary and proper, but which did not reserve any right to look to the stockholders of that corporation if it failed or refused to meet the obligation imposed upon it in respect of those bonds.</p>\n<p>Touching the obligation of the several railroad companies to pay at maturity the bonds received from the United States in aid of the construction of a railroad and telegraph line to the Pacific Ocean, there are cogent reasons, apart from the words of the act of Congress, why a rule should not be applied to the stockholders of the Central Pacific Railroad Company which confessedly cannot be applied to stockholders of the Union Pacific Railroad Company.  Both corporations participated in the execution of the purposes of Congress.  Each received franchises and powers from the federal government to be exerted for objects of national concern.  Although the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California became an artificial being under the laws of that state, its road owes its existence to the national government, for all that was accomplished by the corporation that constructed and owns it was accomplished in the exercise of privileges granted by, and because of the aid derived from, the United States.  "By the act of 1862," this Court has said</p>\n<p>"Congress granted this corporation a right to build a road from San Francisco or the navigable waters of the Sacramento River to the eastern boundary of the state, and thence through the territories of the United States until it met the road of the Union Pacific company.  For this purpose, all the rights, privileges, and franchises were given this company that were granted the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 161 U. S. 433</a></p><p> Union Pacific Company except the franchise of being a corporation, and such others as were merely incident to the organization of the company.  The land grants and subsidy bonds to this company were the same in character and quantity as those to the Union Pacific, and the same right of amendment was reserved.  Each of the companies was required to file in the Department of the Interior its acceptance of the conditions imposed before it could become entitled to the benefits conferred by the act.  This was promptly done by the Central Pacific Company, and in this way that corporation voluntarily submitted itself to such legislative control by Congress as was reserved under the power of amendment."</p>\n<p>Again, in the same case:  "But for the corporate powers and financial aid granted by Congress, it is not probable that the road would have been built."  <em>Sinking Fund Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/700/case.html#710">99 U.

S. 38</a></span>, Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of the Court, referred to the Pacific Railroad acts relating to the Central Pacific Railroad, and said:</p>\n<p>"Thus, without referring to the other franchises and privileges conferred upon this company, the fundamental franchise was given by the acts of 1862, and the subsequent acts to construct a railroad from the Pacific Ocean, across the State of California and the federal territories until it should meet the Union Pacific, which it did meet at Ogden, in the Territory of Utah."</p>\n<p>The relations between the California corporation and the state were of no concern to the national government at the time the purpose was formed to establish a great highway across the continent for governmental and public use.  Congress chose this existing artificial being as an instrumentality to accomplish national ends, and the relations between the United States and that corporation ought to be determined by the enactments which established those relations, and if those enactments do not expressly nor by implication subject the stockholders of such corporation to liability for its debts, it is to be presumed that Congress intended to waive its right to impose any such liability.</p>\n<p>The views we have expressed render it unnecessary to consider </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 161 U.
