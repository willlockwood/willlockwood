He filed his own charge and a subsequent suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, claiming that NAS fired him to retaliate against Regalado for filing her charge.  The District Court granted NAS summary judgment on the ground that third-party retaliation claims were not permitted by Title VII, which prohibits discrimination against an employee \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he has made a [Title VII] charge,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U.

Dictum in <em>Trafficante</em> v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/205/index.html">409 U. S. 205</a>, suggesting that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s aggrievement requirement reaches as far as Article III permits, is too expansive and the Court declines to follow it.  At the other extreme, limiting \xe2\x80\x9cperson aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d to the person who was the subject of unlawful retaliation is an artificially narrow reading.  A common usage of the term \xe2\x80\x9cperson aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d avoids both of these extremes.  The Administrative Procedure Act, which authorizes suit to challenge a federal agency by any \xe2\x80\x9cperson \xe2\x80\xa6 adversely affected or aggrieved \xe2\x80\xa6 within the meaning of a relevant statute,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702, establishes a regime under which a plaintiff may not sue unless he \xe2\x80\x9cfalls within the \xe2\x80\x98zone of interests\xe2\x80\x99 sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>National Wildlife Federation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/871/index.html">497 U. S. 871</a>, 883.  Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s term \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d incorporates that test, enabling suit by any plaintiff with an interest \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98arguably [sought] to be protected\xe2\x80\x99 by the statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>National Credit Union Admin.</em> v. <em>First Nat.

NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP<br/>\n562 U. S. ____ (2011)<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 09-291<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ERIC L. THOMPSON, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> NORTH\nAMERICAN STAINLESS, LP</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[January 24, 2011]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until 2003, both petitioner Eric Thompson and his fianc\xc3\xa9e, Miriam Regalado, were employees of respondent North American Stainless (NAS).  In February 2003, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) notified NAS that Regalado had filed a charge alleging sex discrimination.  Three weeks later, NAS fired Thompson.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompson then filed a charge with the EEOC.  After conciliation efforts proved unsuccessful, he sued NAS in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <em>et seq</em>., claiming that NAS had fired him in order to retaliate against Regalado for filing her charge with the EEOC.  The District Court granted summary judgment to NAS, concluding that Title VII \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not permit third party retaliation claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  435 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 633, 639 (ED Ky. 2006).  After a panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court, the Sixth Circuit granted rehearing en banc and affirmed by a 10-to-6 vote.  567 F.\xc2\xa03d 804 (2009).  The court reasoned that because Thompson did not \xe2\x80\x9cengag[e] in any statutorily protected activity, either on his own behalf or on behalf of Miriam Regalado,\xe2\x80\x9d he \xe2\x80\x9cis not included in the class of persons for whom Congress created a retaliation cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 807\xe2\x80\x93808.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  561 U. S. ___ (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title VII provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees \xe2\x80\xa6 because he has made a charge\xe2\x80\x9d under Title VII.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  The statute permits \xe2\x80\x9ca person claiming to be aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d to file a charge with the EEOC alleging that the employer committed an unlawful employment practice, and, if the EEOC declines to sue the employer, it permits a civil action to \xe2\x80\x9cbe brought \xe2\x80\xa6 by the person claiming to be aggrieved \xe2\x80\xa6 by the alleged unlawful employment practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(b), (f)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that Regalado\xe2\x80\x99s filing of a charge with the EEOC was protected conduct under Title VII.  In the procedural posture of this case, we are also required to assume that NAS fired Thompson in order to retaliate against Regalado for filing a charge of discrimination.  This case therefore presents two questions: First, did NAS\xe2\x80\x99s firing of Thompson constitute unlawful retaliation?  And second, if it did, does Title VII grant Thompson a cause of action?</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With regard to the first question, we have little difficulty concluding that if the facts alleged by Thompson are true, then NAS\xe2\x80\x99s firing of Thompson violated Title VII.  In <em>Burlington N. &amp; S.\xc2\xa0F.\xc2\xa0R. Co.</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/53/index.html">548 U. S. 53</a> (2006), we held that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision must be construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct.  We reached that conclusion by contrasting the text of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision with its substantive antidiscrimination provision.  Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98with respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and discriminatory practices that would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 62 (quoting 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a) (emphasis deleted)).  In contrast, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision prohibits an employer from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discriminat[ing] against any of his employees\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for engaging in protected conduct, without specifying the employer acts that are prohibited.  548 U. S., at 62 (quoting \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) (emphasis deleted)).  Based on this textual distinction and our understanding of the antiretaliation provision\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe antiretaliation provision, unlike the substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 64.  Rather, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision prohibits any employer action that \xe2\x80\x9cwell might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 68 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fianc\xc3\xa9 would be fired.  Indeed, NAS does not dispute that Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s firing meets the standard set forth in <em>Burlington</em>.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 30.  NAS raises the concern, however, that prohibiting reprisals against third parties will lead to difficult line-drawing problems concerning the types of relationships entitled to protection.  Perhaps retaliating against an employee by firing his fianc\xc3\xa9e would dissuade the employee from engaging in protected activity, but what about firing an employee\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend, close friend, or trusted co-worker?  Applying the <em>Burlington </em>standard to third-party reprisals, NAS argues, will place the employer at risk any time it fires any employee who happens to have a connection to a different employee who filed a charge with the EEOC.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we acknowledge the force of this point, we do not think it justifies a categorical rule that third-party reprisals do not violate Title VII.  As explained above, we adopted a broad standard in <em>Burlington </em>because Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision is worded broadly.  We think there is no textual basis for making an exception to it for third-party reprisals, and a preference for clear rules cannot justify departing from statutory text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must also decline to identify a fixed class of relationships for which third-party reprisals are unlawful.  We expect that firing a close family member will almost always meet the <em>Burlington</em> standard, and inflicting a milder reprisal on a mere acquaintance will almost never do so, but beyond that we are reluctant to generalize.  As we explained in <em>Burlington</em>, 548 U. S., at 69, \xe2\x80\x9cthe significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Given the broad statutory text and the variety of workplace contexts in which retaliation may occur, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision is simply not reducible to a comprehensive set of clear rules.  We emphasize, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe provision\xe2\x80\x99s standard for judging harm must be objective,\xe2\x80\x9d so as to \xe2\x80\x9cavoi[d] the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s unusual subjective feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 68\xe2\x80\x9369.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The more difficult question in this case is whether Thompson may sue NAS for its alleged violation of Title VII.  The statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9ca civil action may be brought \xe2\x80\xa6 by the person claiming to be aggrieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(1).  The Sixth Circuit concluded that this provision was merely a reiteration of the requirement that the plaintiff have Article III standing.  567 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 808, n.\xc2\xa01.  We do not understand how that can be.  The provision unquestionably permits a person \xe2\x80\x9cclaiming to be aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d to bring \xe2\x80\x9ca civil action.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is arguable that the aggrievement referred to is nothing more than the minimal Article III standing, which consists of injury in fact caused by the defendant and remediable by the court.  See <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560\xe2\x80\x93561 (1992).  But Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s claim undoubtedly meets those requirements, so if that is indeed all that aggrievement consists of, he may sue.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have suggested in dictum that the Title VII aggrievement requirement conferred a right to sue on all who satisfied Article III standing.  <em>Trafficante</em> v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/205/index.html">409 U. S. 205</a> (1972), involved the \xe2\x80\x9cperson aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d provision of Title VIII (the Fair Housing Act) rather than Title VII.  In deciding the case, however, we relied upon, and cited with approval, a Third Circuit opinion involving Title VII, which, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cconcluded that the words used showed \xe2\x80\x98a congressional\nintention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by Article III of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 209 (quoting <em>Hackett</em> v. <em>McGuire Bros., Inc.</em>, 445 F.\xc2\xa02d 442, 446 (1971)).  We think that dictum regarding Title VII was too expansive.  Indeed, the <em>Trafficante </em>opinion did not adhere to it in expressing its Title VIII holding that residents of an apartment complex could sue the owner for his racial discrimination against prospective tenants.  The opinion said that the \xe2\x80\x9cperson aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d of Title VIII was coextensive with Article III \xe2\x80\x9c<em>insofar as tenants of the same housing unit that is charged with discrimination are concerned</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  409 U. S.<em>,</em> at 209 (emphasis added).  Later opinions, we must acknowledge, reiterate that the term \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d in Title VIII reaches as far as Article III permits, see <em>Bennett</em> v. <em>Spear</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/154/index.html">520 U. S. 154</a>, 165\xe2\x80\x93166 (1997); <em>Gladstone, Realtors</em> v. <em>Village of Bellwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/91/index.html">441 U. S. 91</a>, 109 (1979), though the holdings of those cases are compatible with the \xe2\x80\x9czone of interests\xe2\x80\x9d limitation that we discuss below.  In any event, it is Title VII rather than Title VIII that is before us here, and as to that we are surely not bound by the <em>Trafficante </em>dictum.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now find that this dictum was ill-considered, and we decline to follow it.  If any person injured in the Article III sense by a Title VII violation could sue, absurd consequences would follow.  For example, a shareholder would be able to sue a company for firing a valuable employee for racially discriminatory reasons, so long as he could show that the value of his stock decreased as a consequence.  At oral argument Thompson acknowledged that such a suit would not lie, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\xe2\x80\x936.  We agree, and therefore conclude that the term \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d must be construed more narrowly than the outer boundaries of Article III.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the other extreme from the position that \xe2\x80\x9cperson aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d means anyone with Article III standing, NAS argues that it is a term of art that refers only to the employee who engaged in the protected activity.  We know of no other context in which the words carry this artificially narrow meaning, and if that is what Congress intended it would more naturally have said \xe2\x80\x9cperson claiming to have been discriminated against\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cperson claiming to be aggrieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  We see no basis in text or prior practice for limiting the latter phrase to the person who was the subject of unlawful retaliation.  Moreover, such a reading contradicts the very holding of <em>Trafficante</em>, which was that residents of an apartment complex were \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s] aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d by discrimination against prospective tenants.  We see no reason why the same phrase in Title VII should be given a narrower meaning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view there is a common usage of the term \xe2\x80\x9cperson aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d that avoids the extremity of equating it with Article III and yet is fully consistent with our application of the term in <em>Trafficante.  </em>The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7551 <em>et seq</em>., authorizes suit to challenge a federal agency by any \xe2\x80\x9cperson \xe2\x80\xa6 adversely affected or aggrieved \xe2\x80\xa6 within the meaning of a relevant statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7702.  We have held that this language establishes a regime under which a plaintiff may not sue unless he \xe2\x80\x9cfalls within the \xe2\x80\x98zone of interests\xe2\x80\x99 sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>National Wildlife Federation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/871/index.html">497 U. S. 871</a>, 883 (1990).  We have described the \xe2\x80\x9czone of interests\xe2\x80\x9d test as denying a right of review \xe2\x80\x9cif\nthe plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clarke</em> v. <em>Securities Industry Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/388/index.html">479 U. S. 388</a>, 399\xe2\x80\x93400 (1987).  We hold that the term \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d in Title VII incorporates this test, enabling suit by any plaintiff with an interest \xe2\x80\x9carguably [sought] to be protected by the statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>National Credit Union Admin.</em> v. <em>First Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/479/index.html">522 U. S. 479</a>, 495 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), while excluding plaintiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III sense but whose interests are unrelated to the statutory prohibitions in Title VII.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying that test here, we conclude that Thompson falls within the zone of interests protected by Title VII.  Thompson was an employee of NAS, and the purpose of Title VII is to protect employees from their employers\xe2\x80\x99 unlawful actions.  Moreover, accepting the facts as alleged, Thompson is not an accidental victim of the retaliation\xe2\x80\x94collateral damage, so to speak, of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful act.  To the contrary, injuring him was the employer\xe2\x80\x99s intended means of harming Regalado.  Hurting him was the unlawful act by which the employer punished her.  In those circumstances, we think Thompson well within the zone of interests sought to be protected by Title VII.

In its Compliance Manual, the EEOC counsels that Title VII \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[s] retaliation against someone so closely related to or associated with the person exercising his or her statutory rights that it would discourage or prevent the person from pursuing those rights.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (quoting EEOC Compliance Manual \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93II(C)(3) (1998)).  Such retaliation \xe2\x80\x9ccan be challenged,\xe2\x80\x9d the Manual affirms, \xe2\x80\x9cby both the individual who engaged in protected activity and the relative, where both are employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (quoting Compliance Manual \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93II(B)(3)(c)).  The EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s statements in the Manual merit deference under <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a> (1944).  See <em>Federal Express Corp.</em> v. <em>Holowecki</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/389/index.html">552 U. S. 389</a>, 399\xe2\x80\x93400 (2008).  The EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Title VII, I further note, is consistent with interpretations of analogous statutes by other federal agencies.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Advertisers Mfg. Co.</em>, 823 F. 2d 1086, 1088\xe2\x80\x931089 (CA7 1987) (adopting NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s position that retaliation against a relative violates the National Labor Relations Act); <em>Tasty Baking Co.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, 254 F.\xc2\xa03d 114, 127\xe2\x80\x93128 (CADC 2001) (same), cited in Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
