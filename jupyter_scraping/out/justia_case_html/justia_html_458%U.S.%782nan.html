On April 1, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 458 U. S. 784</a></p><p> 1975, at approximately 7:45 a.m., Thomas and Eunice Kersey, aged 86 and 74, were robbed and fatally shot at their farmhouse in central Florida.  The evidence showed that Sampson and Jeanette Armstrong had gone to the back door of the Kersey house and asked for water for an overheated car.  When Mr. Kersey came out of the house, Sampson Armstrong grabbed him, pointed a gun at him, and told Jeanette Armstrong to take his money.  Mr. Kersey cried for help, and his wife came out of the house with a gun and shot Jeanette Armstrong, wounding her.  Sampson Armstrong, and perhaps Jeanette Armstrong, then shot and killed both of the Kerseys, dragged them into the kitchen, and took their money and fled.</p>\n<p>Two witnesses testified that they drove past the Kersey house between 7:30 and 7:40 a.m. and saw a large cream- or yellow-colored car parked beside the road about 200 yards from the house, and that a man was sitting in the car.  Another witness testified that, at approximately 6:45 a.m., he saw Ida Jean Shaw, petitioner\'s common law wife and Jeanette Armstrong\'s mother, driving a yellow Buick with a vinyl top which belonged to her and petitioner Earl Enmund.  Enmund was a passenger in the car along, with an unidentified woman.  At about 8 a.m., the same witness saw the car return at a high rate of speed.  Enmund was driving, Ida Jean Shaw was in the front seat, and one of the other two people in the car was lying down across the back seat.</p>\n<p>Enmund, Sampson Armstrong, and Jeanette Armstrong were indicted for the first-degree murder and robbery of the Kerseys.  Enmund and Sampson Armstrong were tried together. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The prosecutor maintained in his closing argument that "Sampson Armstrong killed the old people."  Record 1577.  The judge instructed the jury that</p>\n<p>"[t]he killing of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 458 U. S. 785</a></p><p> human being while engaged in the perpetration of or in the attempt to perpetrate the offense of robbery is murder in the first degree even though there is no premeditated design or intent to kill."</p>\n<p>App. 6.  He went on to instruct them that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n order to sustain a conviction of first degree murder while engaging in the perpetration of or in the attempted perpetration of the crime of robbery, the evidence must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was actually present and was actively aiding and abetting the robbery or attempted robbery, and that the unlawful killing occurred in the perpetration of or in the attempted perpetration of the robbery."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 9.</p>\n<p>The jury found both Enmund and Sampson Armstrong guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of robbery.  A separate sentencing hearing was held, and the jury recommended the death penalty for both defendants under the Florida procedure whereby the jury advises the trial judge whether to impose the death penalty.  <em>See</em> Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 921.141(2) (1981).  The trial judge then sentenced Enmund to death on the two counts of first-degree murder.  Enmund appealed, and the Florida Supreme Court remanded for written findings as required by Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 921.141(3) (1981).  The trial judge found four statutory aggravating circumstances:  the capital felony was committed while Enmund was engaged in or was an accomplice in the commission of an armed robbery, Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 921.141(5)(d) (1981); the capital felony was committed for pecuniary gain, \xc2\xa7 921.141(5)(f); it was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, \xc2\xa7 921.141(5)(h); and Enmund was previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence, \xc2\xa7 921.141(5)(b).  399 So.2d 1362, 1371-1372 (Fla.1981).  The court found that "none of the statutory mitigating circumstances applied" to Enmund, and that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.  <em>Id.</em> at 1372.  Enmund was therefore sentenced to death on each of the murder counts. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="786">Page 458 U. S. 786</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Florida Supreme Court affirmed Enmund\'s conviction and sentences.  It found that</p>\n<p>"[t]here was no direct evidence at trial that Earl Enmund was present at the back door of the Kersey home when the plan to rob the elderly couple led to their being murdered."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1370.  However, it rejected petitioner\'s argument that, at most, he could be found guilty of second-degree murder under Florida\'s felony murder rule.  The court explained that the interaction of the "<em>felony murder rule and the law of principals combine to make a felon generally responsible for the lethal acts of his co-felon.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at 1369, quoting <em>Adams v. State,</em> 341 So.2d 765, 768-769 (Fla.1976), <em>cert. denied,</em> 434 U.S. 878 (1977).  Although petitioner could be convicted of second-degree murder only if he were an accessory before the fact, rather than a principal, the Florida Supreme Court reasoned:\n</em></p>\n<p>"[T]he only evidence of the degree of his participation is the jury\'s likely inference that he was the person in the car by the side of the road near the scene of the crimes.  The jury could have concluded that he was there, a few hundred feet away, waiting to help the robbers escape with the Kerseys\' money.  The evidence, therefore, was sufficient to find that the appellant was a principal of the second degree, constructively present aiding and abetting the commission of the crime of robbery.  This conclusion supports the verdicts of murder in the first degree on the basis of the felony murder portion of section 782.04(1)(a)."</p>\n<p>399 So.2d at 1370. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 458 U. S. 787</a></p><p> The State Supreme Court rejected two of the four statutory aggravating circumstances found by the trial court.  It held that the findings that the murders were committed in the course of a robbery and that they were committed for pecuniary gain referred to the same aspect of petitioner\'s crime, and must be treated as only one aggravating circumstance.  <em>Id.</em> at 1373.  In addition, the court held that "[t]he recited circumstance, that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel, cannot be approved."  <em>Ibid.,</em> citing <em>Armstrong v. State,</em> 399 So.2d 953 (Fla.1981). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  However, because there were two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances, the death sentence was affirmed.  In so doing, the court expressly rejected Enmund\'s submission that, because the evidence did not establish that he intended to take life, the death penalty was barred by the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  399 So.2d at 1371.</p>\n<p>We granted Enmund\'s petition for certiorari, 454 U.S. 939 (1981), presenting the question whether death is a valid penalty under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments for one who neither took life, attempted to take life, nor intended to take life. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="788">Page 458 U. S. 788</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>As recounted above, the Florida Supreme Court held that the record supported no more than the inference that Enmund was the person in the car by the side of the road at the time of the killings, waiting to help the robbers escape.  This was enough under Florida law to make Enmund a constructive aider and abettor, and hence a principal in first-degree murder upon whom the death penalty could be imposed.  It was thus irrelevant to Enmund\'s challenge to the death sentence that he did not himself kill and was not present at the killings; also beside the point was whether he intended that the Kerseys be killed or anticipated that lethal force would or might be used if necessary to effectuate the robbery or a safe escape.  We have concluded that imposition of the death penalty in these circumstances is inconsistent with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment is directed, in part, "<em>against all punishments which, by their excessive length or severity, are greatly disproportioned to the offenses charged.\'"  <em>Weems v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/217/349/case.html">217 U. S. 349</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/217/349/case.html#371">217 U. S. 371</a></span> (1910), quoting <em>O\'Neil v.

This Court most recently held a punishment excessive in relation to the crime charged in <em>Coker v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html">433 U. S. 584</a></span> (1977).  There the plurality opinion concluded that the imposition of the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman\n</em></p>\n<p>"is grossly disproportionate and excessive punishment for the crime of rape, and is therefore forbidden by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#592">433 U. S. 592</a></span>.  In reaching this conclusion, it was stressed that our judgment "should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Accordingly, the Court looked to the historical development of the punishment at issue, legislative judgments, international opinion, and the sentencing decisions juries have made before bringing its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="789">Page 458 U. S. 789</a></p><p> own judgment to bear on the matter.  We proceed to analyze the punishment at issue in this case in a similar manner.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Coker plurality observed that, "[a]t no time in the last 50 years have a majority of the States authorized death as a punishment for rape."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#593">433 U. S. 593</a></span>.   More importantly, in reenacting death penalty laws in order to satisfy the criteria established in <em>Furman v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/case.html">408 U. S. 238</a></span> (1972), only three States provided the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman in their revised statutes.  433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#594">433 U. S. 594</a></span>.  The plurality therefore concluded that</p>\n<p>"[t]he current judgment with respect to the death penalty for rape is not wholly unanimous among state legislatures, but it obviously weighs very heavily on the side of rejecting capital punishment as a suitable penalty for raping an adult woman."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#596">433 U. S. 596</a></span> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Thirty-six state and federal jurisdictions presently authorize the death penalty.  Of these, only eight jurisdictions authorize imposition of the death penalty solely for participation in a robbery in which another robber takes life. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Of the remaining 28 jurisdictions, in 4, felony murder is not a capital crime. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Eleven States require some culpable mental state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="790">Page 458 U. S. 790</a></p><p> with respect to the homicide as a prerequisite to conviction of a crime for which the death penalty is authorized.  Of these 11 States, 8 make knowing, intentional, purposeful, or premeditated killing an element of capital murder. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Three other States require proof of a culpable mental state short of intent, such as recklessness or extreme indifference to human life, before the death penalty may be imposed. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In these 11 States, therefore, the actors in a felony murder are not subject to the death penalty without proof of their mental state, proof which was not required with respect to Enmund </p><p><a class="page-number" name="791">Page 458 U. S. 791</a></p><p> either under the trial court\'s instructions or under the law announced by the Florida Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Four additional jurisdictions do not permit a defendant such as Enmund to be put to death.  Of these, one State flatly prohibits capital punishment in cases where the defendant did not actually commit murder. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Two jurisdictions preclude the death penalty in cases, such as this one, where the defendant</p>\n<p>"was a principal in the offense, which was committed by another, but his participation was relatively minor, although not so minor as to constitute a defense to prosecution. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]"</p>\n<p>One other State limits the death penalty in felony murders to narrow circumstances not involved here. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Nine of the remaining States deal with the imposition of the death penalty for a vicarious felony murder in their capital sentencing statutes.  In each of these States, a defendant may not be executed <em>solely</em> for participating in a felony in which a person was killed if the defendant did not actually cause the victim\'s death.  For a defendant to be executed in these States, typically the statutory aggravating circumstances which are present must outweigh mitigating factors.  To be sure, a vicarious felony murderer may be sentenced to death in these jurisdictions absent an intent to kill if sufficient aggravating circumstances are present.  However, six </p><p><a class="page-number" name="792">Page 458 U. S. 792</a></p><p> of these nine States make it a statutory <em>mitigating</em> circumstance that the defendant was an accomplice in a capital felony committed by another person and his participation was relatively minor. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  By making minimal participation in a capital felony committed by another person a mitigating circumstance, these sentencing statutes reduce the likelihood that a person will be executed for vicarious felony murder.  The remaining three jurisdictions exclude felony murder from their lists of aggravating circumstances that will support a death sentence. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  In each of these nine States, a nontriggerman guilty of felony murder cannot be sentenced to death for the felony murder absent aggravating circumstances above and beyond the felony murder itself.</p>\n<p>Thus, only a small minority of jurisdictions -- eight -- allow the death penalty to be imposed solely because the defendant somehow participated in a robbery in the course of which a murder was committed.  Even if the nine States are included where such a defendant could be executed for an unintended felony murder if sufficient aggravating circumstances are present to outweigh mitigating circumstances -- which often include the defendant\'s minimal participation in the murder -- only about a third of American jurisdictions would ever permit a defendant who somehow participated in a robbery where a murder occurred to be sentenced to die.  Moreover, of the eight States which have enacted new death penalty statutes since 1978, none authorize capital punishment in such circumstances. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  While the current legislative judgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="793">Page 458 U. S. 793</a></p><p> with respect to imposition of the death penalty where a defendant did not take life, attempt to take it, or intend to take life is neither "wholly unanimous among state legislatures," <em>Coker v. Georgia,</em> 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#596">433 U. S. 596</a></span>, nor as compelling as the legislative judgments considered in <em>Coker,</em> it nevertheless weighs on the side of rejecting capital punishment for the crime at issue. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="794">Page 458 U.

Georgia, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#596">433 U. S. 596</a></span>, quoting <em>Gregg v.

The evidence is overwhelming that American juries have repudiated imposition of the death penalty for crimes such as petitioner\'s.  First, according to the petitioner, a search of all reported appellate court decisions since 1954 in cases where a defendant was executed for homicide shows that, of the 362 executions, in 339, the person executed personally committed a homicidal assault. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  In 2 cases, the person executed had another person commit the homicide for him, and, in 16 cases, the facts were not reported in sufficient detail to determine whether the person executed committed the homicide. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The survey revealed only 6 cases out of 362 where a nontriggerman felony murderer was executed.  All six executions took place in </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="795">Page 458 U. S. 795</a></em></p><p><em> 1955.  By contrast, there were 72 executions for rape in this country between 1955 and this Court\'s decision in <em>Coker v. Georgia</em> in 1977. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>That juries have rejected the death penalty in cases, such as this one, where the defendant did not commit the homicide, was not present when the killing took place, and did not participate in a plot or scheme to murder is also shown by petitioner\'s survey of the Nation\'s death-row population. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  As of October 1, 1981, there were 796 inmates under sentences of death for homicide.  Of the 739 for whom sufficient data are available, only 41 did not participate in the fatal assault on the victim.  Of the 40 among the 41 for whom sufficient information was available, only 16 were not physically present when the fatal assault was committed.  These 16 prisoners included only 3, including petitioner, who were sentenced to die absent a finding that they hired or solicited someone else to kill the victim or participated in a scheme designed to kill the victim.  The figures for Florida are similar. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Forty-five felony murderers are currently on death row.  The Florida Supreme Court either found or affirmed a trial court or jury finding that the defendant intended life to be taken in 36 cases.  In eight cases, the courts made no finding with respect to intent, but the defendant was the triggerman in each case.  In only one case -- Enmund\'s -- there was no finding of an intent to kill and the defendant was not the triggerman. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="796">Page 458 U. S. 796</a></p><p> The State does not challenge this analysis of the Florida cases.</p>\n<p>The dissent criticizes these statistics on the ground that they do not reveal the percentage of homicides that were charged as felony murders or the percentage of cases where the State sought the death penalty for an accomplice guilty of felony murder.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#818">458 U. S. 818</a></span>-819.  We doubt whether it is possible to gather such information, and at any rate, it would be relevant if prosecutors rarely sought the death penalty for accomplice felony murder, for it would tend to indicate that prosecutors, who represent society\'s interest in punishing crime, consider the death penalty excessive for accomplice felony murder.  The fact remains that we are not aware of a single person convicted of felony murder over the past quarter century who did not kill or attempt to kill, and did not intend the death of the victim, who has been executed, and that only three persons in that category are presently sentenced to die.  Nor can these figures be discounted by attributing to petitioner the argument that "death is an unconstitutional penalty absent an intent to kill," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#819">458 U. S. 819</a></span>, and observing that the statistics are incomplete with respect to intent.  Petitioner\'s argument is that, because he did not kill, attempt to kill, and he did not intend to kill, the death penalty is disproportionate as applied to him, and the statistics he cites are adequately tailored to demonstrate that juries -- and perhaps prosecutors as well -- consider death a disproportionate penalty for those who fall within his category. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="797">Page 458 U. S. 797</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although the judgments of legislatures, juries, and prosecutors weigh heavily in the balance, it is for us ultimately to judge whether the Eighth Amendment permits imposition of the death penalty on one such as Enmund who aids and abets a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force will be employed.  We have concluded, along with most legislatures and juries, that it does not.</p>\n<p>We have no doubt that robbery is a serious crime deserving serious punishment.  It is not, however, a crime "so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death."  <em>Gregg v. Georgia,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html#184">428 U. S. 184</a></span> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>"[I]t does not compare with murder, which does involve the unjustified taking of human life.  Although it may be accompanied by another crime, [robbery], by definition, does not include the death of or even the serious injury to another person.  The murderer kills; the [robber], if no more than that, does not.  Life is over for the victim of the murderer; for the [robbery] victim, life . . . is not over, and normally is not beyond repair."</p>\n<p><em>Coker v. Georgia,</em> 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#598">433 U. S. 598</a></span> (footnote omitted).  As was said of the crime of rape in <em>Coker,</em> we have the abiding conviction that the death penalty, which is "unique in its severity and irrevocability," <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html#187">428 U. S. 187</a></span>, is an excessive penalty for the robber who, as such, does not take human life. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="798">Page 458 U. S. 798</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Here, the robbers did commit murder; but they were subjected to the death penalty only because they killed as well as robbed.  The question before us is not the disproportionality of death as a penalty for murder, but rather the validity of capital punishment for Enmund\'s own conduct.  The focus must be on his culpability, not on that of those who committed the robbery and shot the victims, for we insist on "individualized consideration as a constitutional requirement in imposing the death sentence," <em>Lockett v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html">438 U. S. 586</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#605">438 U. S. 605</a></span> (1978) (footnote omitted), which means that we must focus on "relevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender."  <em>Woodson v. North Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html">428 U. S. 280</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html#304">428 U. S. 304</a></span> (1976).  Enmund himself did not kill or attempt to kill; and, as construed by the Florida Supreme Court, the record before us does not warrant a finding that Enmund had any intention of participating in or facilitating a murder.  Yet under Florida law, death was an authorized penalty because Enmund aided and abetted a robbery in the course of which murder was committed.  It is fundamental that "causing harm intentionally must be punished more severely than causing the same harm unintentionally."  H. Hart, Punishment and Responsibility 162 (1968).  Enmund did not kill or intend to kill, and thus his culpability is plainly different from that of the robbers who killed; yet the State treated them alike, and attributed to Enmund the culpability of those who killed the Kerseys.  This was impermissible under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p>In <em>Gregg v. Georgia,</em> the opinion announcing the judgment observed that "[t]he death penalty is said to serve two principal social purposes:  retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders."  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html#183">428 U. S. 183</a></span> (footnote omitted).  Unless the death penalty, when applied to those in Enmund\'s position, measurably contributes to one or both of these goals, it "is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering," and hence an unconstitutional punishment.  <em>Coker v. Georgia, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#592">433 U. S. 592</a></span>.  We are quite unconvinced, however, that the threat </p><p><a class="page-number" name="799">Page 458 U. S. 799</a></p><p> that the death penalty will be imposed for murder will measurably deter one who does not kill and has no intention or purpose that life will be taken.  Instead, it seems likely that "capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation," <em>Fisher v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/463/case.html">328 U. S. 463</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/463/case.html#484">328 U. S. 484</a></span> (1946) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), for if a person does not intend that life be taken or contemplate that lethal force will be employed by others, the possibility that the death penalty will be imposed for vicarious felony murder will not "enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act."  <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html#186">428 U. S. 186</a></span> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>It would be very different if the likelihood of a killing in the course of a robbery were so substantial that one should share the blame for the killing if he somehow participated in the felony.  But competent observers have concluded that there is no basis in experience for the notion that death so frequently occurs in the course of a felony for which killing is not an essential ingredient that the death penalty should be considered as a justifiable deterrent to the felony itself.  Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7 210.2, Comment, p. 38, and n. 96.  This conclusion was based on three comparisons of robbery statistics, each of which showed that only about one-half of one percent of robberies resulted in homicide. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  The most recent national </p><p><a class="page-number" name="800">Page 458 U. S. 800</a></p><p> crime statistics strongly support this conclusion. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  In addition to the evidence that killings only rarely occur during robberies is the fact, already noted, that however often death occurs in the course of a felony such as robbery, the death penalty is rarely imposed on one only vicariously guilty of the murder, a fact which further attenuates its possible utility as an effective deterrence.</p>\n<p>As for retribution as a justification for executing Enmund, we think this very much depends on the degree of Enmund\'s culpability -- what Enmund\'s intentions, expectations, and actions were.  American criminal law has long considered a defendant\'s intention -- and therefore his moral guilt -- to be critical to "the degree of [his] criminal culpability," <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/684/case.html">421 U. S. 684</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/684/case.html#698">421 U. S. 698</a></span> (1975), and the Court has found criminal penalties to be unconstitutionally excessive in the absence of intentional wrongdoing.  In <em>Robinson v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/660/case.html">370 U. S. 660</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/660/case.html#667">370 U. S. 667</a></span> (1962), a statute making narcotics addiction a crime, even though such addiction "is apparently an illness which may be contracted innocently or involuntarily," was struck down under the Eighth Amendment.  Similarly, in <em>Weems v. United States,</em> the Court invalidated a statute making it a crime for a public official to make a false entry in a public record but not requiring the offender to "injur[e] anyone by his act or inten[d] to injure anyone."  217 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/217/349/case.html#363">217 U. S. 363</a></span>.  The Court employed a similar approach in <em>Godfrey v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/420/case.html">446 U. S. 420</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/420/case.html#433">446 U. S. 433</a></span> (1980), reversing a death sentence based on the existence of an aggravating circumstance because the defendant\'s crime did not reflect "a consciousness </p><p><a class="page-number" name="801">Page 458 U. S. 801</a></p><p> materially more <em>depraved\' than that of any person guilty of murder."\n</em></p>\n<p>For purposes of imposing the death penalty, Enmund\'s criminal culpability must be limited to his participation in the robbery, and his punishment must be tailored to his personal responsibility and moral guilt.  Putting Enmund to death to avenge two killings that he did not commit and had no intention of committing or causing does not measurably contribute to the retributive end of ensuring that the criminal gets his just deserts.  This is the judgment of most of the legislatures that have recently addressed the matter, and we have no reason to disagree with that judgment for purposes of construing and applying the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the death penalty in this case in the absence of proof that Enmund killed or attempted to kill, and regardless of whether Enmund intended or contemplated that life would be taken, we reverse the judgment upholding the death penalty and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Jeanette Armstrong\'s trial was severed and she was convicted of two counts of second-degree murder and one count of robbery and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences.  399 So.2d 1362, 1371 (Fla.1981).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Florida Supreme Court\'s understanding of the evidence differed sharply from that of the trial court with respect to the degree of Enmund\'s participation.  In its sentencing findings, the trial court concluded that Enmund was a major participant in the robbery because he planned the robbery in advance and himself shot the Kerseys.  399 So.2d at 1372.  Both of these findings, as we understand it, were rejected by the Florida Supreme Court\'s holding that the only supportable inference with respect to Enmund\'s participation was that he drove the getaway car.  The dissent, while conceding that this holding negated the finding that Enmund was one of the triggermen, argues that the trial court\'s finding that Enmund planned the robbery was implicitly affirmed.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#809">458 U. S. 809</a></span>.  As we have said, we disagree with that view.  In any event, the question is irrelevant to the constitutional issue before us, since the Florida Supreme Court held that driving the escape car was enough to warrant conviction and the death penalty, whether or not Enmund intended that life be taken or anticipated that lethal force would be used.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Armstrong,</em> the Florida Supreme Court rejected the trial court\'s conclusion that the Kerseys had been killed in order to eliminate them as witnesses, and stated that, according to the only direct account of the events, "the shootings were indeed spontaneous, and were precipitated by the armed resistance of Mrs. Kersey."  399 So.2d at 963.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The petitioner argues a second question:  whether the degree of Enmund\'s participation in the killings was given the consideration required by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.

It begins by noting that 31 States "authorize a sentencer to impose a death sentence for a death that occurs during the course of a robbery."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#819">458 U. S. 819</a></span>.  That is not relevant to this case, however.  Rather, at issue is the number of States which authorize the death penalty where the defendant did not kill, attempt to kill, or intend to kill.  The dissent divides the statutes into three categories.  Its first category of 20 statutes include 8 about which there is no disagreement -- Cal., Fla., Ga., Miss., Nev., S.C. Tenn., and Wyo.  In 11 other States listed by the dissent -- Ariz., Colo., Conn., Idaho, Ind., Mont., Neb., N.M., N.C., Okla., and S.D. -- the dissent looks solely at the provisions defining the crime of capital murder.  Colorado\'s capital sentencing statute makes a defendant\'s minimal participation in a murder an absolute defense to imposition of the death penalty.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em>  Contrary to the dissent\'s claim that this provision would have been of no help to petitioner, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#820">458 U.

Similarly, the Ariz., Conn., Ind., Mont., Neb., and N.C. capital sentencing statutes do not permit capital</p>\n<p>brk:</p>\n<p>punishment solely for vicarious felony murder, and reduce the likelihood that the death penalty will be imposed on a vicarious felony murderer, even where aggravating circumstances are present, by making a defendant\'s minimal participation in the homicide a mitigating circumstance.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F12" name="T12">n</a> 12, <em>supra.</em>  Three other States -- Idaho, Okla., and S.D. -- allow a defendant who does not intend to kill or actually kill to be executed only where other aggravating circumstances are present, and in those States, the felony murder itself cannot serve as an aggravating circumstance.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F13" name="T13">n</a> 13, <em>supra.</em>  New Mexico\'s capital sentencing statute requires the jury to find at least one statutory aggravating circumstance before the death penalty may be imposed, and, in addition, aggravating circumstances must outweigh mitigating circumstances.  N.M.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 31-20A-4(C)(1) and (2) (Supp.1981).  The statute lists seven statutory aggravating circumstances, six of which require an intent to kill.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 31-20A-5(B)(G).  The only aggravating circumstance which does not include an intent element is not applicable here, for it requires that the victim must be "a peace officer who was acting in the lawful discharge of an official duty when he was murdered."  \xc2\xa7 31-20A-5(A).  The remaining State, Vermont, limits the death penalty to narrow circumstances not present here.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F11" name="T11">n</a> 11, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>There is no disagreement that three States require a culpable mental state short of intent before a nontriggerman may be put to death, <em>compare</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra, with post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#821">458 U.

The authors found that juries rebel "at imposing the death penalty for the vicarious criminal responsibility of the defendant," <em>id.</em> at 776, to the extent that felony murder and accomplice factors accounted for more jury decisions not to impose the death penalty when the trial judge decided to impose the death penalty than any other factor.  <em>Id.</em> at 777.  The authors had anticipated that, "because of the rigidity of the felony murder rule, the jury\'s sense of equity would produce a broad area of disagreement."  <em>Id.</em> at 776, n. 10.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  When Thomas Kersey retrieved a water jug to help the Armstrongs, Sampson Armstrong grabbed him, held a gun to him, and told Jeanette Armstrong to take his wallet.  Hearing her husband\'s cries for help, Eunice Kersey came around the side of the house with a gun and shot Jeanette Armstrong.  Sampson Armstrong, and perhaps Jeanette Armstrong, returned the fire, killing both of the Kerseys. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The Armstrongs dragged the bodies into the kitchen, took Thomas Kersey\'s money, and fled to a nearby car, where the petitioner, Earl Enmund, was waiting to help the Armstrongs escape.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Ida Jean Shaw [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] testified that, on March 31, the petitioner and the two Armstrongs were staying at her house.  When she awoke on April 1, the day of the murders, the petitioner, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="803">Page 458 U. S. 803</a></p><p> Jeanette, and Sampson, as well as Shaw\'s 1969 yellow Buick, were gone.  <em>Id.</em> at 1185-1186.  A little after eight o\'clock, either the petitioner or Sampson Armstrong entered the house and told her that Jeanette had been shot.  <em>Id.</em> at 1187-1188.  After learning that Jeanette had been shot during a robbery, Shaw asked the petitioner "[w]hy he did it."  Enmund answered that he had decided to rob Thomas Kersey after he had seen Kersey\'s money a few weeks earlier.  <em>Id.</em> at 1205. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  At the same time, Sampson Armstrong volunteered that he had made sure that the Kerseys were dead.  <em>Id.</em> at 1207-1208.</p>\n<p>Ida Jean Shaw also testified that, pursuant to the petitioner\'s and Sampson Armstrong\'s instructions, she had disposed of a .22-caliber pistol that she normally kept in her car, as well as a .38-caliber pistol belonging to the Armstrongs.  <em>Id.</em> at 1198-1202.  The murder weapons were never recovered. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>In his closing argument, the prosecutor did not argue that Earl Enmund had killed the Kerseys.  Instead, he maintained that the petitioner had initiated and planned the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="804">Page 458 U. S. 804</a></p><p> armed robbery, and was in the car during the killings.  According to the prosecutor, "Sampson Armstrong killed the old people."  <em>Id.</em> at 1577. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>After deliberating for four hours, the jury found Sampson Armstrong and the petitioner each guilty of two counts of first-degree murder [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] and one count of robbery. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  The jury </p><p><a class="page-number" name="805">Page 458 U. S. 805</a></p><p> then heard evidence pertaining to the appropriate sentence for the two defendants, and recommended the death penalty for each defendant on each of the murder counts. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>In its sentencing findings, [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] the trial court found four statutory aggravating circumstances regarding the petitioner\'s involvement in the murder:  (1) the petitioner previously had been convicted of a felony involving the use of violence (an armed robbery in 1957), Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 921.141(5)(b) (1981); (2) the murders were committed during the course of a robbery, \xc2\xa7 921.141(5)(d); (3) the murders were committed for pecuniary gain, \xc2\xa7 921.141(5)(f); and (4) the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel because the Kerseys had been shot in a prone position in an effort to eliminate them as witnesses, \xc2\xa7 921.141(5)(h).  App. 30-31; 399 So.2d 1362, 1371-1372 (Fla.1981). [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="806">Page 458 U. S. 806</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The trial court also found that "<em>none</em> of the statutory mitigating circumstances applied" to the petitioner.  App. 32 (emphasis in original).  Most notably, the court concluded that the evidence clearly showed that the petitioner was an accomplice to the capital felony, and that his participation had not been "relatively minor," but had been major in that he "planned the capital felony and actively participated in an attempt to avoid detection by disposing of the murder weapons."  <em>Ibid.;</em> 399 So.2d at 1373.  <em>See</em> Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 921.141(6)(d) (1981). [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p>Considering these factors, the trial court concluded that the "aggravating circumstances of these capital felonies outweigh the mitigating circumstances," and imposed the death penalty for each count of murder.  App. 32; 399 So.2d at 1373.  The court sentenced the petitioner to life imprisonment for the robbery.  App. 28. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="807">Page 458 U. S. 807</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the petitioner\'s convictions and sentences. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  In challenging his convictions for first-degree murder, the petitioner claimed that there was no evidence that he had committed premeditated murder, or that he had been present aiding and abetting the robbery when the Kerseys were shot.  He argued that, since the jury properly could have concluded only that he was in the car on the highway when the murders were committed, he could be found guilty, at most, of second-degree murder under the State\'s felony murder rule. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>The court rejected this argument.  Quoting from an earlier case, the Florida Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p>"\'[A]n individual who personally kills another during the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate one of the enumerated felonies is guilty of first degree murder. . . .  Moreover, the felon\'s liability for first degree murder extends to all of his co-felons who are personally present.  As perpetrators of the underlying felony, they are principals in the homicide.  In Florida, as in the majority of jurisdictions, the felony murder rule and the law of principals combine to make a felon generally responsible for the lethal acts of his co-felon.  Only if the felon is an accessory before the fact and not personally present does liability attach under the second degree murder provision of the applicable statute in the instant case.\'"</p>\n<p>399 So.2d at 1369 (quoting <em>Adams v. State,</em> 341 So.2d 765, 768-769 (Fla.1976) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied,</em> 434 U.S. 878 (1977)).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="808">Page 458 U. S. 808</a></p><p> Consequently, the critical issue regarding liability was whether the petitioner\'s conduct would make him a principal or merely an accessory before the fact to the underlying robbery.  Under Florida law at the time of the murders,</p>\n<p>"if the accused was present aiding and abetting the commission or attempt of one of the violent felonies listed in the first-degree murder statute, he is equally guilty, with the actual perpetrator of the underlying felony, of first-degree murder."</p>\n<p>399 So.2d at 1370.  Moreover,</p>\n<p>"\'the presence of the aider and abetter need not have been actual, but it is sufficient if he was constructively present, provided the aider, pursuant to a previous understanding, is sufficiently near and so situated as to abet or encourage, or to render assistance to, the actual perpetrator in committing the felonious act or in escaping after its commission.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Pope v. State,</em> 84 Fla. 428, 446, 94 So. 865, 871 (1922)).</p>\n<p>The court noted that there</p>\n<p>"was no direct evidence at trial that Earl Enmund was present at the back door of the Kersey home when the plan to rob the elderly couple led to their being murdered."</p>\n<p>399 So.2d at 1370. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  Instead,</p>\n<p>"the only evidence of the degree of his participation is the jury\'s likely inference that he was the person in the car by the side of the road near the scene of the crimes.  The jury could have concluded that he was there, a few hundred feet away, waiting to help the robbers escape with the Kerseys\' money."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  This evidence, the court concluded, was sufficient to find the petitioner to be a principal under state law, "constructively present aiding and abetting the commission of the crime of robbery," and thus guilty of first-degree murder.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="809">Page 458 U. S. 809</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Turning to the trial court\'s written sentencing findings, the State Supreme Court rejected two of the four aggravating circumstances.  First, the court held that two of the trial judge\'s findings -- that the murders were committed both in the course of robbery and for pecuniary gain -- referred to the same aspect of the petitioner\'s crime.  Consequently, these facts supported only one aggravating circumstance.  Second, citing <em>Armstrong v. State,</em> 399 So.2d 953 (Fla.1981), the court held that "[t]he recited circumstance, that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel, cannot be approved."  399 So.2d at 1373. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  The court affirmed the trial court\'s findings that none of the statutory mitigating circumstances applied.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because one of those findings was that Enmund\'s participation in the capital felony was not minor, due to his role in planning the robbery, the State Supreme Court implicitly affirmed the finding that Enmund had planned the robbery.</p>\n<p>Regarding the petitioner\'s claim that imposition of the death penalty, absent a showing that he intended to kill, would violate the Eighth Amendment\'s ban on cruel and unusual punishments, the court simply stated that the petitioner "offers us no binding legal authority that directly supports this proposition, and we therefore reject it."  <em>Id.</em> at 1371. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="810">Page 458 U. S. 810</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Earl Enmund\'s claim in this Court is that the death sentence imposed by the Florida trial court, and affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court, is unconstitutionally disproportionate to the role he played in the robbery and murders of the Kerseys. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  In particular, he contends that, because he had no actual intent to kill the victims -- in effect, because his behavior and intent were no more blameworthy than that of any robber -- capital punishment is too extreme a penalty.

Rather, through the doctrine of accessorial liability, the petitioner has been convicted of two murders that he did not specifically intend. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]  Thus, it is necessary to examine the concept of proportionality as enunciated in this Court\'s cases to determine whether the penalty imposed on Earl Enmund is unconstitutionally disproportionate to his crimes.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Eighth Amendment concept of proportionality was first fully expressed in <em>Weems v.

[<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]  Moreover, because they turn on considerations unique to each defendant\'s case, these latter factors underlying the concept of proportionality are reflected in this Court\'s conclusion in <em>Lockett v.

This effort fails, however, for the available data do not show that society has rejected conclusively the death penalty for felony murderers.</p>\n<p>As the petitioner acknowledges, the felony murder doctrine, and its corresponding capital penalty, originated hundreds of years ago, [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>] and was a fixture of English common law until 1957, when Parliament declared that an unintentional killing during a felony would be classified as manslaughter. [<a href="#F2/29" name="T2/29">Footnote 2/29</a>]  The common law rule was transplanted to the American Colonies, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="817">Page 458 U. S. 817</a></p><p> and its use continued largely unabated into the 20th century, although legislative reforms often restricted capital felony murder to enumerated violent felonies. [<a href="#F2/30" name="T2/30">Footnote 2/30</a>]</p>\n<p>The petitioner discounts the weight of this historical precedent by arguing that jurors and judges widely resisted the application of capital punishment by acquitting defendants in felony murder cases or by convicting them of noncapital manslaughter. [<a href="#F2/31" name="T2/31">Footnote 2/31</a>]  The force of the petitioner\'s argument is speculative, at best, however, for it is unclear what fraction of the jury nullification in this country resulted from dissatisfaction with the capital felony murder rule.  Much of it, surely, was a reaction to the mandatory death penalty, and the failure of the common law and early state statutes to classify murder by degree.  In fact, it was in response to juror attitudes toward capital punishment that most jurisdictions by the early part of this century replaced their mandatory death penalty statutes with statutes allowing juries the discretion to decide whether to impose or to recommend the death penalty.  <em>See Woodson v. North Carolina,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html#291">428 U. S. 291</a></span>-292 (opinion of Stewart, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.). [<a href="#F2/32" name="T2/32">Footnote 2/32</a>]  Thus, it simply is not possible to conclude that historically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="818">Page 458 U. S. 818</a></p><p> this country conclusively has rejected capital punishment for homicides committed during the course of a felony.  The petitioner and the Court turn to jury verdicts in an effort to show that, by present standards at least, capital punishment is grossly out of proportion to the crimes that the petitioner committed.  Surveying all reported appellate court opinions since 1954 involving executions, the petitioner has found that, of the 362 individuals executed for homicide, 339 personally committed the homicidal assault, and two others each had another person commit the homicide on his behalf.  Only six persons executed were "non-triggermen." [<a href="#F2/33" name="T2/33">Footnote 2/33</a>]  A similar trend can be seen in the petitioner\'s survey of the current death row population. [<a href="#F2/34" name="T2/34">Footnote 2/34</a>]  Of the 739 prisoners for whom sufficient data are available, only 40 did not participate in the homicidal assault, and, of those, only 3 (including the petitioner) were sentenced to death absent a finding that they had collaborated with the killer in a specific plan to kill.  Brief for Petitioner 336.  <em>See also</em> App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner (showing that of the 45 felony murderers currently on death row in Florida, 36 were found by the State Supreme Court or a trial court to have had the intent to kill; in 8 cases, the state courts made no finding, but the defendant was the triggerman; and in 1, the petitioner\'s case, the defendant was not the triggerman, and there was no finding of intent to kill).  Impressive as these statistics are at first glance, they cannot be accepted uncritically.  So stated, the data do not reveal the number or fraction of homicides that were charged as felony murders, or the number or fraction of cases in which the State sought the death penalty for an accomplice guilty of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="819">Page 458 U. S. 819</a></p><p> felony murder.  Consequently, we cannot know the fraction of cases in which juries rejected the death penalty for accomplice felony murder.  Moreover, as JUSTICE BLACKMUN pointed out in his concurring opinion in <em>Lockett v. Ohio,</em> 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#615">438 U. S. 615</a></span>, n. 2, many of these data classify defendants by whether they "personally committed a homicidal assault," and do not show the fraction of capital defendants who were shown to have an intent to kill.  While the petitioner relies on the fact that he did not pull the trigger, his principal argument is, and must be, that death is an unconstitutional penalty absent an intent to kill, for otherwise defendants who hire others to kill would escape the death penalty.  <em>See</em> <l=|458 20|="" 782fn2="" u.s.="">n. 20, <em>supra.</em>  Thus, the data he presents are not entirely relevant.  Even accepting the petitioner\'s facts as meaningful, they may only reflect that sentencers are especially cautious in imposing the death penalty, and reserve that punishment for those defendants who are sufficiently involved in the homicide, whether or not there was specific intent to kill.</l=|458></p>\n<p>Finally, as the petitioner acknowledges, the jury verdict statistics cannot be viewed in isolation from state death penalty legislation.  The petitioner and the Court therefore review recent legislation in order to support the conclusion that society has rejected capital felony murder.  Of the 35 States that presently have a death penalty, however, fully 31 authorize a sentencer to impose a death sentence for a death that occurs during the course of a robbery. [<a href="#F2/35" name="T2/35">Footnote 2/35</a>]  The States are not uniform in delimiting the circumstances under which the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="820">Page 458 U. S. 820</a></p><p> death penalty may be imposed for felony murder, but each state statute can be classified as one of three types.  The first category, containing 20 statutes, includes those States that permit imposition of the death penalty for felony murder even though the defendant did not commit the homicidal act, and even though he had no actual intent to kill. [<a href="#F2/36" name="T2/36">Footnote 2/36</a>]  Three additional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="821">Page 458 U. S. 821</a></p><p> States, while requiring some finding of intent, do not require the intent to kill that the petitioner believes is constitutionally mandated before the death sentence may be imposed. [<a href="#F2/37" name="T2/37">Footnote 2/37</a>]  The second category, containing seven statutes, includes those States that authorize the death penalty only if the defendant had the specific intent (or some rough equivalent) to kill the victim. [<a href="#F2/38" name="T2/38">Footnote 2/38</a>]  The third class of statutes, from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="822">Page 458 U. S. 822</a></p><p> only three States, restricts application of the death penalty to those felony murderers who actually commit the homicide. [<a href="#F2/39" name="T2/39">Footnote 2/39</a>]  The Court\'s curious method of counting the States that authorize imposition of the death penalty for felony murder cannot hide the fact that 23 States permit a sentencer to impose the death penalty even though the felony murderer has neither killed nor intended to kill his victim.  While the Court acknowledges that eight state statutes follow the Florida death penalty scheme, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#789">458 U. S. 789</a></span>, n. 5, it also concedes that 15 other statutes permit imposition of the death penalty where the defendant neither intended to kill or actually killed the victims.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#790">458 U. S. 790</a></span>, n. 8 (Arkansas, Delaware, and Kentucky); <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#793">458 U.

S. 792</a></span>, n. 13 (Idaho, Oklahoma, and South Dakota).  Not all of the statutes list the same aggravating circumstances.  Nevertheless, the question before the Court is not whether a particular species of death penalty statute is unconstitutional, but whether a scheme that permits imposition of the death penalty, absent a finding that the defendant either killed or intended to kill the victims, is unconstitutional.  In short, the Court\'s peculiar statutory analysis cannot withstand closer scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Thus, in nearly half of the States, and in two-thirds of the States that permit the death penalty for murder, a defendant who neither killed the victim nor specifically intended that the victim die may be sentenced to death for his participation in the robbery-murder.  Far from "weigh[ing] very heavily on the side of rejecting capital punishment as a suitable penalty for" felony murder, <em>Coker v. Georgia,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/595/case.html#596">443 U. S. 596</a></span>, these legislative judgments indicate that our "evolving standards of decency" still embrace capital punishment for this crime.  For this reason, I conclude that the petitioner has failed to meet the standards in <em>Coker</em> and <em>Woodson</em> that the "two crucial indicators of evolving standards of decency . . . -- jury determinations and legislative enactments -- <em>both point conclusively</em> to the repudiation" of capital punishment for felony murder.  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html#293">428 U. S. 293</a></span> (emphasis added).  In short, the death penalty for felony murder does not fall short of our national "standards of decency."</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>As I noted earlier, the Eighth Amendment concept of proportionality involves more than merely a measurement of contemporary standards of decency.  It requires in addition that the penalty imposed in a capital case be proportional to the harm caused and the defendant\'s blameworthiness.  Critical to the holding in <em>Coker,</em> for example, was that,</p>\n<p>"in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="824">Page 458 U. S. 824</a></p><p> to the public, [rape] does not compare with murder, which . . . involve[s] the unjustified taking of human life."</p>\n<p>433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#598">433 U. S. 598</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Although the Court disingenuously seeks to characterize Enmund as only a "robber," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#797">458 U. S. 797</a></span>, it cannot be disputed that he is responsible, along with Sampson and Jeanette Armstrong, for the murders of the Kerseys.  There is no dispute that their lives were unjustifiably taken, and that the petitioner, as one who aided and abetted the armed robbery, is legally liable for their deaths. [<a href="#F2/40" name="T2/40">Footnote 2/40</a>]  Quite unlike the defendant in <em>Coker,</em> the petitioner cannot claim that the penalty imposed is "grossly out of proportion" to the harm for which he admittedly is at least partly responsible.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s holding today is especially disturbing because it makes intent a matter of federal constitutional law, requiring this Court both to review highly subjective definitional problems customarily left to state criminal law and to develop an Eighth Amendment meaning of intent.  As JUSTICE BLACKMUN pointed out in his concurring opinion in <em>Lockett,</em> the Court\'s holding substantially "interfere[s] with the States\' individual statutory categories for assessing legal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="825">Page 458 U. S. 825</a></p><p> guilt." 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#616">438 U. S. 616</a></span>.

S. 635</a></span>-636 (opinion of REHNQUIST, J.) (rejecting the idea that intent to kill must be proved before the State can impose the death penalty).  Although the Court\'s opinion suggests that intent can be ascertained as if it were some historical fact, in fact, it is a legal concept, not easily defined.  Thus, while proportionality requires a nexus between the punishment imposed and the defendant\'s blameworthiness, the Court fails to explain why the Eighth Amendment concept of proportionality requires rejection of standards of blameworthiness based on other levels of intent, such as, for example, the intent to commit an armed robbery coupled with the knowledge that armed robberies involve substantial risk of death or serious injury to other persons.  Moreover, the intent-to-kill requirement is crudely crafted; it fails to take into account the complex picture of the defendant\'s knowledge of his accomplice\'s intent and whether he was armed, the defendant\'s contribution to the planning and success of the crime, and the defendant\'s actual participation during the commission of the crime.  Under the circumstances, the determination of the degree of blameworthiness is best left to the sentencer, who can sift through the facts unique to each case.  Consequently, while the type of <em>mens rea</em> of the defendant must be considered carefully in assessing the proper penalty, it is not so critical a factor in determining blameworthiness as to require a finding of intent to kill in order to impose the death penalty for felony murder.</p>\n<p>In sum, the petitioner and the Court have failed to show that contemporary standards, as reflected in both jury determinations and legislative enactments, preclude imposition of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="826">Page 458 U. S. 826</a></p><p> the death penalty for accomplice felony murder.  Moreover, examination of the qualitative factors underlying the concept of proportionality do not show that the death penalty is disproportionate as applied to Earl Enmund.  In contrast to the crime in <em>Coker,</em> the petitioner\'s crime involves the very type of harm that this Court has held justifies the death penalty.  Finally, because of the unique and complex mixture of facts involving a defendant\'s actions, knowledge, motives, and participation during the commission of a felony murder, I believe that the factfinder is best able to assess the defendant\'s blameworthiness.  Accordingly, I conclude that the death penalty is not disproportionate to the crime of felony murder, even though the defendant did not actually kill or intend to kill his victims. [<a href="#F2/42" name="T2/42">Footnote 2/42</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="827">Page 458 U.

Thus, in deciding whether or not to impose capital punishment on a felony murderer, a sentencer must consider any relevant evidence or arguments that the death penalty is inappropriate for a particular defendant because of his relative lack of <em>mens rea</em> and his peripheral participation in the murder.  Because of the peculiar circumstances of this case, I conclude that the trial court did not give sufficient consideration to the petitioner\'s role in the crimes, and thus did not consider the mitigating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="829">Page 458 U.

In its factual findings, the trial court stated that the "armed robbery . . . was planned ahead of time by the defendant Enmund," App. 30, and that he had shot each of the victims while they lay prone in order to eliminate them as witnesses.  <em>Id.</em> at 301.  The court expressly found that "<em>none</em> of the statutory mitigating circumstances applied" to the petitioner.  <em>Id.</em> at 32 (emphasis in original).  Among other findings, the court rejected Enmund\'s claim that his participation in the murders had been "relatively minor," and found instead that</p>\n<p>"his participation in the capital felony was major.

Reviewing the aggravating circumstances, the Supreme Court consolidated two of them, and rejected the trial court\'s conclusion that the murders had been "heinous, atrocious, or cruel," since the evidence showed that the Armstrongs had killed the Kerseys in a gun battle arising from Mrs. Kersey\'s armed resistance, and not that the petitioner had killed them in an effort to eliminate them as witnesses.  <em>See Armstrong v.

In his erroneous belief that the petitioner had shot both of the victims while they lay in a prone position in order to eliminate them as witnesses, the trial judge necessarily rejected the only argument offered in mitigation -- that the petitioner\'s role in the capital felonies was minor, undeserving of the death penalty, because the petitioner was in the car when the fatal shots were fired.  This fundamental misunderstanding of the petitioner\'s role in the crimes prevented the trial court from considering the "circumstances of the particular offense" in imposing sentence.  <em>Woodson v.

State,</em> 399 So.2d 953, 960-961 (Fla.1981).  The trial court considered the only possible mitigating circumstance to be Armstrong\'s age (23), but did not actually find that fact to be mitigating.  <em>See id.</em> at 962 ("the factor of age was given no consideration").  Finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, the trial judge imposed the death penalty for each murder conviction, and imposed a life sentence for the robbery.  <em>Id.</em> at 955, 962.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/15" name="F2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>The Florida Supreme Court also affirmed the convictions and sentences of Sampson Armstrong.  <em>See Armstrong v.

Even if they were available under the Florida statute, these provisions would have been of no help to the petitioner, since the trial court found that there were no mitigating circumstances, in part because Enmund\'s role in the capital felony was not minor.  <em>See</em> Fla.Stat. \xc2\xa7 921.141(6)(d) (1981).

Several of them provide that robbery murder is a capital felony, but require proof of additional aggravating circumstances, <em>e.g.,</em> the defendant had been convicted previously of a violent felony, or the victim was a correctional officer, before the death penalty can be imposed.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Okla.Stat., Tit. 21, \xc2\xa7 701.12 (1981); N.M.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 30-2-1(A)(2), 31-18-14(A), 31-20A-5 (Supp.1981).  Others, like the Florida statute, define robbery murder as a capital offense and use the robbery as an aggravating circumstance.  The common thread in all of these statutes, however, is that the defendant need not have the intent to kill in order to be subject to the death penalty.  The Court\'s additional subdivision of this group of statutes, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#791">458 U.

S. 786</a></span>-787, n. 2, does not square with the facts of this case.  The trial court expressly found that, because Enmund had planned the robbery, his role was not minor, and that therefore no statutory mitigating circumstances applied.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the finding of no mitigating circumstances, thereby affirming the underlying factual predicate -- Enmund had planned the armed robbery.  Moreover, even Enmund\'s trial counsel conceded at the sentencing hearing that Enmund initiated the armed robbery and drove the getaway car.  <em>See</em> <l=|458 10|="" 782fn2="" u.s.="">n. 10, <em>supra.</em></l=|458></p>\n<p>The Court misreads the opinion below in suggesting that the State Supreme Court deduced from the <em>sentencing hearing</em> that Enmund\'s only participation was as the getaway driver.  In fact, the court made that statement with respect to the <em>guilt</em> phase of the trial.  As I mentioned above, Enmund\'s counsel conceded at the sentencing hearing that Enmund had initiated the armed robbery.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/41" name="F2/41">Footnote 2/41</a>]</p>\n<p>It is not true, as the petitioner suggests, that an intent-to-kill requirement would not interfere with the State\'s substantive categories of murder.  Prohibiting the death penalty for accomplice felony murder would create a category of murder between capital murder, for which the death penalty is permitted, and the next statutory degree, for which some term of years (typically less than life imprisonment) is imposed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/42" name="F2/42">Footnote 2/42</a>]</p>\n<p>The petitioner and the Court also contend that capital punishment for felony murder violates the Eighth Amendment because it "makes no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment."  <em>Coker v. Georgia,</em> 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html#592">433 U. S. 592</a></span>.  In brief, the petitioner and the Court reason that, since he did not specifically intend to kill the Kerseys, since the probability of death during an armed robbery is so low, <em>see</em> ALI, Model Penal Code, <em>supra,</em> <l=|458 28|="" 782fn2="" u.s.="">n. 28, \xc2\xa7 210.2, Comment, p. 38, n. 96 (concluding from several studies that a homicide occurs in about one-half of one percent of all robberies), and since the death penalty is so rarely imposed on nontriggermen, capital punishment could not have deterred him or anyone else from participating in the armed robbery.  The petitioner and the Court also reject the notion that the goal of retribution might be served because his "moral guilt" is too insignificant.</l=|458></p>\n<p>At their core, these conclusions are legislative judgments regarding the efficacy of capital punishment as a tool in achieving retributive justice and deterring violent crime.  Surely, neither the petitioner nor the Court has shown that capital punishment is ineffective as a deterrent for his crime; the most the Court can do is speculate as to its effect on other felony murderers and rely on "competent observers" rather than legislative judgments.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html#799">458 U. S. 799</a></span>-800.  Moreover, the decision of whether or not a particular punishment serves the admittedly legitimate goal of retribution seems uniquely suited to legislative resolution.  Because an armed robber takes a serious risk that someone will die during the course of his crime, and because of the obviousness of that risk, we cannot conclude that the death penalty "makes no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment.

As noted above, the petitioner offered no additional evidence at the sentencing hearing in mitigation of his crime.  <em>See</em> Record 1677.
