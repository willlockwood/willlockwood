MICHIGAN</h4>\n<h4>CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF\nMICHIGAN</h4>\n No. 03\xc2\x9710198.Argued April 25,\n2005\xc2\x96Decided June 23, 2005 \n\n\n<p>In <i>Douglas</i> v. <i>California,</i> 372 U.S. 353, this\nCourt held that, in criminal proceedings, a State must provide\ncounsel for an indigent defendant in a first appeal as of\nright.\tTwo considerations were key:\xc2\xa0(1) An appeal\n\xc2\x93of right\xc2\x94 yields an adjudication on the\n\xc2\x93merits,\xc2\x94 <i>id.,</i> at 357, and (2) first-tier\nreview differs from subsequent appellate stages \xc2\x93at which\nthe claims have once been presented by a lawyer and passed upon\nby an appellate court,\xc2\x94 <i>id.</i>, at 356.  Later, in\n<i>Ross</i> v. <i>Moffitt,</i> 417 U.S. 600, the\nCourt held that a State need not appoint counsel to aid a poor\nperson seeking to pursue a second-tier discretionary appeal to\nthe State\xc2\x92s highest court, or, thereafter, certiorari\nreview in this Court.  <i>Id.,</i> at 610\xc2\x97612,\n615\xc2\x97618.  The <i>Douglas </i>rationale does not extend to\nsecond-tier discretionary review, the Court explained, because,\nat that stage, error correction is not the reviewing\ncourt\xc2\x92s prime function.  <i>Id.,</i> at 615.  Principal\ncriteria for state high court review, <i>Ross</i> noted,\ninclude whether the issues presented are of significant public\ninterest, whether the cause involves legal principles of major\nsignificance to the State\xc2\x92s jurisprudence, and whether the\ndecision below is in probable conflict with the high\ncourt\xc2\x92s precedent.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Further, a defendant who\nhas received counsel\xc2\x92s aid in a first-tier appeal as of\nright would be armed with a transcript or other record of trial\nproceedings, a brief in the appeals court setting forth his\nclaims, and, often, that court\xc2\x92s opinion disposing of the\ncase.  Ibid.</p>\n<p> \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan has a\ntwo-tier appellate system.  The State Supreme Court hears\nappeals by leave only.\tThe intermediate Court of Appeals\nadjudicates appeals as of right from criminal convictions,\nexcept that a defendant convicted on a guilty or <i>nolo\ncontendere</i> plea who seeks intermediate appellate court\nreview must apply for leave to appeal.\tUnder Michigan law,\nmost indigent defendants convicted on a plea must proceed\n<i>pro se</i> in seeking leave to appeal to the intermediate\ncourt.\tIn <i>People </i>v. <i>Bulger</i>, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt held that the Fourteenth\nAmendment\xc2\x92s Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses\ndo not secure a right to appointed counsel for plea-convicted\ndefendants seeking review in the intermediate appellate court\nfor these reasons:\xc2\xa0Such review is discretionary; plea\nproceedings are shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials;\nand a defendant entering a plea accedes to the State\xc2\x92s\nfundamental interest in finality.</p>\n<p> \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\nHalbert pleaded <i>nolo contendere </i>to two counts of\ncriminal sexual conduct.  During Halbert\xc2\x92s plea colloquy,\nthe trial court advised him of instances in which it\n\xc2\x93must\xc2\x94 or \xc2\x93may\xc2\x94 appoint appellate counsel,\nbut failed to tell him that it could not appoint counsel in any\nother circumstances, including Halbert\xc2\x92s own case.  The\nday after his sentence was imposed, Halbert moved to withdraw\nhis plea.  Denying the motion, the trial court stated that\nHalbert\xc2\x92s proper remedy was to appeal to the State Court\nof Appeals.  Twice thereafter, Halbert asked the trial court to\nappoint counsel to help him prepare an application for leave to\nappeal to the intermediate court, stating that his sentence had\nbeen misscored, that he needed counsel to preserve the issue\nbefore undertaking an appeal, that he had learning disabilities\nand was mentally impaired, and that he had been obliged to rely\non fellow inmates in preparing his <i>pro se </i>filings.  The\ncourt denied Halbert\xc2\x92s motion, citing <i>Bulger.</i> \nHalbert then filed a <i>pro se</i> application for leave to\nappeal, asserting sentencing error and ineffective assistance\nof counsel and seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, remand for\nappointment of appellate counsel.  The Court of Appeals denied\nleave \xc2\x93for lack of merit in the grounds presented.\xc2\x94 \nThe Michigan Supreme Court declined review. </p>\n<p><i>Held:\xc2\xa0</i>The Due Process and Equal\nProtection Clauses require the appointment of counsel for\ndefendants, convicted on their pleas, who seek access to\nfirst-tier review in the Michigan Court of Appeals. \nPp.\xc2\xa09\xc2\x9717.</p>\n<p> \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two aspects of\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals\xc2\x92 process following\nplea-based convictions compel the conclusion that\n<i>Douglas</i>, not <i>Ross,</i> controls here.  First, in\nruling on an application for leave to appeal, that court looks\nto the merits of the appellant\xc2\x92s claims.  Second, indigent\ndefendants pursuing first-tier review in the Court of Appeals\nare generally ill equipped to represent themselves.  A\ndefendant who pleads guilty or <i>nolo contendere </i>in a\nMichigan court, although he relinquishes access to an appeal as\nof right, is entitled to apply for leave to appeal, and that\nentitlement is officially conveyed to him.  Of critical\nimportance, the intermediate appellate court, unlike the\nMichigan Supreme Court, sits as an error-correction instance. \nA court Rule provides that the intermediate court may respond\nto a leave application in a number of ways: It may grant or\ndeny the application, enter a final decision, grant other\nrelief, request additional material from the record, or require\na certified concise statement of proceedings and facts from the\nlower court.  The court\xc2\x92s response to the leave\napplication by any of these alternatives\xc2\x96including denial\nof leave\xc2\x96necessarily entails some evaluation of the merits\nof the applicant\xc2\x92s claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xc2\x9710.</p>\n<p> \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\nrejects Michigan\xc2\x92s argument that <i>Ross </i>is\ndispositive here because review in the intermediate appellate\ncourt following a plea-based conviction is discretionary, given\nthe necessity of filing an application for leave to appeal. \nThe <i>Ross</i> Court recognized that leave-granting\ndeterminations by a State\xc2\x92s highest court turn on\nconsiderations other than a lower court\xc2\x92s commission of\nerror, <i>e.g.</i>, the involvement of a matter of\n\xc2\x93significant public interest.\xc2\x94  417 U.S., at 615. \nMichigan\xc2\x92s Supreme Court, like the highest courts of other\nStates, sits not to correct errors in individual cases, but to\ndecide matters of larger public import.  By contrast, the\nintermediate court, as an error-correction instance, is guided\nin responding to leave to appeal applications by the merits of\nthe particular defendant\xc2\x92s claims, not by the general\nimportance of the questions presented. \nPp.\xc2\xa010\xc2\x9711.</p>\n<p> \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether\nformally categorized as the decision of an appeal or the\ndisposal of a leave application, the intermediate appellate\ncourt\xc2\x92s ruling on a plea-convicted defendant\xc2\x92s claims\nprovides the first, and likely the only, direct review the\ndefendant\xc2\x92s conviction and sentence will receive.\tParties\nlike Halbert, however, are disarmed in their endeavor to gain\nfirst-tier review.  <i>Ross</i> emphasized that a defendant\nseeking State Supreme Court review following a first-tier\nappeal as of right earlier had the assistance of appellate\ncounsel, who will have reviewed the trial court record,\nresearched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflecting\nthat review and research.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Such a defendant may\nalso be armed with an opinion of the intermediate appellate\ncourt addressing the issues counsel raised.  Without such\nguides keyed to a court of review, a <i>pro se\n</i>applicant\xc2\x92s entitlement to seek leave to appeal to\nMichigan\xc2\x92s intermediate court may be more formal than\nreal.  Cf. <i>Swenson </i>v. <i>Bosler,</i> 386 U.S. 258 <i>(per\ncuriam).</i>  Persons in Halbert\xc2\x92s situation, many of whom\nhave little education, learning disabilities, and mental\nimpairments, are particularly handicapped as\nself-representatives.  See <i>Kowalski</i> v. <i>Tesmer</i>,\n543 U.S. ___, ___ (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  Further, appeals\nby defendants convicted on their pleas may be \xc2\x93no less\ncomplex than other appeals.\xc2\x94  <i>Id.</i>, at ___. \nMichigan\xc2\x92s complex procedures for seeking leave to appeal\nafter sentencing on a plea, moreover, may intimidate the\nuncounseled.  See <i>id.</i>, at ___ \xc2\x97 ___.  The State\ndoes have a legitimate interest in reducing its\njudiciary\xc2\x92s workload, but providing indigents with\nappellate counsel will yield applications easier to comprehend.\n Michigan\xc2\x92s Court of Appeals would still have recourse to\nsummary denials of leave applications in cases not warranting\nfurther review.  And when a defendant\xc2\x92s case presents no\ngenuinely arguable issue, appointed counsel may so inform the\ncourt.\tPp.\xc2\xa011\xc2\x9716.</p>\n<p> \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\ndisagrees with Michigan\xc2\x92s contention that, even if Halbert\nhad a constitutionally guaranteed right to appointed counsel\nfor first-level appellate review, he waived that right by\nentering a <i>nolo contendere</i> plea.  At the time he entered\nhis plea, Halbert had no recognized right to appointed\nappellate counsel he could elect to forgo.  Moreover, the trial\ncourt did not tell Halbert, simply and directly, that in his\ncase, there would be no access to appointed counsel.  Cf.\n<i>Iowa</i> v. <i>Tovar,</i> 541 U.S. 77, 81. \nPp.\xc2\xa016\xc2\x9717.</p>\n<p>Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nGinsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which\nStevens, O\xc2\x92Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer, JJ.,\njoined.

Const.,\nArt. 1, \xc2\xa720.  Thereafter, \xc2\x93several Michigan state\njudges began to deny appointed appellate counsel to\nindigents\xc2\x94 convicted by plea.  <i>Kowalski</i> v.\n<i>Tesmer</i>, 543 U.S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 1). \nRejecting challenges based on the Equal Protection and Due\nProcess Clauses of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the Federal Constitution, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt upheld this practice, and its codification in Mich. Comp.\nLaws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3a (West 2000).  <i>People</i> v.\n<i>Harris</i>, 470 Mich. 882, 681 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 653 (2004);\n<i>People</i> v. <i>Bulger</i>, 462 Mich. 495, 511, 614\nN.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 103, 110 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Antonio Dwayne Halbert,\nconvicted on his plea of <i>nolo contendere</i>, sought the\nappointment of counsel to assist him in applying for leave to\nappeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  The state trial court\nand the Court of Appeals denied Halbert\xc2\x92s requests for\nappointed counsel, and the Michigan Supreme Court declined\nreview.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan Court of Appeals review of\nan application for leave to appeal, Halbert contends, ranks as\na first-tier appellate proceeding requiring appointment of\ncounsel under <i>Douglas</i> v. <i>California,</i> 372 U.S. 353 (1963). \nMichigan urges that appeal to the State Court of Appeals is\ndiscretionary and, for an appeal of that order, <i>Ross</i> v.\n<i>Moffitt,</i> 417\nU.S. 600 (1974), holds counsel need not be appointed. \nEarlier this Term, in <i>Kowalski</i> v. <i>Tesmer</i>, this\nCourt, for prudential reasons, declined to reach the\nclassification question posed by Michigan\xc2\x92s system for\nappellate review following a plea of guilty, guilty but\nmentally ill, or <i>nolo contendere</i>.  Today, we reach the\nclassification question and conclude that Halbert\xc2\x92s case\nis properly ranked with <i>Douglas </i>rather than <i>Ross</i>.\n Accordingly, we hold that the Due Process and Equal Protection\nClauses require the appointment of counsel for defendants,\nconvicted on their pleas, who seek access to first-tier review\nin the Michigan Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>\nI</p>\n<p>\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Constitution imposes on\nthe States no obligation to provide appellate review of\ncriminal convictions.  <i>McKane</i> v. <i>Durston,</i> 153 U.S. 684, 687\n(1894).  Having provided such an avenue, however, a State may\nnot \xc2\x93bolt the door to equal justice\xc2\x94 to indigent\ndefendants.  <i>Griffin</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 351 U.S. 12, 24 (1956)\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment); see <i>id.</i>, at\n23 (same) (\xc2\x93[W]hen a State deems it wise and just that\nconvictions be susceptible to review by an appellate court, it\ncannot by force of its exactions draw a line which precludes\nconvicted indigent persons \xc2\x85 from securing such \xc2\x85\nreview.\xc2\x94).  <i>Griffin </i>held that, when a State\nconditions an appeal from a conviction on the provision of a\ntrial transcript, the State must furnish free transcripts to\nindigent defendants who seek to appeal.  <i>Id.</i>, at\n16\xc2\x9720 (plurality opinion).  <i>Douglas</i> relied on\n<i>Griffin</i>\xc2\x92s reasoning to hold that, in first appeals\nas of right, States must appoint counsel to represent indigent\ndefendants.  372 U.S., at 357.\t<i>Ross</i> held, however, that\na State need not appoint counsel to aid a poor person in\ndiscretionary appeals to the State\xc2\x92s highest court, or in\npetitioning for review in this Court.  417 U.S., at\n610\xc2\x97612, 615\xc2\x97618.</p>\n<p>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cases on appeal barriers encountered by\npersons unable to pay their own way, we have observed,\n\xc2\x93cannot be resolved by resort to easy slogans or\npigeonhole analysis.\xc2\x94  <i>M. L. B.</i> v. <i>S. L. J.,</i>\n519 U.S. 102, 120\n(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Our decisions in\npoint reflect \xc2\x93both equal protection and due process\nconcerns.\xc2\x94  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xc2\x93The equal protection\nconcern relates to the legitimacy of fencing out would-be\nappellants based solely on their inability to pay core\ncosts,\xc2\x94 while \xc2\x93[t]he due process concern homes in on\nthe essential fairness of the state-ordered proceedings.\xc2\x94 \n<i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Evitts</i> v. <i>Lucey,</i> 469 U.S. 387, 405\n(1985).</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two considerations were key to our\ndecision in <i>Douglas</i> that a State is required to appoint\ncounsel for an indigent defendant\xc2\x92s first-tier appeal as\nof right.  First, such an appeal entails an adjudication on the\n\xc2\x93merits.\xc2\x94  372 U.S., at 357.\tSecond, first-tier\nreview differs from subsequent appellate stages \xc2\x93at which\nthe claims have once been presented by [appellate counsel] and\npassed upon by an appellate court.\xc2\x94  <i>Id.</i>, at 356. \nUnder the California system at issue in <i>Douglas</i>, the\nfirst-tier appellate court independently examined the record to\ndetermine whether to appoint counsel.  <i>Id.</i>, at 355. \nWhen a defendant able to retain counsel pursued an appeal, the\n<i>Douglas</i> Court observed, \xc2\x93the appellate court\npasse[d] on the merits of [the] case only after having the full\nbenefit of written briefs and oral argument by counsel.\xc2\x94 \n<i>Id.,</i> at 356.  In contrast, when a poor person appealed,\n\xc2\x93the appellate court [wa]s forced to prejudge the merits\n[of the case] before it c[ould] even determine whether counsel\nshould be provided.\xc2\x94  Ibid.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <i>Ross</i>, we explained why the\nrationale of <i>Douglas </i>did not extend to the appointment\nof counsel for an indigent seeking to pursue a second-tier\ndiscretionary appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court or,\nthereafter, certiorari review in this Court.  The North\nCarolina Supreme Court, in common with this Court we perceived,\ndoes not sit as an error-correction instance.  417 U.S., at\n615.  Principal criteria for state high court review, we noted,\nincluded \xc2\x93whether the subject matter of the appeal has\nsignificant public interest, whether the cause involves legal\nprinciples of major significance to the jurisprudence of the\nState, [and] whether the decision below is in probable\nconflict\xc2\x94 with the court\xc2\x92s precedent.  <i>Ibid.</i>\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, we pointed out, a\ndefendant who had already benefited from counsel\xc2\x92s aid in\na first-tier appeal as of right would have, \xc2\x93at the very\nleast, a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a\nbrief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his\nclaims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the Court of\nAppeals disposing of his case.\xc2\x94  Ibid.</p>\n<p>\nII</p>\n<p>\nA</p>\n<p>\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan has a two-tier appellate\nsystem comprising the State Supreme Court and the intermediate\nCourt of Appeals.  The Michigan Supreme Court hears appeals by\nleave only.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3(6) (West Supp.\n2004).\tPrior to 1994, the Court of Appeals adjudicated appeals\nas of right from all criminal convictions.  <i>Bulger</i>, 462\nMich., at 503\xc2\x97504, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d, at\n106\xc2\x97107.  To reduce the workload of the Court of Appeals,\na 1994 amendment to the Michigan Constitution changed the\nprocess for appeals following plea-based convictions. \n<i>Id.</i>, at 504, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d, at 106\xc2\x97107. \nAs amended, the State Constitution provides: \xc2\x93In every\ncriminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right \xc2\x85\nto have an appeal as a matter of right, except as provided by\nlaw an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo\ncontendere shall be by leave of the court.\xc2\x94  Mich. Const.,\nArt. 1, \xc2\xa720.</p>\n<p>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A defendant convicted by plea who seeks\nreview in the Michigan Court of Appeals must now file an\napplication for leave to appeal pursuant to Mich. Ct. Rule\n7.205 (2005).  In response, the Court of Appeals may, among\nother things, \xc2\x93grant or deny the application; enter a\nfinal decision; [or] grant other relief.\xc2\x94\tRule\n7.205(D)(2).  If the court grants leave, \xc2\x93the case\nproceeds as an appeal of right.\xc2\x94  Rule 7.205(D)(3).  The\nparties agree that the Court of Appeals, in its orders denying\nproperly filed applications for leave, uniformly cites\n\xc2\x93lack of merit in the grounds presented\xc2\x94 as the basis\nfor its decision.

App. 23.  During Halbert\xc2\x92s plea colloquy, the\ntrial court asked Halbert, \xc2\x93You understand if I accept\nyour plea you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal\nas of right,\xc2\x94 and Halbert answered, \xc2\x93Yes, sir.\xc2\x94 \n<i>Id.</i>, at 22.  The court then advised Halbert of certain\ninstances in which, although the appeal would not be as of\nright, the court nevertheless \xc2\x93must\xc2\x94 or\n\xc2\x93may\xc2\x94 appoint appellate counsel.  The court did not\ntell Halbert, however, that it could not appoint counsel in any\nother circumstances, including Halbert\xc2\x92s own case:</p>\n<p>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\x93THE COURT: You understand if I\naccept your plea and you are financially unable to retain a\nlawyer to represent you on appeal, the Court must appoint an\nattorney for you if the sentence I impose exceeds the\nsentencing guidelines or you seek leave to appeal a conditional\nplea or the prosecutor seeks leave to appeal or the Court of\nAppeals or Supreme Court grants you leave to appeal.  Under\nthose conditions I must appoint an attorney, do you understand\nthat?</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\x93THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\x93THE COURT: Further, if you are\nfinancially unable to retain a lawyer to represent you on\nappeal, the Court may appoint an attorney for you if you allege\nan improper scoring of the sentencing guidelines, you object to\nthe scoring at the time of the sentencing and the sentence I\nimpose exceeds the sentencing guidelines as you allege it\nshould be scored.

The trial court set\nHalbert\xc2\x92s sentences to run consecutively.\t<i>Id.</i>, at\n35.  Halbert submitted a handwritten motion to withdraw his\nplea the day after sentencing.\tDenying the motion, the trial\ncourt stated that Halbert\xc2\x92s \xc2\x93proper remedy is to\nappeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals.\xc2\x94\t<i>Id.</i>, at\n43.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twice thereafter and to no avail,\nHalbert asked the trial court to appoint counsel to help him\nprepare an application for leave to appeal to the intermediate\nappellate court.  He submitted his initial request on a form\nprovided by the State.\t<i>Id.</i>, at 46\xc2\x9750, 53\xc2\x9757. \nThe trial court denied the request.  <i>Id.</i>, at 44\xc2\x9745,\n51\xc2\x9752.  Halbert next sent the trial court a letter and\naccompanying motion, again seeking appointed counsel. \n<i>Id.</i>, at 58.  Halbert stated that his sentence had been\nmisscored and that he needed the aid of counsel to preserve the\nissue before undertaking an appeal.  <i>Id.</i>, at 58,\n61\xc2\x9762.  Halbert also related that he had \xc2\x93required\nspecial education due to learning disabilities,\xc2\x94\n<i>id.</i>, at 61, and was \xc2\x93mentally impaired,\xc2\x94\n<i>id.</i>, at 62.  To prepare his <i>pro se </i>filings, he\nnoted, he was obliged to rely on the assistance of fellow\ninmates.  <i>Id.</i>, at 61.  The trial court denied\nHalbert\xc2\x92s motion; citing <i>Bulger</i>, the court stated\nthat Halbert \xc2\x93does not have a constitutional \xc2\x85 right\nto appointment of appellate counsel to pursue a discretionary\nappeal.\xc2\x94  App. 64.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again using a form supplied by the\nState and acting <i>pro se</i>, Halbert filed an application\nfor leave to appeal.  <i>Id.</i>, at 66\xc2\x9771.  He asserted\nclaims of sentencing error and ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, <i>id.</i>, at 68, and sought, <i>inter alia</i>,\nremand for appointment of appellate counsel and resentencing,\n<i>id.</i>, at 71.  In a standard form order, the Court of\nAppeals denied Halbert\xc2\x92s application \xc2\x93for lack of\nmerit in the grounds presented.\xc2\x94  <i>Id.</i>, at 72.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State Supreme Court, dividing 5\nto 2, denied Halbert\xc2\x92s application for leave to appeal to\nthat court.  The dissenting justices would have provided for\nthe appointment of counsel, and would have allowed counsel to\nfile a supplemental leave application prior to the Court of\nAppeals\xc2\x92 reconsideration of Halbert\xc2\x92s pleas. \n<i>Id.</i>, at 84.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 543 U.S. ___\n(2005), to consider whether the denial of appointed counsel to\nHalbert violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\tWe now vacate the judgment of the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals.</p>\n<p>\nIII</p>\n<p>\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Halbert\xc2\x92s case is\nframed by two prior decisions of this Court concerning\nstate-funded appellate counsel, <i>Douglas</i> and <i>Ross</i>.\n The question before us is essentially one of classification:\nWith which of those decisions should the instant case be\naligned?<a class="fnflag" href="#FN2" name="FN2SRC">2</a>  We\nhold that <i>Douglas </i>provides the controlling instruction. \nTwo aspects of the Michigan Court of Appeals\xc2\x92 process\nfollowing plea-based convictions lead us to that conclusion. \nFirst, in determining how to dispose of an application for\nleave to appeal, Michigan\xc2\x92s intermediate appellate court\nlooks to the merits of the claims made in the application. \nSecond, indigent defendants pursuing first-tier review in the\nCourt of Appeals are generally ill equipped to represent\nthemselves.</p>\n<p>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A defendant who pleads guilty or\n<i>nolo contendere </i>in a Michigan court does not thereby\nforfeit all opportunity for appellate review.  Although he\nrelinquishes access to an appeal as of right, he is entitled to\napply for leave to appeal, and that entitlement is officially\nconveyed to him.  See <i>supra</i>, at 4\xc2\x975; Mich. Ct. Rule\n6.425(E)(2)(a) (2005) (\xc2\x93[T]he defendant is entitled to\nfile an application for leave to appeal.\xc2\x94); see also\nAdvice Concerning Right To Appeal, \xc2\xb61, <i>supra,</i> at 7,\nn.\xc2\xa01 (\xc2\x93You are entitled to file an application for\nleave to appeal with the Court of Appeals.\xc2\x94).  Of critical\nimportance, the tribunal to which he addresses his application,\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme\nCourt, sits as an error-correction instance.<a class="fnflag" href="#FN3" name="FN3SRC">3</a></p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals may respond to a\nleave application in a number of ways.\tIt \xc2\x93may grant or\ndeny the application; enter a final decision; grant other\nrelief; request additional material from the record; or require\na certified concise statement of proceedings and facts from the\ncourt\xc2\xa0\xc2\x85\xc2\xa0whose order is being appealed.\xc2\x94 \nMich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(2) (2005).  When the court denies leave\nusing the stock phrase \xc2\x93for lack of merit in the grounds\npresented,\xc2\x94 its disposition may not be equivalent to a\n\xc2\x93final decision\xc2\x94 on the merits, <i>i.e.</i>, the\ndisposition may simply signal that the court found the matters\nasserted unworthy of the expenditure of further judicial\nresources.  But the court\xc2\x92s response to the leave\napplication by any of the specified alternatives\xc2\x96including\ndenial of leave\xc2\x96necessarily entails some evaluation of the\nmerits of the applicant\xc2\x92s claims.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan urges that review in the\nCourt of Appeals following a plea-based conviction is as\n\xc2\x93discretionary\xc2\x94 as review in the Michigan Supreme\nCourt because both require an application for leave to appeal. \nSee <i>Bulger</i>, 462 Mich., at 506\xc2\x97508, 519, 614\nN.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d, at 108, 113; Brief for Respondent\n31\xc2\x9734.<a class="fnflag" href="#FN4" name="FN4SRC">4</a> \nTherefore, Michigan maintains, <i>Ross </i>is dispositive of\nthis case.  The Court in <i>Ross</i>, however, recognized that\nleave-granting determinations by North Carolina\xc2\x92s Supreme\nCourt turned on considerations other than the commission of\nerror by a lower court, <i>e.g.</i>, the involvement of a\nmatter of \xc2\x93significant public interest.\xc2\x94  See\n<i>supra</i>, at 4.  Michigan\xc2\x92s Supreme Court, too, sits\nnot to correct errors in individual cases, but to decide\nmatters of larger public import.  See Mich. Ct. Rule\n7.302(B)(2)\xc2\x97(3) (2005) (criteria for granting leave to\nappeal to the Michigan Supreme Court include whether a case\npresents an \xc2\x93issue [of] significant public interest\xc2\x94\nor \xc2\x93involves legal principles of major significance to the\nstate\xc2\x92s jurisprudence\xc2\x94); <i>Great Lakes Realty Corp.\n</i>v. <i>Peters</i>, 336 Mich. 325, 328\xc2\x97329, 57\nN.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d 901, 903 (1953) (equating denial of an\napplication for leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court\nwith denial of a petition for writ of certiorari in this\nCourt); see also this Court\xc2\x92s Rule 10 (considerations\nguiding decision whether to grant certiorari).\tBy contrast,\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals, because it is an\nerror-correction instance, is guided in responding to leave to\nappeal applications by the merits of the particular\ndefendant\xc2\x92s claims, not by the general importance of the\nquestions presented.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether formally categorized as the\ndecision of an appeal or the disposal of a leave application,\nthe Court of Appeals\xc2\x92 ruling on a plea-convicted\ndefendant\xc2\x92s claims provides the first, and likely the\nonly, direct review the defendant\xc2\x92s conviction and\nsentence will receive.\tParties like Halbert, however, are\ndisarmed in their endeavor to gain first-tier review.  As the\nCourt in <i>Ross</i> emphasized, a defendant seeking State\nSupreme Court review following a first-tier appeal as of right\nearlier had the assistance of appellate counsel.  The attorney\nappointed to serve at the intermediate appellate court level\nwill have reviewed the trial court record, researched the legal\nissues, and prepared a brief reflecting that review and\nresearch.  417 U.S., at 615.  The defendant seeking second-tier\nreview may also be armed with an opinion of the intermediate\nappellate court addressing the issues counsel raised.  A\nfirst-tier review applicant, forced to act <i>pro se</i>, will\nface a record unreviewed by appellate counsel, and will be\nequipped with no attorney\xc2\x92s brief prepared for, or\nreasoned opinion by, a court of review.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <i>Bulger </i>Court concluded\nthat \xc2\x93[a] pro se<i> </i>defendant seeking discretionary\nreview\xc2\x94 in the Court of Appeals is adequately armed\nbecause he \xc2\x93will have the benefit of a transcript, trial\ncounsel\xc2\x92s framing of the issues in [a] motion to withdraw,\nand the trial court\xc2\x92s ruling on the motion.\xc2\x94\t462\nMich., at 518, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 113; see also Mich. Ct.\nRule 6.005(H)(4) (2005) (trial counsel must file\n\xc2\x93postconviction motions the lawyer deems appropriate,\nincluding motions \xc2\x85 to withdraw plea, or for\nresentencing\xc2\x94); <i>post</i>, at 11 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting).<a class="fnflag" href="#FN5" name="FN5SRC">5</a> \nBut we held in <i>Swenson</i> v. <i>Bosler,</i> 386 U.S. 258 (1967)\n<i>(per curiam)</i>, that comparable materials prepared by\ntrial counsel are no substitute for an appellate lawyer\xc2\x92s\naid.  There, the Missouri court reviewing an indigent\xc2\x92s\npost-trial appeal had before it a transcript plus trial\ncounsel\xc2\x92s \xc2\x93notice of appeal and \xc2\x85 motion for new\ntrial which specifically designated the issues which could be\nconsidered on direct appeal.\xc2\x94  <i>Id.</i>, at 259.  The\nabsence of counsel in these circumstances, <i>Bosler </i>held,\n\xc2\x93violated [the defendant\xc2\x92s] Fourteenth\nAmendment rights, as defined in <i>Douglas</i>.\xc2\x94 \n<i>Ibid.</i>  Adhering to <i>Douglas</i>, we explained that\n\xc2\x93[t]he assistance of appellate counsel in preparing and\nsubmitting a brief to the appellate court which defines the\nlegal principles upon which the claims of error are based and\nwhich designates and interprets the relevant portions of the\n[record] may well be of substantial benefit to the defendant\n[and] may not be denied \xc2\x85 solely because of his\nindigency.\xc2\x94  386 U.S., at 259.  Although <i>Bosler\n</i>involved a post-trial rather than post-plea appeal, the\nCourt recognized that a transcript and motion by trial counsel\nare not adequate stand-ins for an appellate lawyer\xc2\x92s\nreview of the record and legal research.  Without guides keyed\nto a court of review, a <i>pro se </i>applicant\xc2\x92s\nentitlement to seek leave to appeal to Michigan\xc2\x92s\nintermediate court may be more formal than real.</p>\n<p>\n  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Persons in Halbert\xc2\x92s situation\nare particularly handicapped as self-representatives.

The Court holds Michigan\xc2\x92s law unconstitutional as applied to Halbert.\tIt fails, however, to ground its analysis in any particular provision of the Constitution or in this Court\xc2\x92s precedents.  It also ignores that, even if there is a right to counsel in the circumstances at issue, the right is waivable and was validly waived here.\tI respectfully dissent.</p> <p> I</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand why the Court\xc2\x92s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.\tBy the early 1990\xc2\x92s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  <i>People</i> v. <i>Bulger</i>, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that \xc2\x93[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall \xc2\x85 have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] \xc2\x85 an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.\xc2\x94  Mich. Const., Art. 1, \xc2\xa720; <i>Bulger</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 504, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 107.\tThis constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.</p> <p> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a \xc2\x93defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant\xc2\x92s conviction or sentence.\xc2\x94  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3a(1) (West 2000).\tDefendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant\xc2\x92s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  \xc2\xa7770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  \xc2\xa7770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, \xc2\x93the case proceeds as an appeal of right,\xc2\x94 Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.</p> <p> II</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan\xc2\x92s system is constitutionally inadequate.\tIt finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.  The majority does not say where in the Constitution that right is located\xc2\x96the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, or some purported confluence of the two.  <i>Ante</i>, at 2\xc2\x973.  Nor does the majority attempt to anchor its holding in the history of those Clauses.  <i>M.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0B.</i> v. <i>S.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0J.,</i> 519 U.S. 102, 131, 133, 138 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Nor does the majority even attempt to ground its holding in the entirety of this Court\xc2\x92s jurisprudence, which does not require paid appellate assistance for indigent criminal defendants.  <i>Id.</i>, at 131\xc2\x97138.  The majority ignores the bulk of that jurisprudence and leaves those arguments unanswered.</p> <p> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the majority pins its hopes on a single case: <i>Douglas</i> v. <i>California,</i> 372 U.S. 353 (1963).  <i>Douglas</i>, however, does not support extending the right to counsel to any form of discretionary review, as <i>Ross</i> v. <i>Moffitt,</i> 417 U.S. 600 (1974), and later cases make clear.  Moreover, Michigan has not engaged in the sort of invidious discrimination against indigent defendants that <i>Douglas</i> condemns.  Michigan has done no more than recognize the undeniable difference between defendants who plead guilty and those who maintain their innocence, in an attempt to divert resources from largely frivolous appeals to more meritorious ones.  The majority substitutes its own policy preference for that of Michigan voters, and it does so based on an untenable reading of <i>Douglas</i>.</p> <p> A</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <i>Douglas</i>, California granted an initial appeal as of right to all convicted criminal defendants.  372 U.S., at 356.\tHowever, the California District Court of Appeal appointed counsel for indigent defendants only after determining whether counsel would be useful to the defendant or the court.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Thus the California appellate court was \xc2\x93forced to prejudge the merits\xc2\x94 of indigent defendants\xc2\x92 appeals, while it judged the merits of other defendants\xc2\x92 appeals only after briefing and oral argument.  <i>Ibid</i>.</p> <p> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In previous cases, this Court had considered state-imposed conditions like transcript and filing fees that prevented indigent criminal defendants from obtaining any appellate review.  <i>Ross</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 606\xc2\x97607 (discussing <i>Griffin</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 351 U.S. 12 (1956), and its progeny).  By contrast, in <i>Douglas</i>, California provided appellate review to all criminal defendants, but it did not provide a state subsidy for indigent defendants whose claims appeared unlikely to benefit from counsel\xc2\x92s assistance.  This Court nevertheless held that when States provide a first appeal as of right, they must supply indigent defendants with counsel.  <i>Ross</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 607.  In <i>Ross</i>, however, this Court declined to extend <i>Douglas</i>\xc2\x92 right to counsel beyond initial appeals as of right.  States need not appoint counsel for indigent defendants who seek discretionary review in a State\xc2\x92s highest court or this Court.  <i>Ross, supra,</i> at 616\xc2\x97618.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michigan\xc2\x92s system bears some similarity to the state systems at issue in both <i>Douglas</i> and <i>Ross</i>.  Like the defendant in <i>Douglas</i>, Halbert requests appointed counsel for an initial appeal before an intermediate appellate court.  But like the defendant in <i>Ross</i>, Halbert requests appointed counsel for an appeal that is discretionary, not as of right.  Crucially, however, <i>Douglas</i> noted that its decision extended only to initial appeals <i>as of right</i>\xc2\x96and later cases have repeatedly reaffirmed that understanding.<a class="fnflag" href="#FN1" name="FN1SRC">1</a>  This Court has never required States to appoint counsel for discretionary review.  <i>Ross</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 610; <i>Murray</i> v. <i>Giarratano,</i> 492 U.S. 1, 10\xc2\x9711 (1989); see also <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Finley,</i> 481 U.S. 551, 555 (1987).  And an appeal permitted only \xc2\x93by leave of the court,\xc2\x94 Mich. Const., Art. 1, \xc2\xa720, is discretionary\xc2\x96as the Michigan Supreme Court has recognized, <i>Bulger</i>, 462 Mich., at 519, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 113; <i>id.</i>, at 542\xc2\x97542, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).  Neither <i>Douglas</i> nor any other decision of this Court warrants extending the right to counsel to discretionary review, even on a defendant\xc2\x92s initial appeal.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just as important, the rationale of <i>Douglas</i> does not support extending the right to counsel to this particular form of discretionary review.  Admittedly, the precise rationale for the <i>Griffin</i>/<i>Douglas</i> line of cases has never been made explicit.  <i>Ross</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 608\xc2\x97609.\tThose cases, however, have a common theme.  States may not impose financial barriers that preclude indigent defendants from securing appellate review altogether.  <i>Griffin</i>, 351 U.S., at 17\xc2\x9718 (plurality opinion); <i>id.</i>, at 22 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment); <i>Burns</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> 360 U.S. 252, 258 (1959); <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 365 U.S. 708, 713\xc2\x97714 (1961).  Nor may States create \xc2\x93\xc2\xa0\xc2\x91unreasoned distinctions\xc2\x92\xc2\xa0\xc2\x94 among defendants, <i>M.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0B.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 111 (quoting <i>Rinaldi</i> v. <i>Yeager,</i> 384 U.S. 305, 310 (1966)); <i>Douglas</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 356; <i>Griffin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 22\xc2\x9723 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment), that \xc2\x93arbitrarily cut off appeal rights for indigents while leaving open avenues of appeals for more affluent persons,\xc2\x94 <i>Ross</i>, 417 U.S., at 607.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Far from being an \xc2\x93arbitrary\xc2\x94 or \xc2\x93unreasoned\xc2\x94 distinction, Michigan\xc2\x92s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in <i>Douglas</i>.  In <i>Douglas</i>, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.  Here, Michigan preliminarily denies paid counsel only to indigent defendants who admit or do not contest their guilt.  And because a defendant who pleads guilty \xc2\x93may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea,\xc2\x94 <i>Tollett</i> v. <i>Henderson,</i> 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973), the potential issues that can be raised on appeal are more limited, <i>Bulger</i>, 462 Mich., at 517, and n.\xc2\xa07, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 112\xc2\x97113, and n.\xc2\xa07.  Further, as the Michigan Supreme Court has explained, </p> <p> \xc2\x93[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the \xc2\x91factual basis\xc2\x92 for the plea that is provided to the trial court.  In contrast with trials, less danger exists in plea cases that the record will be so unclear, or the errors so hidden, that the defendant\xc2\x92s appeal will be reduced to a meaningless ritual.\xc2\x94  <i>Id.</i>, at 517, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 112.</p> <p>  When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all \xc2\x93\xc2\xa0\xc2\x91[r]easoned distinctions\xc2\x92\xc2\xa0\xc2\x94 between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.  <i>M.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0B.</i>, 519 U.S., at 111 (quoting <i>Rinaldi,</i> <i>supra</i>, at 310).</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The brief history of Michigan\xc2\x92s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals\xc2\x92 docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan\xc2\x92s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not \xc2\x93invidious discrimination\xc2\x94 against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.  <i>Douglas</i>, 372 U.S., at 356 (internal quotation omitted).  It was an attempt to ensure \xc2\x93that frivolous appeals [were] not subsidized and public moneys not needlessly spent.\xc2\x94  <i>Griffin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 24 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment).</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xc2\x92s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan\xc2\x96at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, \xc2\xa7770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  \xc2\xa7770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan\xc2\x92s resources constant (since we have no control over the State\xc2\x92s bar or budget), the majority\xc2\x92s policy choice to redistribute the State\xc2\x92s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims\xc2\x96to say nothing of \xc2\x93the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the \xc2\x91over-lawyering\xc2\x92 of minor cases.\xc2\x94  <i>Alabama</i> v. <i>Shelton,</i> 535 U.S. 654, 681 (2002) (Scalia, J., dissenting); cf. <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Beard</i>, <i>ante,</i> at 8 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Then, too, Michigan is under no constitutional obligation to provide appeals for plea-convicted defendants.\t<i>Ante</i>, at 2 (citing <i>McKane</i> v. <i>Durston,</i> 153 U.S. 684 (1894)).  Michigan may decline to provide an appellate process altogether (since the Court\xc2\x92s ruling increases the cost of having a system of appellate review).  Surely plea-convicted defendants would prefer appeals with limited access to counsel than no appeals at all.</p> <p> B</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority does not attempt to demonstrate that Michigan\xc2\x92s system is the sort of \xc2\x93unreasoned\xc2\x94 discrimination against indigent defendants <i>Douglas</i> prohibits.  Instead, the majority says that this case is earmarked by two considerations that were also key to this Court\xc2\x92s decision in <i>Douglas:</i> First, when a plea-convicted defendant seeks leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals adjudicates the leave application with reference to the merits.  <i>Ante</i>, at 9.  Second, the plea-convicted defendant who seeks leave to appeal is \xc2\x93generally ill equipped to represent [himself].\xc2\x94  <i>Ibid</i>.  Neither of these arguments is correct.</p> <p> 1</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority reasons that in adjudicating an application for leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals \xc2\x93is guided \xc2\x85 by the merits of the particular defendant\xc2\x92s claims.\xc2\x94  <i>Ante</i>, at 11.  The distinction that <i>Douglas</i> drew, however, was not between appellate systems that involve \xc2\x93some evaluation of the merits of the applicant\xc2\x92s claims\xc2\x94 and those that do not, <i>ante</i>, at 10, but instead between discretionary and mandatory review.  <i>Supra</i>, at 4\xc2\x976.  Of course the California intermediate courts in <i>Douglas</i> evaluated cases on their merits: These courts were hearing appeals as of right.</p> <p> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider \xc2\x93the merits of the applicant\xc2\x92s claims\xc2\x94 in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.\tFor instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case\xc2\x92s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.\tNone of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court\xc2\x92s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court\xc2\x92s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals\xc2\x92 decision to grant review remains \xc2\x93discretionary,\xc2\x94 because it does not depend on \xc2\x93whether there has been \xc2\x91a correct adjudication of guilt\xc2\x92 in every individual case.\xc2\x94  <i>Ross</i>, 417 U.S., at 615.  Like other courts of discretionary review, the Court of Appeals may opt to correct errors, <i>ante</i>, at 10\xc2\x9711, and n.\xc2\xa03\xc2\x96but it is not compelled to do so.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary, <i>ante</i>, at 10\xc2\x9711, and n.\xc2\xa04, but it provides no support for its speculation.  Unlike the California District Court of Appeal in <i>Douglas</i>, the Michigan Court of Appeals has discretion in deciding whether to grant leave applications.  See <i>Bulger</i>, 462 Mich., at 519, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 113 (describing the issue as \xc2\x93whether a defendant is entitled under the federal constitution to appointed counsel in a first <i>discretionary</i> appeal from a plea-based conviction\xc2\x94 (emphasis in original)); <i>id.</i>, at 542\xc2\x97543, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (\xc2\x93Nothing in our court rules or statute precludes the Court of Appeals from denying leave even though it may believe that the trial court\xc2\x92s decision was incorrect\xc2\x94).  So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals\xc2\x92 decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xc2\x92s holding suggests that Michigan\xc2\x92s system would pass constitutional muster if the Court of Appeals recited \xc2\x93lack of importance in the grounds presented\xc2\x94 as its ground for denying leave, <i>ante</i>, at 10\xc2\x9712, or if its decisional criteria were set forth in a statute, judicial decision, or court rule, <i>ibid</i>.  Yet the relevant inquiry under <i>Douglas</i> and <i>Ross</i> is whether the Court of Appeals is obliged to review the case\xc2\x96not whether the Court of Appeals must or does offer a particular ground for declining review.</p> <p> 2</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also asserts that, without counsel, plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal are \xc2\x93generally ill equipped to represent themselves.\xc2\x94  <i>Ante</i>, at 9.  This overgeneralizes <i>Douglas</i>\xc2\x92 rationale.  The <i>Douglas</i> Court was concerned with the \xc2\x93barren record\xc2\x94 that would follow a defendant on appeal.\t372 U.S., at 356.  For \xc2\x93where the record [was] unclear or the errors [were] hidden,\xc2\x94 the appellate court would have difficulty detecting errors without the assistance of counsel.  <i>Id.</i>, at 358.</p> <p> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is in part why this Court in <i>Ross</i> did not extend the right to counsel to discretionary review before the North Carolina Supreme Court.  Before that court, a defendant applying for leave had \xc2\x93a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing of his case.\xc2\x94  <i>Ross</i>, 417 U.S., at 615.  Coupled with whatever the defendant might submit on his own, these materials provided the State Supreme Court \xc2\x93with an adequate basis for its decision to grant or deny review.\xc2\x94  Ibid.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority does not argue that indigent plea-convicted defendants who file leave applications do so with a \xc2\x93barren record,\xc2\x94 <i>Douglas</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 356, or that the Michigan Court of Appeals lacks an \xc2\x93adequate basis\xc2\x94 for reviewing their leave applications, <i>Ross</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 615.  The Michigan Supreme Court put it best:</p> <p> \xc2\x93[Michigan\xc2\x92s] court rules require trial counsel to assist the defendant in organizing and presenting to the trial court any potential appellate issues that warrant preservation.  Accordingly, a pro se defendant seeking discretionary review will have the benefit of a transcript, trial counsel\xc2\x92s framing of the issues in the motion to withdraw, and the trial court\xc2\x92s ruling on the motion.\xc2\x94  <i>Bulger</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 518, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 113; see also Mich. Ct. Rule 6.005(H)(4) (2005).</p> <p>  As in <i>Ross</i>, these materials aid both the plea-convicted defendant and the Michigan Court of Appeals in identifying claims appropriate for plenary consideration.  A plea-convicted defendant does not face a record unreviewed by counsel, and he does not lack any reasoned treatment of his claims.  And, again, plea proceedings tend to be more transparent than trials, <i>supra</i>, at 6; \xc2\x93less danger exists in plea cases that the record will be so unclear, or the errors so hidden,\xc2\x94 <i>Bulger</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 517, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 112, that the Michigan Court of Appeals will be unable to identify issues that deserve further examination on appeal.  After all, the Michigan Court of Appeals need know only enough to decide whether to grant further review.\tShould it elect to do so, Michigan law requires the appointment of counsel to aid in the appeal.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3a(2)(c) (2005).</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xc2\x92s unwillingness to confront the distinctions between Michigan\xc2\x92s system and the California system at issue in <i>Douglas</i> is made clear by its reliance on <i>Swenson</i> v. <i>Bosler,</i> 386 U.S. 258 (1967) <i>(per curiam)</i>.  <i>Swenson</i> considered whether indigent defendants convicted at trial have a right to appointed counsel during their initial appeal as of right, even if the State provides indigent defendants with a trial transcript and a motion for a new trial prepared by trial counsel.  <i>Id.</i>, at 258\xc2\x97259.\tBut <i>Douglas</i> had already answered that question, as this Court summarily declared: \xc2\x93[Appointed counsel] may not be denied to a criminal defendant, solely because of his indigency, on the only appeal which the State affords him <i>as a matter of right</i>.\xc2\x94  386 U.S., at 259 (emphasis added).  Of course, Michigan\xc2\x92s entire argument is that there is a \xc2\x93[r]easoned distinction\xc2\x94 between defendants convicted following trials and pleas, as there is between appeals as of right and discretionary review.  <i>M.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0B.</i>, 519 U.S., at 111 (citation omitted); Brief for Respondent 28.  This Court\xc2\x92s brief, <i>per curiam</i> opinion in <i>Swenson</i> did not consider, much less address, these arguments.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lacking support in this Court\xc2\x92s cases, the majority effects a not-so-subtle shift from whether the record is adequate to enable discretionary review to whether plea-convicted defendants are generally able to \xc2\x93[n]aviga[te] the appellate process without a lawyer\xc2\x92s assistance.\xc2\x94  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.  This rationale lacks any stopping point.  <i>Pro se</i> defendants may have difficulty navigating discretionary direct appeals and collateral proceedings, but this Court has never extended the right to counsel beyond first appeals as of right.  <i>Supra</i>, at 4\xc2\x975, and n.\xc2\xa01.  The majority does not demonstrate that <i>pro se</i> defendants have any more difficulty filing leave applications before the Michigan courts than, say, filing petitions for certiorari before this Court.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, this Court receives thousands of <i>pro se</i> petitions every year that list \xc2\x93the date and nature of the judgment or order appealed from,\xc2\x94 Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(B)(1) (2005); \xc2\x93reci[te] the appellant\xc2\x92s allegations of error and the relief sought,\xc2\x94 <i>ibid.; </i>and \xc2\x93se[t] forth a concise argument \xc2\x85 in support of the appellant\xc2\x92s position on each issue,\xc2\x94 <i>ibid</i>.\tSee this Court\xc2\x92s Rule 14 (setting forth analogous requirements for petitions for writs of certiorari).  Michigan actually provides a three-page form application accompanied by two pages of instructions for defendants seeking leave to appeal after sentencing on a plea.  It counsels defendants to \xc2\x93state the issues and facts relevant to the appeal,\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93state the law that supports your position and explain how the law applies to the facts of your case.\xc2\x94  <i>Ante,</i> at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The majority gives no clue as to how Michigan could make its procedures for seeking leave to appeal less intimidating to the uncounseled.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Regardless, Michigan\xc2\x92s procedures are more than sufficient to enable discretionary review.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority then attempts to soften the blow by saying that it is doing the State a favor, because \xc2\x93providing indigents with appellate counsel will yield applications easier to comprehend.\xc2\x94  <i>Ante</i>, at 15\xc2\x9716.  Even assuming the majority\xc2\x92s paternalism is accurate, there is no evidence that the Michigan courts currently have difficulty adjudicating leave applications.  At the least, the majority leaves unexplained why the Michigan courts have greater difficulty than do state and federal courts considering discretionary direct appeals and collateral proceedings.  And  even assuming the Michigan courts have special difficulty, it is unlikely any marginal gains will offset the harms wrought by the majority\xc2\x92s preference for redistributing resources to a set of generally less meritorious claims.  Whether or not one agrees with the policy choice made by Michigan voters, it is perfectly constitutional.</p> <p> III</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming that there is a right to appointed appellate counsel in these circumstances, the right, like the vast majority of other procedural rights, is waivable, despite the majority\xc2\x92s dictum to the contrary.  Moreover, Michigan\xc2\x92s statutory prohibition on appointed appellate counsel does not prevent defendants from waiving any constitutional right to such counsel.  And, in this case, Halbert\xc2\x92s waiver was knowing and intelligent.</p> <p> A</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Legal rights, even constitutional ones, are presumptively waivable.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mezzanatto,</i> 513 U.S. 196, 200\xc2\x97201 (1995); see also <i>New York</i> v. <i>Hill,</i> 528 U.S. 110, 114 (2000); <i>Peretz</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 501 U.S. 923, 936 (1991) (\xc2\x93The most basic rights of criminal defendants are \xc2\x85 subject to waiver\xc2\x94).  The presumption of waivability holds true for the right to counsel.  This Court has held repeatedly that a defendant may waive that right, both at trial and at the entry of a guilty plea, so long as the waiver is knowing and intelligent.  <i>Iowa</i> v. <i>Tovar,</i> 541 U.S. 77, 88 (2004); <i>Faretta</i> v. <i>California,</i> 422 U.S. 806, 835 (1975); <i>Adams</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. McCann,</i> 317 U.S. 269, 279 (1942); <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Zerbst,</i> 304 U.S. 458, 464\xc2\x97465 (1938).  Michigan seeks a waiver no more extensive than those this Court has already sanctioned at other stages of a criminal proceeding: It asks defendants convicted by plea to waive the right to appointed counsel on appeal.</p> <p> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There may be some nonwaivable rights: ones \xc2\x93so fundamental to the reliability of the factfinding process that they may never be waived without irreparably discrediting the federal courts.\xc2\x94\t<i>Mezzanatto</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 204 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted).  The right to appointed counsel on discretionary appeal from a guilty plea, however, is not one of them<i>.</i>  Even assuming that the assistance of appellate counsel enhances the reliability of the factfinding process by correcting errors in that process, it cannot possibly be so fundamental to the process that its absence \xc2\x93irreparably discredit[s]\xc2\x94 the federal courts, particularly since the Constitution guarantees no right to an appeal at all, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>M.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0B.</i>, 519 U.S., at 110, 120.  Furthermore, as I have explained, the record of a plea proceeding is fully adequate to enable discretionary review and, in turn, to permit the correction of errors in the factfinding process when necessary.  <i>Supra</i>, at 11 (explaining that a plea-convicted defendant does not face a record unreviewed by counsel, and does not lack any reasoned treatment of his claims).  And, finally, even if the reliability of the appellate process rather than the trial process is the relevant consideration here, the assistance of appellate counsel is not so fundamental to the appellate process that its absence deprives that process of meaning.  <i>Supra</i>, at 6, 11\xc2\x9713.  Cf<i>.</i> <i>Hill, supra</i>, at 116\xc2\x97117 (a constitutional protection may be waived even if it benefits society as well as criminal defendants).</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner emphasizes the difficulty of the choice to which Michigan\xc2\x92s statute puts criminal defendants: proceed to trial and guarantee the appointment of appellate counsel, or plead guilty and forgo that benefit.  But this Court has repeatedly recognized that difficult choices are a necessary byproduct of the criminal justice system, and of plea bargaining in particular.\tSee, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Mezzanatto</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 210; <i>Brady</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 397 U.S. 742, 750 (1970).  Michigan\xc2\x92s waiver requires a choice no more demanding than others criminal defendants regularly face.</p> <p> B</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority maintains, first, that Halbert could not waive the right to appointed appellate counsel because Michigan law afforded him no such right to waive; second, in dictum, that the right cannot be waived; and, third, that even if the right can be waived, Halbert did not knowingly and intelligently waive it here.  The Court is wrong in each respect.</p> <p> 1</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority claims that \xc2\x93[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.\xc2\x94  <i>Ante</i>, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3a (West 2000).\tAt the time of Halbert\xc2\x92s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority\xc2\x92s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.</p> <p> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the statement that \xc2\x93Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,\xc2\x94 <i>ante</i>, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants <i>before entering a plea</i>, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert\xc2\x92s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (\xc2\x93In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right\xc2\x94).\tMichigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alternately, by stating that \xc2\x93Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,\xc2\x94 <i>ante</i>, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right <i>by pleading</i>.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional<i> </i>right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than \xc2\x93no[t] recognized\xc2\x94 at the time of Halbert\xc2\x92s plea, then the right would have been waivable, <i>ante</i>, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).</p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than \xc2\x93no[t] recognized,\xc2\x94 and hence waivable, <i>ante</i>, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority\xc2\x92s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued <i>Bulger</i>, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, <i>Tesmer</i> v. <i>Kowalski</i>, 114 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 622, 625\xc2\x97629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled at the time of Halbert\xc2\x92s plea; hence, on what I take to be the majority\xc2\x92s own terms, the right should have been waivable.<a class="fnflag" href="#FN2" name="FN2SRC">2</a> </p> <p>   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that \xc2\x93nothing in Halbert\xc2\x92s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an \xc2\x91unsettled\xc2\x92 \xc2\x85 but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.\xc2\x94  <i>Ante</i>, at 16, n.\xc2\xa07.  But any arguable inadequacy in the plea colloquy is a separate issue from, and is irrelevant to, the question at hand: whether the right was recognized, and hence waivable by Halbert (or any other defendant deciding how to plead), irrespective of the content of the plea colloquy.</p> <p> 2</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority compounds its error by expressing doubt in dictum that the right to appointed appellate counsel can be waived.  <i>Ante</i>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa08.  This ignores the well-established presumption of waivability, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Mezzanatto</i>,<i> </i>513 U.S., at 200\xc2\x97201; <i>Hill</i>, 528 U.S., at 114.  By ignoring the presumption, the majority effectively reverses it, espousing an analysis that is \xc2\x93directly contrary to the approach we have taken in the context of a broad array of constitutional and statutory provisions.\xc2\x94\t<i>Mezzanatto, supra,</i> at 200.  For the proposition that Michigan\xc2\x92s waiver requirement is unconstitutional, the majority cites <i>Douglas</i>, 372 U.S., at 357\xc2\x97358, and <i>M.</i> <i>L .B.</i>, 519 U.S., at 110\xc2\x97113, which explained that states cannot create unreasoned distinctions between indigent and moneyed defendants.  <i>Ante</i>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa08.  These cases have nothing to do with waiver; they determined only that certain rights existed, not that they both existed <i>and were nonwaivable</i>.</p> <p> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority seems to think that Michigan\xc2\x92s waiver requirement arbitrarily distinguishes between indigents and more affluent persons.  As I have explained, however, the statute does no such thing.  Rather, it sensibly differentiates between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea.  <i>Supra</i>, at 6\xc2\x977.  The majority\xc2\x92s dictum fails to persuade.</p> <p> 3</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the plea colloquy shows that Halbert\xc2\x92s waiver was knowing and intelligent, and that any deficiency in the plea colloquy was harmless.\tSee 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2111; cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\xc2\xa011(h).  First, Halbert understood he was waiving any appeal as of right: The trial court asked Halbert, \xc2\x93You understand if I accept your plea you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of right,\xc2\x94 and Halbert answered \xc2\x93Yes, sir.\xc2\x94  App. 22.  Second, the court explained the statutory exceptions governing when counsel must or might be appointed, and Halbert again indicated that he understood those conditions.  <i>Ante</i>, at 7 (quoting colloquy).  In context, the court\xc2\x92s enumeration of the limited conditions in which counsel might be appointed informed Halbert that counsel would not be appointed in other circumstances.  Third, at the end of the colloquy, the court asked counsel, \xc2\x93Any other promises or considerations I should be made aware of?\xc2\x94 App. 24, and \xc2\x93Do counsel believe I\xc2\x92ve complied with the court rule regarding no contest pleas?\xc2\x94 <i>id.,</i> at 25, both of which questions the prosecutor and defense attorney answered in the affirmative.  Cf. <i>Bradshaw</i> v. <i>Stumpf</i>, <i>ante,</i> at 7 (\xc2\x93Where a defendant is represented by competent counsel, the court usually may rely on that counsel\xc2\x92s assurance that the defendant has been properly informed of the nature and elements of the charge to which he is pleading guilty\xc2\x94).  Fourth, the court \xc2\x93f[ound] the plea understandingly made, voluntary and accurate.\xc2\x94  App. 25.  There can be no serious claim that Halbert would have changed his plea had the court provided further information.</p> <p> ***</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today the Court confers on defendants convicted by plea a right nowhere to be found in the Constitution or this Court\xc2\x92s cases.  It does so at the expense of defendants whose claims are, on average, likely more meritorious.  And it ignores that, even if such a right exists, it is fully waivable and was waived in this case.  I respectfully dissent.</p> <h4>Notes</h4> <p><a class="fnflag" href="#FN1SRC" name="FN1">1.</a> <i>Douglas</i>, 372 U.S.,<i> </i>at 357; <i>Ross</i>, 417 U.S., at 608 (\xc2\x93<i>[Douglas]</i> extended only to initial appeals as of right\xc2\x94); <i>Evitts</i> v. <i>Lucey,</i> 469 U.S. 387, 394 (1985) (<i>Douglas</i> \xc2\x93is limited to the first appeal as of right\xc2\x94); <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Finley,</i> 481 U.S. 551, 555 (1987) (\xc2\x93[T]he right to appointed counsel extends to the first appeal of right, and no further\xc2\x94); <i>Coleman</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 501 U.S. 722, 755 (1991) (\xc2\x93<i>[Douglas]</i> establish[es] that an indigent criminal defendant has a right to appointed counsel in his first appeal as of right in state court\xc2\x94); see also <i>Wainwright</i> v. <i>Torna,</i> 455 U.S. 586, 587 (1982) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\xc2\x93<i>[Ross]</i> held that a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to counsel to pursue discretionary state appeals or applications for review in this Court\xc2\x94). </p> <p><a class="fnflag" href="#FN2SRC" name="FN2">2.</a> \xc2\xa0Moreover, the majority\xc2\x92s failure to make clear which sources of law are to be considered in deciding whether a right is \xc2\x93no[t] recognized,\xc2\x94 <i>ante,</i> at 16, and hence nonwaivable, is bound to wreak havoc.\tFor instance, suppose that a defendant waived the right to appeal his sentence after the regional Court of Appeals had held that the principle of <i>Blakely</i> v. <i>Washington</i>, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), did not apply to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, but before this Court held the contrary in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Booker</i>, 543 U.S. ___ (2005).
