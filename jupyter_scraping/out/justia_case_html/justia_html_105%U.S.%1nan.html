CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The only question we have to decide in this case is whether the section of the Illinois Constitution adopted in 1870 relating to "municipal subscriptions to railroads or private corporations" was in force on the 6th of August, 1870.  This question came before the supreme court of the state at the January Term, 1872, only eighteen months after the constitution was adopted, in <em>Schall v. Bowman,</em> 62 Ill. 321, and it was then decided that this section took effect on the 2d of July, the day the people voted for its adoption.  The opinion in the case was written by Mr. Justice Breese, two justices dissenting.  At the September Term in the same year, the same questions came again before the court in <em>Richards v. Donagho,</em> 66 Ill. 73, and the opinion was then delivered by Mr. Justice Thornton in the following words:</p>\n<p>"The only question presented by this record was, after mature deliberation, settled by the opinion in <em>Schall v. Bowman.</em> . . .  Notwithstanding the able and plausible argument made in this case, the majority of the court adhere to the opinion in the case referred to above."</p>\n<p>Afterwards at the January Term, 1878, in <em>Wright v. Bishop,</em> 88 Ill. 302, the court said:</p>\n<p>"Appellants make a very able and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="3">Page 105 U. S. 3</a></p><p> interesting argument against the rulings in those cases, but we are not convinced they should be overruled."</p>\n<p>This Court has never until now been called on to decide the question, but in numerous cases it has assumed that the section took effect on the day fixed by the supreme court of the state.  <em>Town of Concord v.
