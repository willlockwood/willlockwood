SUDERS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE <em>v.</em> SUDERS</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x9395. Argued March 31, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 14, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">In March 1998, the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) hired plaintiff-respondent Suders to work as a police communications operator for the McConnellsburg barracks, where her male supervisors subjected her to a continuous barrage of sexual harassment.  In June 1998, Suders told the PSP\xe2\x80\x99s Equal Employment Opportunity Officer, Virginia Smith-Elliott, that she might need help, but neither woman followed up on the conversation.  Two months later, Suders contacted Smith-Elliott again, this time reporting that she was being harassed and was afraid.  Smith-Elliott told Suders to file a complaint, but did not tell her how to obtain the necessary form.  Two days later, Suders\xe2\x80\x99 supervisors arrested her for theft of her own computer-skills exam papers.  Suders had removed the papers after concluding that the supervisors had falsely reported that she had repeatedly failed, when in fact, the exams were never forwarded for grading.  Suders then resigned from the force and sued the PSP, alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that she had been subjected to sexual harassment and constructively discharged, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted the PSP\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment.  Although recognizing that Suders\xe2\x80\x99 testimony would permit a fact trier to conclude that her supervisors had created a hostile work environment, the court nevertheless held that the PSP was not vicariously liable for the supervisors\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  In support of its decision, the District Court referred to <em>Faragher</em> v. <em>Boca Raton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/775/index.html">524 U. S. 775</a>, 808.  In that case, and in <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html">524 U. S. 742</a>, decided the same day, this Court held that an employer is strictly liable for supervisor harassment that \xe2\x80\x9cculminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.\xe2\x80\x9d  524 U. S.<em>,</em> at 765.  But when no such tangible action is taken, both decisions also hold, the employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability.  To prevail on the basis of the defense, the employer must prove that \xe2\x80\x9c(a) [it] exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d and that (b) the employee \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Suders\xe2\x80\x99 hostile work environment claim was untenable as a matter of law, the District Court stated, because she unreasonably failed to avail herself of the PSP\xe2\x80\x99s internal antiharassment procedures.  The court did not address Suders\xe2\x80\x99 constructive discharge claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit reversed and remanded the case for trial.  The appeals court disagreed with the District Court in two key respects: First, even if the PSP could assert the <em>Ellerth/Faragher</em> affirmative defense, genuine issues of material fact existed about the effectiveness of the PSP\xe2\x80\x99s program to address sexual harassment claims; second, Suders had stated a claim of constructive discharge due to hostile work environment.  The appeals court ruled that a constructive discharge, if proved, constitutes a tangible employment action that renders an employer strictly liable and precludes recourse to the <em>Ellerth/Faragher</em> affirmative defense.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>To establish \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive discharge,\xe2\x80\x9d a plaintiff alleging sexual harassment must show that the abusive working environment became so intolerable that her resignation qualified as a fitting response.  An employer may assert the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense to such a claim unless the plaintiff quit in reasonable response to an adverse action officially changing her employment status or situation, <em>e.g.</em>, a humiliating demotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position in which she would face unbearable working conditions.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Under the constructive discharge doctrine, an employee\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes.  The inquiry is objective: Did working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee\xe2\x80\x99s position would have felt compelled to resign?  This doctrine was developed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s, and was solidly established in the lower federal courts by 1964, when Title VII was enacted.  The Court agrees that Title VII encompasses employer liability for a constructive discharge.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This case concerns employer liability for one subset of constructive discharge claims: those resulting from sexual harassment, or \xe2\x80\x9chostile work environment,\xe2\x80\x9d attributable to a supervisor.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s starting point is the <em>Ellerth/Faragher</em> framework.  Those decisions delineate two categories of sexual harassment claims: (1) those alleging a \xe2\x80\x9ctangible employment action,\xe2\x80\x9d for which employers may be held strictly liable; and (2) those asserting no tangible employment action, in which case employers may assert the affirmative defense.  <em>Ellerth,</em> 524 U. S., at 765.  The key issues here are: Into which <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>category hostile-environment constructive discharge claims fall, and what proof burdens the parties bear in such cases.  In <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher,</em> the Court invoked the principle drawn from agency law that an employer is liable for the acts of its agent when the agent is \xe2\x80\x9caided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id.,</em> at 758.  When a supervisor engaged in harassing conduct takes a tangible employment action against a subordinate, the Court reasoned, it is beyond question that the supervisor is aided by the agency relation.  A tangible employment action, the Court stated, is an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act of the enterprise\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfall[s] within the special province of the supervisor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 762.  In contrast, when supervisor harassment does not culminate in a tangible employment action, <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> explained, it is less obvious that the agency relation is the driving force.  The Court also recognized that a liability limitation linked to an employer\xe2\x80\x99s effort to install effective grievance procedures and an employee\xe2\x80\x99s effort to report harassing behavior would advance Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s conciliation and deterrence purposes.  <em>Id.,</em> at 764.  Accordingly, the Court held that when no tangible employment action is taken, an employer may defeat vicarious liability for supervisor harassment by establishing the two-part affirmative defense.  That defense, the Court observed, accommodates the \xe2\x80\x9cavoidable consequences\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine Title VII \xe2\x80\x9cborrows from tort law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> by requiring plaintiffs reasonably to stave off avoidable harm.  <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> clarify, however, that the defending employer bears the burden to prove that the plaintiff-employee unreasonably failed to avoid or reduce harm.  <em>Faragher,</em> at 807.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The constructive discharge at issue stems from, and can be regarded as an aggravated case of, sexual harassment or hostile work environment.   For an atmosphere of harassment or hostility to be actionable, the offending behavior must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the victim\xe2\x80\x99s employment conditions and create an abusive working environment.  <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB</em> v. <em>Vinson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/57/index.html">477 U. S. 57</a>, 67.  A hostile-environment constructive discharge claim entails something more: working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign.  Suders\xe2\x80\x99 claim is of the same genre as the claims analyzed in <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>.  Essentially, Suders presents a \xe2\x80\x9cworse case\xe2\x80\x9d harassment scenario, harassment ratcheted up to the breaking point.  Like the harassment considered in <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher,</em> harassment so intolerable as to cause a resignation may be effected through co-worker conduct, unofficial supervisory conduct, or official company acts.  Unlike an actual termination, which is <em>always</em> effected through an official company act, a constructive discharge may or may not involve official action.  When it does not, the extent to which the agency relationship aided the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct is less certain, and that uncertainty justifies affording the employer the chance to establish, through the <em>Ellerth/Faragher</em> affirmative defense, that it should not be held vicariously liable.  The Third Circuit erred in drawing the line differently.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit qualified its holding that a constructive discharge itself constitutes a tangible employment action under <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher:</em> The affirmative defense delineated in those cases, the court noted, might be imported into the anterior issue whether the employee\xe2\x80\x99s decision to resign was reasonable under the circumstances.  However, the appeals court left open when and how the <em>Ellerth/Faragher</em> considerations would be brought home to the fact trier.  The Court of Appeals did not address specifically the allocation of pleading and persuasion burdens, but simply relied on \xe2\x80\x9cthe wisdom and expertise of trial judges to exercise their gatekeeping authority when assessing whether all, some, or none of the evidence relating to employers\xe2\x80\x99 antiharassment programs and to employees\xe2\x80\x99 exploration of alternative avenues warrants introduction at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 463.  There is no cause for leaving the district courts thus unguided.  Following <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>, the plaintiff who alleges no tangible employment action has the duty to mitigate harm, but the defendant bears the burden to allege and prove that the plaintiff failed in that regard.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Although the Third Circuit correctly ruled that the case, in its current posture, presents genuine issues of material fact concerning Suders\xe2\x80\x99 hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims, that court erred in declaring the affirmative defense described in <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> never available in constructive discharge cases.

The question presented concerns the proof burdens parties bear when a sexual harassment/constructive discharge claim of that character is asserted under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To establish hostile work environment, plaintiffs like Suders must show harassing behavior \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [their] employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB</em> v. <em>Vinson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/57/index.html">477 U. S. 57</a>, 67 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Forklift Systems, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/17/index.html">510 U. S. 17</a>, 22 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their \xe2\x80\xa6 gender \xe2\x80\xa6 offends Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s broad rule of workplace equality.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Beyond that, we hold, to establish \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive discharge,\xe2\x80\x9d the plaintiff must make a further showing: She must show that the abusive working environment became so intolerable that her resignation qualified as a fitting response.  An employer may defend against such a claim by showing both (1) that it had installed a readily accessible and effective policy for reporting and resolving complaints of sexual harassment, and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of that employer-provided preventive or remedial apparatus.  This affirmative defense will not be available to the employer, however, if the plaintiff quits in reasonable response to an employer-sanctioned adverse action officially changing her employment status or situation, for example, a humiliating demotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position in which she would face unbearable working conditions.  In so ruling today, we follow the path marked by our 1998 decisions in <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/742/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/742/index.html">524 U.

Suders\xe2\x80\x99 supervisors were Sergeant Eric D. Easton, Station Commander at the McConnellsburg barracks, Patrol Corporal William D. Baker, and Corporal Eric B. Prendergast.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Those three supervisors subjected Suders to a continuous barrage of sexual harassment that ceased only when she resigned from the force.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Easton \xe2\x80\x9cwould bring up [the subject of] people having sex with animals\xe2\x80\x9d each time Suders entered his office.  <em>Ibid</em>. (internal quotation marks omitted).  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He told Prendergast, in front of Suders, that young girls should be given instruction in how to gratify men with oral sex.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Easton also would sit down near Suders, wearing spandex shorts, and spread his legs apart.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Apparently imitating a move popularized by television wrestling, Baker repeatedly made an obscene gesture in Suders\xe2\x80\x99 presence by grabbing his genitals and shouting out a vulgar comment inviting oral sex.  <em>Id</em>., at 437.  Baker made this gesture as many as five-to-ten times per night throughout Suders\xe2\x80\x99 employment at the barracks.   <em>Ibid</em>.  Suders once told Baker she \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98d[id]n\xe2\x80\x99t think [he] should be doing this\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; Baker responded by jumping on a chair and again performing the gesture, with the accompanying vulgarity.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Further, Baker would \xe2\x80\x9crub his rear end in front of her and remark \xe2\x80\x98I have a nice ass, don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Prendergast told Suders \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the village idiot could do her job\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; wearing black gloves, he would pound on furniture to intimidate her.  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In June 1998, Prendergast accused Suders of taking a missing accident file home with her.  <em>Id</em>., at 438.  After that incident, Suders approached the PSP\xe2\x80\x99s Equal Employment Opportunity Officer, Virginia Smith-Elliott, and told her she \xe2\x80\x9cmight need some help.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Smith-Elliott gave Suders her telephone number, but neither woman followed up on the conversation.  <em>Ibid</em>.  On August 18, 1998, Suders contacted Smith-Elliott again, this time stating that she was being harassed and was afraid.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Smith-Elliott told Suders to file a complaint, but did not tell her how to obtain the necessary form.  Smith-Elliott\xe2\x80\x99s response and the manner in which it was conveyed appeared to Suders insensitive and unhelpful.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two days later, Suders\xe2\x80\x99 supervisors arrested her\nfor theft, and Suders resigned from the force.  The theft arrest occurred in the following circumstances.  Suders had several times taken a computer-skills exam to satisfy a PSP job requirement.  <em>Id</em>., at 438\xe2\x80\x93439.  Each time, Suders\xe2\x80\x99 supervisors told her that she had failed.  <em>Id</em>., at 439.  Suders one day came upon her exams in a set of drawers in the women\xe2\x80\x99s locker room.  She concluded that her supervisors had never forwarded the tests for grading and that their reports of her failures were false.  <em>Ibid</em>.   Regarding the tests as her property, Suders removed them from the locker room.  <em>Ibid.;</em> App. 11, 119\xe2\x80\x93120.  Upon finding that the exams had been removed, Suders\xe2\x80\x99 supervisors devised a plan to arrest her for theft.  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 438\xe2\x80\x93439.  The officers dusted the drawer in which the exams had been stored with a theft-detection powder that turns hands blue when touched.  <em>Id</em>., at 439.  As anticipated by Easton, Baker, and Prendergast, Suders attempted to return the tests to the drawer, whereupon her hands turned telltale blue.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The supervisors then apprehended and handcuffed her, photographed her blue hands, and commenced to question her.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Suders had previously prepared a written resignation, which she tendered soon after the supervisors detained her.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Nevertheless, the supervisors initially refused to release her.  Instead, they brought her to an interrogation room, gave her warnings under <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966), and continued to question her.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Suders reiterated that she wanted to resign, and Easton then let her leave.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The PSP never brought theft charges against her.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September 2000, Suders sued the PSP in Federal District Court, alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that she had been subjected to sexual harassment and constructively discharged, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <em>et seq</em>.  App. 1, 12\xe2\x80\x9313.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  At the close of discovery, the District Court granted the PSP\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment.  Suders\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, the District Court recognized, sufficed to permit a trier of fact to conclude that the supervisors had created a hostile work environment.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a.  The court nevertheless held that the PSP was not vicariously liable for the supervisors\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  <em>Id</em>., at 80a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In so concluding, the District Court referred to our 1998 decision in <em>Faragher</em> v. <em>Boca Raton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/775/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/775/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/775/index.html">524 U.

In <em>Faragher</em>, along with <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/742/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/742/index.html">524 U.

S., at 808.  Both decisions hold that an employer is strictly liable for supervisor harassment that \xe2\x80\x9cculminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 765; accord<em> Faragher</em>, 524 U. S., at 808.   But when no tangible employment action is taken, both decisions also hold, the employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence: \xe2\x80\x9cThe defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U.

Resigning just two days after she first mentioned anything about harassment to Equal Employment Opportunity Officer Smith-Elliott, the court noted, Suders had \xe2\x80\x9cnever given [the PSP] the opportunity to respond to [her] complaints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The District Court did not address Suders\xe2\x80\x99 constructive discharge claim.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded the case for disposition on the merits.  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 462.  The Third Circuit agreed with the District Court that Suders had presented evidence sufficient for a trier of fact to conclude that the supervisors had engaged in a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of sexual harassment that was pervasive and regular.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 442.  But the appeals court disagreed with the District Court in two fundamental respects.  First, the Court of Appeals held that, even assuming the PSP could assert the affirmative defense described in <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>, genuine issues of material fact existed concerning the effectiveness of the PSP\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprogram \xe2\x80\xa6 to address sexual harassment claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 443.  Second, the appeals court held that the District Court erred in failing to recognize that Suders had stated a claim of constructive discharge due to the hostile work environment.  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A plaintiff alleging constructive discharge in violation of Title VII, the Court of Appeals stated, must establish:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) he or she suffered harassment or discrimination so intolerable that a reasonable person in the same position would have felt compelled to resign \xe2\x80\xa6 ; and (2) the employee\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the workplace situation\xe2\x80\x94that is, his or her decision to resign\xe2\x80\x94was reasonable given the totality of circumstances \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 445.</p>\n<p align="left">\nViewing the complaint in that context, the court determined that Suders had raised genuine issues of material fact relating to her claim of constructive discharge.  <em>Id</em>., at 446.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals then made the ruling challenged here: It held that \xe2\x80\x9ca constructive discharge, when proved, constitutes a tangible employment action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 447.  Under <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>, the court observed, such an action renders an employer strictly liable and precludes employer recourse to the affirmative defense announced in those decisions.  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 447.  The Third Circuit recognized that the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Sixth Circuits had ruled otherwise.  A constructive discharge resulting from a supervisor-created hostile work environment, both Circuits had held, does not qualify as a tangible employment action, and therefore does not stop an employer from invoking the <em>Ellerth/Faragher</em> affirmative defense.  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 452\xe2\x80\x93453 (citing <em>Caridad </em>v. <em>Metro-North Commuter R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 191 F.\xc2\xa03d 283, 294 (CA2 1999), and <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Dowbrands, Inc</em>., No. 99\xe2\x80\x933984, 2000 WL 924599, *1 (CA6, June 26, 2000) (unpublished)).  The Third Circuit, however, reasoned that a constructive discharge \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98constitutes a significant change in employment status\xe2\x80\x99 by ending the employer-employee relationship\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9calso inflicts the same type of \xe2\x80\x98direct economic harm\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as the tangible employment actions <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> offered by way of example (discharge, demotion, undesirable reassignment).  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 460 (quoting <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U.

Satisfied that Suders had \xe2\x80\x9craised genuine issues of material fact as to her claim of constructive discharge,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the PSP was \xe2\x80\x9cprecluded from asserting the affirmative defense to liability advanced in support of its motion for summary judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals remanded Suders\xe2\x80\x99 Title VII claim for trial.  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 461.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1046/index.html">540 U. S. 1046</a> (2003), to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits on the question whether a constructive discharge brought about by supervisor harassment ranks as a tangible employment action and therefore precludes assertion of the affirmative defense articulated in <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>.  Compare 325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 461 (constructive discharge qualifies as a tangible employment action); <em>Jaros </em>v.<em> LodgeNet Entertainment Corp.</em>, 294 F.\xc2\xa03d 960, 966 (CA8 2002) (same), with <em>Caridad</em>, 191 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 294 (constructive discharge does not qualify as a tangible employment action); <em>Turner</em>, 2000 WL 924599, *1 (same), and <em>Reed </em>v. <em>MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc.</em>, 333 F.\xc2\xa03d 27, 33 (CA1 2003) (constructive discharge qualifies as a tangible employment action only when effected through a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s official act); <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Sappington</em>, 351 F.\xc2\xa03d 317, 336 (CA7 2003) (same).  We conclude that an employer does not have recourse to the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense when a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s official act precipitates the constructive discharge; absent such a \xe2\x80\x9ctangible employment action,\xe2\x80\x9d however, the defense is available to the employer whose supervisors are charged with harassment.

See 1 B. Lindemann &amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 838\xe2\x80\x93839 (3d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Lindemann &amp; Grossman).  The inquiry is objective: Did working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee\xe2\x80\x99s position would have felt compelled to resign?  See C. Weirich et\xc2\xa0al., 2002 Cumulative Supplement to Lindemann &amp; Grossman 651\xe2\x80\x93652, and n.\xc2\xa01 (collecting cases) (hereinafter Weirich).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The constructive discharge concept originated in the labor-law field in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s; the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) developed the doctrine to address situations in which employers coerced employees to resign, often by creating intolerable working conditions, in retaliation for employees\xe2\x80\x99 engagement in collective activities.

Over the next two decades, Courts of Appeals sustained NLRB constructive discharge rulings.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>East Texas Motor Freight Lines</em>, 140 F.\xc2\xa02d 404, 405 (CA5 1944) (first Circuit case to hold supervisor-caused resignation an unfair labor practice); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Saxe-Glassman Shoe Corp</em>., 201 F.\xc2\xa02d 238, 243 (CA1 1953) (first Circuit case to allow backpay award for constructive discharge).  By 1964, the year Title VII was enacted, the doctrine was solidly established in the federal courts.  See Comment, That\xe2\x80\x99s It, I Quit: Returning to First Principles in Constructive Discharge Doctrine, 23 Berkeley J. Emp. &amp; Lab. L. 401, 410 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals have recognized constructive discharge claims in a wide range of Title VII cases.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Robinson</em>, 351 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 336\xe2\x80\x93337 (sexual harassment); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>KUKA Welding Systems &amp; Robot Corp.</em>, 171 F.\xc2\xa03d 1073, 1080 (CA6 1999) (race); <em>Bergstrom-Ek </em>v. <em>Best Oil Co.</em>, 153 F.\xc2\xa03d 851, 858\xe2\x80\x93859 (CA8 1998) (pregnancy); <em>Amirmokri </em>v. <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec.

Larson, Labor and Employment Law \xc2\xa759.05[8] (2003) (collecting cases).  And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency charged with implementing Title VII, has stated: An employer \xe2\x80\x9cis responsible for a constructive discharge in the same manner that it is responsible for the outright discriminatory discharge of a charging party.\xe2\x80\x9d  EEOC Compliance Manual 612:0006 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although this Court has not had occasion earlier to hold that a claim for constructive discharge lies under Title VII, we have recognized constructive discharge in the labor-law context, see <em>Sure&amp;nbhyph;Tan, Inc.</em> v. <em>NLRB,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/883/index.html">467 U. S. 883</a>, 894 (1984) (NLRB may find employer engaged in unfair labor practice \xe2\x80\x9cwhen, for the purpose of discouraging union activity, \xe2\x80\xa6 [the employer] creates working conditions so intolerable that the employee has no option but to resign\xe2\x80\x94a so-called \xe2\x80\x98constructive discharge.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, we have stated that \xe2\x80\x9cTitle VII is violated by either explicit or constructive alterations in the terms or conditions of employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U.

We agree with the lower courts and the EEOC that Title VII encompasses employer liability for a constructive discharge.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns an employer\xe2\x80\x99s liability for one subset of Title VII constructive discharge claims: constructive discharge resulting from sexual harassment, or \xe2\x80\x9chostile work environment,\xe2\x80\x9d attributable to a supervisor.  Our starting point is the framework <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> established to govern employer liability for sexual harassment by supervisors.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  As earlier noted, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, those decisions delineate two categories of hostile work environment claims: (1) harassment that \xe2\x80\x9cculminates in a tangible employment action,\xe2\x80\x9d for which employers are strictly liable, <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 765; accord <em>Faragher</em>, 524 U. S., at 808, and (2) harassment that takes place in the absence of a tangible employment action, to which employers may assert an affirmative defense, <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 765; accord <em>Faragher</em>, 524 U. S., at 807.  With the background set out above in mind, we turn to the key issues here at stake: Into which <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>category do hostile-environment constructive discharge claims fall\xe2\x80\x94and what proof burdens do the parties bear in such cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>, the plaintiffs-employees sought to hold their employers vicariously liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors, even though the plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9csuffer[ed] no adverse, tangible job consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 747.  Setting out a framework for employer liability in those decisions, this Court noted that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s definition of  \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d includes the employer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cagent[s],\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e(b).  See <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 754.  We viewed that definition as a direction to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret Title VII based on agency principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Restatement (Second) of Agency (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), the Court noted, states (in its black-letter formulation) that an employer is liable for the acts of its agent when the agent \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 758 (quoting Restatement \xc2\xa7219(2)(d)); accord <em>Faragher</em>, 524 U. S., at 801.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We then identified \xe2\x80\x9ca class of cases where, beyond question, more than the mere existence of the employment relation aids in commission of the harassment: when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the subordinate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 760.  A tangible employment action, the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 761.  Unlike injuries that could equally be inflicted by a co-worker, we stated, tangible employment actions \xe2\x80\x9cfall within the special province of the supervisor,\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9chas been empowered by the company as \xe2\x80\xa6 [an] agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 762.  The tangible employment action, the Court elaborated, is, in essential character, \xe2\x80\x9can official act of the enterprise, a company act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  It is \xe2\x80\x9cthe means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Often, the supervisor will \xe2\x80\x9cuse [the company\xe2\x80\x99s] internal processes\xe2\x80\x9d and thereby \xe2\x80\x9cobtain the imprimatur of the enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ibid</em>.  Ordinarily, the tangible employment decision \xe2\x80\x9cis documented in official company records, and may be subject to review by higher level supervisors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In sum, we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against a subordinate[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 it would be implausible to interpret agency principles to allow an employer to escape liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 762\xe2\x80\x93763.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s harassment of a subordinate does not culminate in a tangible employment action, the Court next explained, it is \xe2\x80\x9cless obvious\xe2\x80\x9d that the agency relation is the driving force.  <em>Id</em>., at 763.  We acknowledged that a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpower and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character, and in this sense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But we also recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are acts of harassment a supervisor might commit which might be the same acts a coemployee would commit, and there may be some circumstances where the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s status [would] mak[e] little difference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An \xe2\x80\x9caided-by-the-agency-relation\xe2\x80\x9d standard, the Court suggested, was insufficiently developed to press into service as the standard governing cases in which no tangible employment action is in the picture.  Looking elsewhere for guidance, we focused on Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s design \xe2\x80\x9cto encourage the creation of antiharassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 764.  The Court reasoned that tying the liability standard to an employer\xe2\x80\x99s effort to install effective grievance procedures would advance Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose \xe2\x80\x9cto promote conciliation rather than litigation\xe2\x80\x9d of Title VII controversies.  <em>Ibid</em>.  At the same time, such linkage of liability limitation to effective preventive and corrective measures could serve Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s deterrent purpose by \xe2\x80\x9cencourag[ing] employees to report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Accordingly, we held that when no tangible employment action is taken, the employer may defeat vicarious liability for supervisor harassment by establishing, as an affirmative defense, both that \xe2\x80\x9cthe employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 765; accord <em>Faragher</em>, 524 U. S., at 807.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> also clarified the parties\xe2\x80\x99 respective proof burdens in hostile environment cases.  Title VII, the Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cborrows from tort law the avoidable consequences doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 764, under which victims have \xe2\x80\x9ca duty \xe2\x80\x98to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages\xe2\x80\x99 that result from violations of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Faragher</em>, 524 U. S., at 806 (quoting <em>Ford Motor Co.</em> v. <em>EEOC,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/219/index.html">458 U. S. 219</a>, 231, n. 15 (1982)).  The <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense accommodates that doctrine by requiring plaintiffs reasonably to stave off avoidable harm.  But both decisions place the burden squarely on the defendant to prove that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avoid or reduce harm.  <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 765; accord <em>Faragher</em>, 524 U. S., at 807; cf. C. McCormick, Law of Damages 130 (1935) (defendant has burden of persuading factfinder \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff could reasonably have reduced his loss or avoided injurious consequences\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The constructive discharge here at issue stems from, and can be regarded as an aggravated case of, sexual harassment or hostile work environment.  For an atmosphere of sexual harassment or hostility to be actionable, we reiterate, see <em>supra</em>, at 1, the offending behavior \xe2\x80\x9cmust be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\xe2\x80\x99s employment and create an abusive working environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Meritor,</em> 477 U. S., at 67 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  A hostile-environment constructive discharge claim entails something more: A plaintiff who advances such a compound claim must show working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Breeding </em>v. <em>Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co.</em>, 164 F.\xc2\xa03d 1151, 1160 (CA8 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]lthough there may be evidence from which a jury could find sexual harassment, \xe2\x80\xa6 the facts alleged [for constructive discharge must be] \xe2\x80\xa6 so intolerable that a reasonable person would be forced to quit.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Harris</em> <em>Chernin, Inc.</em>, 126 F.\xc2\xa03d 1010, 1015 (CA7 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]nless conditions are beyond \xe2\x80\x98ordinary\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination, a complaining employee is expected to remain on the job while seeking redress.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Suders\xe2\x80\x99 claim is of the same genre as the hostile work environment claims the Court analyzed in <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Essentially, Suders presents a \xe2\x80\x9cworse case\xe2\x80\x9d harassment scenario, harassment ratcheted up to the breaking point.  Like the harassment considered in our pathmarking decisions, harassment so intolerable as to cause a resignation may be effected through co-worker conduct, unofficial supervisory conduct, or official company acts.  Unlike an actual termination, which is <em>always</em> effected through an official act of the company, a constructive discharge need not be.  A constructive discharge involves both an employee\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave and precipitating conduct: The former involves no official action; the latter, like a harassment claim without any constructive discharge assertion, may or may not involve official action.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>24.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, a constructive discharge is functionally the same as an actual termination in damages-enhancing respects.  See <em>supra</em>, at 16, n.\xc2\xa08.  As the Third Circuit observed, both \xe2\x80\x9cen[d] the employer-employee relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d and both \xe2\x80\x9cinflic[t] \xe2\x80\xa6 direct economic harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 460 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But when an official act does not underlie the constructive discharge, the <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> analysis, we here hold, calls for extension of the affirmative defense to the employer.  As those leading decisions indicate, official directions and declarations are the acts most likely to be brought home to the employer, the measures over which the employer can exercise greatest control.  See <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 762.  Absent \xe2\x80\x9can official act of the enterprise,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., as the last straw, the employer ordinarily would have no particular reason to suspect that a resignation is not the typical kind daily occurring in the work force.  And as <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> further point out, an official act reflected in company records\xe2\x80\x94a demotion or a reduction in compensation, for example\xe2\x80\x94shows \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond question\xe2\x80\x9d that the supervisor has used his managerial or controlling position to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantage.  See <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 760.  Absent such an official act, the extent to which the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct has been aided by the agency relation, as we earlier recounted, see <em>supra</em>, at 13, is less certain.  That uncertainty, our precedent establishes, see <em>supra</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, justifies affording the employer the chance to establish, through the <em>Ellerth/Faragher</em> affirmative defense, that it should not be held vicariously liable.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit drew the line differently.  Under its formulation, the affirmative defense would be eliminated in all hostile-environment constructive discharge cases, but retained, as <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher </em>require, in \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d hostile work environment cases, <em>i.e.</em>, cases involving no tangible employment action.  That placement of the line, anomalously, would make the <em>graver</em> claim of hostile-environment constructive discharge <em>easier</em> to prove than its lesser included component, hostile work environment.  Moreover, the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s formulation, that court itself recognized, would make matters complex, indeed, more than a little confusing to jurors.  Creation of a hostile work environment is a necessary predicate to a hostile-environment constructive discharge case.  Juries would be so informed.  Under the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision, a jury, presumably, would be cautioned to consider the affirmative-defense evidence only in reaching a decision on the hostile work environment claim, and to ignore or at least downplay that same evidence in deciding the closely associated constructive discharge claim.  It makes scant sense thus to alter the decisive instructions from one claim to the next when the only variation between the two claims is the severity of the hostile working conditions.  Cf. <em>Faragher</em>, 524 U. S., at 801 (affirming \xe2\x80\x9cthe virtue of categorical clarity\xe2\x80\x9d).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note, finally, two recent Court of Appeals decisions that indicate how the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9ctangible employment action\xe2\x80\x9d) criterion should play out when constructive discharge is alleged.  Both decisions advance the untangled approach we approve in this opinion.  In <em>Reed </em>v. <em>MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc.</em>, 333 F.\xc2\xa03d 27 (CA1 2003), the plaintiff claimed a constructive discharge based on her supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s repeated sexual comments and an incident in which he sexually assaulted her.  The First Circuit held that the alleged wrongdoing did not preclude the employer from asserting the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense.  As the court explained in <em>Reed</em>, the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s behavior involved no official actions.  Unlike, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>e.g.</em>, an extremely dangerous job assignment to retaliate for spurned advances,\xe2\x80\x9d 333 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 33, the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in <em>Reed </em>\xe2\x80\x9cwas exceedingly unofficial and involved no direct exercise of company authority\xe2\x80\x9d; indeed, it was \xe2\x80\x9cexactly the kind of wholly unauthorized conduct for which the affirmative defense was designed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  In contrast, in <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Sappington</em>, 351 F.\xc2\xa03d 317 (CA7 2003), after the plaintiff complained that she was sexually harassed by the judge for whom she worked, the presiding judge decided to transfer her to another judge, but told her that \xe2\x80\x9cher first six months [in the new post] probably would be \xe2\x80\x98hell,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that it was in her \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98best interest to resign.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 324.  The Seventh Circuit held that the employer was precluded from asserting the affirmative defense to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s constructive discharge claim.  The <em>Robinson </em>plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s decision to resign, the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cresulted, at least in part, from [the presiding judge\xe2\x80\x99s] official actio[n] in transferring\xe2\x80\x9d her to a judge who resisted placing her on his staff.  <em>Id</em>., at 337.  The courts in <em>Reed </em>and <em>Robinson</em> properly recognized that <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>, which divided the universe of supervisor-harassment claims according to the presence or absence of an official act, mark the path constructive discharge claims based on harassing conduct must follow.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its summation, the Third Circuit qualified its holding that a constructive discharge itself \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutes a tangible employment action within the meaning of <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 462.  The affirmative defense <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> delineated, the court said, might be imported into the anterior issue whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe employee\xe2\x80\x99s decision to resign was reasonable under the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 462.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  As the Third Circuit expressed its thinking:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t may be relevant to a claim of constructive discharge whether an employer had an effective remedial scheme in place, whether an employer attempted to investigate, or otherwise to address, plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaints, and whether plaintiff took advantage of alternatives offered by antiharassment programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThese considerations, the Third Circuit recognized, \xe2\x80\x9care, of course, the same considerations relevant to the affirmative defense in <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit left open when and how the <em>Ellerth/Faragher</em> considerations would be brought home to the fact trier.  It did not address specifically the allocation of pleading and persuasion burdens.  It simply relied on \xe2\x80\x9cthe wisdom and expertise of trial judges to exercise their gatekeeping authority when assessing whether all, some, or none of the evidence relating to employers\xe2\x80\x99 antiharassment programs and to employees\xe2\x80\x99 exploration of alternative avenues warrants introduction at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 463.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We see no cause for leaving the district courts thus unguided.  Following <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em>, the plaintiff who alleges no tangible employment action has the duty to mitigate harm, but the defendant bears the burden to allege and prove that the plaintiff failed in that regard.  See <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  The plaintiff might elect to allege facts relevant to mitigation in her pleading or to present those facts in her case in chief, but she would do so in anticipation of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative defense, not as a legal requirement.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with the Third Circuit that the case, in its current posture, presents genuine issues of material fact concerning Suders\xe2\x80\x99 hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  We hold, however, that the Court of Appeals erred in declaring the affirmative defense described in <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> never available in constructive discharge cases.

SUDERS<br/>\n542 U.

See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  In light of this specific focus, the NLRB requires employees to establish two elements to prove a constructive discharge.  First, the employer must impose burdens upon the employee that \xe2\x80\x9ccause, and [are] intended to cause, a change in his working conditions so difficult or unpleasant as to force him to resign.  Second, it must be shown that those burdens were imposed because of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s union activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crystal Princeton Refining Co.</em>, 222 N.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0B. 1068, 1069 (1976).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the constructive discharge concept was first imported into Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, some courts imposed similar requirements.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Muller</em> v. <em>United States Steel Corp.</em>, 509 F.\xc2\xa02d 923, 929 (CA10 1975) (requiring a showing that \xe2\x80\x9can employer deliberately render[ed] the employee\xe2\x80\x99s working conditions intolerable and thus force[d] him to quit his job\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, because the Court had not yet recognized the hostile work environment cause of action, the first successful Title VII constructive discharge claims typically involved adverse employment actions.  See, <em>Muller</em>, <em>supra</em> (denial of job promotion); <em>Derr</em> v. <em>Gulf Oil Corp.</em>, 796 F.\xc2\xa02d 340, 344 (CA10 1986) (demotion).  If, in order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must prove that his employer subjected him to an adverse employment action with the specific intent of forcing the employee to quit, it makes sense to attach the same legal consequences to a constructive discharge as to an actual discharge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has now adopted a definition of constructive discharge, however, that does not in the least resemble actual discharge.  The Court holds that to establish \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive discharge,\xe2\x80\x9d a plaintiff must \xe2\x80\x9cshow that the abusive working environment became so intolerable that [the employee\xe2\x80\x99s] resignation qualified as a fitting response.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  Under this rule, it is possible to allege a constructive discharge absent any adverse employment action.  Moreover, a majority of Courts of Appeals have declined to impose a specific intent or reasonable foreseeability requirement.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Brooks</em> v. <em>City of San Mateo</em>, 229 F.\xc2\xa03d 917, 930 (CA9 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]onstructive discharge occurs when the working conditions deteriorate, as a result of discrimination, to the point that they become sufficiently extraordinary and egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent, diligent, and reasonable employee to remain on the job to earn a livelihood and to serve his or her employer\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, as it is currently conceived, a \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive\xe2\x80\x9d discharge does not require a \xe2\x80\x9ccompany act[] that can be performed only by the exercise of specific authority granted by the employer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html">524 U. S. 742</a>, 768 (1998) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (<em>i.e., </em>an adverse employment action), nor does it require that the act be undertaken with the same purpose as an actual discharge.  Under these circumstances, it no longer makes sense to view a constructive discharge as equivalent to an actual discharge.  Instead, as the Court points out, a constructive discharge is more akin to \xe2\x80\x9can aggravated case of \xe2\x80\xa6 sexual harassment or hostile work environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  And under this \xe2\x80\x9chostile work environment plus\xe2\x80\x9d framework, the proper standard for determining employer liability is the same standard for hostile work environment claims that I articulated in <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em>, <em>supra</em>.  \xe2\x80\x9cAn employer should be liable if, and only if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negligent in permitting the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct to occur.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 767.  If a supervisor takes an adverse employment action because of sex that directly results in the constructive discharge, the employer is vicariously liable.  <em>Id.,</em> at 768.  But, where the alleged constructive discharge results only from a hostile work environment, an employer is liable if negligent.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because respondent has not adduced sufficient evidence of an adverse employment action taken because of her sex, nor has she proffered any evidence that petitioner knew or should have known of the alleged harassment, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
