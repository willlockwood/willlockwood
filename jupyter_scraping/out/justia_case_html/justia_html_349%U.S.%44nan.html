We held in <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/672/case.html">347 U. S. 672</a></span>, that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="45">Page 349 U. S. 45</a></p><p> such a sale and transportation cannot be regulated by a State, but are subject to the exclusive regulation of the Federal Power Commission.  The <em>Phillips</em> case therefore controls this one.  We disagree with the contention of the appellees that <em>Cities Service Gas Co. v. Peerless Oil and Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/179/case.html">340 U. S. 179</a></span>, and <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/190/case.html">340 U. S. 190</a></span>, are applicable here.  In those cases, we were dealing with constitutional questions, and not the construction of the Natural Gas Act.  The latter question was specifically not passed upon in those cases.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, being of opinion that State regulation of price is permissible until the Federal price regulation permitted by <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/672/case.html">347 U. S. 672</a></span>, is imposed, dissents.  MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n<p>* Together with No. 321, <em>Natural Gas Pipeline Co. v. Corporation Commission of Oklahoma et al.,</em> also on appeal from the same court, argued March 29, 1955.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
