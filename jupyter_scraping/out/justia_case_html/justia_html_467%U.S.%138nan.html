North Dakota\'s Enabling Act provides that all Indian land "shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of Congress."  Petitioner Indian Tribe, which had not accepted state civil jurisdiction under Chapter 27-19, employed respondent Wold Engineering (hereafter respondent) to design and build a water supply system on petitioner\'s reservation in North Dakota.  When the project was completed, it did not perform to petitioner\'s satisfaction, and petitioner sued respondent in a North Dakota state court for negligence and breach of contract.  At the time suit was filed, petitioner\'s tribal court did not have jurisdiction over a claim by an Indian against a non-Indian in the absence of an agreement by the parties.  Although the subject matter of petitioner\'s complaint was within the general scope of the state court\'s jurisdiction, that court granted respondent\'s motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over any claim arising in Indian country, including a claim by an Indian against a non-Indian.  The North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed.  Interpreting Chapter 27-19 to disclaim state court jurisdiction over a claim against a non-Indian by an Indian tribe that had not accepted jurisdiction under the statute, the court determined that the North Dakota Legislature had disclaimed jurisdiction pursuant to the federal statute (Pub.L. 280) governing state jurisdiction over Indian country and that such disclaimer, because it had been authorized by Pub.L. 280, did not violate either the North Dakota or Federal Constitution.  The court rejected petitioner\'s argument that the jurisdiction that it had recognized in <em>Vermillion v. Spotted Elk,</em> 85 N.W.2d 432 wherein it was held that the existing jurisdictional disclaimers in the State\'s Enabling Act and Constitution foreclosed civil jurisdiction over Indian country only in cases involving interests in Indian lands themselves -- had not been extinguished altogether, and that the North Dakota courts possessed "residuary jurisdiction" over a claim by an Indian against a non-Indian following the enactment of Pub.L. 280 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which amended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 467 U.

Public Law 280 does not either require North Dakota to disclaim the basic jurisdiction recognized in <em>Vermillion</em> or authorize it to do so.

The case, as it comes to us, is somewhat unusual in a central respect:  the Tribe seeks, rather than contests, state court jurisdiction, and the non-Indian party is in opposition.  <em>Cf. Williams v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/case.html">358 U. S. 217</a></span> (1959).</p>\n<p>Chapter 27-19 of the North Dakota Century Code (1974) is entitled "Indian Civil Jurisdiction."  Section 27-19-01 of that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 467 U. S. 141</a></p><p> Code provides that the jurisdiction of North Dakota courts shall extend "over all civil causes of action which arise on an Indian reservation upon acceptance by Indian citizens."  In this case, the Supreme Court of North Dakota interpreted Chapter 27-19 to disclaim state court jurisdiction over a claim (against a non-Indian) by an Indian Tribe that had not accepted jurisdiction under the statute.  The court determined that the North Dakota Legislature had disclaimed jurisdiction pursuant to the principal federal statute governing state jurisdiction over Indian country, namely, the Act of Aug. 15, 1953, 67 Stat. 588, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1360, commonly known as Pub.L. 280.  The court further concluded that the jurisdictional disclaimer, inasmuch as it was authorized by Pub.L. 280, did not run afoul of the North Dakota or Federal Constitutions.  Because the North Dakota Supreme Court\'s interpretation of Chapter 27-19 and its accompanying constitutional analysis appear to us to rest on a possible misunderstanding of Pub.L. 280, we vacate the court\'s judgment and remand the case to allow reconsideration of the jurisdictional questions in the light of what we feel is the proper meaning of the federal statute.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>A. Petitioner Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation is a federally recognized Indian Tribe with its reservation in northwestern North Dakota.  Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 543, \xc2\xa7 23, 26 Stat. 1032.  <em>See City of New Town v. United States,</em> 454 F.2d 121 (CA8 1972).  In 1974, petitioner employed respondent Wold Engineering, P. C. (hereafter respondent), a North Dakota corporation, to design and build the Four Bears Water System Project, a water supply system located wholly within the reservation.  The project was completed in 1977, but it did not perform to petitioner\'s satisfaction.</p>\n<p>In 1980, petitioner sued respondent in a North Dakota state court for negligence and breach of contract.  At the time the suit was filed, petitioner\'s tribal court did not have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="142">Page 467 U. S. 142</a></p><p> jurisdiction over a claim by an Indian against a non-Indian in the absence of an agreement by the parties.  Tribal Code, ch. II, \xc2\xa7 1(a). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The subject matter of petitioner\'s complaint, however, clearly fell within the scope of the state trial court\'s general jurisdiction.  <em>See</em> N.D.Const., Art. VI, \xc2\xa7 8; N.D.Cent.Code \xc2\xa7 27-05-06 (1974 and Supp.1983).  After counterclaiming for petitioner\'s alleged failure to complete its payments on the water supply system, respondent moved to dismiss petitioner\'s complaint on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over any claim arising in Indian country.</p>\n<p>B. At this point, in order to place respondent\'s jurisdictional argument in perspective, it is desirable to review the somewhat erratic course of federal and state law governing North Dakota\'s jurisdiction over the State\'s Indian reservations.  Long before North Dakota became a State, this Court had recognized the general principle that Indian territories were beyond the legislative and judicial jurisdiction of state governments.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/515/case.html">Worcester v. Georgia,</a></span></em> 6 Pet. 515 (1832); <em>see generally Williams v. Lee,</em> 358 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/case.html#218">358 U. S. 218</a></span>-222.  That principle was reflected in the federal statute that granted statehood to North Dakota.  Like many other other States in the Midwest and West, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] North Dakota was required to "disclaim all right and title . . . to all lands lying within [the State] owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes" as a condition for admission to the Union.  Enabling Act of Feb. 22, 1889, \xc2\xa7 4, cl. 2, 25 Stat. 677.  The Act further provided that all such Indian land shall</p>\n<p>"remain subject to the disposition of the United States, and . . . shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United </p><p><a class="page-number" name="143">Page 467 U. S. 143</a></p><p> States."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> North Dakota\'s original Constitution contained, in identical terms, the required jurisdictional disclaimers.  <em>See</em> N.D. Const., Art. XVI, \xc2\xa7 203, cl. 2 (1889).</p>\n<p>Federal restrictions on North Dakota\'s jurisdiction over Indian country, however, were substantially eliminated in 1953 with the enactment of the aforementioned Pub.L. 280.  <em>See generally Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html">439 U. S. 463</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html#471">439 U. S. 471</a></span>-474 (1979). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Sections 2 and 4 of Pub.L. 280 gave five States full jurisdiction, with a stated minor exception as to each of two States, over civil and criminal actions involving Indians and arising in Indian country.  67 Stat. 588-589, codified, as amended, at 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1162 and 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1360, respectively.  Sections 6 and 7 gave all other States the option of assuming similar jurisdiction.  Section 6 authorized States whose constitutions and statutes contained federally imposed jurisdictional restraints, like North Dakota\'s, to amend their laws to assume jurisdiction.  67 Stat. 590, codified, as amended, at 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1324.  Section 7 provided similar federal consent to any other State not having civil and criminal jurisdiction, but required such States to assume jurisdiction through "affirmative legislative action."  67 Stat. 590.  As originally enacted, Pub.L. 280 did not require States to obtain the consent of affected Indian tribes before assuming jurisdiction over them.  Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 amended Pub.L. 280, however, to require that all subsequent assertions of jurisdiction be preceded by tribal consent.  Pub.L. 90-284, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 401, 402, 406, 82 Stat. 78-80, codified at 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1321, 1322, 1326.</p>\n<p>Even before North Dakota moved to amend its Constitution and assume full jurisdiction under Pub.L. 280, the North Dakota Supreme Court had taken an expansive view of the scope of state court jurisdiction over Indians in Indian </p><p><a class="page-number" name="144">Page 467 U. S. 144</a></p><p> country.  In 1957, the court held that the existing jurisdictional disclaimers in the Enabling Act and the State\'s Constitution foreclosed civil jurisdiction over Indian country only in cases involving interests in Indian lands themselves.  <em>Vermillion v. Spotted Elk,</em> 85 N.W.2d 432.  The following year, 1958, North Dakota amended its Constitution to authorize its legislature to "provid[e] for the acceptance of such jurisdiction [over Indian country] as may be delegated to the State by Act of Congress."  N.D. Const., Art. XIII, \xc2\xa7 1, cl. 2.  Finally, in 1963, the North Dakota Legislature enacted Chapter 27-19, the principal section of which provides:</p>\n<p>"In accordance with the provisions of Public Law 280 . . . and [the amended] North Dakota constitution, jurisdiction of the state of North Dakota shall be extended over all civil causes of action which arise on an Indian reservation upon acceptance by Indian citizens in a manner provided by this chapter.  Upon acceptance the jurisdiction of the state shall be to the same extent that the state has jurisdiction over other civil causes of action, and those civil laws of this state that are of general application to private property shall have the same force and effect within such Indian reservation or Indian country as they have elsewhere within this state."</p>\n<p>N.D.Cent.Code \xc2\xa7 27-19-01 (1974).</p>\n<p>On their face, both the 1958 amendment to the North Dakota Constitution and Chapter 27-19 appear to expand preexisting state jurisdiction over Indian country, rather than to contract it.  In <em>In re Whiteshield,</em> 124 N.W.2d 694 (1963), however, the North Dakota Supreme Court reached the conclusion that Chapter 27-19 actually disclaimed all jurisdiction over claims arising in Indian country absent Indian consent.  In subsequent decisions, that court adhered to its general view that, without Indian consent, "the State has no jurisdiction over any civil cause arising on an Indian reservation in this State."  <em>White Eagle v. Dorgan,</em> 209 N.W.2d 621, 623 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="145">Page 467 U. S. 145</a></p><p> (1973). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In each case in which the North Dakota Supreme Court declined to recognize jurisdiction, however, the defendant was an Indian; the court never had held squarely that an Indian could not maintain an action against a non-Indian in state court for a claim arising in Indian country. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>C. Respondent\'s motion to dismiss rested on the restrictive jurisdictional principles of <em>Whiteshield</em> and its successors.  Because the petitioner Tribe at no point has consented to state court jurisdiction under Chapter 27-19 over the Fort Berthold Reservation, respondent argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over petitioner\'s claim under Chapter 27-19 and the amended provisions of Pub.L. 280.  Petitioner opposed respondent\'s motion to dismiss on the ground, <em>inter alia,</em> that the tribal consent requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 were not meant to apply to a suit brought by a tribal government like petitioner.  The trial court rejected petitioner\'s arguments and granted the motion to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction, but did so without prejudice to a renewal of the action following compliance with the state and federal consent requirements.  App. to Pet. for Cert. la.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed.  321 N.W.2d 510 (1982).  Petitioner argued that the jurisdiction recognized in <em>Vermillion</em> had not been extinguished altogether, and that the North Dakota courts possessed "residuary jurisdiction" over a claim by an Indian against a non-Indian following the enactment of Pub.L. 280 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968.  The court rejected this argument, adhering instead to its conclusion in <em>Nelson v. Dubois,</em> 232 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="146">Page 467 U. S. 146</a></p><p> N.W.2d 54 (1975), that any residuary jurisdiction was preempted by the tribal consent requirements contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1968.  After reviewing the history of North Dakota\'s jurisdiction over Indian country, the court reaffirmed its prior holdings, observing that</p>\n<p>"we have no jurisdiction over civil causes of action arising within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation, unless the Indian citizens of the reservation vote to accept jurisdiction."</p>\n<p>321 N.W.2d at 512.</p>\n<p>The court also rejected petitioner\'s argument that to prohibit an Indian plaintiff from suing a non-Indian in state court for a claim arising on an Indian reservation would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and deny petitioner equal access to the courts, in violation of the North Dakota Constitution. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The court relied on <em>Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html">439 U. S. 463</a></span> (1979), in which this Court rejected an equal protection challenge to a state jurisdictional statute that relied on tribal classifications.  In <em>Yakima Indian Nation,</em> the Court held that the unique legal status of Indian tribes under federal law permitted the Federal Government to single out tribal Indians in ways that otherwise might be unconstitutional, and that the state jurisdictional statute at issue there was insulated from strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, because it was enacted under the authority of Pub.L. 280.  439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html#499">439 U.

The North Dakota Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<p>"Likewise, the people of North Dakota and the legislature were acting under explicit authority granted by Congress in the exercise of its federal power over Indians when our Constitution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="147">Page 467 U.

Respondent advances two arguments in support of the North Dakota Supreme Court\'s conclusion that state court jurisdiction no longer extends so far.  The first is that federal law precludes the state courts from asserting jurisdiction over petitioner\'s claim.  The second is that, regardless of federal law, the North Dakota Supreme Court has held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction as a matter of state law.   We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Although this Court has departed from the rigid demarcation of state and tribal authority laid down in 1832 in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/515/case.html">Worcester v. Georgia,</a></span></em> 6 Pet. 515, the assertion of state authority over tribal reservations remains subject to "two independent but related barriers."  <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v.

We do not believe that either of these barriers precludes North Dakota courts from entertaining a civil action by an Indian tribe against a non-Indian for a claim arising on an Indian reservation.\n</em></p>\n<p>Despite respondent\'s arguments, we fail to see how the exercise of state court jurisdiction in this case would interfere with the right of tribal Indians to govern themselves under their own laws.  To be sure, the full breadth of state court jurisdiction recognized in <em>Vermillion</em> cannot be squared with principles of tribal autonomy; to the extent that <em>Vermillion</em> permitted North Dakota state courts to exercise jurisdiction over claims by non-Indians against Indians or over claims between Indians, it intruded impermissibly on tribal self-governance.  <em>See Fisher v.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The interests implicated in such cases are very different from those present in <em>Williams v. Lee,</em> where a non-Indian sued an Indian in state court for debts incurred in Indian country, or in <em>Fisher v. District Court,</em> where this Court held that a tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction over an adoption proceeding in which all parties were tribal Indians residing on a reservation.  As a general matter, tribal self-government is not impeded when a State allows an Indian to enter its courts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="149">Page 467 U. S. 149</a></p><p> on equal terms with other persons to seek relief against a non-Indian concerning a claim arising in Indian country.  The exercise of state jurisdiction is particularly compatible with tribal autonomy when, as here, the suit is brought by the tribe itself and the tribal court lacked jurisdiction over the claim at the time the suit was instituted.</p>\n<p>Neither are we persuaded that the exercise of state jurisdiction here would be inconsistent with the federal and tribal interests reflected in North Dakota\'s Enabling Act or in Pub.L. 280.  As for the disclaimer provisions of the Enabling Act, the presence or absence of specific jurisdictional disclaimers rarely has had controlling significance in this Court\'s past decisions about state jurisdiction over Indian affairs or activities on Indian lands.  <em>Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html">463 U. S. 545</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html#562">463 U. S. 562</a></span> (1983); <em>see</em> F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 268 (1982 ed.). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In this case, the sparse legislative record suggests only that the Enabling Act\'s phrase "absolute [congressional] jurisdiction and control" was meant to foreclose state regulation and taxation of Indians and their lands, not that Indians were to be prohibited from entering state courts to pursue judicial remedies against non-Indians.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 1025, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., 8-9, 24 (1888).  To the extent that the disclaimer language of the Enabling Act may be regarded as ambiguous, moreover, it is a settled principle of statutory construction that statutes passed for the benefit of dependent Indian tribes are to be liberally construed, with doubtful expressions being resolved in favor of the Indians.  <em>See, e.g., Bryan v. Itasca County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/373/case.html">426 U. S. 373</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/373/case.html#392">426 U. S. 392</a></span> (1976); <em>Alaska Pacific Fisheries v.

It would be contrary to this principle to resolve any ambiguity in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="150">Page 467 U. S. 150</a></p><p> language of the Enabling Act in favor of a construction under which North Dakota could not provide a judicial forum for an Indian to obtain relief against a non-Indian.</p>\n<p>We also cannot subscribe to the view that Pub.L. 280 either required North Dakota to disclaim the basic jurisdiction recognized in <em>Vermillion</em> or authorized it to do so.  This Court previously has recognized that Pub.L. 280 was intended to facilitate, rather than to impede, the transfer of jurisdictional authority to the States.  <em>Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation,</em> 439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html#490">439 U. S. 490</a></span>; <em>see also Bryan v. Itasca County,</em> 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/373/case.html#383">426 U. S. 383</a></span>-390.  Nothing in the language or legislative history of Pub.L. 280 indicates that it was meant to divest States of preexisting and otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Section 6 of the federal statute authorized a State whose enabling Act and constitution contained jurisdictional disclaimers "to remove any legal impediment to the <em>assumption</em> of civil and criminal jurisdiction" (emphasis added).  67 Stat. 590, codified, as amended, at 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1324.  Similarly, \xc2\xa7 7 gave congressional consent to the assumption of jurisdiction by any other State "not having jurisdiction."  67 Stat. 590.  By their terms, therefore, both \xc2\xa7 6 and \xc2\xa7 7 were designed to eliminate obstacles to the assumption of jurisdiction, rather than to require preexisting jurisdiction to be disclaimed.  Although the Civil Rights Act of 1968 amended Pub.L. 280 by adding tribal consent requirements, those requirements were not made retroactive; [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] the 1968 amendments therefore did not displace jurisdiction previously </p><p><a class="page-number" name="151">Page 467 U. S. 151</a></p><p> assumed under Pub.L. 280, much less jurisdiction assumed prior to and apart from Pub.L. 280.  Similarly, while Pub.L. 280 authorized States to assume partial, rather than full, civil jurisdiction, <em>see Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation,</em> 439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html#493">439 U. S. 493</a></span>-499, nothing in Pub.L. 280 purports to authorize States to disclaim preexisting jurisdiction.  Indeed, the Civil Rights Act of 1968 granted States the authority to retrocede jurisdiction acquired under Pub.L. 280 precisely because Pub.L. 280 itself did not authorize such jurisdictional disclaimers. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>In sum, then, no federal law or policy required the North Dakota courts to forgo the jurisdiction recognized in <em>Vermillion</em> in this case.  If the North Dakota Supreme Court\'s jurisdictional ruling is to stand, it must be shown to rest on state, rather than federal, law.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>This Court concededly has no authority to revise the North Dakota Supreme Court\'s interpretation of state jurisdictional law.  Only last Term, in <em>Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe, supra,</em> we noted that,</p>\n<p>"to the extent that a claimed bar to state jurisdiction . . . is premised on the respective State Constitutions, that is a question of state law over which the state courts have binding authority."</p>\n<p>463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/545/case.html#561">463 U. S. 561</a></span>.  That principle is equally applicable, of course, with respect to jurisdictional bars grounded in state statutes.  If the North Dakota Supreme Court\'s decision that the trial court lacked jurisdiction in this case rested solely on state law, the only remaining issue before this Court would be petitioner\'s argument </p><p><a class="page-number" name="152">Page 467 U. S. 152</a></p><p> that the jurisdictional disclaimer here violates petitioner\'s federal constitutional rights. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>It is equally well established, however, that this Court retains a role when a state court\'s interpretation of state law has been influenced by an accompanying interpretation of federal law.  In some instances, a state court may construe state law narrowly to avoid a perceived conflict with federal statutory or constitutional requirements.  <em>See, e.g., United Air Lines, Inc. v. Mahin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/623/case.html">410 U. S. 623</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/623/case.html#630">410 U.

Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/26/case.html">353 U. S. 26</a></span> (1957).  In others, in contrast, the state court may construe state law broadly in the belief that federal law poses no barrier to the exercise of state authority.  <em>See, e.g., Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/481/case.html">316 U. S. 481</a></span> (1942).  In both categories of cases, this Court has reviewed the federal question on which the state law determination appears to have been premised.  If the state court has proceeded on an incorrect perception of federal law, it has been this Court\'s practice to vacate the judgment of the state court and remand the case so that the court may reconsider the state law question free of misapprehensions about the scope of federal law. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="153">Page 467 U. S. 153</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Here, a careful reading of the North Dakota Supreme Court\'s opinion leaves us far from certain that the court\'s present interpretation of Chapter 27-19 does not rest on a misconception of federal law.  In determining the role played by that court\'s understanding of federal law, we are guided by the jurisdictional principles that have come to govern our calculation of adequate and independent state grounds.  In <em>Michigan v. Long,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/case.html">463 U. S. 1032</a></span> (1983), this Court ruled that</p>\n<p>"when . . . a state court decision fairly appears . . . to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion, we will accept as the most reasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the way it did because it believed that federal law required it to do so."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/case.html#1040">463 U. S. 1040</a></span>-1041.  Although petitioner\'s constitutional challenge to the North Dakota Supreme Court\'s judgment means that we do not face a question of our own jurisdiction, <em>see Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson,</em> 316 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/481/case.html#482">316 U. S. 482</a></span>-483, we believe that the same general interpretive principles properly apply here.  The North Dakota Supreme Court\'s opinion does state that the North Dakota Legislature "totally disclaimed jurisdiction over civil causes of action arising on an Indian reservation," but it adds that the legislature did so "pursuant to Public Law 280," "[u]nder the authority of Public Law 280," and "under explicit authority granted by Congress in the exercise of its federal power over Indians."  321 N.W.2d at 511, 513.  There are at least two respects in which these references and other language in the court\'s opinion leave it far less than clear that the North Dakota </p><p><a class="page-number" name="154">Page 467 U. S. 154</a></p><p> Supreme Court\'s interpretation of Chapter 27-19 was not influenced by its understanding of federal law.</p>\n<p>First, the court\'s treatment of petitioner\'s constitutional claims strongly suggests that the court\'s underlying interpretation of Chapter 27-19 would have been different if the court had realized from the outset that federal law does not insulate the present jurisdictional disclaimer from state and federal constitutional scrutiny.  While we express no view about the merits of petitioner\'s federal equal protection challenge, we note that the North Dakota Supreme Court rejected petitioner\'s state and federal constitutional claims not because it viewed them as otherwise meritless, but because</p>\n<p>"the people of North Dakota and the legislature were acting under explicit authority granted by Congress in the exercise of its federal power over Indians"</p>\n<p>in disclaiming state jurisdiction.  321 N.W.2d at 513.  The court had proceeded on a similar assumption before; in <em>Gourneau v. Smith,</em> 207 N.W.2d 256 (1973), for example, the court rejected an Indian plaintiff\'s jurisdictional claim based on the "open courts" provision of N.D. Const. Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, because the tribal consent requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 were taken to foreclose jurisdiction:</p>\n<p>"The courts of the State of North Dakota are open to all persons.  But . . . Federal law prohibits State courts from assuming jurisdiction of civil actions involving Indians which arise on an Indian reservation, until such time as the Indians of that reservation have consented to such jurisdiction.  Thus the courts of the State of North Dakota are open to Indians, if they consent to the courts\' jurisdiction as provided by law."</p>\n<p>207 N.W.2d at 259.  The assumption that Pub.L. 280 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 either authorized North Dakota to disclaim jurisdiction or affirmatively forbade the exercise of jurisdiction absent tribal consent is incorrect, for the reasons given above.  That assumption, however, appears to have been the sole basis relied on by the North Dakota Supreme Court to avoid </p><p><a class="page-number" name="155">Page 467 U. S. 155</a></p><p> holding the jurisdictional disclaimer unconstitutional as applied in this case.  Because the North Dakota Supreme Court has adhered consistently to the policy of construing state statutes to avoid potential state and federal constitutional problems, <em>see, e.g., State v. Kottenbroch,</em> 319 N.W.2d 465, 473 (1982); <em>Paluck v. Board of County Comm\'rs,</em> 307 N.W.2d 852, 856 (1981); <em>Grace Lutheran Church v. North Dakota Employment Security Bureau,</em> 294 N.W.2d 767, 772 (1980); <em>North American Coal Corp. v. Huber,</em> 268 N.W.2d 593, 596 (1978); <em>Tang v. Ping,</em> 209 N.W.2d 624, 628 (1973), it is entirely possible that the court would have avoided any constitutional question by construing Chapter 27-19 not to disclaim jurisdiction here, and it is equally possible that the court will reconstrue Chapter 27-19 that way if it is given an opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p>Second, the manner in which the court rejected the availability of "residuary jurisdiction" leaves open the possibility that, despite the court\'s references to state law, the court regarded federal law as an affirmative bar to the exercise of jurisdiction here.  The court stated:</p>\n<p>"In essence, [petitioner] argues that North Dakota retained residuary jurisdiction over actions brought by Indians against non-Indians for civil wrongs committed on Indian lands. . . .  That argument would be more convincing had the legislature of North Dakota not, pursuant to Public Law 280, totally disclaimed jurisdiction over civil causes of action arising on an Indian reservation.  <em>In re Whiteshield,</em> 124 N.W.2d 694 (N.D.1963).  In <em>Nelson v. Dubois,</em> 232 N.W.2d 54 (N.D.1975), . . . <em>we rejected the concept of \'residuary\' jurisdiction. We adhere to that decision today.</em>"</p>\n<p>321 N.W.2d at 511 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The court\'s reliance on <em>Nelson v. Dubois</em> is suggestive, because <em>Dubois</em> itself turned aside an attempt to invoke state court jurisdiction over Indian country on the ground that federal law barred the exercise of jurisdiction.  Specifically, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="156">Page 467 U. S. 156</a></p><p> the court held that it did not have "residuary jurisdiction" over a suit by non-Indians against Indians, even if the exercise of jurisdiction were assumed not to infringe on tribal self-governance under <em>Williams v. Lee,</em> because the tribal consent provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 preempted any exercise of state jurisdiction except in accordance with the terms of that Act.  232 N.W.2d at 57-59.  The court recognized that its holding deprived the plaintiffs of any forum for their suit, but added:</p>\n<p>"The solution to this most serious problem lies not with the State.  Congress may amend its statutes; Indian tribes of this State may begin to assert their own jurisdiction.  This State cannot exercise jurisdiction that it does not possess."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 59. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>As noted above, the Civil Rights Act of 1968 in no way bars the exercise of jurisdiction in this case.  The court\'s reliance on <em>Nelson v. Dubois</em> to dismiss petitioner\'s jurisdictional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="157">Page 467 U. S. 157</a></p><p> claim suggests, however, that the court was proceeding on a contrary premise.  In that event, it may well have adopted a restrictive interpretation of Chapter 27-19 to avoid a perceived conflict between state and federal jurisdictional mandates. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  By the same token, <em>Nelson v. Dubois</em> itself suggests that the court might recognize some measure of "residuary jurisdiction" here but for the mistaken belief that a federal jurisdictional impediment exists.  Because we cannot exclude this possibility with any degree of confidence, the prudent course is to give the North Dakota Supreme Court an opportunity to express its views on Chapter 27-19, and thereby</p>\n<p>"avoid the risk of \'an affirmance of a decision which might have been decided differently if the court below had felt free, under our decisions, to do so.\'"</p>\n<p><em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. Mahin,</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/623/case.html#632">410 U. S. 632</a></span>, quoting <em>Perkins v.

Were we not to give the North Dakota Supreme Court an opportunity to reconsider its conclusions with the proper understanding of federal law, we would be required to decide whether North Dakota has denied petitioner equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment by excluding it from state courts in a circumstance in which a non-Indian would be allowed to maintain a suit.  It is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint, however, that this Court will not reach constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/173/case.html">443 U.

If the North Dakota Supreme Court reinterprets Chapter 27-19 to permit petitioner to maintain its claim in the state courts, or if it concludes that Chapter 27-19 violates the State\'s Constitution insofar as it bars jurisdiction in this case, neither that court nor this one will be required finally to reach petitioner\'s federal constitutional challenge.  Under these circumstances, our responsibility to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication demands that we resolve any uncertainty over the North Dakota Supreme Court\'s decision in favor of the possibility that it was influenced by a misunderstanding of federal law.

The court also once stated flatly that "Indians have the right to sue non-Indians in State courts."  <em>Rolette County v.

If the court\'s misunderstanding of Pub.L. 280 in fact did not contribute to its interpretation of state law, the court is free to reinstate its former judgment on remand.  <em>See, e.g., United Air Lines, Inc. v.

In contrast, if the court\'s understanding of federal law did play a role in its interpretation of Chapter 27-19 but we were to proceed on a contrary assumption, we would be depriving petitioner of a judicial forum that the North Dakota Supreme Court would make available if only it were given another opportunity to address the issue.  When the cost of erring in one direction is so negligible and the cost of erring in the other is so great, we think that uncertainty about the federal basis for the state law decision properly is resolved in favor of the conclusion that federal law played a material role.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The highest state court in North Dakota has made a decision on the scope of state court jurisdiction, a decision based on a state statute passed following amendment of the State Constitution.  The question is clearly one of state law, immune from our review except in so far as it might be preempted by federal law or in conflict with the United States Constitution.  The Court today does not say that Chapter 27-19, as interpreted by the North Dakota Supreme Court, is preempted by federal law.  Nor does the Court find that statute unconstitutional.  Yet the Court vacates the judgment below because Pub.L. 280 neither "authorized" nor "required" any disclaimer of preexisting state jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>I do not disagree with the Court\'s essay on the purpose and effect of Pub.L. 280.  But I fail to see its relevance to the state law issues decided by the court below.  Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the North Dakota court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="160">Page 467 U. S. 160</a></p><p> because the only federal question actually before us -- the constitutionality of North Dakota\'s refusal to exercise jurisdiction over a lawsuit brought by an Indian tribe -- is insubstantial.</p>\n<p>In  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#147">467 U. S. </a></span> the Court argues that state court jurisdiction over this case would have been proper, as a matter of both federal and North Dakota law, prior to the passage of Pub.L. 280, and that nothing in Pub.L. 280 should have changed that situation.  In Part  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#151">467 U. S. </a></span> the Court parlays the eclipse of this "residual jurisdiction" into a reason for concluding that the North Dakota Supreme Court may have misunderstood Pub.L. 280 when it interpreted Chapter 27-19.  The linchpin of the entire argument is the 1957 case of <em>Vermillion v. Spotted Elk,</em> 85 N.W.2d 432, in which the North Dakota court took an expansive view of the scope of state court jurisdiction over suits by and against Indians in Indian country.  The Court today correctly states that the jurisdiction claimed in <em>Vermillion</em> -- over all civil actions arising in Indian country, except those involving interests in Indian lands -- would embrace this case.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#147">467 U. S. 147</a></span>. B ut the argument for residual jurisdiction which the Court constructs around <em>Vermillion</em> is wholly untenable for the simple reason that the expansive jurisdiction of <em>Vermillion</em> was discredited, two years after it was claimed, by our decision in <em>Williams v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/case.html">358 U. S. 217</a></span> (1959).</p>\n<p>Both the specific holding and the broad dictum of <em>Vermillion</em> were preempted by <em>Williams v. Lee.</em> [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The North Dakota court exercised jurisdiction in <em>Vermillion</em> over a suit arising out of a car accident on an Indian reservation in which all the parties were reservation Indians.  The principles of tribal autonomy recognized in <em>Williams v. Lee</em> clearly preclude </p><p><a class="page-number" name="161">Page 467 U. S. 161</a></p><p> such an intrusion into strictly tribal affairs without affirmative legislative action pursuant to Pub.L. 280.  <em>See Fisher v. District Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/382/case.html">424 U. S. 382</a></span> (1976).  And the expansive claim made in <em>Vermillion</em> to jurisdiction over all civil actions arising in Indian country, except those involving interests in Indian lands, cannot be squared with the requirement that such jurisdiction be assumed by legislative action pursuant to Pub.L. 280.</p>\n<p>In short, at the time Chapter 27-19 was passed, four years after <em>Williams v. Lee, Vermillion</em> was not in any sense good law.  The "lawfully assumed jurisdiction," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#150">467 U. S. 150</a></span>, which the Court thinks must have survived both Pub.L. 280 and Chapter 27-19, was in fact unlawfully assumed, and therefore invalid.  The fact that Chapter 27-19 appears to expand state jurisdiction over Indian country, rather than to contract it, must be understood not in light of <em>Vermillion,</em> but in light of the intervening, superseding decision of this Court in <em>Williams v. Lee.</em>  The North Dakota Legislature was effectively starting from "square one" in asserting jurisdiction over civil actions in Indian country when it passed Chapter 27-19.  Thus, since the assumption of jurisdiction in Chapter 27-19 was predicated on tribal consent, which has not been forthcoming, the North Dakota Supreme Court could naturally and properly conclude that there was no state court jurisdiction in this case. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court glosses over this obvious difficulty in its argument by simply recasting <em>Vermillion</em> to fit its needs.</p>\n<p>"To be sure, the full breadth of state court jurisdiction recognized in <em>Vermillion</em> cannot be squared with principles of tribal autonomy; to the extent that <em>Vermillion</em> permitted North Dakota state courts to exercise jurisdiction over claims by non-Indians against Indians or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="162">Page 467 U. S. 162</a></p><p> over claims between Indians, it intruded impermissibly on tribal self-governance. . . .  This Court, however, repeatedly has approved the exercise of jurisdiction by state courts over claims by Indians against non-Indians, even when those claims arose in Indian country."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">467 U. S. 148</span>.</p>\n<p>In accordance with its view of what the North Dakota courts could have done compatibly with federal law, the Court proceeds to treat <em>Vermillion</em> as if it had, in fact, only claimed jurisdiction over suits by Indians against non-Indians.  Thus, the Court says that nothing in Pub.L. 280 "required North Dakota to disclaim the basic jurisdiction recognized in <em>Vermillion</em> or authorized it to do so," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#150">467 U. S. 150</a></span>, and that "no federal law or policy required the North Dakota courts to forgo the jurisdiction recognized in <em>Vermillion</em> in this case," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#151">467 U. S. 151</a></span>.  The Court even refers to the jurisdiction of <em>Vermillion</em> as "otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#150">467 U. S. 150</a></span>.</p>\n<p>I must confess to being nonplussed by the Court\'s treatment of <em>Vermillion.</em>  It seems strange, indeed, to suppose that <em>Vermillion</em> is in some sense good law -- when neither its holding nor its reasoning is acceptable under federal law -- merely because the opinion would be acceptable if it had been written altogether differently and reached an opposite result.  The fact remains that it was not written differently, and did not reach the opposite result.</p>\n<p>The North Dakota court improperly tried to assert jurisdiction over all civil actions arising in Indian country, except those involving interests in Indian lands.  That attempt having failed, there is no indication that North Dakota would have accepted the one-way jurisdiction sought by petitioner in this case, whereby Indians can sue non-Indians, but not vice versa.  And the fact that our cases would have permitted the assumption of such jurisdiction is simply beside the point.  Nothing in the Enabling Act, the State Constitution, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="163">Page 467 U. S. 163</a></p><p> or Pub.L. 280 compelled North Dakota to grant Indians the right to sue non-Indians in state court in situations where non-Indians could not sue Indians.  And it is sheer speculation to suppose that the State would have done so. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Without <em>Vermillion,</em> the Court\'s argument in Part  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#151">467 U. S. </a></span>  For without some sort of plausible "residual jurisdiction" that would cover this case, Pub.L. 280 constitutes an affirmative bar to the assumption of jurisdiction by the North Dakota court.  Any jurisdiction over Indian country assumed by an option State following passage of Pub.L. 280 must be assumed in accordance with the requirements of Pub.L. 280.  It must be assumed, that is, by affirmative legislative action; state courts are powerless to act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="164">Page 467 U. S. 164</a></p><p> on their own initiative.  As we stated in <em>Kennerly v. District Court of Montana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/423/case.html">400 U. S. 423</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/423/case.html#427">400 U. S. 427</a></span> (1971):</p>\n<p>"[T]he requirement of affirmative legislative action [was not] an idle choice of words; the legislative history of the 1953 statute shows that the requirement was intended to assure that state jurisdiction would not be extended until the jurisdictions to be responsible for the portion of Indian country concerned manifested by political action their willingness and ability to discharge their new responsibilities. "</p>\n<p>North Dakota took affirmative legislative action in passing Chapter 27-19, but conditioned its assumption of jurisdiction on tribal consent.  Since that consent has not been forthcoming, North Dakota has not assumed any additional jurisdiction over Indian country under Pub.L. 280.  <em>See Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html">439 U.

North Dakota courts therefore have no authority to unilaterally augment their jurisdiction by entertaining suits either by or against Indians in actions arising on Indian lands.  <em>Fisher v.

The North Dakota court, in fact, shows a perfectly clear appreciation of both the purpose and effect of Pub.L. 280.</p>\n<p>"The purpose of Public Law 280 was to facilitate the transfer of jurisdictional responsibility to the states.  <em>Washington v.

S. 150</a></span>, reads like a paraphrase of the above passage.</p>\n<p>The North Dakota court never even remotely implies that Pub.L. 280 "required" the State to eliminate any preexisting, lawfully assumed jurisdiction.  The focus is rather on the passage of Chapter 27-19 by the state legislature.  <em>See</em> <l=|467 138fn2="" 3|="" u.s.="">n. 3, <em>supra.</em>  And as to whether the court may have mistakenly thought that Pub.L. 280 "authorized" such a disclaimer of jurisdiction by the State, I cannot see how that question is relevant at all.  Either a disclaimer of preexisting jurisdiction was forbidden by federal law or it was not.  If not, and </l=|467></p><p><a class="page-number" name="166">Page 467 U. S. 166</a></p><p> the majority does not imply that it was, then there is no additional requirement that it be affirmatively sanctioned.  A State is not obliged to play "Mother, may I" with the Federal Government before retroceding jurisdiction that, under our cases, could have been retained.</p>\n<p>In my view, therefore, the only federal question presented in this case is whether North Dakota\'s failure to permit Indians to sue non-Indians in circumstances under which non-Indians could not sue Indians violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  After our decision in <em>Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, supra,</em> that question is not a substantial one.  <em>See</em> <l=|467 138fn2="" 5|="" u.s.="">n. 5, <em>supra.</em>  Access to the North Dakota courts is within the power of petitioner.  The Tribe need merely consent to the full civil jurisdiction which North Dakota, pursuant to Pub.L. 280, stands ready to offer them.  Petitioner wants to enjoy the full benefits of the state courts as plaintiff without ever running the risk of appearing as defendant.  The Equal Protection Clause mandates no such result.</l=|467></p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Williams,</em> a non-Indian who operated a store on an Indian reservation in Arizona sued an Indian couple to collect goods sold to them on credit.  We held that principles of tribal autonomy precluded the Arizona courts from entertaining the suit in the absence of an affirmative assumption of jurisdiction by the state legislature.  358 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/case.html#222">358 U.

Yakima Indian Nation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html">439 U. S. 463</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html#495">439 U.

As noted, the jurisdiction claimed in <em>Vermillion</em> under state law was invalid under <em>Williams v. Lee</em> as preempted by federal law.  That same jurisdiction was also disclaimed as a matter of state law by the passage of Chapter 27-19.  <em>See</em> 321 N.W.2d 510, 511 (N.D.1982).</p>\n<p>Chapter 27-19 provides that</p>\n<p>"jurisdiction of the state of North Dakota shall be extended over all civil causes of action which arise on an Indian reservation upon acceptance by Indian citizens in a manner provided by this chapter."</p>\n<p>N.D.Cent.Code \xc2\xa7 27-19-01 (1974).  A later provision excepts from this jurisdiction suits involving interests in Indian lands.  \xc2\xa7 27-19-08.  Thus, the jurisdiction which North Dakota stands ready to accept under Chapter 27-19 is exactly coterminous with that claimed in <em>Vermillion.</em></p>\n<p>If <em>Vermillion</em> had been good law, Chapter 27-19 would have been entirely superfluous.  Following the passage of Chapter 27-19, therefore, the North Dakota court could reasonably conclude that the legislature had disclaimed (<em>i.e.,</em> renounced any claim to) the jurisdiction wrongfully usurped in <em>Vermillion</em> except on consent of the affected tribes.  And the fact that the court concluded that all the jurisdiction of <em>Vermillion</em> had been disclaimed indicates that, as a matter of state law, the court views the jurisdiction of <em>Vermillion</em> as an all-or-nothing, reciprocal proposition.  Again, it is irrelevant that our cases would have permitted the State to assert one-sided, residual jurisdiction.  The State was not obliged to accept the invitation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>For this reason, the Court\'s reliance on <em>Nelson v. Dubois,</em> 232 N.W.2d 54 (N.D.1975), and <em>Schantz v. White Lightning,</em> 231 N.W.2d 812 (N.D.1975), <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#155">467 U. S. 155</a></span>-156, and n. 14, for the proposition that the North Dakota Supreme Court may have misread federal law is misplaced.  Insofar as North Dakota has not already assumed lawful jurisdiction over suits arising in Indian country, either prior to Pub.L. 280 or pursuant to the terms of that statute, federal law does act "as an affirmative bar to the exercise of jurisdiction here," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#155">467 U. S. 155</a></span>.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Obviously, if Pub.L. 280 would preclude a judicial assumption of jurisdiction in this case, then the North Dakota Supreme Court properly disposed of petitioner\'s equal protection argument with a simple citation to <em>Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation,</em> 439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/463/case.html#500">439 U.

It would also follow that the lower court\'s handling of the equal protection claim does not, as the Court would have it, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/case.html#154">467 U.
