He valued his California home at $363,348, claiming that $75,000 of that value was covered by California\xe2\x80\x99s homestead exemption and thus was exempt from the bankruptcy estate.  See\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(A).  He also claimed that the sum of two voluntary liens\xe2\x80\x94one of which was in favor of \xe2\x80\x9cLin\xe2\x80\x99s Mortgage &amp; Associates\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94exceeded the home\xe2\x80\x99s nonexempt value, leaving no equity recoverable for his other creditors.  Respondent Siegel, the bankruptcy estate trustee, challenged the \xe2\x80\x9cLin\xe2\x80\x9d lien in an adversary proceeding, but protracted and expensive litigation ensued when a supposed \xe2\x80\x9cLili Lin\xe2\x80\x9d in China claimed to be the beneficiary of Law\xe2\x80\x99s deed of trust.  Ultimately, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that the loan was a fiction created by Law to preserve his equity in the house.  It thus granted Siegel\xe2\x80\x99s motion to \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge\xe2\x80\x9d Law\xe2\x80\x99s $75,000 homestead exemption, making those funds available to defray attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred by Siegel in overcoming Law\xe2\x80\x99s fraudulent misrepresentations.  The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court exceeded the limits of its authority when it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law\xe2\x80\x99s homestead exemption be made available to pay Siegel\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.

The surcharge thus exceeded the limits of both the court\xe2\x80\x99s authority under \xc2\xa7105(a) and its inherent powers.

But insofar as that argument equates the surcharge with an outright denial of Law\xe2\x80\x99s homestead exemption, it founders on this case\xe2\x80\x99s procedural history.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel recognized that because no one timely objected to the homestead exemption, it became final before the surcharge was imposed.  And a trustee who fails to make a timely objection cannot challenge an exemption.  Taylor v. Freeland &amp; Kronz,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 638\n\xe2\x80\x93644.  Assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have revisited Law\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to the exemption, \xc2\xa7522 specifies the criteria that render property exempt, and a court may not refuse to honor a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of an exemption without a valid statutory basis.  Federal courts may apply state law to disallow state-created exemptions, but federal law itself provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemption on a ground not specified in the Code.

Citizens Bank nor its dictum points toward a different result.  There, the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s bad faith kept him from converting his bankruptcy from a Chapter 7 liquidation to a Chapter 13 reorganization as permitted by \xc2\xa7706(a).  But that was because his conduct prevented him from qualifying under Chapter 13, and thus he could not satisfy \xc2\xa7706(d), which expressly conditions conversion on the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to qualify under Chapter 13.

It further provides that exempt assets generally are not liable for any expenses associated with administering the estate.  In this case, we consider whether a bankruptcy court nonetheless may order that a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s exempt assets be used to pay administrative expenses incurred as a result of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I. Background</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code gives an insolvent debtor the opportunity to discharge his debts by liquidating his assets to pay his creditors.  11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7704(a)(1), 726, 727.  The filing of a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 7 creates a bankruptcy \xe2\x80\x9cestate\xe2\x80\x9d generally comprising all of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s property.  \xc2\xa7541(a)(1).  The estate is placed under the control of a trustee, who is responsible for managing liquidation of the estate\xe2\x80\x99s assets and distribution of the proceeds.  \xc2\xa7704(a)(1).  The Code authorizes the debtor to \xe2\x80\x9cexempt,\xe2\x80\x9d however, certain kinds of property from the estate, enabling him to retain those assets postbankruptcy.  \xc2\xa7522(b)(1).  Except in particular situations specified in the Code, exempt property \xe2\x80\x9cis not liable\xe2\x80\x9d for the payment of \xe2\x80\x9cany [prepetition] debt\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cany administrative expense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7522(c), (k).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 522(d) of the Code provides a number of exemptions unless they are specifically prohibited by state law.  \xc2\xa7522(b)(2), (d).  One, commonly known as the \xe2\x80\x9chomestead exemption,\xe2\x80\x9d protects up to $22,975 in equity in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s residence.  \xc2\xa7522(d)(1) and note following \xc2\xa7522; see Owen v. Owen,\n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305,\n310 (1991)\n.  The debtor may elect, however, to forgo the \xc2\xa7522(d) exemptions and instead claim whatever exemptions are available under applicable state or local law.  \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(A).  Some States provide homestead exemptions that are more generous than the federal exemption; some provide less generous versions; but nearly every State provides some type of homestead exemption.  See L\xc3\xb3pez, State Homestead Exemptions and Bankruptcy Law: Is It Time for Congress To Close the Loophole? 7 Rutgers Bus. L.\xc2\xa0J. 143, 149\xe2\x80\x93165 (2010) (listing state exemptions).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioner, Stephen Law, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004, and respondent, Alfred H. Siegel, was appointed to serve as trustee.  The estate\xe2\x80\x99s only significant asset was Law\xe2\x80\x99s house in Hacienda Heights, California.  On a schedule filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Law valued the house at $363,348 and claimed that $75,000 of its value was covered by California\xe2\x80\x99s homestead exemption.  See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7704.730(a)(1) (West Supp. 2014).  He also reported that the house was subject to two voluntary liens: a note and deed of trust for $147,156.52 in favor of Washington Mutual Bank, and a second note and deed of trust for $156,929.04 in favor of \xe2\x80\x9cLin\xe2\x80\x99s Mortgage &amp; Associates.\xe2\x80\x9d  Law thus represented that there was no equity in the house that could be recovered for his other creditors, because the sum of the two liens exceeded the house\xe2\x80\x99s nonexempt value.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        If Law\xe2\x80\x99s representations had been accurate, he presumably would have been able to retain the house, since Siegel would have had no reason to pursue its sale.  Instead, a few months after Law\xe2\x80\x99s petition was filed, Siegel initiated an adversary proceeding alleging that the lien in favor of \xe2\x80\x9cLin\xe2\x80\x99s Mortgage &amp; Associates\xe2\x80\x9d was fraudulent.  The deed of trust supporting that lien had been recorded by Law in 1999 and reflected a debt to someone named \xe2\x80\x9cLili Lin.\xe2\x80\x9d  Not one but two individuals claiming to be Lili Lin ultimately responded to Siegel\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  One, Lili Lin of Artesia, California, was a former acquaintance of Law\xe2\x80\x99s who denied ever having loaned him money and described his repeated efforts to involve her in various sham transactions relating to the disputed deed of trust.  That Lili Lin promptly entered into a stipulated judgment disclaiming any interest in the house.  But that was not the end of the matter, because the second \xe2\x80\x9cLili Lin\xe2\x80\x9d claimed to be the true beneficiary of the disputed deed of trust.  Over the next five years, this \xe2\x80\x9cLili Lin\xe2\x80\x9d managed\xe2\x80\x94despite supposedly living in China and speaking no English\xe2\x80\x94to engage in extensive and costly litigation, including several appeals, contesting the avoidance of the deed of trust and Siegel\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent sale of the house.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, in 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cno person named Lili Lin ever made a loan to [Law] in exchange for the disputed deed of trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  In\xc2\xa0re Law, 401 B.\xc2\xa0R. 447, 453 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.).  The court found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe loan was a fiction, meant to preserve [Law\xe2\x80\x99s] equity in his residence beyond what he was entitled to exempt\xe2\x80\x9d by perpetrating \xe2\x80\x9ca fraud on his creditors and the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  With regard to the second \xe2\x80\x9cLili Lin,\xe2\x80\x9d the court declared itself \xe2\x80\x9cunpersuaded that Lili Lin of China signed or approved any declaration or pleading purporting to come from her.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Rather, it said, the \xe2\x80\x9cmost plausible conclusion\xe2\x80\x9d was that Law himself had \xe2\x80\x9cauthored, signed, and filed some or all of these papers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  It also found that Law had submitted false evidence \xe2\x80\x9cin an effort to persuade the court that Lili Lin of China\xe2\x80\x94rather than Lili Lin of Artesia\xe2\x80\x94was the true holder of the lien on his residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 452.  The court determined that Siegel had incurred more than $500,000 in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees overcoming Law\xe2\x80\x99s fraudulent misrepresentations.  It therefore granted Siegel\xe2\x80\x99s motion to \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge\xe2\x80\x9d the entirety of Law\xe2\x80\x99s $75,000 homestead exemption, making those funds available to defray Siegel\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed.  BAP No. CC\xe2\x80\x9309\xe2\x80\x931077\xe2\x80\x93PaMkH, 2009 WL 7751415 (Oct. 22, 2009) (\xc2\xa0per curiam).  It held that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings regarding Law\xe2\x80\x99s fraud were not clearly erroneous and that the court had not abused its discretion by surcharging Law\xe2\x80\x99s exempt assets.  It explained that in Latman v. Burdette, 366 F. 3d 774 (2004), the Ninth Circuit had recognized a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9cequitably surcharge a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s statutory ex-emptions\xe2\x80\x9d in exceptional circumstances, such as \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a debtor engages in inequitable or fraudulent conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  2009 WL 7751415, *5, *7.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel acknowledged that the Tenth Circuit had disagreed with Latman, see In\xc2\xa0re Scrivner, 535 F.\xc2\xa03d 1258, 1263\xe2\x80\x931265 (2008), but the panel affirmed that Latman was correct.  2009 WL 7751415, *7, n.\xc2\xa010.  Judge Markell filed a concurring opinion agreeing with the panel\xe2\x80\x99s application of Latman but questioning \xe2\x80\x9cwhether Latman remains good policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  2009 WL 7751415, *10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In\xc2\xa0re Law, 435 Fed. Appx. 697 (2011) (\xc2\xa0per curiam).  It held that the surcharge was proper because it was \xe2\x80\x9ccalculated to compensate the estate for the actual monetary costs imposed by the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct, and was warranted to protect the integrity of the bankruptcy process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 698.

Analysis</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        A bankruptcy court has statutory authority to \xe2\x80\x9cissue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of\xe2\x80\x9d the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7105(a).

Citizens Bank of Mass.,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 365\n\xe2\x80\x93376 (2007).

Section 105(a) confers authority to \xe2\x80\x9ccarry out\xe2\x80\x9d the provisions of the Code, but it is quite impossible to do that by taking action that the Code prohibits.  That is simply an application of the axiom that a statute\xe2\x80\x99s general permission to take actions of a certain type must yield to a specific prohibition found elsewhere.  See Morton v. Mancari,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 535\n\xe2\x80\x93551 (1974); D. Ginsberg &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

We have long held that \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever equitable powers remain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be exercised within the confines of\xe2\x80\x9d the Bankruptcy Code.  Norwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 197,\n206 (1988)\n; see, e.g., Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 15\n\xe2\x80\x9325 (2000); United States v.

We conclude that it did.  Section 522 (by reference to California law) entitled Law to exempt $75,000 of equity in his home from the bankruptcy estate.  \xc2\xa7522(b)(3)(A).

In doing so, the court exceeded the limits of its authority under \xc2\xa7105(a) and its inherent powers.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Siegel does not dispute the premise that a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7105(a) and inherent powers may not be exercised in contravention of the Code.  Instead, his main argument is that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s surcharge did not contravene \xc2\xa7522.  That statute, Siegel contends, \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[es] the procedure by which a debtor may seek to claim exemptions\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9ccontains no directive requiring [courts] to allow [an exemption] regardless of the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 35.  Thus, he says, recognition of an equitable power in the Bankruptcy Court to deny an exemption by \xe2\x80\x9csurcharging\xe2\x80\x9d the exempt property in response to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct can coexist comfortably with \xc2\xa7522.  The United States, appearing in support of Siegel, agrees, arguing that \xc2\xa7522 \xe2\x80\x9cneither gives debtors an absolute right to retain exempt property nor limits a court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to impose an equitable surcharge on such property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Insofar as Siegel and the United States equate the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s surcharge with an outright denial of Law\xe2\x80\x99s homestead exemption, their arguments founder upon this case\xe2\x80\x99s procedural history.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel stated that because no one \xe2\x80\x9ctimely oppose[d] [Law]\xe2\x80\x99s homestead exemption claim,\xe2\x80\x9d the exemption \xe2\x80\x9cbecame final\xe2\x80\x9d before the Bankruptcy Court imposed the surcharge.  2009 WL 7751415, at *2.  We have held that a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make a timely objection prevents him from challenging an exemption.  Taylor v. Freeland &amp; Kronz,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 638\n\xe2\x80\x93644 (1992).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But even assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have revisited Law\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to the exemption, \xc2\xa7522 does not give courts discretion to grant or withhold exemptions based on whatever considerations they deem appropriate.  Rather, the statute exhaustively specifies the criteria that will render property exempt.  See \xc2\xa7522(b), (d).  Siegel insists that because \xc2\xa7522(b) says that the debtor \xe2\x80\x9cmay exempt\xe2\x80\x9d certain property, rather than that he \xe2\x80\x9cshall be entitled\xe2\x80\x9d to do so, the court retains discretion to grant or deny exemptions even when the statutory criteria are met.  But the subject of \xe2\x80\x9cmay exempt\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7522(b) is the debtor, not the court, so it is the debtor in whom the statute vests discretion.  A debtor need not invoke an exemption to which the statute entitles him; but if he does, the court may not refuse to honor the exemption absent a valid statutory basis for doing so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, \xc2\xa7522 sets forth a number of carefully calibrated exceptions and limitations, some of which relate to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct.  For example, \xc2\xa7522(c) makes exempt property liable for certain kinds of prepetition debts, including debts arising from tax fraud, fraud in connection with student loans, and other specified types of wrongdoing.  Section 522(o) prevents a debtor from claiming a homestead exemption to the extent he acquired the homestead with nonexempt property in the previous 10 years \xe2\x80\x9cwith the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor.\xe2\x80\x9d  And \xc2\xa7522(q) caps a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s homestead exemption at approximately $150,000 (but does not eliminate it en-tirely) where the debtor has been convicted of a felony that shows \xe2\x80\x9cthat the filing of the case was an abuse of the provisions of\xe2\x80\x9d the Code, or where the debtor owes a debt arising from specified wrongful acts\xe2\x80\x94such as securities fraud, civil violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or \xe2\x80\x9cany criminal act, intentional tort, or willful or reckless misconduct that caused serious physical injury or death to another individualin the preceding 5 years.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7522(q) and note following\xc2\xa7522.  The Code\xe2\x80\x99s meticulous\xe2\x80\x94not to say mind-numbingly detailed\xe2\x80\x94enumeration of exemptions and exceptions to those exemptions confirms that courts are not authorized to create additional exceptions.  See Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 12); TRW Inc. v. Andrews,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19\n\xe2\x80\x9329 (2001).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Siegel points out that a handful of courts have claimed authority to disallow an exemption (or to bar a debtor from amending his schedules to claim an exemption, which is much the same thing) based on the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s fraudulent concealment of the asset alleged to be exempt.  See, e.g., In\xc2\xa0re Yonikus, 996 F.\xc2\xa02d 866, 872\xe2\x80\x93873 (CA7 1993); In\xc2\xa0re Doan, 672 F.\xc2\xa02d 831, 833 (CA11 1982) (\xc2\xa0per curiam); Stewart v. Ganey, 116 F.\xc2\xa02d 1010, 1011 (CA5 1940).  He suggests that those decisions reflect a general, equitable power in bankruptcy courts to deny exemptions based on a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s bad-faith conduct.  For the reasons we have given, the Bankruptcy Code admits no such power.  It is of course true that when a debtor claims a state-created exemption, the exemption\xe2\x80\x99s scope is determined by state law, which may provide that certain types of debtor misconduct warrant denial of the exemption.  E.g., In\xc2\xa0re Sholdan, 217 F.\xc2\xa03d 1006, 1008 (CA8 2000); see 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb6522.08[1]\xe2\x80\x93[2], at 522\xe2\x80\x9345 to 522\xe2\x80\x9347.  Some of the early decisions on which Siegel relies, and which the Fifth Circuit cited in Stewart, are instances in which federal courts applied state law to disallow state-created exemptions.  See In\xc2\xa0re Denson, 195 F. 857, 858 (ND Ala. 1912); Cowan v. Burchfield, 180 F. 614, 619 (ND Ala. 1910); In\xc2\xa0re Ansley Bros., 153 F. 983, 984 (EDNC 1907).  But federal law provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemption on a ground not specified in the Code.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our decision in Marrama v. Citizens Bank, on which Siegel and the United States heavily rely, does not point toward a different result.  The question there was whether a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s bad-faith conduct was a valid basis for a bankruptcy court to refuse to convert the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy from a liquidation under Chapter 7 to a reorganization under Chapter 13.  Although \xc2\xa7706(a) of the Code gave the debtor a right to convert the case, \xc2\xa7706(d) \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly conditioned\xe2\x80\x9d that right on the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cability to qualify as a \xe2\x80\x98debtor\xe2\x80\x99 under Chapter 13.\xe2\x80\x9d  549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 372.  And \xc2\xa71307(c) provided that a proceeding under Chapter 13 could be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause,\xe2\x80\x9d which the Court interpreted to authorize dismissal or conversion for bad-faith conduct.  In light of \xc2\xa71307(c), the Court held that the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s bad faith could stop him from qualifying as a debtor under Chapter 13, thus preventing him from satisfying \xc2\xa7706(d)\xe2\x80\x99s express condition on conversion.  Id., at 372\xe2\x80\x93373.  That holding has no relevance here, since no one suggests that Law failed to satisfy any express statutory condition on his claiming of the homestead exemption.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        True, the Court in Marrama also opined that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to convert the case was authorized under \xc2\xa7105(a) and might have been authorized under the court\xe2\x80\x99s inherent powers.  Id., at 375\xe2\x80\x93376.  But even that dictum does not support Siegel\xe2\x80\x99s position.  In Marrama, the Court reasoned that if the case had been converted to Chapter 13, \xc2\xa71307(c) would have required it to be either dismissed or reconverted to Chapter 7 in light of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s bad faith.  Therefore, the Court suggested, even if the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to convert the case had not been expressly authorized by \xc2\xa7706(d), that action could have been justified as a way of providing a \xe2\x80\x9cprompt, rather than a delayed, ruling on [the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s] unmeritorious at-tempt to qualify\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71307(c).  Id., at 376.  At most, Marrama\xe2\x80\x99s dictum suggests that in some circumstances a bankruptcy court may be authorized to dispense with futile procedural niceties in order to reach more expeditiously an end result required by the Code.  Marrama most certainly did not endorse, even in dictum, the view that equitable considerations permit a bankruptcy court to contravene express provisions of the Code.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We acknowledge that our ruling forces Siegel to shoulder a heavy financial burden resulting from Law\xe2\x80\x99s egregious misconduct, and that it may produce inequitable results for trustees and creditors in other cases.  We have recognized, however, that in crafting the provisions of \xc2\xa7522, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress balanced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schwab v. Reilly,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 770,\n791 (2010)\n.  The same can be said of the limits imposed on recovery of administrative expenses by trustees.  For the reasons we have explained, it is not for courts to alter the balance struck by the statute.  Cf. Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund,\n\n493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 365\n\xe2\x80\x93377 (1990).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our decision today does not denude bankruptcy courts of the essential \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to respond to debtor misconduct with meaningful sanctions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17.  There is ample authority to deny the dishonest debtor a discharge.  See \xc2\xa7727(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(6).  (That sanction lacks bite here, since by reason of a postpetition settlement between Siegel and Law\xe2\x80\x99s major creditor, Law has no debts left to discharge; but that will not often be the case.)  In addition, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Pro-cedure 9011\xe2\x80\x94bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x99s analogue to Civil Rule 11\xe2\x80\x94authorizes the court to impose sanctions for bad-faith litigation conduct, which may include \xe2\x80\x9can order directing payment.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of some or all of the reasonable attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011(c)(2).  The court may also possess further sanctioning authority under either \xc2\xa7105(a) or its inherent powers.  Cf. Chambers, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 45\xe2\x80\x9349.  And because it arises postpetition, a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s monetary sanction survives the bankruptcy case and is thereafter enforceable through the normal procedures for collecting money judgments.  See \xc2\xa7727(b).  Fraudulent conduct in a bankruptcy case may also subject a debtor to criminal prosecution under\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7152, which carries a maximum penalty of five years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But whatever other sanctions a bankruptcy court may impose on a dishonest debtor, it may not contravene express provisions of the Bankruptcy Code by ordering that the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s exempt property be used to pay debts and expenses for which that property is not liable under the Code.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The second sentence of \xc2\xa7105(a) adds little to the analysis.
