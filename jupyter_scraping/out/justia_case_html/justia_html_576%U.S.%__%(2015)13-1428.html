The judge permitted the prosecution to disclose its reasons for the strikes outside the presence of the defense and concluded that the prosecution had valid, race-neutral reasons for the strikes.  Ayala was eventually convicted and sentenced to death.  On appeal, the California Supreme Court analyzed Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s challenge under both <i>Batson</i> and its state-law analogue, concluding that it was error, as a matter of state law, to exclude Ayala from the hearings.  The court held, however, that the error was harmless under state law and that, if a federal error occurred, it too was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <i>Chapman</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 18\n.  Ayala subsequently pressed his claims in federal court.  There, the District Court held that even if the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> proceedings violated federal law, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s harmlessness finding could not be overturned because it was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under 28  U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).  A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit disagreed and granted Ayala habeas relief.  The panel majority held that the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> proceedings violated Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s federal constitutional rights and that the error was not harmless under <i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abrahamson</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 619\n, as to at least three of the seven prospective jurors.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Any federal constitutional error that may have occurred by excluding Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s attorney from part of the <i>Batson</i> hearing was harmless.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a) Even assuming that Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s federal rights were violated, he is entitled to habeas relief only if the prosecution cannot demonstrate harmlessness.  <i>Glebe </i>v. <i>Frost</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Under <i>Brecht</i>, federal habeas petitioners \xe2\x80\x9care not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in \xe2\x80\x98actual prejudice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637.  Because Ayala seeks federal habeas corpus relief, he must meet the <i>Brecht</i> standard, but that does not mean, as the Ninth Circuit thought, that a state court\xe2\x80\x99s harmlessness determination has no significance under <i>Brecht</i>.  The <i>Brecht </i>standard subsumes the requirements that \xc2\xa72254(d) imposes when a federal habeas petitioner contests a state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that a constitutional error was harmless under <i>Chapman</i>.  <i>Fry</i> v. <i>Pliler</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 112\n.  But <i>Brecht</i> did not abrogate the limitation on federal habeas relief that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 plainly sets out.  There is no dispute that the California Supreme Court held that any federal error was harmless under <i>Chapman</i>, and this decision was an \xe2\x80\x9cadjudication on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d of Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Accordingly, a federal court cannot grant Ayala relief unless the state court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of his claim was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.

As the trial court and State Supreme Court found, the record amply supports the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s concerns, and Ayala cannot establish that the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte </i>hearing prejudiced him.  The Ninth Circuit misunderstood the role of a federal court in a habeas case.  That role is not to conduct <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> review of factual findings and substitute the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s own opinions for the determination made on the scene by the trial judge. Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The prosecution stated that it struck Gerardo O., a Hispanic man, because he had a poor grasp of English, his answers suggested an unwillingness to impose the death penalty, and he did not appear to get along with other jurors.  Each of these reasons was amply supported by the record, and there is no basis for finding that the absence of defense counsel affected the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of the strike.  Ayala cannot establish that the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> hearing actually prejudiced him or that no fairminded jurist could agree with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <i>Chapman</i>.  Once again, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision was based on a misapplication of basic rules regarding harmless error.  The inquiry is not whether the federal habeas court could definitively say that the defense could make no winning arguments, but whether the evidence in the record raised \xe2\x80\x9cgrave doubt[s]\xe2\x80\x9d about whether the trial judge would have ruled differently.  <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Neal</i> v. <i>McAninch</i>,\n\n513 U.

Not only was the Ninth Circuit incorrect to suppose that the presence of Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s counsel at the hearing would have made a difference in the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of the strike, but the Ninth Circuit failed to mention that defense counsel specifically addressed the issue during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> and reminded the judge that Robert M. also made several statements favorable to the death penalty.  Thus, the trial judge heard counsel\xe2\x80\x99s arguments and concluded that the record supplied a legitimate basis for the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s concern.  That defense counsel did not have the opportunity to repeat that argument does not create grave doubt about whether the trial court would have decided the issue differently.

The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision was based on the procedure used by the trial judge in ruling on Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s objections under <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Kentucky</i>,\n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79 (1986)\n, to some of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenges of prospective jurors.  The trial judge allowed the prosecutor to explain the basis for those strikes outside the presence of the defense so as not to disclose trial strategy.  On direct appeal, the California Supreme Court found that if this procedure violated any federal constitutional right, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Ninth Circuit, however, held that the error was harmful.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision was based on the misapplication of basic rules regarding harmless error.  Assuming without deciding that a federal constitutional error occurred, the error was harmless under <i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abrahamson</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 619 (1993)\n, and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s conviction resulted from the attempted robbery of an automobile body shop in San Diego, California, in April 1985.  The prosecution charged Ayala with three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of robbery, and three counts of attempted robbery.  The prosecution also announced that it would seek the death penalty on the murder counts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Jury selection lasted more than three months, and during this time the court and the parties interviewed the prospective jurors and then called back a subset for general <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>.  As part of the jury selection process, more than 200 potential jurors completed a 77-question, 17-page questionnaire.  Potential jurors were then questioned in court regarding their ability to follow the law.  Jurors who were not dismissed for cause were called back in groups for <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, and the parties exercised their peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Each side was allowed 20 peremptories, and the prosecution used 18 of its allotment.  It used seven peremptories to strike all of the African-Americans and Hispanics who were available for service.  Ayala, who is Hispanic, raised <i>Batson</i> objections to those challenges.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ayala first objected after the prosecution peremptorily challenged two African-Americans, Olanders D. and Galileo S.  The trial judge stated that these two strikes failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, but he nevertheless required the prosecution to reveal the reasons for the strikes.  The prosecutor asked to do this outside the presence of the defense so as not to disclose trial strategy, and over Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s objection, the judgegranted the request.  The prosecution then offered several reasons for striking Olanders D., including uncertainty about his willingness to impose the death penalty.  The prosecution stated that it dismissed Galileo S. primarily because he had been arrested numerous times and had not informed the court about all his prior arrests.  After hearing and evaluating these explanations, the judge concluded that the prosecution had valid, race-neutral reasons for these strikes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ayala again raised <i>Batson </i>objections when the prosecution used peremptory challenges to dismiss two Hispanics, Gerardo O. and Luis M.  As before, the judge found that the defense had not made out a prima facie case, but ordered the prosecution to reveal the reasons for the strikes.  This was again done <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i>, but this time the defense did not expressly object.  The prosecution explained that it had challenged Gerardo O. and Luis M. in part because it was unsure that they could impose the death penalty.  The prosecution also emphasized that Gerardo O.\xe2\x80\x99s English proficiency was limited and that Luis M. had independently investigated the case.  The trial court concluded a second time that the prosecution had legitimate race-neutral reasons for the strikes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ayala raised <i>Batson</i> objections for a third and final time when the prosecution challenged Robert M., who was Hispanic; George S., whose ethnicity was disputed; and Barbara S., who was African-American.  At this point, the trial court agreed that Ayala had made a prima facie <i>Batson</i> showing.  Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s counsel argued that the strikes were in fact based on race.  Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s counsel contended that the challenged jurors were \xe2\x80\x9cnot significantly different from the white jurors that the prosecution ha[d] chosen to leave on the jury both in terms of their attitudes on the death penalty, their attitudes on the criminal justice system, and their attitudes on the presumption of innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 306.  Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s counsel then reviewed the questionnaire answers and <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> testimony of Barbara S. and Robert M., as well as the statements made by three of the prospective jurors who had been the subject of the prior <i>Batson</i> objections, Galileo S., Gerardo O., and Luis M.  Counsel argued that their answers showed that they could impose the death penalty.  The trial court stated that it would hear the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s response outside the presence of the jury, and Ayala once more did not object to that ruling.  The prosecution then explained that it had dismissed the prospective jurors in question for several race-neutral reasons, including uncertainty that Robert M., George S., or Barbara S. would be open to imposing the death penalty.  The prosecution also emphasized (among other points) that Robert M. had followed a controversial trial, that George S. had been a holdout on a prior jury, and that Barbara S. had given the impression during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> that she was under the influence of drugs.  The trial court concluded, for a third time, that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenges were based on race-neutral criteria.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In August 1989, the jury convicted Ayala of all the charges except one of the three attempted robberies.  With respect to the three murder convictions, the jury found two special circumstances: Ayala committed multiple murders, and he killed during the course of an attempted robbery.  The jury returned a verdict of death on all three murder counts, and the trial court entered judgment consistent with that verdict.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Ayala appealed his conviction and sentence, and counsel was appointed to represent him in January 1993.  Between 1993 and 1999, Ayala filed 20 applications for an extension of time, 11 of which requested additional time to file his opening brief.  After the California Supreme Court eventually ruled that no further extensions would be granted, Ayala filed his opening brief in April 1998, nine years after he was convicted.  The State filed its brief in September 1998, and Ayala then asked for four extensions of time to file his reply brief.  After the court declared that it would grant him no further extensions, he filed his reply brief in May 1999.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In August 2000, the California Supreme Court affirmed Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and death sentence.  <i>People </i>v. <i>Ayala</i>, 24 Cal. 4th 243, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d 193.  In an opinion joined by five justices, the State Supreme Court rejected Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the trial court committed reversible error by excluding the defense from part of the <i>Batson</i> hearing.  The court understood Ayala to challenge the peremptory strikes under both <i>Batson</i> and its state-law analogue, <i>People </i>v. <i>Wheeler</i>, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P.\xc2\xa02d 748 (1978).  The court first concluded that the prosecution had not offered matters of trial strategy at the <i>ex parte</i> hearing and that, \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of state law, it was [error]\xe2\x80\x9d to bar Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s attorney from the hearing.  24 Cal. 4th, at 262, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 203.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Turning to the question of prejudice, the court stated:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWe have concluded that error occurred under state law, and we have noted [the suggestion in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>, 827 F.\xc2\xa02d 1254 (CA9 1987),] that excluding the defense from a <i>Wheeler</i>-type hearing may amount to a denial of due process.  We nonetheless conclude that the error was harmless under state law (<i>People</i> v. <i>Watson</i> (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836), and that, if federal error occurred, it, too, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt (<i>Chapman</i> v. <i>California</i> (1967)\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 18\n) as a matter of federal law.  On the record before us, we are confident that the challenged jurors were excluded for proper, race-neutral reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 264, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 204.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court then reviewed the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for striking the seven prospective jurors and found that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n this well-developed record, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. we are confident that defense counsel could not have argued anything substantial that would have changed the court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings.  Accordingly, the error was harmless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 268, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 207.  The court concluded that the record supported the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s implicit determination that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s justifications were not fabricated and were instead \xe2\x80\x9cgrounded in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 267, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 206.  And the court emphasized that the \xe2\x80\x9ctrial court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings in the ex\xc2\xa0parte hearing indisputably reflect both its familiarity with the record of voir\xc2\xa0dire of the challenged prospective jurors and its critical assessment of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s proffered justifications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 266\xe2\x80\x93267, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 206.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The California Supreme Court also rejected Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s argument that his conviction should be vacated because most of the questionnaires filled out by prospective jurors who did not serve had been lost at some point during the decade that had passed since the end of the trial.  The court wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cthe record is sufficiently complete for us to be able to conclude that [the prospective jurors who were the subject of the contested peremptories] were not challenged and excused on the basis of forbidden group bias.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 270, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 208.  And even if the loss of the questionnaires was error under federal or state law, the court held, the error was harmless under <i>Chapman</i> and its state-law analogue.  Two justices of the State Supreme Court dissented.  We then denied certiorari.\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1029 (2001)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">After the California Supreme Court summarily denied a habeas petition, Ayala turned to federal court.  He filed his initial federal habeas petition in 2002, but then went back to state court to exhaust several claims.  In December 2004, he filed the operative federal petition and argued, among other things, that the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> hearings and loss of the questionnaires violated his rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and\n \nFourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2006, the District Court denied Ayala relief on those claims.  The District Court read the decision of the California Supreme Court to mean that the state court had not decided whether the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> proceedings violated federal law, and the District Court expressed doubt \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s procedure was constitutionally defective as a matter of clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 145a.  But even if such a violation occurred, the District Court held, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of harmlessness was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established law and thus could not be overturned under AEDPA.  The District Court also rejected Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s argument about the lost questionnaires, concluding that, even without them, the record was sufficient to resolve Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s other claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2013, a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit granted Ayala federal habeas corpus relief and required California either to release or retry him.  <i>Ayala</i> v. <i>Wong</i>, 756 F.\xc2\xa03d 656 (2014).  Because Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s federal petition is subject to the requirements of AEDPA, the panel majority began its analysis by inquiring whether the state court had adjudicated Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s claims on the merits.  Applying <i>de novo</i> review,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] the panel held that the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> proceedings violated the Federal Constitution, and that the loss of the questionnaires violated Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s federal due process rights if that loss deprived him of \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability to meaningfully appeal the denial of his <i>Batson</i> claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 671.  The </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">panel folded this inquiry into its analysis of the question whether the error regarding the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> proceedings was harmless.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Turning to the question of harmlessness, the panel identified the applicable standard of review as that set out in <i>Brecht</i> and added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe apply the <i>Brecht</i> test without regard for the state court\xe2\x80\x99s harmlessness determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  756 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 674 (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The panel used the following complicated formulation to express its understanding of <i>Brecht</i>\xe2\x80\x99s application to Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s claims: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we cannot say that the exclusion of defense counsel with or without the loss of the questionnaires likely did not prevent Ayala from prevailing on his <i>Batson</i> claim, then we must grant the writ.\xe2\x80\x9d  756 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 676.  Applying this test, the panel majority found that the error was not harmless, at least with respect to three of the seven prospective jurors.  The panel asserted that the absence of Ayala and his counsel had interfered with the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to evaluate the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proffered justifications for those strikes and had impeded appellate review, and that the loss of the questionnaires had compounded this impairment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Judge Callahan dissented.  She explained that the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that any federal error was harmless constituted a merits adjudication of Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s federal claims.  She then reviewed the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s explanations for its contested peremptory challenges and concluded that federal habeas relief was barred because \xe2\x80\x9cfairminded jurists can concur in the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of harmless error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 706.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, but Judge Ikuta wrote a dissent from denial that was joined by seven other judges.

We assume for the sake of argument that Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s federal rights were violated, but that does not necessarily mean that he is entitled to habeas relief.  In the absence of \xe2\x80\x9cthe rare type of error\xe2\x80\x9d that requires automatic reversal, relief is appropriate only if the prosecution cannot demonstrate harmlessness.  <i>Glebe</i> v. <i>Frost</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 3).  The Ninth Circuit did not hold\xe2\x80\x94and Ayala does not now contend\xe2\x80\x94that the error here falls into that narrow category, and therefore Ayala is entitled to relief only if the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The test for whether a federal constitutional error was harmless depends on the procedural posture of the case.

For reasons of finality, comity, and federalism, habeas petitioners \xe2\x80\x9care not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in \xe2\x80\x98actual prejudice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Brecht</i>, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637 (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lane</i>,\n\n474 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438,\n449 (1986)\n).  Under this test, relief is proper only if the federal court has \xe2\x80\x9cgrave doubt about whether a trial error of federal law had \xe2\x80\x98substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Neal</i> v. <i>McAninch</i>,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 432,\n436 (1995)\n.

The <i>Brecht</i> standard reflects the view that a \xe2\x80\x9cState is not to be put to th[e] arduous task [of retrying a defendant] based on mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error; the court must find that the defendant was actually prejudiced by the error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Coleman</i>,\n\n525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 141,\n146 (1998)\n (<i>per curiam</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because Ayala seeks federal habeas corpus relief, he must meet the <i>Brecht</i> standard, but that does not mean, as the Ninth Circuit thought, that a state court\xe2\x80\x99s harmlessness determination has no significance under <i>Brecht</i>.  In <i>Fry</i> v. <i>Pliler</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 112,\n120 (2007)\n, we held that the <i>Brecht</i> standard \xe2\x80\x9csubsumes\xe2\x80\x9d the requirements that \xc2\xa72254(d) imposes when a federal habeas petitioner contests a state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that a constitutional error was harmless under <i>Chapman</i>.

There is no dispute that the California Supreme Court held that any federal error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <i>Chapman</i>, and this decision undoubtedly constitutes an adjudication of Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claim \xe2\x80\x9con the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g., Mitchell</i> v. <i>Esparza</i>,\n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 12\n\xe2\x80\x9318 (2003) (<i>per curiam</i>).  Accordingly, a federal habeas court cannot grant Ayala relief unless the state court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of his claim (1) was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.  Because the highly deferential AEDPA standard applies, we may not overturn the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision unless that court applied <i>Chapman</i> \xe2\x80\x9cin an \xe2\x80\x98objectively unreasonable\xe2\x80\x99 manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 18 (quoting <i>Lockyer</i> v. <i>Andrade</i>,\n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 63,\n75 (2003)\n).  When a <i>Chapman</i> decision is reviewed under AEDPA, \xe2\x80\x9ca federal court may not award habeas relief under \xc2\xa72254 unless <i>the harmlessness determination itself</i> was unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fry</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 119 (emphasis in original).

Ayala therefore must show that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to reject his claim \xe2\x80\x9cwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 103.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, a prisoner who seeks federal habeas corpus relief must satisfy <i>Brecht</i>, and if the state court adjudi-cated his claim on the merits, the <i>Brecht</i> test subsumes the limitations imposed by AEDPA.  <i>Fry</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 119\xe2\x80\x93120.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With this background in mind, we turn to the question whether Ayala was harmed by the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to receive the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for its challenged strikes without the defense present.  In order for this argument to succeed, Ayala must show that he was actually prejudiced by this procedure, a standard that he neces-sarily cannot satisfy if a fairminded jurist could agree with the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that this procedure met the <i>Chapman</i> standard of harmlessness.  Evaluation of these questions requires consideration of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s grounds for rejecting Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Batson</i> challenges.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Batson</i> held that the Equal Protection Clause of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment prohibits prosecutors from exercising peremptory challenges on the basis of race.  476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 89.  When adjudicating a <i>Batson</i> claim, trial courts follow a three-step process:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para"> \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  Snyder</i> v. <i>Louisiana</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472\n\xe2\x80\x93477 (2008) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The opponent of the strike bears the burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation, <i>Purkett</i> v. <i>Elem</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 765,\n768 (1995)\n (<i>per curiam</i>), and a trial court finding regarding the credibility of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the ground for a peremptory challenge is \xe2\x80\x9centitled to \xe2\x80\x98great deference,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Felkner</i> v. <i>Jackson</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 594,\n598 (2011)\n (<i>per curiam</i>) (quoting <i>Batson</i>, 476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98, n. 21).  On direct appeal, those findings may be reversed only if the trial judge is shown to have committed clear error.  <i>Rice</i> v. <i>Collins</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 333,\n338 (2006)\n.  Under AEDPA, even more must be shown.  A federal habeas court must accept a state-court finding unless it was based on \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  \xe2\x80\x9cState-court factual findings, moreover, are presumed correct; the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption by \xe2\x80\x98clear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Collins</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 338\xe2\x80\x93339 (quoting \xc2\xa72254(e)(1)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, Ayala challenged seven of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory challenges.  As explained above, the Ninth Circuit granted relief based on the dismissal of three potential jurors.  The dissent discusses only one, Olanders D.  We will devote most of our analysis to the three individuals discussed by the Ninth Circuit, but we hold that any error was harmless with respect to all seven strikes.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Ayala first contests the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s decision to challenge Olanders D., an African-American man.  The prosecution stated that its \xe2\x80\x9cprimary\xe2\x80\x9d reason for striking Olanders D. was uncertainty about whether he could impose the death penalty, and the prosecutor noted that Olanders D. had written on his questionnaire that he did not \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve in the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  50 Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Tr. on Appeal 6185 (hereinafter Tr.).  Providing additional reasons for this strike, the prosecutor first stated that Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s responses \xe2\x80\x9cdid not make a lot of sense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwere not thought out,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate[d] a lack of ability to express himself well.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 283.  The prosecutor also voiced doubt that Olanders D. \xe2\x80\x9ccould actively participate in a meaningful way in deliberations with other jurors\xe2\x80\x9d and might have lacked the \xe2\x80\x9cability to fit in with a cohesive group of 12 people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The trial court concluded that the strike was race-neutral.  The judge stated: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly with reference to whether or not he would get along with 12 people, it may well be that he would get along very well with 12 people.  I think the other observations of counsel are accurate and borne out by the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  50 Tr. 6186.  The California Supreme Court found that the evidence of Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s views on the death penalty provided adequate support for the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the strike exercised against him was not based on race, and the court further found that defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s presence would not have affected the outcome of the <i>Batson </i>hearing.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, but its decision rested on a misapplication of the applicable harmless-error standards.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As the trial court and the State Supreme Court found, Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> responses amply support the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s concern that he might not have been willing to impose the death penalty.  During <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, Olanders D. acknowledged that he wrote on his questionnaire, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the death penalty,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d App. 179, and he agreed that he had at one time \xe2\x80\x9cthought that [the death penalty] was completely wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 177.  Although he stated during the <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> that he had reconsidered his views, it was reasonable for the prosecution and the trial court to find that he did not clearly or adequately explain the reason or reasons for this change.  When asked about this, Olanders D. gave a vague and rambling reply: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94one thing would be the\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94I mean, examining it more closely, I think, and becoming more familiar with the laws and the\xe2\x80\x94and the behavior, I mean, the change in the people, I think.  All of those things contributed to the changes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 178.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit reversed because it speculated that defense counsel, if present when the prosecution explained the basis for this strike, \xe2\x80\x9ccould have pointed to seated white jurors who had expressed similar or greater hesitancy\xe2\x80\x9d in imposing the death penalty.  756 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 678.  The Ninth Circuit wrote that a seated white juror named Ana L. was \xe2\x80\x9cindistinguishable from Olanders D. in this regard\xe2\x80\x9d and that she had \xe2\x80\x9cmade almost precisely the same statement in her questionnaire.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The responses of Olanders D. and Ana L., however, were by no means \xe2\x80\x9cindistinguishable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Olanders D. initially voiced unequivocal opposition to the death penalty, stating flatly: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  He also revealed that he had once thought it was \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ana L., by contrast, wrote on the questionnaire that she \xe2\x80\x9c<i>probably</i> would not be able to vote for the death penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 109 (emphasis added), and she then later said at <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> that she could vote for a verdict of death.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In a capital case, it is not surprising for prospective jurors to express varying degrees of hesitancy about voting for a death verdict.  Few are likely to have experienced a need to make a comparable decision at any prior time in their lives.  As a result, both the prosecution and the defense may be required to make fine judgment calls about which jurors are more or less willing to vote for the ultimate punishment.  These judgment calls may involve a comparison of responses that differ in only nuanced respects, as well as a sensitive assessment of jurors\xe2\x80\x99 demeanor.  We have previously recognized that peremptory challenges \xe2\x80\x9care often the subjects of instinct,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Dretke</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 231,\n252 (2005)\n (citing <i>Batson</i>, 476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 106 (Marshall, J., concurring)), and that \xe2\x80\x9crace-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges often invoke a juror\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Snyder</i>, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 477.  A trial court is best situated to evaluate both the words and the demeanor of jurors who are peremptorily challenged, as well as the credibility of the prosecutor who exercised those strikes.  As we have said, \xe2\x80\x9cthese determinations of credibility and demeanor lie peculiarly within a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s province,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of exceptional circumstances, we [will] defer to the trial court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cAppellate judges cannot on the basis of a cold record easily second-guess a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision about likely motivation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Collins</i>, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 343 (Breyer, J., concurring).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is that even if \xe2\x80\x9c[r]easonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s credibility, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s credibility determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 341\xe2\x80\x93342 (majority opinion).  Here, any similarity between the responses of Olanders D. and Ana L. is insufficient to compel an inference of racial discrimination under <i>Brecht</i> or AEDPA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ayala contends that the presence of defense counsel might have made a difference because defense counsel might have been able to identify white jurors who were not stricken by the prosecution even though they had \xe2\x80\x9cexpressed similar or greater hesitancy\xe2\x80\x9d about the death penalty.  We see no basis for this argument.  The questionnaires of all the jurors who sat and all the alternates are in the record, and Ana L., whom we just discussed, is apparently the white juror whose answers come the closest to those of Olanders D.  Since neither Ayala nor the Ninth Circuit identified a white juror whose statements better support their argument, there is no reason to think that defense counsel could have pointed to a superior comparator at the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> proceeding.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In rejecting the argument that the prosecutor peremptorily challenged Olanders D. because of his race, the California Supreme Court appears to have interpreted the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of this strike to mean that Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s views on the death penalty were alone sufficient to convince him to exercise a strike, see 24 Cal. 4th, at 266, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 206, and this was certainly an interpretation of the record that must be sustained under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  As a result, it is not necessary for us to consider the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s supplementary reason for this strike\xe2\x80\x94the poor quality of Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s responses\xe2\x80\x94but in any event, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of this reason is also flawed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit wrote that its independent \xe2\x80\x9creview of the voir\xc2\xa0dire transcript reveal[ed] nothing that supports the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s claim: Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s answers were responsive and complete.\xe2\x80\x9d  756 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 679.  The record, however, provides sufficient support for the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s incoherent explanation during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> of the reasons for his change of opinion about the death penalty was quoted above.  He also provided a chronology of the evolution of his views on the subject that did not hold together.  He stated that he had been \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely against the death sentence\xe2\x80\x9d 10 years earlier but seemed to suggest that his views had changed over the course of the intervening decade.  See App. 176\xe2\x80\x93177.  However, on the questionnaire, which he had completed just a month before the <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, he wrote unequivocally: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 179.  And then, at the time of the <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, he said that he would be willing to impose the death penalty in some cases.  <i>Id</i>., at 180.  He explained his answer on the questionnaire as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cI answered that kind of fast[.]  [N]ormally, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question that way, but I mean, I really went through that kind of fast.  I should have done better than that.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 179\xe2\x80\x93180.  These answers during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> provide more than sufficient support for the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s observation, which the trial court implicitly credited, that Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s statements \xe2\x80\x9cdid not make a lot of sense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwere not thought out,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate[d] a lack of ability to express himself well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In ordering federal habeas relief based on their assessment of the responsiveness and completeness of Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s answers, the members of the panel majority misunderstood the role of a federal court in a habeas case.  The role of a federal habeas court is to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Richter</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 102\xe2\x80\x93103 (quoting <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n443 U.\xc2\xa0S. 307\n, n.\xc2\xa05 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)), not to apply <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> review of factual findings and to substitute its own opinions for the determination made on the scene by the trial judge.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Ayala next challenges the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s use of a peremptory challenge to strike Gerardo O., a Hispanic man.  The prosecution offered three reasons for this strike: Gerardo O. had a poor grasp of English; his answers during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> and on his questionnaire suggested that he might not be willing to impose the death penalty; and he did not appear to get along with the other prospective jurors.

The Ninth Circuit thought that it could grant Ayala relief simply because it \xe2\x80\x9c[could not] say that Ayala would not have shown that the trial court would or should have determined that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s strike of Gerardo O. violated <i>Batson</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 682.  But that is not the test.  The inquiry under <i>Brecht</i> is not whether the federal habeas court could definitively say that there were no winning arguments that the defense could have made.  Instead, the evidence in the record must raise \xe2\x80\x9cgrave doubt[s]\xe2\x80\x9d about whether the trial judge would have ruled differently.  <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Neal</i>, 513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 436.  This requires much more than a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable possibility\xe2\x80\x9d that the result of the hearing would have been different.  <i>Brecht</i>, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And on the record in this case, Ayala cannot establish actual prejudice or that no fairminded jurist could agree with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <i>Chapman</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We begin with the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that it challenged Gerardo O. because of his limited English proficiency.  During <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, Gerardo O. acknowledged that someone else had written the answers for him onhis questionnaire \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I cannot read\xe2\x80\x94I cannot spell that well.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 163.  He added that he \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t get\xe2\x80\x9d some of the words on the questionnaire.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Gerardo O.\xe2\x80\x99s testimony also revealed that he might well have been unable to follow what was said at trial.  When asked whether he could understand spoken English, he responded: \xe2\x80\x9cIt depends if you make long words.  If you make\xe2\x80\x94if you go\xe2\x80\x94if you say it straight out, then I might<i> </i>understand.  If you beat around the bush, I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 166.  At that point, defense counsel and Gerardo O. engaged in a colloquy that suggests that defense counsel recognized that he lacked the ability to understand words not used in basic everyday speech, \xe2\x80\x9clegal words,\xe2\x80\x9d and rapid speech in English:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9cQ: I\xe2\x80\x99ll try not to talk\xe2\x80\x94use any legal words or lawyer talk\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9cA: Okay.</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9cQ: \xe2\x80\x94and talk regular with you.

The prosecution had an obvious reason to worry that service on this jury would have strained Gerardo O.\xe2\x80\x99s linguistic capability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion by distorting the record and the applicable law.  The Ninth Circuit first suggested that Gerardo O.\xe2\x80\x99s English-language deficiencies were limited to reading and writing, 756 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 680, but as the portions of the <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> quoted above make clear, that was not true; the record shows that his ability to understand spoken English was also limited.  The Ninth Circuit then suggested that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s purported reason for striking Gerardo O. .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was directly related to his status as someone who spoke Spanish as his first language,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, but the prosecutor voiced no concern about Gerardo O.\xe2\x80\x99s ability to speak Spanish or about the fact that Spanish was his first language.  The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s objection concerned Gerardo O.\xe2\x80\x99s limited proficiency in <i>English</i>.  The Ninth Circuit quoted the following statement from <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 352,\n363 (1991)\n (plurality opinion): \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s frank admission that his ground for excusing th[is] juror[\xc2\xa0] related to [his] ability to speak and understand Spanish raised a plausible, though not a necessary, inference that language might be a pretext for what in fact [was a] race-based peremptory challenge[\xc2\xa0].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  756 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 680 (alterations in original).  This statement, however, did not concern a peremptory exercised due to a prospective juror\xe2\x80\x99s lack of English proficiency.  Instead, it concerned the dismissal of </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Spanish-speaking members of the venire for fear that, if seated, they might not follow the English translation of testimony given in Spanish.  See 500 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 360.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision regarding Gerardo O. was thus based on a misreading of the record and a distortion of our case law.  And neither Ayala nor the Ninth Circuit has identified anything that defense counsel might have done at the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> hearing to show that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s concern about Gerardo O.\xe2\x80\x99s limited English proficiency was pretextual.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s second proffered reason for striking Gerardo O. was concern about his willingness to impose the death penalty, and as the trial court found, this observation was also supported by the record.  Indeed, when asked in <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> how he felt about imposing the death penalty, Gerardo O. responded that he was \xe2\x80\x9c[k]ind of shaky about it.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not too sure if I can take someone else\xe2\x80\x99s life in my hands and say that; say, you know, \xe2\x80\x98death,\xe2\x80\x99 or something.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 168.  In response to another question about his thoughts on the death penalty, he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet.  It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of hard, you know, to pick it up like that and say how I feel about the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 Tr. 1052.  Answering a question about whether his thoughts on the death penalty would affect how he viewed the evidence presented at trial, he responded, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir, to tell you the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 165.  And when asked if he had \xe2\x80\x9cany feeling that [he] would be unable to vote for the death penalty if [he] thought it was a case that called for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Gerardo O. responded once again, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 Tr. 1043.  While Gerardo O. did say at one point that he might be willing to impose the death pen-alty, he qualified that statement by adding that he would be comforted by the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s eleven more other persons on the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 170.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What we said above regarding jurors who express doubts about their openness to a death verdict applies as well here.  The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to take a chance that Gerardo O. would ultimately be willing to consider the death penalty in accordance with state law did not compel the trial judge to find that the strike of Gerardo O. was based on race.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor is there a basis for finding that the absence of defense counsel affected the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of the sincerity of this proffered ground for the strike.  Defense counsel had a full opportunity during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> to create a record regarding Gerardo O.\xe2\x80\x99s openness to the death penalty.  And defense counsel had the opportunity prior to the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> proceeding on the Gerardo O. strike to compare the minority jurors dismissed by the prosecution with white jurors who were seated.  Counsel argued that the answers on the death penalty given by the minority jurors were \xe2\x80\x9cnot significantly different from [those of] the white jurors that the prosecution ha[d] chosen to leave on the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 306.  The trial judge asked counsel for \xe2\x80\x9cparticulars,\xe2\x80\x9d and counsel discussed Gerardo O., albeit briefly.  <i>Id.,</i> at 307\xe2\x80\x93308.  Thus, there is no reason to believe that counsel could have made a more persuasive argumentat the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> proceeding than he made during thisexchange.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s final reason for striking Gerardo O. was that he appeared to be \xe2\x80\x9ca standoffish type of individ-ual\xe2\x80\x9d whose \xe2\x80\x9cdress and\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0mannerisms\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0were not in keeping with the other jurors\xe2\x80\x9d and who \xe2\x80\x9cdid not appear to be socializing or mixing with any of the other jurors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 298.  The trial judge did not dispute that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s reflections were borne out by the record.  The California Supreme Court affirmed and also emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings in the ex\xc2\xa0parte hearing indisput-ably reflect both its familiarity with the record of voir\xc2\xa0dire of the challenged prospective jurors and its critical assessment of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s proffered justifications.\xe2\x80\x9d  24 Cal.\xc2\xa04th, at 266\xe2\x80\x93267, 6 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 206.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of the strength of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s first two reasons for striking Gerardo O., it is not at all clear that the prosecution proffered this final reason as an essential factor in its decision to strike, but in any event, there is no support for the suggestion that Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, if allowed to attend the <i>ex parte</i> hearing, would have been able to convince the judge that this reason was pretextual.  The Ninth Circuit, however, was content to speculate about what might have been.  Mixing guesswork with armchair sociology, the Ninth Circuit mused that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is likely that Gerardo O.\xe2\x80\x99s dress and mannerisms were distinctly Hispanic.  Perhaps in the late 1980\xe2\x80\x99s Hispanic males in San Diego County were more likely than members of other racial or ethnic groups in the area to wear a particular style or color of shirt, and Gerardo O. was wearing such a shirt.\xe2\x80\x9d  756 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 680\xe2\x80\x93681.  As for the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s observation that Gerardo O. did not socialize with other jurors, the Ninth Circuit posited that, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps, unbeknownst to the trial judge, Gerardo O. did \xe2\x80\x98socializ[e] or mix[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x99 with a number of other jurors, and had even organized a dinner for some of them at his favorite Mexican restaurant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 681.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This is not how habeas review is supposed to work.  The record provides no basis for the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s flight of fancy.  <i>Brecht</i> requires more than speculation about what extrarecord information defense counsel might have mentioned.  And speculation of that type is not enough to show that a State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the argument regarding Gerardo O. was unreasonable.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The final prospective juror specifically discussed in the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision was Robert M., who is Hispanic.  The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s primary proffered reason for striking Robert M. was concern that he would not impose the death penalty, though the prosecution added that it was troubled that he had followed the Sagon Penn case, a high-profile prosecution in San Diego in which an alleged murderer was acquitted amid allegations of misconduct by police and prosecutors.  In addition, the prosecution also explained to the trial court that Robert M. scored poorly on its 10-point scale for evaluating prospective jurors.  The trial court accepted the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the strike.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With respect to the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s concern that Robert M. might not be willing to impose the death penalty, the Ninth Circuit found that defense counsel, if permitted to attend the <i>in camera</i> proceeding, could have compared Robert M.\xe2\x80\x99s statements about the death penalty to those of other jurors and could have reminded the judge that Robert M. had \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly stated during voir\xc2\xa0dire that he believed in the death penalty and could personally vote to impose it.\xe2\x80\x9d  756 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 682.  But as with Olanders D. and Gerardo O., we cannot say that the prosecution had no basis for doubting Robert M.\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to impose the death penalty.  For example, when asked at one point whether he could vote for death, Robert M. responded: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve though[t] about that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult question, and yeah, it is difficult for me to say, you know, one way or the other.  I believe in it, but for me to be involved in it is\xe2\x80\x94is hard.  It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to accept that aspect of it, do you know what I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 149\xe2\x80\x93150.  In response to another question, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be hard, but I think I could, yes.  It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say, you know\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who the person is\xe2\x80\x94to say that they have to put somebody away, you know.  It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 154.  These are hardly answers that would inspire confidence in the minds of prosecutors in a capital case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While the Ninth Circuit argued that defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s absence at the <i>in camera</i> hearing prejudiced the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s ability to assess this reason for the strike of Robert M., the Ninth Circuit failed to mention that defense counsel specifically addressed this issue during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>.  At that time, he pointedly reminded the judge that Robert M. had made several statements during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> that were favorable to the death penalty.  <i>Id</i>., at 307.  The trial judge thus heard defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s arguments but nevertheless concluded that the record supplied a basis for a legitimate concern about whether Robert M. could impose the death penalty.  That Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s attorney did not have the opportunity to repeat this same argument once more at the <i>in camera</i> proceeding does not create grave doubt about whether the trial court would have decided the issue differently.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As for the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s second proffered reason for striking Robert M.\xe2\x80\x94that he had followed the Sagon Penn case[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]\xe2\x80\x94the Ninth Circuit placed great emphasis on the fact that a seated white juror had followed a different murder trial, that of Robert Alton Harris.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  But the Penn and Harris cases were quite different.  Harris was convicted while Penn was acquitted; and since the Harris case was much older, the experience of following it was less likely to have an effect at the time of the trial in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">E</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Ayala raised a <i>Batson</i> objection about the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s use of peremptory challenges on four additional jurors, George S., Barbara S., Galileo S., and Luis M.  The Ninth Circuit did not address these prospective jurors at length, and we need not dwell long on them.  With respect to all four of these prospective jurors, we conclude that any constitutional error was harmless.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of these four additional jurors, Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s brief in this Court develops an argument with respect to only two, </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">George S. and Barbara S.  And while Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s attorney claimed that George S. was Hispanic, the prosecutor said that he thought that George S. was Greek.  In any event, the prosecution offered several reasons for striking George S.  The prosecutor noted that one of his responses \xe2\x80\x9cwas essentially, \xe2\x80\x98you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to be a juror on this case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 312.  The prosecutor was also concerned about whether he would vote for death or even a life sentence and whether he would follow the law as opposed to his personal religious beliefs.  In addition, the prosecutor noted that George S. had previously been the sole holdout on a jury and that his prior application to be a police officer had been rejected, for reasons that were not clear.  The trial court accepted these explanations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ayala contests only two of these justifications.  He quibbles that George S. had not been a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98holdout,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but instead had been the dissenting juror in a civil case on which unanimity was not required.  This observation does not render the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proffered justification \xe2\x80\x9cfalse or pretextual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 46.  The fact that George S. had been willing to dissent from a jury verdict could reasonably give a prosecutor pause in a capital case since a single holdout juror could prevent a guilty verdict or death sentence.  The most that Ayala can establish is that reasonable minds can disagree about whether the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s fears were well founded, but this does not come close to establishing \xe2\x80\x9cactual prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d under <i>Brecht</i>.  Nor does it meet the AEDPA standard.  Ayala also points out that a seated white juror, Charles C., had been re-jected by a police force, but George S. admitted that he had applied to law enforcement because he was \xe2\x80\x9ctrying to get out of the Army,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 222, and the reasons for his rejection were not clear.  Charles C., by contrast, had received a qualifying score on a law enforcement exam but was not hired because a position was not available.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As for Barbara S., the prosecution struck her because, during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, she appeared to be \xe2\x80\x9cunder the influence of drugs\xe2\x80\x9d and disconnected from the proceedings.  <i>Id.</i>, at 314.  The prosecution emphasized that she had \xe2\x80\x9can empty look in her eyes, slow responses, a lack of really being totally in tune with what was going on.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  It added that she appeared \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat angry,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest[ed] a great deal of nervousness,\xe2\x80\x9d and seemed like someone who would be unlikely to closely follow the trial.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The trial judge thought that Barbara S. appeared nervous rather than hostile, but he agreed that she gave incomplete answers that were sometimes \xe2\x80\x9cnon sequiturs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 315.  He concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly cannot quarrel .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with your subjective impression, and the use of your peremp-tory challenge based upon her individual manifestation, as opposed to her ethnicity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Ayala points to the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement with the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s impression that Barbara S. was hostile, but this ruling illustrates the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s recollection of the demeanor of the prospective jurors and his careful evaluation of each of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s proffered reasons for strikes.  And the fact that the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s impression of Barbara S.\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor was somewhat different from the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s hardly shows that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s reasons were pretextual.  It is not at all unusual for individuals to come to different conclusions in attempting to read another person\xe2\x80\x99s attitude or mood.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The pattern of peremptory challenges in this case was sufficient to raise suspicions about the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s motives and to call for the prosecution to explain its strikes.  As we have held, the\n \nFourteenth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor from striking potential jurors based on race.  Discrimination in the jury selection process undermines our criminal justice system and poisons public confidence in the evenhanded administration of justice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Batson</i>, this Court adopted a procedure for ferreting out discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges, and this procedure places great responsibility in thehands of the trial judge, who is in the best position to determine whether a peremptory challenge is based on an impermissible factor.  This is a difficult determination because of the nature of peremptory challenges: They are often based on subtle impressions and intangible factors.  In this case, the conscientious trial judge determined that the strikes at issue were not based on race, and his judgment was entitled to great weight.  On appeal, five justices of the California Supreme Court carefully evaluated the record and found no basis to reverse.

This separate writing responds only to one factual circumstance, mentioned at oral argument but with no direct bearing on the precise legal questions presented by this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In response to a question, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s counsel advised the Court that, since being sentenced to death in 1989, Ayala has served the great majority of his more than 25 years in custody in \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative segregation\xe2\x80\x9d or, as it is better known, solitary confinement.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  Counsel for petitioner did not have a clear opportunity to enter the discussion, and the precise details of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conditions of confinement are not established in the record.  Yet if his solitary confinement follows the usual pattern, it is likely respondent has been held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot for 23 hours a day; and in the one hour when he leaves it, he likely is allowed little or no opportunity for conversation or interaction with anyone.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also <i>Wilkinson</i> v. <i>Austin</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 209,\n218 (2005)\n; Amnesty International, Entombed: Isolation in the U.\xc2\xa0S. Federal Prison System (2014).  It is estimated that 25,000 inmates in the United States are currently serving their sentence in whole or substantial part in solitary confinement, many regardless of their conduct in prison.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation long has been understood, and questioned, by writers and commentators.  Eighteenth-century British prison re-former John Howard wrote \xe2\x80\x9cthat criminals who had affected an air of boldness during their trial, and appeared quite unconcerned at the pronouncing sentence upon them, were struck with horror, and shed tears when brought to these darksome solitary abodes.\xe2\x80\x9d  The State of the Prisons in England and Wales 152 (1777).  In literature, Charles Dickens recounted the toil of Dr. Manette, whose 18 years of isolation in One Hundred and Five, North Tower, caused him, even years after his release, to lapse in and out of a mindless state with almost no awareness or appreciation for time or his surroundings.  A Tale of Two Cities (1859).  And even Manette, while imprisoned, had a work bench and tools to make shoes, a type of diversion no doubt denied many of today\xe2\x80\x99s inmates.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One hundred and twenty-five years ago, this Court recognized that, even for prisoners sentenced to death, solitary confinement bears \xe2\x80\x9ca further terror and peculiar mark of infamy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>In re Medley</i>,\n\n134 U.\xc2\xa0S. 160,\n170 (1890)\n; see also <i>id.</i>,<i> </i>at 168 (\xe2\x80\x9cA considerable number of the prisoners fell, after even a short [solitary] confinement, into a semi-fatuous condition .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and others became violently insane; others, still, committed suicide\xe2\x80\x9d).  The past centuries\xe2\x80\x99 experience and consideration of this issue is discussed at length in texts such as The Oxford History of the Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society (1995), a joint disciplinary work edited by law professor Norval Morris and professor of medicine and psychiatry David Rothman that discusses the deprivations attendant to solitary confinement.  <i>Id., </i>at 184.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Yet despite scholarly discussion and some commentary from other sources, the condition in which prisoners are kept simply has not been a matter of sufficient public inquiry or interest.  To be sure, cases on prison procedures and conditions do reach the courts.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Plata</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011); <i>Hutto</i> v. <i>Finney</i>,\n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 678,\n685 (1978)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cConfinement in a prison or in an isolation cell is a form of punishment subject to scrutiny under the\n \nEighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Weems</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n217 U.\xc2\xa0S. 349\n\xe2\x80\x93367 (1910).  Sentencing judges, moreover, devote considerable time and thought to their task.  There is no accepted mechanism, however, for them to take into account, when sentencing a defendant, whether the time in prison will or should be served in solitary.  So in many cases, it is as if a judge had no choice but to say: \xe2\x80\x9cIn imposing this capital sentence, the court is well aware that during the many years you will serve in prison before your execution, the penal system has a solitary confinement regime that will bring you to the edge of madness, perhaps to madness itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Even if the law were to condone or permit this added punishment, so stark an outcome ought not to be the result of society\xe2\x80\x99s simple unawareness or indifference.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Too often, discussion in the legal academy and among practitioners and policymakers concentrates simply on the adjudication of guilt or innocence.  Too easily ignored is the question of what comes next.  Prisoners are shut away\xe2\x80\x94out of sight, out of mind.  It seems fair to suggest that, in decades past, the public may have assumed lawyers and judges were engaged in a careful assessment of correctional policies, while most lawyers and judges assumed these matters were for the policymakers and correctional experts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There are indications of a new and growing awareness in the broader public of the subject of corrections and of solitary confinement in particular.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Gonnerman, Before the Law, The New Yorker, Oct. 6, 2014, p. 26 (detailing multiyear solitary confinement of Kalief Browder, who was held\xe2\x80\x94but never tried\xe2\x80\x94for stealing a backpack); Schwirtz &amp; Winerip, Man, Held at Rikers for 3 Years Without Trial, Kills Himself, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, June 9, 2015, p. A18.  And penalogical and psychology experts, including scholars in the legal academy, continue to offer essential information and analysis.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Simon &amp; Sparks, Punishment and Society: The Emergence of an Academic Field, in<i> </i>The SAGE Handbook of Punishment and Society (2013); see also Venters et\xc2\xa0al., Solitary Confinement and Risk of Self-Harm Among Jail Inmates, 104 Am. J. Pub. Health 442 (March 2014); Metzner &amp; Fellner, Solitary Confinement and Mental Illness in U.\xc2\xa0S. Prisons: A Challenge for Medical Ethics, 38 J. Am. Academy Psychiatry and Law 104\xe2\x80\x93108 (2010).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These are but a few examples of the expert scholarship that, along with continued attention from the legal community, no doubt will aid in the consideration of the many issues solitary confinement presents.  And consideration of these issues is needed.  Of course, prison officials must have discretion to decide that in some instances temporary, solitary confinement is a useful or necessary means to impose discipline and to protect prison employees and other inmates.  But research still confirms what this Court suggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total isolation exacts a terrible price.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash. U. J.\xc2\xa0L. &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y 325 (2006) (common side-effects of solitary confinement include anxiety, panic, withdrawal, hallucinations, self-mutilation, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors).  In a case that presented the issue, the judiciary may be required, within its proper jurisdiction and authority, to determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Over 150 years ago, Dostoyevsky wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThe degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.\xe2\x80\x9d The Yale Book of Quotations 210 (F. Shapiro ed. 2006).

In his federal habeas petition, Ayala challenged the state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to permit his attorneys to participate in hearings regarding the legitimacy of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s alleged race-neutral reasons for its strikes.  See <i>Batson </i>v. <i>Kentucky</i>,\n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79\n\xe2\x80\x9398  (1986).  The Court assumes that defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion from these proceedings violated Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights, but concludes that the Ninth Circuit erred in granting habeas relief because there is insufficient reason to believe that counsel could have convinced the trial court to reject the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proffered reasons.  I respectfully dissent.  Given the strength of Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie case and the comparative juror analysis his attorneys could have developed if given the opportunity to do so, little doubt exists that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion from Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Batson </i>hearings substantially influenced the outcome.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">My disagreement with the Court does not stem from its discussion of the applicable standard of review, which simply restates the holding of <i>Fry </i>v. <i>Pliler</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 112\n (2007).  <i>Fry </i>rejected the argument that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, compels federal courts to apply any standard other than that set forth in <i>Brecht </i>v. <i>Abrahamson</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 619 (1993)\n, when assessing the harmlessness of a constitutional error on habeas review.  551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 120.  <i>Brecht</i>, in turn, held that the harmlessness standard federal courts must apply in collateral proceedings is more difficult to meet than the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d standard applicable on direct review.  507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 622\xe2\x80\x93623 (quoting <i>Chapman </i>v. <i>California</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 18,\n24 (1967)\n).  More specifically, under <i>Brecht</i>, a federal court can grant habeas relief only when it concludes that a constitutional error had a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial and injurious effect or influence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on either a jury verdict or a trial court decision.  507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 623<i>.</i>  Later, <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Neal </i>v. <i>McAninch</i>,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 432 (1995)\n, clarified that this standard is satisfied when a reviewing judge \xe2\x80\x9cis in grave doubt about whether\xe2\x80\x9d the error is harmless; that is, when \xe2\x80\x9cthe matter is so evenly balanced that [a judge] feels himself in virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness of the error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 435 (emphasis deleted).  See also <i>ante, </i>at 10 (quoting <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Neal</i>, 513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 436).  Put differently, when a federal court is in equipoise as to whether an error was actually prejudicial, it must \xe2\x80\x9ctreat the error, not as if it were harmless, but as if it affected the verdict (<i>i.e., </i>as if it had a \xe2\x80\x98substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict\xe2\x80\x99).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Neal</i>, 513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 435<i>.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to confirming the <i>Brecht</i> standard\xe2\x80\x99s continued vitality, <i>Fry </i>established its exclusivity.  <i>Fry</i> expressly held that federal habeas courts need not first assess whether a state court unreasonably applied <i>Chapman </i>before deciding whether that error was prejudicial under <i>Brecht.</i>  Such a requirement would \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] no sense .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when the latter [standard] obviously subsumes the former.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fry</i>, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 120<i>. </i> Nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today calls into question this aspect of <i>Fry</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  If a trial error is prejudicial under <i>Brecht</i>\xe2\x80\x99s standard, a state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is necessarily unreasonable.  See <i>ante, </i>at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To apply <i>Brecht</i> to the facts of this case, it is essential to understand the contours of Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s underlying constitutional claim or\xe2\x80\x94perhaps more importantly\xe2\x80\x94to appreciate what his claim is not.  Trial judges assess criminal defendants\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 use of peremptory strikes using the three-part procedure first announced in <i>Batson</i>.  After a defendant makes a \xe2\x80\x9cprima facie showing that a peremptory challenge [was] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. exercised on the basis of race,\xe2\x80\x9d the prosecution is given an opportunity to \xe2\x80\x9coffer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Miller-El </i>v. <i>Cockrell</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322,\n328 (2003)\n.  The court then \xe2\x80\x9cdecid[es] whether it was more likely than not that the challenge was improperly motivated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>California</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 162,\n169,\n170 (2005)\n.  This determination is a factual one, which\xe2\x80\x94as the Court correctly notes\xe2\x80\x94reviewing courts must accord \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98great deference.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante,</i> at 13 (quoting <i>Felkner </i>v. <i>Jackson</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 594,\n598 (2011)\n (<i>per curiam</i>)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, Ayala does not claim that the trial court wrongly rejected his <i>Batson </i>challenges based on the record before it. Rather, Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s claim centers on the exclusion of his attorneys from the <i>Batson </i>hearings.  Ayala contends that there is at least a grave doubt as to whether the trial or appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of his <i>Batson </i>challenges was substantially influenced by the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous refusal to permit his attorneys to appear at the hearings at which those challenges were adjudicated.  Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s conviction must be vacated if there is grave doubt as to whether even just one of his <i>Batson</i> challenges would have been sustained had the defense been present.  <i>Snyder </i>v. <i>Louisiana</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472,\n478 (2008)\n (reversing a conviction after concluding that use of one peremptory strike was racially motivated).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Brecht </i>application begins and ends with a discussion of particular arguments the Ninth Circuit posited Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers could have raised had they been present at his <i>Batson </i>hearings.  This approach fails to account for the basic background principle that must inform the application of <i>Brecht </i>to Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s procedural <i>Batson </i>claim: the \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d insight \xe2\x80\x9cthat secret decisions based on only one side of the story will prove inaccurate more often than those made after hearing from both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kaley</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 16).  Our entire criminal justice system was founded on the premise that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ruth .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is best discovered by powerful statements on both sides of the question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cronic</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648,\n655 (1984)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  There is no reason to believe that <i>Batson </i>hearings are the rare exception to this rule.  Instead, defense counsel could have played at least two critical roles had they been present at Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Batson </i>hearings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys would have been able to call into question the credibility of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s asserted race-neutral justifications for the use of its peremptory strikes.  Of course, a trial court may identify some pretextual reasons on its own, but <i>Snyder</i> held that when assessing a claimed <i>Batson</i> error, \xe2\x80\x9call of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity must be consulted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Snyder</i>, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 478.  Absent an adversarial presentation, a diligent judge may overlook relevant facts or legal arguments in even a straightforward case.  There is also great probative force to a \xe2\x80\x9ccomparative juror analysis\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an analysis of whether the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for using its peremptory strikes against nonwhite jurors apply equally to white jurors whom it would have allowed to serve.  <i>Miller-El </i>v. <i>Dretke</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 231,\n241 (2005)\n.  See also <i>Snyder</i>, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 483 (emphasizing importance of conducting a comparative juror analysis in the trial court).  Trial courts are ill suited to perform this intensive inquiry without defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s assistance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The risk that important arguments will not be considered rises close to a certainty in a capital case like Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s, where jury selection spanned more than three months, involved more than 200 prospective jurors, and generated a record that is massive by any standard.  See <i>Ayala </i>v. <i>Wong</i>, 756 F.\xc2\xa03d 656, 660, 676 (CA9 2014) (case below).  It strains credulity to suggest that a court confronted with this mountain of information necessarily considered all of the facts that would have informed its credibility determination without the presence of defense counsel to help bring them to its attention.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, not only did the exclusion of defense counsel from Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Batson </i>hearings prevent him from making his strongest arguments before the person best situated to assess their merit, it also impeded his ability to raise these claims on appeal.  Because Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers were not afforded any opportunity to respond to the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s race-neutral reasons, we are left to speculate as to whether the trial court actually considered any of the points the defense would have made before it accepted the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s proffered explanations.  Moreover, even if we could divine which of the possible considerations the trial judge took into account, our review would still be unduly constrained by a record that lacks whatever material facts the defense would have preserved had it been on notice of the assertions that it needed to challenge.  Perhaps some of these facts, such as the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 appearance and demeanor, were known to the trial judge, but appellate courts \xe2\x80\x9ccan only serve [their] function when the record is clear as to the relevant facts\xe2\x80\x9d or when they can rely on \xe2\x80\x9cdefense counsel[\xe2\x80\x99s] fail[ure] to point out any such facts after learning of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Thompson</i>, 827 F.\xc2\xa02d 1254, 1261 (CA9 1987).  Neither of these conditions is met here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For the reasons described above, the fact that counsel was wrongfully excluded from Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Batson </i>hearings on its own raises doubt as to whether the outcome of these proceedings\xe2\x80\x94or the appellate courts\xe2\x80\x99 review of them\xe2\x80\x94would have been the same had counsel been present.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  This doubt is exacerbated by the loss of the vast majority of the questionnaires that jurors completed at the start of <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, including those filled out by the seven black and Hispanic jurors against whom the prosecution exercised its peremptory strikes.  The prosecution cited these questionnaires in support of its alleged race-neutral reasons at the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> <i>Batson </i>hearings.  See <i>e.g., </i>App. 283, 298, 312, 314, 316.  Without the underlying documents, however, it is impossible to assess whether the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s characterizations of those prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x99 responses were fair and accurate.  The loss of the questionnaires has also precluded every court that has reviewed this case from performing a comprehensive comparative juror analysis.  The Court today analyzes how the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s statements at the <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> <i>Batson </i>hearings regarding the black and Hispanic jurors\xe2\x80\x99 questionnaires stack up against the actual questionnaires completed by the white seated jurors and alternates.  But there is no way to discern how these representations compare with the answers that were given by white jurors whom the prosecution would have permitted to serve but whom the defense ultimately struck.  See <i>Miller-El </i>v. <i>Dretke</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 244\xe2\x80\x93245 (comparing a juror struck by the prosecution with a juror challenged only by the defense).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The above-described consequences of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s procedural error and the fact that the prosecution struck every potential black or Hispanic juror go a long way toward establishing the degree of uncertainty that <i>Brecht</i> requires.  Keeping these considerations in mind, the next step is to assess the arguments that Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys may have raised had they been allowed to participate at his <i>Batson </i>hearings.  As explained above, Ayala is entitled to habeas relief if a reviewing judge is in \xe2\x80\x9cequipoise\xe2\x80\x9d as to whether his lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 exclusion from the <i>Batson </i>hearings had an \xe2\x80\x9cinjurious effect\xe2\x80\x9d on the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to find by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s peremptory strikes was racially motivated.  With the inquiry so framed, it is easy to see that the Ninth Circuit correctly found that Ayala was actually prejudiced by the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional error.  In particular, there is a substantial likelihood that if defense counsel had been present, Ayala could at least have convinced the trial court that the race-neutral reasons the prosecution put forward for dismissing a black juror, Olanders D., were pretextual.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The prosecution offered three justifications for striking Olanders D.: (1) he might be unable to vote for the death penalty because he had written in his questionnaire that \xe2\x80\x9che does not believe [in] it\xe2\x80\x9d and had failed to fully explain a subsequent change in position; (2) his questionnaire answers were poor; and, (3) he might lack the \xe2\x80\x9cability to fit in with a cohesive group of 12 people.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 283.  The trial court rejected the third of these reasons outright, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cit may well .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be that he would get along very well with 12 people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 283\xe2\x80\x93284<i>.  </i>I have grave misgivings as to whether the trial judge would have found it more likely than not that the first two purported bases were legitimate had defense counsel been given an opportunity to respond to them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys could have challenged the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Olanders D. would hesitate to impose the death penalty by pointing to a seated juror\xe2\x80\x94Ana L.\xe2\x80\x94who made remarkably similar statements concerning capital punishment.  Based on his remarks during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, it appears that Olanders D. suggested on his questionnaire that he was or had been opposed to the death penalty.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  <i>Id.,</i> at 176, 179.  Ana L.\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire contained numerous comparable statements.  When asked to express her \xe2\x80\x9cfeelings about the death penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in taking a life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 108.  And, in response to a question regarding whether she \xe2\x80\x9cwould like to serve as a juror and why?\xe2\x80\x9d, Ana L. said: \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x94If I am selected as a Juror and all Jurors voted for the death penalty I probably would not be able to vote for the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 109.  Finally, on her questionnaire, Ana L. indicated that she believes the death penalty is imposed \xe2\x80\x9c[t]oo often\xe2\x80\x9d and that she strongly disagrees with the \xe2\x80\x9cadage, \xe2\x80\x98An eye for any eye,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which she understood to mean,\xe2\x80\x9c[a] criminal took a life[,] now [it] is our turn to take his.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 108\xe2\x80\x93109.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A direct comparison of Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s and Ana L.\xe2\x80\x99s <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> answers is equally telling.  During <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, Olanders D. clarified that he had not intended his questionnaire to reflect that he was categorically opposed to the death penalty, but only that his views on the topic had evolved over the prior decade and that he had come to believe that the death penalty \xe2\x80\x9cwould be an appropriate sentence under certain circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 176.  To account for this change in his position, Olanders D. cited a number of considerations, including a new understanding of what his religion required, <i>ibid., </i>\xe2\x80\x9cmore familiar[ity] with the laws,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 178, increased violence in our soci-ety, <i>ibid., </i>and conversations with his immediate family, <i>id.,</i> at 180. Ana L., by contrast, stated at <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> that she \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. did not believe in the death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d up until she \xe2\x80\x9c[f]illed out the questionnaire.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 193.  And, only after repeated attempts by both the defense and the prosecution to get her to pinpoint what caused this sudden about face, Ana L. said that she had \xe2\x80\x9clisten[ed] to the Bundy evidence that was said and his being put to death, and I started to think; and I said if they were guilty maybe there is a death sentence for these people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 202.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Based on this record, it requires little speculation to see that defense counsel could have made a powerful argument that Ana L. was equally or even less likely to impose the death penalty than Olanders D.  While both jurors had opposed the death penalty at some point in the past, Olanders D. stated that he had come to believe in capital punishment after a period of sustained deliberation.  Ana L., however, purported to change her view due only to one recent execution and the fact that she had been called to serve as a juror on a capital case.  Moreover, there is no basis to think that the trial court accounted for the similarities between Ana L. and Olanders D.  Approximately two months passed between Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s and Ana L.\xe2\x80\x99s <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> hearings and the date on which the prosecution exercised its peremptory strike against Olanders D.  Without the benefit of defense counsel to help jog his recollection, it is absurd to proceed as if the trial judge actually considered one of more than 200 prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x99 statements concerning the death penalty when ruling on Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Batson </i>motion.  Taken together, it seems highly likely that these arguments\xe2\x80\x94had they been raised\xe2\x80\x94would have convinced the trial judge that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s first alleged reason for striking Olanders D. was pretextual.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As for the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s second purported justification\xe2\x80\x94that his questionnaire responses \xe2\x80\x9cwere poor,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at  283\xe2\x80\x94it is impossible to know what winning arguments the defense could have raised because the questionnaire itself is missing from the record.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  Indeed, for all that is known, counsel may have had a compelling argument that Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s answers were cogent and complete.  Even if some of them were lacking, however, counsel could still have drawn the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s attention to weak questionnaires completed by several of the seated jurors.  For instance, if the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s claim was that Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire answers were conclusory, Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s counsel could have referred the Court to seated juror Charles G.\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire.  In response to a prompt asking prospective jurors to explain why they would or would not like to be empaneled in Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s case, Charles G. wrote only \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 71.  Alternatively, if the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s concern was that Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s answer to a particular question demonstrated an inability to clearly express himself, the defense could have directed the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the questionnaire completed by seated juror Thomas B.  When asked to share his \xe2\x80\x9cimpressions or feelings .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. about gangs based on what [he had] read or s[een],\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas B. stated: \xe2\x80\x9cI feel the only media coverage they get is bad, however, those whom do constructive events usually seek out positive media coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 30.  Finally, it bears noting that if Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers had been able to respond at the <i>Batson </i>hearing, they would have had the questionnaires of many more comparable jurors at their disposal.  It is entirely possible that some of the questionnaires completed by prospective jurors who were accepted by the prosecution but dismissed by the defense were weaker than those completed by Charles G. and Thomas B.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, it is probable that had Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers been present at the <i>Batson </i>hearing on Olanders D., his strong <i>Batson </i>claim would have turned out to be a winning one.  The trial judge rejected one of the reasons advanced by the prosecution on its own and the defense had numerous persuasive arguments that it could have leveled against the remaining two justifications had it been given the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court concludes that Ayala is not entitled to habeas relief because it finds that there is little or no reason to doubt that the trial judge would have accepted both of the above-discussed reasons for striking Olanders D. even if counsel participated at Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Batson </i>hearings.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, however, misunderstands the record and mistakes Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s procedural <i>Batson </i>claim for a direct challenge to a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of a <i>Batson </i>motion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In defense of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s first basis for striking Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x94that he was uncomfortable with the death penalty\xe2\x80\x94the Court begins by asserting that Ana L. was insufficiently similar to Olanders D. to have cast any doubt on the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Olanders D., the Court maintains, \xe2\x80\x9cinitially voiced unequivocal opposition to the death penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas Ana L. \xe2\x80\x9cwrote on [her] questionnaire that she \xe2\x80\x98<i>probably</i> would not be able to vote for the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (emphasis in original).  But the Court has plucked one arguably ambiguous statement from Ana L.\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire while ignoring others (described above) suggesting that she fundamen-tally opposed capital punishment.  More importantly, the Court is not comparing apples with apples.  Because Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire has been lost, there is no way to know the extent to which the views he expressed there were \xe2\x80\x9cunequivocal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Consequently, in support of its contention that Olanders D. originally wrote that he was categorically opposed to the death penalty, the Court relies on his response to a question posed by the prosecution during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>.  To be sure, when asked whether he had stated that he did not \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve in the death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d on his questionnaire, Olanders D. responded: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 179.  During <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, however, Ana L. described the position she had taken in her questionnaire in identical terms, stating: \xe2\x80\x9cI remember saying [on my questionnaire] that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 201.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given the difficulty of differentiating between Ana L.\xe2\x80\x99s and Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s views toward the death penalty based on the record before us, the Court understandably does not press this factual point further.  Instead, it commits a legal error by contending that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s determination is entitled to deference because the judge\xe2\x80\x94unlike this Court\xe2\x80\x94had the benefit of observing both Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s and the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor.  <i>Ante, </i>at 16.  Deference may be warranted when reviewing a substantive <i>Batson </i>claim.  By suggesting that a trial judge can make a sound credibility determination without the benefit of an adversarial proceeding, however, the Court ignores the procedural nature of the constitutional error whose existence it purports to assume.  Courts defer to credibility findings not only because of trial judges\xe2\x80\x99 proximity to courtroom events, but also because of the expectations regarding the procedures used in the proceedings that they oversee.  A decision to credit a prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s race-neutral basis for striking a juror is entitled to great weight if that reason has \xe2\x80\x9csurvive[d] the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cronic</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 656.  It warrants substantially less\xe2\x80\x94if any\xe2\x80\x94deference where, as here, it is made in the absence of the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental instrument for judicial judgment: an adversary proceeding in which both parties may participate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carroll </i>v. <i>President and Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Princess Anne</i>,\n\n393 U.\xc2\xa0S. 175,\n183 (1968)\n; see also <i>Kaley</i>,<i> </i>571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (slip op.,at 16) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt takes little imagination to see that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> proceedings create a heightened risk of error\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the second reason put forward for striking Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x94that his questionnaire was faulty\xe2\x80\x94 fares no better.  As a preliminary matter, perhaps because Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire has been lost, the Court characterizes the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s second proffered reason for dismissing Olanders D. as an objection to <i>all</i> of his \xe2\x80\x9cresponses\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to simply the responses on his <i>questionnaire</i>.  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.  But even if the prosecution had relied on the rationale that the Court now substitutes, there is a real likelihood that the defense would still have been able to undermine its credibility.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court asserts that Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cresponses\xe2\x80\x9d were misleading because he had \xe2\x80\x9cunequivocally\xe2\x80\x9d stated that he did not believe in the death penalty on his questionnaire, but at <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> he said that his views on capital punishment had changed over the previous 10 years.  <i>Ante, </i>at 18.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument thus hinges on the premise that Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire clearly stated that he was opposed to the death penalty.  At least one person, how-ever, did not construe Olander D.\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire to express such a categorical view: defense counsel.  During <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>, one of Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers remarked that she thought Olanders D.\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire \xe2\x80\x9cindicated that [he] had had some change in [his] feelings about the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 176.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]y understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cis that at one time [he] felt one way, and\xe2\x80\x94and then at some point [he] felt differently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Thus, if (as the Court now hypothesizes) the trial court was inclined to accept the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s second reason for striking Olanders D. based on apparent tension between his questionnaire and his statements during <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> (a proposition that is itself uncertain), the defense may have been able to argue persuasively that any claimed inconsistency was illusory.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Batson</i> recognized that it is fundamentally unfair to permit racial considerations to drive the use of peremptory challenges against jurors.  When the prosecution strikes every potential black and Hispanic juror, a reviewing court has a responsibility to ensure that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Batson </i>motion was not influenced by constitutional error.  But there is neither a factual nor a legal basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s confidence that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s race-neutral reasons for striking Olanders D. were unassailable.  Because the Court overlooks that Ayala raised a procedural <i>Batson </i>claim, it scours the record for possible support for the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s credibility determination without accounting for the flaws in the process that led to it.  The proper inquiry is not whether the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s determination can be sustained, but whether it may have been different had counsel been present.  Given the strength of Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie case and the arguments his counsel would have been able to make based even on the limited existing record, grave doubts exist as to whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion from Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Batson </i>hearings was harmless.
