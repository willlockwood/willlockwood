Page being at Canton on 28 March, 1793, endorsed these bills to Van Braam, the defendant in error, and on the same day as the agent of Brown &amp; Francis, drew another set of bills of exchange upon Thomas Dickason &amp; Co. payable, also, at 365 days sight, to Van Braam or order, for \xef\xbf\xbd3,000 sterling.</p>\n<p>On 9 April, 1793, Page, in the same character of agent, drew a similar set of bills in favor of Van Braam, or order, for \xef\xbf\xbd400 sterling.  One bill of each set was presented to Thomas Dickason &amp; Co. in London for acceptance on 31 December, 1793, but were then protested for nonacceptance, of which Brown &amp; Francis had notice on 1 July, 1794, though the bills and protests were not actually returned to them.  The bills were again presented for payment on 15 January, 1795 (that is, 10 days after they were actually due) and protested for nonpayment, of which Brown &amp; Francis had notice on 1 April, 1795.  This action was instituted in the circuit court of November Term, 1796, to recover the amount of the protested bills, with interest, damages, and charges, and the declaration contained a special count on each bill, together with a general <em>indebitatus assumpsit</em> for $40,000, money had and received by the defendants, to the use of the plaintiff.  On the return of the record, it appeared that Francis had died subsequent to the service of the original writ; that Brown came into court and, after suggesting the death of Francis, pleaded the general issue, and that the plaintiff having likewise suggested the death of Francis, "prayed judgment against John Brown, the surviving defendant."
