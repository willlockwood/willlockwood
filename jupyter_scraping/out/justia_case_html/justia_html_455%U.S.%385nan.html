(TWA), brought a federal court class action alleging that TWA practiced unlawful sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by its policy of grounding all female flight attendants who became mothers while their male counterparts who became fathers were permitted to continue flying.  Subsequently, individual members of the class (petitioners in No. 78-1545) were appointed as class representatives to replace the union, which was found to be an inadequate representative.  The District Court later denied TWA\'s motion to exclude class members who had not filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within the time limit specified in Title VII, holding that, while such filing requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite not subject to waiver, any violation by TWA continued against all the class members until TWA changed its challenged policy.  The court also granted the plaintiff class\' motion for summary judgment on the issue of TWA\'s liability for violating Title VII.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment and held that timely filing of EEOC charges was a jurisdictional prerequisite, but declined to extend the "continuing violation" theory so as to include in the plaintiff class those terminated employees who failed to file timely EEOC charges.  However, the court stayed its mandate pending the filing of petitions in this Court, which, in turn, deferred consideration of the petitions pending completion of settlement proceedings in the District Court.  In such proceedings, the District Court designated two subclasses:  Subclass A, consisting of women who were terminated on or after March 20, 1970, and those who were discharged earlier but who had accepted reinstatement in ground positions, and Subclass B, consisting of all other members of the class, whose claims the Court of Appeals had found to be jurisdictionally barred for failure to satisfy the timely filing requirement.

On the basis of the Court of Appeals\' stay of its mandate in its jurisdictional decision, the District Court rejected the union\'s challenge to its jurisdiction over Subclass B.  It also approved the settlement and awarded restoration of retroactive seniority.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the union\'s contention that, because of the Court of Appeals\' earlier opinion, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to approve the settlement or to order retroactive seniority with respect to Subclass B.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. Filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.

The District Court found unlawful discrimination against the plaintiff class as a whole, at a time when the class had not yet been divided into the two subclasses, and the court\'s summary judgment ran in favor of the entire class.  Since the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the District Court had no jurisdiction over claims by those who had not met the filing requirement, and that those individuals should have been excluded from the class prior to the grant of summary judgment, there was no jurisdictional barrier to the District Court\'s finding of discrimination with respect to the entire class.

S. 388</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1970, the Air Line Stewards and Stewardesses Association (ALSSA), then the collective bargaining agent of Trans World Airlines (TWA) flight attendants, brought a class action alleging that TWA practiced unlawful sex discrimination in violation of Title VII by its policy of grounding all female flight cabin attendants who became mothers, while their male counterparts who became fathers were permitted to continue flying.  After collective bargaining eliminated the challenged practice prospectively, the parties in the case reached a tentative settlement.  The settlement, which provided neither backpay nor retroactive seniority, was approved by the District Court.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, however, found the union to be an inadequate representative of the class because of the inherent conflict between the interests of current and former employees.  It remanded the case with instructions that the District Court name individual members of the class to replace ALSSA as the class representative. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Air Line Stewards and Stewardesses Assn. v. American Airlines, Inc.,</em> 490 F.2d 636 (1973).</p>\n<p>Upon remand, petitioners in No. 71545 were appointed as class representatives.  TWA moved to amend its answer to assert that the claims of plaintiffs and other class members were barred by Title VII\'s "statute of limitations" because they had failed to file charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within the statutory time </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 455 U. S. 389</a></p><p> limit.  1 App. 89a. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Although the District Court granted the motion to amend, it noted that the "delay in pleading the defense of limitations may well ultimately constitute a waiver of the defense."  <em>Id.</em> at 101a.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, on October 15, 1976, the District Court denied TWA\'s motion to exclude class members who had not filed timely charges with the EEOC.  In support of its motion, TWA argued that, instead of an affirmative defense analogous to a statute of limitations, timely filing with the EEOC is a jurisdictional prerequisite not subject to waiver by any action of the defendants.  While the District Court agreed that the filing requirements of Title VII are jurisdictional, it denied the motion on the basis that any violation by the airline continued against all the class members until the airline changed the challenged policy.  <em>Id.</em> at 131a-132a.  On October 19, 1976, the District Court granted the motion of the plaintiff class for summary judgment on the issue of TWA\'s liability for violating Title VII.  <em>Id.</em> at 133a-134a.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the order of October 18, 1976, granting summary judgment on liability, expressly holding that "TWA\'s no motherhood policy . . . provides a clear example of sex discrimination prohibited by \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(a)."  <em>In re Consolidated Petrial Proceedings in the Airline Cases,</em> 582 F.2d 1142, 1145 (1978).  It declined, however,</p>\n<p>"to extend the continuing violation theory, as did the district court, so as to include in the plaintiff class those employees who were permanently terminated more than 90 days before the filing of EEOC charges."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1149.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals went on to hold that timely filing of EEOC charges was a jurisdictional prerequisite.  Because TWA could not waive the timely filing requirement, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 455 U. S. 390</a></p><p> Court of Appeals found that approximately 92% of the plaintiffs\' claims were jurisdictionally barred by the failure of those plaintiffs to have filed charges of discrimination with the EEOC within 90 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice.  The Court of Appeals, however, stayed its mandate pending the filing of petitions in this Court. Petitions for certiorari were filed by the plaintiff class, No. 78-1545, and by TWA, No. 78-1549.  This Court granted motions to defer consideration of the petitions pending completion of settlement proceedings in the District Court.  442 U.S. 916 (1979).</p>\n<p>In connection with the settlement proceedings, the District Court designated two subclasses.  Subclass A, consisting of some 30 women, comprised those who were terminated on or after March 2, 1970, as well as those who were discharged earlier, but who had accepted reinstatement in ground duty positions.  Subclass B, numbering some 400 women, covered all other members of the class and consisted of those whose claims the Court of Appeals had found to be jurisdictionally barred for failure to satisfy the timely filing requirement.  2 App. 3.</p>\n<p>The proposed settlement divided $3 million between the two groups.  It also provided each class member with full company and union seniority from the date of termination.  The agreement specified that,</p>\n<p>"in the event of the timely objection of any interested person, it is agreed that the amount of seniority and credit for length of service for the compensation period will be determined by the Court in its discretion, pursuant to the provisions of Section 706(g), and all other applicable provisions of law, without contest or objection by TWA. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]"</p>\n<p>3 App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 80-951, p. 29a. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="391">Page 455 U. S. 391</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Independent Federation of Flight Attendants (union), which had replaced ALSSA as the collective bargaining agent for the flight attendants, was permitted to intervene and to object to the settlement.  On the basis that the Court of Appeals had not issued the mandate in its jurisdictional decision, the District Court rejected the union\'s challenge to its jurisdiction over Subclass B.  <em>Id.</em> at 14a-15a.  After holding three days of hearings, the District Court approved the settlement and awarded competitive seniority.  It explicitly found that full restoration of retroactive seniority would not have an unusual adverse impact upon currently employed flight attendants in any way atypical of Title VII cases.  <em>Id.</em> at 18a-19a.</p>\n<p>The union appealed.  It argued that, because of the Court of Appeals\' earlier opinion, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to approve the settlement or to order retroactive seniority with respect to Subclass B.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, reasoning that</p>\n<p>"the principles favoring settlement of class action lawsuits remain the same regardless of whether the disputed legal issues center on the jurisdiction of the court over the action."</p>\n<p><em>Air Line Stewards and Stewardesses Assn. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</em> 630 F.2d 1164, 1169 (1980).  It further explained that the question of jurisdiction as to Subclass B had not been finally determined, because a challenge to its decision was pending before this Court, and observed that the Courts of Appeals were split on the issue.  The Court of Appeals noted that the District Court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of Subclass A.  It concluded:</p>\n<p>"Where, as here, the jurisdictional question is not settled with finality, parties should not be forced to litigate the issue of jurisdiction if they can arrive at a settlement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="392">Page 455 U. S. 392</a></p><p> that is otherwise appropriate for district court approval."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also affirmed the award of seniority.  According to the court, the settlement served the public policy of remedying past acts of sex discrimination and the consequences of those past acts.  Moreover, "[t]he right to have its objections heard does not, of course, give the intervenor the right to block any settlement to which it objects."  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The union petitioned for certiorari, No. 80-951.  We granted its petition together with the petitions in No. 71545 and No. 71549, 450 U.S. 979 (1981), but later removed the TWA case, No. 71549, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] from the argument docket and limited the grant in No. 80-951.  451 U.S. 980 (1981).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The single question in No. 71545 is whether the timely filing of an EEOC charge is a jurisdictional prerequisite to bringing a Title VII suit in federal court, or whether the requirement is subject to waiver and estoppel.  In reaching its decision that the requirement is jurisdictional, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit relied on its reading of the statutory language, the absence of any indication to the contrary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="393">Page 455 U. S. 393</a></p><p> in the legislative history, and references in several of our cases to the 90-day filing requirement as "jurisdictional." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Other Courts of Appeals that have examined the same materials have reached the opposite conclusion. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>We hold that filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The structure of Title VII, the congressional policy underlying it, and the reasoning of our cases all lead to this conclusion.</p>\n<p>The provision granting district courts jurisdiction under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 20005(e) and (f), does not limit jurisdiction to those cases in which there has been a timely filing with the EEOC. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  It contains no reference to the timely </p><p><a class="page-number" name="394">Page 455 U. S. 394</a></p><p> filing requirement.  The provision specifying the time for filing charges with the EEOC appears as an entirely separate provision, and it does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The legislative history of the filing provision is sparse, but Senator Humphrey did characterize the time period for filing a claim as a "period of limitations," 110 Cong.Rec. 12723 (1964), and Senator Case described its purpose as preventing the pressing of "stale" claims, <em>id.</em> at 7243, the end served by a statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>Although subsequent legislative history is not dispositive, <em>see Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. v. Shell Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/572/case.html">444 U.

S. 686</a></span>, n. 7 (1979), the legislative history of the 1972 amendments also indicates that Congress intended the filing period to operate as a statute of limitations, instead of a jurisdictional requirement.  In the final Conference Committee section-by-section analysis of H.R. 1746, The Equal Opportunity Act of 1972, 118 Cong.Rec. 7166, 7167 (1972), the Committee not only termed the filing period a "time limitation," but explained:</p>\n<p>"This subsection as amended provides that charges be filed within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice.  Court decisions under the present law have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="395">Page 455 U. S. 395</a></p><p> shown an inclination to interpret this time limitation so as to give the aggrieved person the maximum benefit of the law; it is not intended that such court decisions should be in any way circumscribed by the extension of the time limitations in this subsection. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]"</p>\n<p>This result is entirely consistent with prior case law.  Although our cases contain scattered references to the timely filing requirement as jurisdictional, the legal character of the requirement was not at issue in those cases, and as or more often, in the same or other cases, we have referred to the provision as a limitations statute.

The District Court denied relief for unnamed class members on the ground that those individuals had not filed administrative charges under the provisions of Title VII, and that relief for them was thus not appropriate.  The Court of Appeals did not disturb this ruling, but we reversed, saying:</p>\n<p>"The District Court stated two reasons for its denial of seniority relief for the unnamed class members.  The first was that those individuals had not filed administrative charges under the provision of Title VII with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and therefore class relief of this sort was not appropriate.

S. 405</a></span> (1975), would have been without jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims of those who had not filed, as well as without jurisdiction to award them seniority.  We did not so hold.  Furthermore, we noted that Congress had approved the Court of Appeals cases that awarded relief to class members who had not exhausted administrative remedies before the EEOC.  It is evident that, in doing so, Congress necessarily adopted the view that the provision for filing charges with the EEOC should not be construed to erect a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in the district court.</p>\n<p>In <em>Love v. Pullman Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/522/case.html">404 U. S. 522</a></span> (1972), we announced a guiding principle for construing the provisions of Title VII.  Declining to read literally another filing provision of Title VII, we explained that a technical reading would be "particularly inappropriate in a statutory scheme in which laymen, unassisted by trained lawyers, initiate the process."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/522/case.html#527">404 U.

Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/229/case.html">429 U. S. 229</a></span> (1976), we rejected the argument that the timely filing requirement should be tolled because the plaintiff had been pursuing a grievance procedure set up in the collective bargaining agreement.  We did not reach this decision on the basis that the 180-day period was jurisdictional.  Instead, we considered the merits of a series of arguments that grievance procedures should toll the requirement.  Such reasoning would have been gratuitous if the filing requirement were a jurisdictional prerequisite.

Silver,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/807/case.html">447 U. S. 807</a></span> (1980), on the basis that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because of plaintiff\'s failure to comply with a related Title VII time provision.  Instead, we merely observed in a footnote that "[p]etitioner did not assert respondent\'s failure to file the action within 90 days as a defense."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/807/case.html#811">447 U.

We have already rejected the union\'s first contention, namely, that the District Court had no jurisdiction to award relief to those who had not complied with Title VII\'s filing requirement.  The union also contends that, in any event, there has been no finding of discrimination with respect to Subclass B members, and that the predicate for relief under \xc2\xa7 706(g) is therefore missing.  This contention is also without merit.</p>\n<p>The District Court unquestionably found an unlawful discrimination against the plaintiff class, and the class at that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="399">Page 455 U. S. 399</a></p><p> time had not been subdivided into Subclasses A and B.  Summary judgment ran in favor of the entire class, including both those members who had filed timely charges and those who had not.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the summary judgment order as well as the finding of a discriminatory employment practice.  The court went on, however, to hold that the District Court had no jurisdiction over claims by those who had not met the filing requirement, and that those individuals should have been excluded from the class prior to the grant of summary judgment.  But as we have now held, that ruling is erroneous.  The District Court did have jurisdiction over nonfiling class members.  Thus, there was no jurisdictional barrier to its finding of discrimination with respect to the entire class.  With the reversal of the Court of Appeals judgment in No. 71545 and our dismissal of No. 71549, which had challenged the affirmance of the summary judgment order, the order that found classwide discrimination remains intact, and is final.  The award of retroactive seniority to members of Subclass B as well as Subclass A is not infirm for want of a finding of a discriminatory employment practice.</p>\n<p>Equally meritless is the union\'s contention that retroactive seniority contrary to the collective bargaining agreement should not be awarded over the objection of a union that has not itself been found guilty of discrimination.  In <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#764">424 U. S. 764</a></span>, we read the legislative history of Title VII as giving</p>\n<p>"emphatic confirmation that federal courts are empowered to fashion such relief as the particular circumstances of a case may require to effect restitution, making whole in so far as possible the victims of . . . discrimination. . . ."</p>\n<p>While recognizing that backpay was the only remedy specifically mentioned in the provision, we reasoned that adequate relief might be denied without a seniority remedy.  We concluded that the class-based seniority relief for identifiable victims </p><p><a class="page-number" name="400">Page 455 U. S. 400</a></p><p> of illegal discrimination is a form of relief generally appropriate under \xc2\xa7 706(g).</p>\n<p>In <em>Franks,</em> the District Court had found both that the employer had engaged in discrimination and that the discriminatory practices were perpetuated in the collective bargaining agreements with the unions.  424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#751">424 U.

In <em>Teamsters,</em> the parties agreed to a decree which provided that the District Court would decide "whether any discriminatees should be awarded additional equitable relief such as retroactive seniority."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#331">431 U.

In <em>McArthur,</em> the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the approval of a settlement agreement in a Title VII class action, holding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because no plaintiff had filed a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC.  Because of our holding in No. 78-1545 that timely filing with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite, this issue need not be resolved.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Title 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(f)(3), for example, reads:</p>\n<p>"Each United States district court and each United States court of a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this subchapter.

Because the time requirement for filing an unfair labor practice charge under the National Labor Relations Act operates as a statute of limitations subject to recognized equitable doctrines, and not as a restriction of the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, <em>see NLRB v.

The timely charge order was entered on October 15, 1976, three days before the entry of the order finding classwide discrimination.  These orders were consolidated on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  Although the October 18th order, finding discrimination, was affirmed, the Court of Appeals vacated the other order, holding that the members of Subclass B had failed to meet the jurisdictional requirements of Title VII because they had not filed timely claims.  No District Court order was ever actually vacated, because, on the motion of the parties, the Court of Appeals stayed its mandate, and the parties then reached a settlement.

Bowman Transportation Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html">424 U. S. 747</a></span> (1976), timely charges of discrimination had been filed.  Relief was awarded on the theory that current employees were merely being placed in the position they would have enjoyed, relative to the victims, had no discrimination ever taken place.  In contrast, when the victims of discrimination have slept on their rights, it will often be unfair to award them full retroactive seniority at the expense of employees who may have accrued their present seniority in good faith.  When timely charges have not been filed, a district court should consider these equities in determining whether to award competitive status seniority, and the presence of a settlement between the employer and the plaintiffs should not affect the balancing of these equities.  Under any other rule, employers will be able to settle Title VII actions, in part, by bargaining away the rights of current employees.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court refers to <em>United Air Lines v. Evans</em> twice, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/case.html#393">455 U. S. 393</a></span>, n. 6, and at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/case.html#396">455 U. S. 396</a></span>, n. 12; both references are to terms used by the <em>Evans</em> Court in describing the timely filing requirement.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>I am not entirely content with this formalistic resolution of the "timely filing" issue.  But, after almost 12 years of litigation, neither the parties nor the courts have addressed specifically whether the failure to file timely charges should affect the balance of the equities in awarding competitive status seniority.  Rather than prolong this disruptive litigation, it may well be in the best interest of all of the parties to approve the settlement -- as the Court\'s judgment does today.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
