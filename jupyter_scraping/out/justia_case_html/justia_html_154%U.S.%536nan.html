The first two present, in fact, but a single proposition, arising on the special verdict. </p><p> The law authorizing the issue of the bonds by the county required that the railroad company should not sell them at less than par value. The verdict finds that they were sold by the railroad company for 64 cents in the dollar, and submits to the court whether the judgment should be for the interest at the par value of the bonds, or for only 64 per cent. On this point the court was divided, and the question is properly presented by the certificate of division. </p><p> Since this case was certified, that of Woods v. Lawrence Co., 1 Black, 386, was argued at length by learned counsel, and carefully considered by this court. The report of that case shows that all the questions that could arise in this case were decided in that.
