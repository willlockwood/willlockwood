Because there is no legal cause of bail set forth in the proceedings in said suit, and by the refusal of the circuit court to allow his appearance to be entered to said suit, he is unlawfully detained in custody by the marshal of said district."</p>\n<p>"2. Because the Act of Maryland passed in 1715, c. 46, \xc2\xa7 3, is in force in the County of Washington, and nowise repealed, and the petitioner was by virtue of said act entitled to appear to said suit on giving special bail in the sum of one hundred and thirty-three dollars thirty-three and a third cents.  But the court refused to allow him so to appear or to enter bail in said amount."</p>\n<p>"3. Because the petitioner has a legal right to appear without bail, or upon giving bail to the amount required by the act of 1715, c. 46, \xc2\xa7 3, and thereby to be discharged from prison, and the said legal right does not depend on the discretion of the court, but is fixed and regulated by law, and there is other legal remedy for the petitioner in the premises."</p>\n<p>"ROBERT J.

That thereupon your petitioner moved to enter his appearance to said suit upon giving good and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 55 U.

The sufficiency of said bail for said amount was fully admitted by said court, as will appear by reference to said transcript of the record, but the court overruled said application upon the express ground that your petitioner was bound to enter special bail to said action in the amount of the sum sworn to in the affidavit of said Ewing, which sum is shown in said affidavit to be four thousand nine hundred and seventy dollars.  Your petitioner is advised that the aforesaid recited act of the Legislature of Maryland is in full force in Washington County aforesaid, and that under and by virtue of said law it was the duty of the marshal to require no greater appearance bail, and of the court to require no greater special bail than the amount specified in said act where no copy of the declaration is sent to be served with the writ, and your petitioner is also advised that there is in said affidavit no legal cause of bail whatever.  Wherefore, inasmuch as the said circuit court has refused both of said applications for an appearance on the part of your petitioner to said suit, and as the law provides no other adequate remedy in the premises whereby your petitioner can, before the final determination of said suit, regain his personal liberty, whereof he is now illegally and unjustifiably deprived, your petitioner prays that the writ of mandamus may be issued and directed to the judges of said circuit court commanding and enjoining them to receive the appearance of your petitioner to said action, either without requiring special bail or upon your petitioner\'s causing good and sufficient special bail to be entered to said action in the sum of one hundred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-three cents and one-third of a cent."</p>\n<p>And, as in duty bound, your petitioner will ever pray, &amp;c.</p>\n<p>"ROBERT J.

Smith, Clerk of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for the County of Washington, hereby certify that the aforegoing is a full and perfect transcript of all the proceedings had in the said court in the said case of Thomas Ewing, Jr., against David Taylor, as appears from the minutes of the proceedings of said court."</p>\n<p>"In testimony whereof, I have hereunto subscribed my name, and affixed the seal of said court, this 10th December, 1852."</p>\n<p>"[SEAL]                                        JNO. A. SMITH, <em>Clerk</em>"</p>\n<p>It appears in this case that a suit was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for Washington County, in the District of Columbia, by Thomas Ewing, Jr., against David Taylor, to recover a sum of money which he alleged to be due to him upon a contract which is set forth in the proceedings, and also for services rendered to Taylor at his instance and request.</p>\n<p>The writ issued on the 4th of October, 1852, returnable to the October term, which began on the third Monday of the same month.  And at the time of issuing the writ, the plaintiff filed his declaration containing the usual money counts and also an affidavit stating the amount due and the nature of his claim; that the debt was contracted in Washington County, in the District of Columbia, and that Taylor, being then in said county and district, was about to remove from it and remove his property, rights, and credits in order to avoid the payment of this debt.</p>\n<p>The marshal arrested Taylor and made his return upon the writ "Cepi in jail," and thereupon Taylor appeared in court in the custody of the marshal, and by his counsel moved for leave to appear on common bail.  But the court refused to permit him to appear and to discharge him from custody until he should give bail to the amount of the debt sworn to in the affidavit of the plaintiff.  Taylor then moved for leave to appear upon giving bail in the sum of one hundred and thirty-three dollars thirty-three and a third cents, claiming that he was entitled to be discharged upon giving bail to that amount under the act of assembly of Maryland of 1715, which act, together with the other laws of Maryland in force when the United </p><p><a class="page-number" name="12">Page 55 U. S. 12</a></p><p> States assumed jurisdiction over this District, were adopted by Congress as the laws of Washington County.</p>\n<p>But the circuit court adhered to its decision and refused to permit the party to appear without giving bail to the amount claimed in the plaintiff\'s affidavit.</p>\n<p>Upon this state of the case, Taylor moves for a rule on the judges of the circuit court to show cause why a mandamus shall not be issued from this Court commanding the judges of the circuit court to permit Taylor to appear to the above-mentioned suit on common bail in order that he may be discharged from the custody of the marshal, and failing that motion, then to show cause why he should not be permitted to appear upon giving bail to the amount of one hundred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-three and one-third cents under the provisions of the Maryland law.</p>\n<p>According to the established practice of this Court, a rule of this kind is not granted as a matter of course, and the inferior court is never called on to show cause unless a case is presented which <em>prima facie</em> requires the interposition of this Court.  It was so settled in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/36/173/case.html">Postmaster General v. Trig,,</a></span></em> 11 Pet. 173.</p>\n<p>We proceed, then, to inquire whether such a case has been presented to support this motion.</p>\n<p>The proceedings by which Taylor was arrested and held in custody were under the Act of Congress of August 1, 1842, 5 Stat. 498.  This act provides that no person shall be held to bail in any suit in the District of Columbia, unless upon such an affidavit as is described in the law, which must be filed previously to the issuing of the writ.</p>\n<p>It is insisted on behalf of Taylor that he was entitled to his discharge from custody upon entering an appearance by his attorney to the suit, because, as he alleges, the affidavit filed in the suit does not conform to the provisions of the act of Congress, and therefore was not sufficient under that law to justify the court in demanding bail.</p>\n<p>But that is a question which this Court cannot consider.  The act of Congress provides that the sufficiency of the affidavit to hold to bail and the amount of bail to be given shall, upon application of the defendant, be decided by the court in term time, and by a single judge in vacation.  In deciding upon the application to discharge Taylor from the custody of the marshal, the court must necessarily have considered and interpreted the act of Congress, as well as the affidavit, and determined whether the affidavit was sufficient or not.  And certainly, even in England, the King\'s Bench never claimed or exercised the power to issue a mandamus to an inferior court of record commanding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="13">Page 55 U. S. 13</a></p><p> it to reverse its judgment in a matter where the law authorized it to judge.  In the case before us, the power of deciding on the sufficiency of the affidavit and the amount of bail is a part of the judicial power of the court.  It has exercised this power, and passed its judgment.  We do not mean to say that this judgment is in any respect erroneous.  But assuming it to be so, this Court cannot, by mandamus, command them to reverse it.  The writ has never been extended so far, nor ever used to control the discretion and judgment of an inferior court of record acting within the scope of its judicial authority.  There is no ground, therefore, for the rule under the act of Congress.</p>\n<p>The application under the Maryland act of 1715 is equally untenable. The provision in that act relied on in support of the motion was never held in Maryland to apply to anything but the bail bonds to be taken by the sheriff in certain cases, and never influenced the decision of the courts as to the amount of bail to be required when the defendant was brought into court.  But it is unnecessary to speak of that act or of the construction it received in the courts of Maryland, because the right of the plaintiff in the circuit court to demand bail depends altogether upon the act of Congress.  And if there is any discrepancy between this act and the act of assembly of 1715, the act of Congress must govern, and is a repeal <em>pro tanto</em> of the Maryland law.</p>\n<p>The rule to show cause is therefore</p>\n<p><em>Refused.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
