The Court of Appeals effectively has deprived petitioners of the protection afforded by Rule 5(b), even though there is no reason to believe that they were less vulnerable to the overbearing effects of custodial interrogation. The policies underlying Rule 5(b) apply with as much force to the accused already in custody pursuant to an unrelated conviction as they do to the accused in custody solely on the basis of the alleged offense. Indeed, in the case at hand, the danger of overreaching by prison officials is vividly apparent from the very fact that petitioners were placed in segregated confinement. Certainly, it cannot be suggested that petitioners, because they previously had been convicted of another offense, were any less entitled to the rudimentary procedures afforded to a person who stands accused of a crime. </p><p> I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari solely to consider whether petitioners should have been arraigned promptly after the alleged offense. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] Rule 5(a) provides:</p><ul>\'An officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner or before any other nearby officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States. When a person arrested with a warrant is brought before a commissioner or other officer, a complaint shall be filed forthwith.\' </ul> <p>Rule 5 was amended, effective October 1, 1972.
