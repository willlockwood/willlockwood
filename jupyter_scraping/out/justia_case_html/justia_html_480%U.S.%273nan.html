She was discharged in 1979 after suffering a third relapse of tuberculosis within two years.  After she was denied relief in state administrative proceedings, she brought suit in federal court, alleging that the school board\'s decision to dismiss her because of her tuberculosis violated \xc2\xa7 504 of the Act. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>A trial was held in the District Court, at which the principal medical evidence was provided by Marianne McEuen, M.D., an assistant director of the Community Tuberculosis Control Service of the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.  According to the medical records reviewed by Dr. McEuen, Arline was hospitalized for tuberculosis in 1957.  App. 11-12.  For the next 20 years, Arline\'s disease was in remission.  <em>Id.</em> at 32.  Then, in 1977, a culture revealed that tuberculosis was again active in her system; cultures taken in March, 1978, and in November, 1978, were also positive.  <em>Id.</em> at 12.</p>\n<p>The superintendent of schools for Nassau County, Craig Marsh, then testified as to the school board\'s response to Arline\'s medical reports.  After both her second relapse, in the spring of 1978 and her third relapse in November 1978, the school board suspended Arline with pay for the remainder of the school year.  <em>Id.</em> at 49-51.  At the end of the 1978-1979 school year, the school board held a hearing, after which it discharged Arline, "not because she had done anything wrong," but because of the "continued reoccurence [<em>sic</em>] of tuberculosis."  <em>Id.</em> at 49-52.</p>\n<p>In her trial memorandum, Arline argued that it was</p>\n<p>"not disputed that the [school board dismissed her] solely on the basis of her illness.  Since the illness in this case qualifies the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="277">Page 480 U. S. 277</a></p><p> Plaintiff as a \'handicapped person,\' it is clear that she was dismissed solely as a result of her handicap in violation of Section 504."</p>\n<p>Record 119.  The District Court held, however, that, although there was "[n]o question that she suffers a handicap," Arline was nevertheless not "a handicapped person under the terms of that statute."  App. to Pet. for Cert. C-2.  The court found it "difficult . . . to conceive that Congress intended contagious diseases to be included within the definition of a handicapped person."  The court then went on to state that, "even assuming" that a person with a contagious disease could be deemed a handicapped person, Arline was not "qualified" to teach elementary school.  <em>Id.</em> at C-2-C-3.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that "persons with contagious diseases are within the coverage of section 504," and that Arline\'s condition "falls . . . neatly within the statutory and regulatory framework" of the Act.  772 F.2d 759, 764 (CA11 1985).  The court remanded the case</p>\n<p>"for further findings as to whether the risks of infection precluded Mrs. Arline from being \'otherwise qualified\' for her job and, if so, whether it was possible to make some reasonable accommodation for her in that teaching position"</p>\n<p>or in some other position.  <em>Id.</em> at 765 (footnote omitted).  We granted certiorari, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/1118/case.html">475 U. S. 1118</a></span> (1986), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In enacting and amending the Act, Congress enlisted all programs receiving federal funds in an effort</p>\n<p>"to share with handicapped Americans the opportunities for an education, transportation, housing, health care, and jobs that other Americans take for granted."</p>\n<p>123 Cong.Rec. 13515 (1977) (statement of Sen. Humphrey).  To that end, Congress not only increased federal support for vocational rehabilitation, but also addressed the broader problem of discrimination against the handicapped by including \xc2\xa7 504, an antidiscrimination provision patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights </p><p><a class="page-number" name="278">Page 480 U. S. 278</a></p><p> Act of 1964. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States, as defined in section 706(7) of this title, shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . ."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 794.  In 1974, Congress expanded the definition of "handicapped individual" for use in \xc2\xa7 504 to read as follows: [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="279">Page 480 U. S. 279</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"[A]ny person who (i) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person\'s major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 706(7)(B).  The amended definition reflected Congress\' concern with protecting the handicapped against discrimination stemming not only from simple prejudice, but also from "archaic attitudes and laws" and from</p>\n<p>"the fact that the American people are simply unfamiliar with and insensitive to the difficulties confront[ing] individuals with handicaps."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 93-1297, p. 50 (1974).  To combat the effects of erroneous but nevertheless prevalent perceptions about the handicapped, Congress expanded the definition of "handicapped individual" so as to preclude discrimination against "[a] person who has a record of, or is regarded as having, an impairment.[but who] may at present have no actual incapacity at all."  <em>Southeastern Community College v.

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In determining whether a particular individual is handicapped as defined by the Act, the regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services are of significant assistance.  As we have previously recognized, these regulations were drafted with the oversight and approval of Congress, <em>see Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Darrone,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/624/case.html">465 U. S. 624</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/624/case.html#634">465 U.

The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="280">Page 480 U. S. 280</a></p><p> regulations are particularly significant here because they define two critical terms used in the statutory definition of handicapped individual. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  "Physical impairment" is defined as follows:</p>\n<p>"[A]ny physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems:  neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive, digestive, genitourinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine."</p>\n<p>45 CFR \xc2\xa7 84.3(j)(2)(i) (1985).  In addition, the regulations define "major life activities" as</p>\n<p>"functions such as caring for one\'s self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 84.3(j)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Within this statutory and regulatory framework, then, we must consider whether Arline can be considered a handicapped individual.  According to the testimony of Dr. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="281">Page 480 U. S. 281</a></p><p> McEuen, Arline suffered tuberculosis "in an acute form in such a degree that it affected her respiratory system," and was hospitalized for this condition.  App. 11.  Arline thus had a physical impairment as that term is defined by the regulations, since she had a "physiological disorder or condition . . . affecting [her] . . . respiratory [system]."  45 CFR \xc2\xa7 84.3(j)(2)(i) (1985).  This impairment was serious enough to require hospitalization, a fact more than sufficient to establish that one or more of her major life activities were substantially limited by her impairment.  Thus, Arline\'s hospitalization for tuberculosis in 1957 suffices to establish that she has a "record of . . . impairment" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 706(7)(B)(ii), and is therefore a handicapped individual.</p>\n<p>Petitioners concede that a contagious disease may constitute a handicapping condition to the extent that it leaves a person with "diminished physical or mental capabilities," Brief for Petitioners 15, and concede that Arline\'s hospitalization for tuberculosis in 1957 demonstrates that she has a record of a physical impairment, <em>see</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-53.  Petitioners maintain, however, that Arline\'s record of impairment is irrelevant in this case, since the school board dismissed Arline not because of her diminished physical capabilities, but because of the threat that her relapses of tuberculosis posed to the health of others. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="282">Page 480 U. S. 282</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We do not agree with petitioners that, in defining a handicapped individual under \xc2\xa7 504, the contagious effects of a disease can be meaningfully distinguished from the disease\'s physical effects on a claimant in a case such as this.  Arline\'s contagiousness and her physical impairment each resulted from the same underlying condition, tuberculosis.  It would be unfair to allow an employer to seize upon the distinction between the effects of a disease on others and the effects of a disease on a patient and use that distinction to justify discriminatory treatment. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Nothing in the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 504 suggests that Congress intended such a result.  That history demonstrates that Congress was as concerned about the effect of an impairment on others as it was about its effect on the individual.  Congress extended coverage, in 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 706(7)(B)(iii), to those individuals who are simply "regarded as having" a physical or mental impairment. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The Senate Report provides as an example of a person who would be covered under this subsection "a person with some kind of visible physical impairment which in fact does not substantially limit that person\'s functioning."  S.Rep. No. 93-1297, at 64. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="283">Page 480 U. S. 283</a></p><p> Such an impairment might not diminish a person\'s physical or mental capabilities, but could nevertheless substantially limit that person\'s ability to work as a result of the negative reactions of others to the impairment. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="284">Page 480 U. S. 284</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Allowing discrimination based on the contagious effects of a physical impairment would be inconsistent with the basic purpose of \xc2\xa7 504, which is to ensure that handicapped individuals are not denied jobs or other benefits because of the prejudiced attitudes or the ignorance of others.  By amending the definition of "handicapped individual" to include not only those who are actually physically impaired, but also those who are regarded as impaired and who, as a result, are substantially limited in a major life activity, Congress acknowledged that society\'s accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Few aspects of a handicap give rise to the same level of public fear and misapprehension as contagiousness. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Even those who suffer or have recovered from such noninfectious diseases as epilepsy or cancer have faced discrimination based on the irrational fear that they might be contagious. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The Act is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="285">Page 480 U. S. 285</a></p><p> carefully structured to replace such reflexive reactions to actual or perceived handicaps with actions based on reasoned and medically sound judgments:  the definition of "handicapped individual" is broad, but only those individuals who are both handicapped <em>and</em> otherwise qualified are eligible for relief.  The fact that <em>some</em> persons who have contagious diseases may pose a serious health threat to others under certain circumstances does not justify excluding from the coverage of the Act <em>all</em> persons with actual or perceived contagious diseases.  Such exclusion would mean that those accused of being contagious would never have the opportunity to have their condition evaluated in light of medical evidence and a determination made as to whether they were "otherwise qualified."  Rather, they would be vulnerable to discrimination on the basis of mythology -- precisely the type of injury Congress sought to prevent. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  We conclude that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="286">Page 480 U.

To answer this question in most cases, the district court will need to conduct an individualized inquiry and make appropriate findings of fact.  Such an inquiry is essential if \xc2\xa7 504 is to achieve its goal of protecting handicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of grantees as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The basic factors to be considered in conducting this inquiry are well established.

In making these findings, courts normally should defer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health officials. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The next step in the "otherwise-qualified" inquiry is for the court to evaluate, in light of these medical findings, whether the employer could reasonably accommodate the employee under the established standards for that inquiry.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F17" name="T17">n</a> 17, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>Because of the paucity of factual findings by the District Court, we, like the Court of Appeals, are unable at this stage of the proceedings to resolve whether Arline is "otherwise qualified" for her job.  The District Court made no findings as to the duration and severity of Arline\'s condition, nor as to the probability that she would transmit the disease.  Nor did the court determine whether Arline was contagious at the time she was discharged, or whether the School Board could </p><p><a class="page-number" name="289">Page 480 U.

The range of programs subject to \xc2\xa7 504\'s prohibition is broader, however, than that covered by Title VI, because \xc2\xa7 504 covers employment discrimination even in programs that receive federal aid with a primary objective other than the promotion of employment.  <em>See Consolidated Rail Corporation v.

After reviewing the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\'s subsequent attempt to devise regulations to implement the Act, however, Congress concluded that the definition of "handicapped individual," while appropriate for the vocational rehabilitation provisions in Titles I and III of the Act, was too narrow to deal with the range of discriminatory practices in housing, education, and health care programs which stemmed from stereotypical attitudes and ignorance about the handicapped.

The United States contends that this is true in the case of some carriers of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) virus.  From this premise, the United States concludes that discrimination solely on the basis of contagiousness is never discrimination on the basis of a handicap.  The argument is misplaced in this case, because the handicap here, tuberculosis, gave rise both to a physical impairment and to contagiousness.  This case does not present, and we therefore do not reach, the questions whether a carrier of a contagious disease such as AIDS could be considered to have a physical impairment, or whether such a person could be considered, solely on the basis of contagiousness, a handicapped person as defined by the Act.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Congress\' desire to prohibit discrimination based on the effects a person\'s handicap may have on others was evident from the inception of the Act.

At oral argument, the United States took the position that a condition such as cosmetic disfigurement could not substantially limit a major life activity within the meaning of the statute, because the only major life activity that it would affect would be the ability to work.  The United States recognized that "working" was one of the major life activities listed in the regulations, but said that to argue that a condition that impaired only the ability to work was a handicapping condition was to make "a totally circular argument which lifts itself by its bootstraps."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 15-16.  The argument is not circular, however, but direct.  Congress plainly intended the Act to cover persons with a physical or mental impairment (whether actual, past, or perceived) that substantially limited one\'s ability to work.

It is evident, however, that our holding is premised on the plain language of the Act, and on the detailed regulations that implement it, neither of which the dissent discusses and both of which support the conclusion that those with a contagious disease such as tuberculosis may be considered "handicapped" under the Act.  We also find much support in the legislative history, while the dissent is unable to find any evidence to support its view.  Accordingly, the dissent\'s construction of the Act to exclude those afflicted with a contagious disease is not only arbitrary (and therefore unfair) but unfaithful to basic canons of statutory construction.</p>\n<p>Nothing in <em>Pennhurst</em> requires such infidelity.  The statutory provision at issue there was held to be "simply a general statement of <em>findings,\'" and to express "no more than . . . a congressional preference for certain kinds of treatment."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html#19">451 U.

The contrast between the congressional preference at issue in <em>Pennhurst</em> and the antidiscrimination mandate of \xc2\xa7 504 could not be more stark.\n</em></p>\n<p>Nor is there any reason to think that today\'s decision will extend the Act beyond manageable bounds.  Construing \xc2\xa7 504 not to exclude those with contagious diseases will complement, rather than complicate, state efforts to enforce public health laws.  As we state <em>infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/273/case.html#288">480 U.

Conforming employment decisions with medically reasonable judgments can hardly be thought to threaten the States\' regulation of communicable diseases.  Indeed, because the Act requires employers to respond rationally to those handicapped by a contagious disease, the Act will assist local health officials by helping remove an important obstacle to preventing the spread of infectious diseases:  the individual\'s reluctance to report his or her condition.  It is not surprising, then, that in their brief as <em>amici curiae</em> in support of respondent, the States of California, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin conclude that</p>\n<p>"inclusion of communicable diseases within the ambit of Section 504 does not reorder the priorities of state regulatory agencies . . .

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  When faced </p><p><a class="page-number" name="291">Page 480 U. S. 291</a></p><p> with such extensive regulation, this Court has declined to read the Rehabilitation Act expansively.  <em>See Bowen v.

The record in this case leaves no doubt that Arline was discharged because of the contagious nature of tuberculosis, and not because of any diminished physical or mental capabilities resulting from her condition. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Thus, in the language of \xc2\xa7 504, the central question here is whether discrimination on the basis of contagiousness constitutes discrimination "by reason of . . . handicap."  Because the language of the Act, regulations, and legislative history are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="292">Page 480 U. S. 292</a></p><p> silent on this issue, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] the principles outlined above compel the conclusion that contagiousness is not a handicap within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 504.  It is therefore clear that the protections of the Act do not extend to individuals such as Arline.</p>\n<p>In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court never questions that Arline was discharged because of the threat her condition posed to others.  Instead, it posits that the contagious effects of a disease cannot be "meaningfully" distinguished from the disease\'s effect on a claimant under the Act.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/273/case.html#282">480 U. S. 282</a></span>.  To support this position, the Court observes that Congress intended to extend the Act\'s protections to individuals who have a condition that does not impair their mental and physical capabilities, but limits their major life activities because of the adverse reactions of others.  This congressional recognition of a handicap resulting from the reactions of others, we are told, reveals that Congress intended the Rehabilitation Act to regulate discrimination on the basis of contagiousness.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/273/case.html#284">480 U. S. 284</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This analysis misses the mark in several respects.  To begin with, Congress\' recognition that an individual may be handicapped under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="293">Page 480 U. S. 293</a></p><p> the Act solely by reason of the reactions of others in no way demonstrates that, for the purposes of interpreting the Act, the reactions of others to the condition cannot be considered separately from the effect of the condition on the claimant.  In addition, the Court provides no basis for extending the Act\'s generalized coverage of individuals suffering discrimination as a result of the reactions of others to coverage of individuals with contagious diseases.  Although citing examples of handicapped individuals described in the regulations and legislative history, the Court points to nothing in these materials suggesting that Congress contemplated that a person with a condition posing a threat to the health of others may be considered handicapped under the Act. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Even in an ordinary case of statutory construction, such meager proof of congressional intent would not be determinative.  The Court\'s evidence, therefore, could not possibly provide the basis for "knowing acceptance" by such entities as the Nassau County School Board that their receipt of federal funds is conditioned on Rehabilitation Act regulation of public health issues.  <em>Pennhurst</em>, 451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html#17">451 U.
