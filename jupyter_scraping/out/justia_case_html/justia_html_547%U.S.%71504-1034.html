S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a), 1342(a), and defines \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71362(7).  The Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), which issues permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, interprets \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d expansively to include not only traditional navigable waters, 33 CFR \xc2\xa7328.3(a)(1), but also other defined waters, \xc2\xa7328.3(a)(2), (3); \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ributaries\xe2\x80\x9d of such waters, \xc2\xa7328.3(a)(5); and wetlands \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d to such waters and tributaries, \xc2\xa7328.3(a)(7).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]djacent\xe2\x80\x9d wetlands include those \xe2\x80\x9cbordering, contiguous [to], or neighboring\xe2\x80\x9d waters of the United States even when they are \xe2\x80\x9cseparated from [such] waters \xe2\x80\xa6 by man-made dikes \xe2\x80\xa6 and the like.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7328.3(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases involve four Michigan wetlands lying near ditches or man-made drains that eventually empty into traditional navigable waters.  In No. 04\xe2\x80\x931034, the United States brought civil enforcement proceedings against the Rapanos petitioners, who had backfilled three of the areas without a permit.  The District Court found federal jurisdiction over the wetlands because they were adjacent to \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and held petitioners liable for CWA violations.  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit found federal jurisdiction based on the sites\xe2\x80\x99 hydrologic connections to the nearby ditches or drains, or to more remote navigable waters.  In No. 04\xe2\x80\x931384, the Carabell petitioners were denied a permit to deposit fill in a wetland that was separated from a drainage ditch by an impermeable berm.  The Carabells sued, but the District Court found federal jurisdiction over the site.  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit held that the wetland was adjacent to navigable waters.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The judgments are vacated, and the cases are remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x931034, 376 F.\xc2\xa03d 629, and No. 04\xe2\x80\x931384, 391 F.\xc2\xa03d 704, vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d includes only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water \xe2\x80\x9cforming geographic features\xe2\x80\x9d that are described in ordinary parlance as \xe2\x80\x9cstreams,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9coceans, rivers, [and] lakes,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed.), and does not include channels through which water flows intermittently or ephemerally, or channels that periodically provide drainage for rainfall.  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 expansive interpretation of that phrase is thus not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A.

S. 121</a>, 133, the CWA authorizes federal jurisdiction only over \xe2\x80\x9cwaters.\xe2\x80\x9d  The use of the definite article \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d and the plural number \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d show plainly that \xc2\xa71362(7) does not refer to water in general, but more narrowly to water \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s found in streams,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9coceans, rivers, [and] lakes,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed.).  Those terms all connote relatively permanent bodies of water, as opposed to ordinarily dry channels through which water occasionally or intermittently flows.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s use of the traditional phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d further confirms that the CWA confers jurisdiction only over relatively permanent bodies of water.  Traditionally, such \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d included only discrete bodies of water, and the term still carries some of its original substance, <em>SWANCC, supra,</em> at 172.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in the CWA likewise confirms this limitation.  See, <em>e.g., Riverside Bayview, supra, </em>at 131.  And the CWA itself categorizes the channels and conduits that typically carry intermittent flows of water separately from \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d including them in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98point sources,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(14).  Moreover, only the foregoing definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d is consistent with CWA\xe2\x80\x99s stated policy \xe2\x80\x9cto recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the States \xe2\x80\xa6 to plan the development and use \xe2\x80\xa6 of land and water resources \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71251(b).  In addition, \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d hardly qualifies as the clear and manifest statement from Congress needed to authorize intrusion into such an area of traditional state authority as land-use regulation; and to authorize federal action that stretches the limits of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s commerce power.  See <em>SWANCC, supra, </em>at 173.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0A wetland may not be considered \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent to\xe2\x80\x9d remote \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d based on a mere hydrologic connection.  <em>Riverside Bayview </em>rested on an inherent ambiguity in defining where the \xe2\x80\x9cwater\xe2\x80\x9d ends and its abutting (\xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d) wetlands begin, permitting the Corps to rely on ecological considerations only to resolve that ambiguity in favor of treating all abutting wetlands as waters.  Isolated ponds are not \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in their own right, see <em>SWANCC, supra,</em> at 167, 171, and present no boundary-drawing problem justifying the invocation of such ecological factors.  Thus, only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between the two, are \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d to such waters and covered by the Act.  Establishing coverage of the Rapanos and Carabell sites requires finding that the adjacent channel contains a relatively permanent \xe2\x80\x9cwate[r] of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and that each wetland has a continuous surface connection to that water, making it difficult to determine where the water ends and the wetland begins.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Because the Sixth Circuit applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered \xe2\x80\x9cwaters,\xe2\x80\x9d and because of the paucity of the record, the cases are remanded for further proceedings.  P.\xc2\xa039.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy concluded that the Sixth Circuit correctly recognized that a water or wetland constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act if it possesses a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d to waters that are navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so made, <em>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.</em> v. <em>Army Corps of Engineers, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/531/159/index.html"></a><a href="/us/531/159/index.html">531 U. S. 159</a>, 167, 172 <em>(SWANCC), </em>but did not consider all the factors necessary to determine that the lands in question had, or did not have, the requisite nexus.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/121/index.html"></a><a href="/us/474/121/index.html">474 U. S. 121</a>, and <em>SWANCC </em>establish the framework for the inquiry here.  The nexus required must be assessed in terms of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s goals and purposes.  Congress enacted the law to \xe2\x80\x9crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters,\xe2\x80\x9d 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(a), and it pursued that objective by restricting dumping and filling in \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a), 1362(12).  The rationale for the Act\xe2\x80\x99s wetlands regulation, as the Corps has recognized, is that wetlands can perform critical functions related to the integrity of other waters\xe2\x80\x94such as pollutant trapping, flood control, and runoff storage.  33 C. F.\xc2\xa0R. \xc2\xa7320.4(b)(2).  Accordingly, wetlands possess the requisite nexus, and thus come within the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d if the wetlands, alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters understood as navigable in the traditional sense.  When, in contrast, their effects on water quality are speculative or insubstantial, they fall outside the zone fairly encompassed by the term \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 theory of jurisdiction in these cases\xe2\x80\x94adjacency to tributaries, however remote and insubstantial\xe2\x80\x94goes beyond the <em>Riverside Bayview </em>holding, its assertion of jurisdiction cannot rest on that case.  The breadth of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 existing standard for tributaries\xe2\x80\x94which seems to leave room for regulating drains, ditches, and streams remote from any navigable-in-fact water and carrying only minor water-volumes toward it\xe2\x80\x94precludes that standard\xe2\x80\x99s adoption as the determinative measure of whether adjacent wetlands are likely to play an important role in the integrity of an aquatic system comprising navigable waters as traditionally understood.  Absent more specific regulations, the Corps must establish a significant nexus on a case-by-case basis when seeking to regulate wetlands based on adjacency to nonnavigable tributaries, in order to avoid unreasonable applications of the Act.  In the instant cases the record contains evidence pointing to a possible significant nexus, but neither the agency nor the reviewing courts considered the issue in these terms.  Thus, the cases should be remanded for further proceedings.

Rapanos backfilled wetlands on a parcel of land in Michigan that he owned and sought to develop.  This parcel included 54 acres of land with sometimes-saturated soil conditions.  The nearest body of navigable water was 11 to 20 miles away.  339 F.\xc2\xa03d 447, 449 (CA6 2003) <em>(Rapanos I)</em>.  Regulators had informed Mr. Rapanos that his saturated fields were \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(7), that could not be filled without a permit.  Twelve years of criminal and civil litigation ensued.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The burden of federal regulation on those who would deposit fill material in locations denominated \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d is not trivial.  In deciding whether to grant or deny a permit, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) exercises the discretion of an enlightened despot, relying on such factors as \xe2\x80\x9ceconomics,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9caesthetics,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crecreation,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin general, the needs and welfare of the people,\xe2\x80\x9d 33 CFR \xc2\xa7320.4(a) (2004).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The average applicant for an individual permit spends 788 days and $271,596 in completing the process, and the average applicant for a nationwide permit spends 313 days and $28,915\xe2\x80\x94not counting costs of mitigation or design changes.

These costs cannot be avoided, because the Clean Water Act \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[s] criminal liability,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as steep civil fines, \xe2\x80\x9con a broad range of ordinary industrial and commercial activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hanousek</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/1102/index.html">528 U. S. 1102</a>, 1103 (2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  In this litigation, for example, for backfilling his own wet fields, Mr. Rapanos faced 63 months in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in criminal and civil fines.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rapanos, </em>235 F.\xc2\xa03d 256, 260 (CA6 2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The enforcement proceedings against Mr. Rapanos are a small part of the immense expansion of federal regulation of land use that has occurred under the Clean Water Act\xe2\x80\x94without any change in the governing statute\xe2\x80\x94during the past five Presidential administrations.  In the last three decades, the Corps and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have interpreted their jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to cover 270-to-300 million acres of swampy lands in the United States\xe2\x80\x94including half of Alaska and an area the size of California in the lower 48 States.  And that was just the beginning.  The Corps has also asserted jurisdiction over virtually any parcel of land containing a channel or conduit\xe2\x80\x94whether man-made or natural, broad or narrow, permanent or ephemeral\xe2\x80\x94through which rainwater or drainage may occasionally or intermittently flow.  On this view, the federally regulated \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d include storm drains, roadside ditches, ripples of sand in the desert that may contain water once a year, and lands that are covered by floodwaters once every 100 years.  Because they include the land containing storm sewers and desert washes, the statutory \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d engulf entire cities and immense arid wastelands.  In fact, the entire land area of the United States lies in some drainage basin, and an endless network of visible channels furrows the entire surface, containing water ephemerally wherever the rain falls.  Any plot of land containing such a channel may potentially be regulated as a \xe2\x80\x9cwater of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress passed the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act) in 1972.

The Act also states that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the policy of Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the development and use (including restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of land and water resources, and to consult with the Administrator in the exercise of his authority under this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71251(b).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s principal provisions is 33 U.

That case concerned a wetland that \xe2\x80\x9cwas adjacent to a body of navigable water,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe area characterized by saturated soil conditions and wetland vegetation extended beyond the boundary of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s property to \xe2\x80\xa6 a navigable waterway.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 131; see also 33 CFR \xc2\xa7328.3(b) (2004).  Noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe transition from water to solid ground is not necessarily or even typically an abrupt one,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Corps must necessarily choose some point at which water ends and land begins,\xe2\x80\x9d 474 U.

For example, in 1986, to \xe2\x80\x9cclarify\xe2\x80\x9d the reach of its jurisdiction, the Corps announced the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cMigratory Bird Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d which purported to extend its jurisdiction to any intrastate waters \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hich are or would be used as habitat\xe2\x80\x9d by migratory birds.  51 Fed. Reg. 41217; see also <em>SWANCC</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 163\xe2\x80\x93164.  In addition, the Corps interpreted its own regulations to include \xe2\x80\x9cephemeral streams\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdrainage ditches\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ctributaries\xe2\x80\x9d that are part of the \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d see 33 CFR \xc2\xa7328.3(a)(5), provided that they have a perceptible \xe2\x80\x9cordinary high water mark\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in \xc2\xa7328.3(e).  65 Fed. Reg. 12823 (2000).  This interpretation extended \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to virtually any land feature over which rainwater or drainage passes and leaves a visible mark\xe2\x80\x94even if only \xe2\x80\x9cthe presence of litter and debris.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 CFR \xc2\xa7328.3(e).

Prior to our decision in <em>SWANCC</em>, lower courts upheld the application of this expansive definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctributaries\xe2\x80\x9d to such entities as storm sewers that contained flow to covered waters during heavy rainfall, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Eidson</em>, 108 F.\xc2\xa03d 1336, 1340\xe2\x80\x931342 (CA11 1997), and dry arroyos connected to remote waters through the flow of groundwater over \xe2\x80\x9ccenturies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Quivira Mining Co.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 765 F.\xc2\xa02d 126, 129 (CA10 1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>SWANCC</em>, we considered the application of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cMigratory Bird Rule\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9can abandoned sand and gravel pit in northern Illinois.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U.

Observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t was the <em>significant nexus</em> between the wetlands and \xe2\x80\x98navigable waters\xe2\x80\x99 that informed our reading of the CWA in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 167 (emphasis added), we held that <em>Riverside Bayview</em> did not establish \xe2\x80\x9cthat the jurisdiction of the Corps extends to ponds that are not adjacent to open water.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U.

The Corps provided notice of a proposed rulemaking in light of <em>SWANCC</em>, 68 Fed. Reg. 1991 (2003), but ultimately did not amend its published regulations.  Because <em>SWANCC</em> did not directly address tributaries, the Corps notified its field staff that they \xe2\x80\x9cshould continue to assert jurisdiction over traditional navigable waters \xe2\x80\xa6 and, generally speaking, their tributary systems (and adjacent wetlands).\xe2\x80\x9d  68 Fed. Reg. 1998.  In addition, because <em>SWANCC</em> did not overrule <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, the Corps continues to assert jurisdiction over waters \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98neighboring\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d traditional navigable waters and their tributaries.  68 Fed.

Rather, they reflect the breadth of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 determinations in the field.  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 enforcement practices vary somewhat from district to district because \xe2\x80\x9cthe definitions used to make jurisdictional determinations\xe2\x80\x9d are deliberately left \xe2\x80\x9cvague.\xe2\x80\x9d  GAO Report 26; see also <em>id.</em>, at 22.  But district offices of the Corps have treated, as \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d such typically dry land features as \xe2\x80\x9carroyos, coulees, and washes,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as other \xe2\x80\x9cchannels that might have little water flow in a given year.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  They have also applied that definition to such manmade, intermittently flowing features as \xe2\x80\x9cdrain tiles, storm drains systems, and culverts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 24 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to \xe2\x80\x9ctributaries,\xe2\x80\x9d the Corps and the lower courts have also continued to define \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d wetlands broadly after <em>SWANCC</em>.  For example, some of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 district offices have concluded that wetlands are \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d to covered waters if they are hydrologically connected \xe2\x80\x9cthrough directional sheet flow during storm events,\xe2\x80\x9d GAO Report 18, or if they lie within the \xe2\x80\x9c100-year floodplain\xe2\x80\x9d of a body of water\xe2\x80\x94that is, they are connected to the navigable water by flooding, on average, once every 100 years, <em>id.,</em> at 17, and n.\xc2\xa016.  Others have concluded that presence within 200 feet of a tributary automatically renders a wetland \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d and jurisdictional.  <em>Id.,</em> at 19.  And the Corps has successfully defended such theories of \xe2\x80\x9cadjacency\xe2\x80\x9d in the courts, even after <em>SWANCC</em>\xe2\x80\x99s excision of \xe2\x80\x9cisolated\xe2\x80\x9d waters and wetlands from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.  One court has held since <em>SWANCC</em> that wetlands separated from flood control channels by 70-foot-wide berms, atop which ran maintenance roads, had a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d to covered waters because, <em>inter alia</em>, they lay \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the 100 year floodplain of tidal waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Baccarat Fremont Developers, LLC</em> v. <em>Army Corps of Engineers</em>, 425 F. 3d 1150, 1152, 1157 (CA9 2005).  In one of the cases before us today, the Sixth Circuit held, in agreement with \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he majority of courts,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwhile a hydrological connection between the non-navigable and navigable waters is required, there is no \xe2\x80\x98direct abutment\xe2\x80\x99 requirement\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>SWANCC</em> for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adjacency.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  376 F.\xc2\xa03d 629, 639 (2004) <em>(Rapanos II)</em>.  And even the most insubstantial hydrologic connection may be held to constitute a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus.\xe2\x80\x9d  One court distinguished <em>SWANCC</em> on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9ca molecule of water residing in one of these pits or ponds [in <em>SWANCC</em>] could not mix with molecules from other bodies of water\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94whereas, in the case before it, \xe2\x80\x9cwater molecules currently present in the wetlands will inevitably flow towards and mix with water from connecting bodies,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[a] drop of rainwater landing in the Site is certain to intermingle with water from the [nearby river].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rueth Development Co.</em>, 189 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 874, 877\xe2\x80\x93878 (ND Ind. 2002).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these consolidated cases, we consider whether four Michigan wetlands, which lie near ditches or man-made drains that eventually empty into traditional navigable waters, constitute \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Act.  Petitioners in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931034, the Rapanos and their affiliated businesses, deposited fill material without a permit into wetlands on three sites near Midland, Michigan: the \xe2\x80\x9cSalzburg site,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cHines Road site,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cPine River site.\xe2\x80\x9d  The wetlands at the Salzburg site are connected to a man-made drain, which drains into Hoppler Creek, which flows into the Kawkawlin River, which empties into Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron.

The District Court found that the three described wetlands were \xe2\x80\x9cwithin federal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d because they were \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent to other waters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and held petitioners liable for violations of the CWA at those sites.  <em>Id.,</em> at B32\xe2\x80\x93B35.  On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that there was federal jurisdiction over the wetlands at all three sites because \xe2\x80\x9cthere were hydrological connections between all three sites and corresponding adjacent tributaries of navigable waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  376 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 643.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931384, the Carabells, were denied a permit to deposit fill material in a wetland located on a triangular parcel of land about one mile from Lake St. Clair.  A man-made drainage ditch runs along one side of the wetland, separated from it by a 4-foot-wide man-made berm.  The berm is largely or entirely impermeable to water and blocks drainage from the wetland, though it may permit occasional overflow to the ditch.  The ditch empties into another ditch or a drain, which connects to Auvase Creek, which empties into Lake St. Clair.

The District Court ruled that there was federal jurisdiction because the wetland \xe2\x80\x9cis adjacent to neighboring tributaries of navigable waters and has a significant nexus to \xe2\x80\x98waters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49a.

See 10 Wall., at 563.  But this definition cannot be applied wholesale to the CWA.  The Act uses the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d as a <em>defined</em> term, and the definition is simply \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U.

This provision shows that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s term \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d includes something more than traditional navigable waters.  We have twice stated that the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act is broader than the traditional understanding of that term, <em>SWANCC</em>, 531 U.

S., at 133.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We have also emphasized, however, that the qualifier \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable\xe2\x80\x9d is not devoid of significance, <em>SWANCC</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 172.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not decide the precise extent to which the qualifiers \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States\xe2\x80\x9d restrict the coverage of the Act.  Whatever the scope of these qualifiers, the CWA authorizes federal jurisdiction only over \xe2\x80\x9cwaters.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(7).  The only natural definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters,\xe2\x80\x9d our prior and subsequent judicial constructions of it, clear evidence from other provisions of the statute, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s canons of construction all confirm that \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71362(7) cannot bear the expansive meaning that the Corps would give it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 expansive approach might be arguable if the CSA defined \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cwater of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  But \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d is something else.  The use of the definite article (\xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d) and the plural number (\xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d) show plainly that \xc2\xa71362(7) does not refer to water in general.  In this form, \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters\xe2\x80\x9d refers more narrowly to water \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s found in streams and bodies forming geographical features such as oceans, rivers, [and] lakes,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe flowing or moving masses, as of waves or floods, making up such streams or bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  On this definition, \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d include only relatively permanent, standing or flowing bodies of water.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The definition refers to water as found in \xe2\x80\x9cstreams,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9coceans,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crivers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clakes,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbodies\xe2\x80\x9d of water \xe2\x80\x9cforming geographical features.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  All of these terms connote continuously present, fixed bodies of water, as opposed to ordinarily dry channels through which water occasionally or intermittently flows.  Even the least substantial of the definition\xe2\x80\x99s terms, namely \xe2\x80\x9cstreams,\xe2\x80\x9d connotes a continuous flow of water in a permanent channel\xe2\x80\x94especially when used in company with other terms such as \xe2\x80\x9crivers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clakes,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coceans.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  None of these terms encompasses transitory puddles or ephemeral flows of water.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The restriction of \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude channels containing merely intermittent or ephemeral flow also accords with the commonsense understanding of the term.  In applying the definition to \xe2\x80\x9cephemeral streams,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwet meadows,\xe2\x80\x9d storm sewers and culverts, \xe2\x80\x9cdirectional sheet flow during storm events,\xe2\x80\x9d drain tiles, man-made drainage ditches, and dry arroyos in the middle of the desert, the Corps has stretched the term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d beyond parody.  The plain language of the statute simply does not authorize this \xe2\x80\x9cLand Is Waters\xe2\x80\x9d approach to federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s use of the traditional phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d (the defined term) further confirms that it confers jurisdiction only over relatively <em>permanent</em> bodies of water.  The Act adopted that traditional term from its predecessor statutes.  See <em>SWANCC</em>, 531 U. S., at 180 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  On the traditional understanding, \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d included only discrete <em>bodies</em> of water.  For example, in <em>The Daniel Ball</em>, we used the terms \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crivers\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably.  10 Wall., at 563.  And in <em>Appalachian Electric</em>, we consistently referred to the \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cwaterways.\xe2\x80\x9d  311 U. S., at 407\xe2\x80\x93409.  Plainly, because such \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d had to be navigable in fact or susceptible of being rendered so, the term did not include ephemeral flows.  As we noted in <em>SWANCC</em>, the traditional term \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even though defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94carries <em>some</em> of its original substance: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is one thing to give a word limited effect and quite another to give it no effect whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U. S., at 172.  That limited effect includes, at bare minimum, the ordinary presence of water.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our subsequent interpretation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in the CWA likewise confirms this limitation of its scope.  In <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, we stated that the phrase in the Act referred primarily to \xe2\x80\x9crivers, streams, and other <em>hydrographic features more conventionally identifiable as \xe2\x80\x98waters\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d </em>than the wetlands adjacent to such features.  474 U. S., at 131 (emphasis added).  We thus echoed the dictionary definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d as referring to \xe2\x80\x9cstreams and bodies <em>forming geographical features</em> such as oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 2882 (emphasis added).  Though we upheld in that case the inclusion of wetlands abutting such a \xe2\x80\x9chydrographic featur[e]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94principally due to the difficulty of drawing any clear boundary between the two, see 474 U. S., at 132; Part IV, <em>infra</em>\xe2\x80\x94nowhere did we suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d should be expanded to include, in their own right, entities other than \xe2\x80\x9chydrographic features more conventionally identifiable as \xe2\x80\x98waters.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Likewise, in both <em>Riverside Bayview</em> and <em>SWANCC</em>, we repeatedly described the \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d covered by the Act as \xe2\x80\x9copen water\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9copen waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 132, and n.\xc2\xa08, 134; <em>SWANCC</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 167, 172.  Under no rational interpretation are typically dry channels described as \xe2\x80\x9c<em>open</em> waters.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most significant of all, the CWA itself categorizes the channels and conduits that typically carry intermittent flows of water separately from \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d by including them in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98point source.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98point source\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(14).  It also defines \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discharge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant <em>to</em> navigable waters <em>from</em> any point source.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(12)(A) (emphases added).  The definitions thus conceive of \xe2\x80\x9cpoint sources\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d as separate and distinct categories.  The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d would make little sense if the two categories were significantly overlapping.  The separate classification of \xe2\x80\x9cditch[es], channel[s], and conduit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which are terms ordinarily used to describe the watercourses through which <em>intermittent</em> waters typically flow\xe2\x80\x94shows that these are, by and large, <em>not</em> \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, only the foregoing definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d is consistent with the CWA\xe2\x80\x99s stated \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy of Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, [and] to plan the development and use (including restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of land and water resources \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71251(b).  This statement of policy was included in the Act as enacted in 1972, see 86 Stat. 816, prior to the addition of the optional state administration program in the 1977 amendments, see 91 Stat. 1601.  Thus the policy plainly referred to something beyond the subsequently added state administration program of 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(g)\xe2\x80\x93(<em>l</em>).  But the expansive theory advanced by the Corps, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cpreserv[ing] the primary rights and responsibilities of the States,\xe2\x80\x9d would have brought virtually all \xe2\x80\x9cplan[ning of] the development and use .\xc2\xa0. . of land and water resources\xe2\x80\x9d by the States under federal control.  It is therefore an unlikely reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d were ambiguous as applied to intermittent flows, our own canons of construction would establish that the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the statute is impermissible.  As we noted in <em>SWANCC</em>, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s expansive interpretation would \xe2\x80\x9cresult in a significant impingement of the States\xe2\x80\x99 traditional and primary power over land and water use.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U. S., at 174.  Regulation of land use, as through the issuance of the development permits sought by petitioners in both of these cases, is a quintessential state and local power.  See <em>FERC</em> v. <em>Mississippi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/742/index.html">456 U. S. 742</a>, 768, n. 30 (1982); <em>Hess</em> v. <em>Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/30/index.html">513 U. S. 30</a>, 44 (1994).  The extensive federal jurisdiction urged by the Government would authorize the Corps to function as a <em>de facto</em> regulator of immense stretches of intrastate land\xe2\x80\x94an authority the agency has shown its willingness to exercise with the scope of discretion that would befit a local zoning board.  See 33 CFR \xc2\xa7320.4(a)(1) (2004).  We ordinarily expect a \xe2\x80\x9cclear and manifest\xe2\x80\x9d statement from Congress to authorize an unprecedented intrusion into traditional state authority.  See <em>BFP</em> v. <em>Resolution Trust Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/531/index.html">511 U. S. 531</a>, 544 (1994).  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d hardly qualifies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, just as we noted in <em>SWANCC</em>, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation stretches the outer limits of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s commerce power and raises difficult questions about the ultimate scope of that power.  See 531 U. S., at 173.  (In developing the current regulations, the Corps consciously sought to extend its authority to the farthest reaches of the commerce power.  See 42 Fed. Reg. 37127 (1977).)  Even if the term \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d were ambiguous as applied to channels that sometimes host ephemeral flows of water (which it is not), we would expect a clearer statement from Congress to authorize an agency theory of jurisdiction that presses the envelope of constitutional validity.  See <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</em> v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/index.html">485 U. S. 568</a>, 575 (1988).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, on its only plausible interpretation, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d includes only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water \xe2\x80\x9cforming geographic features\xe2\x80\x9d that are described in ordinary parlance as \xe2\x80\x9cstreams[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 2882.  The phrase does not include channels through which water flows intermittently or ephemerally, or channels that periodically provide drainage for rainfall.  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 expansive interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d is thus not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council</em>, <em>Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U.

See 391 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 708\xe2\x80\x93709.  Likewise in <em>Rapanos</em>, the Sixth Circuit held that the nearby ditches were \xe2\x80\x9ctributaries\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7328(a)(5).  376 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 643.  But <em>Rapanos II</em> also stated that, even if the ditches were not \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d the wetlands were \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d to <em>remote</em> traditional navigable waters in virtue of the wetlands\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9chydrological connection\xe2\x80\x9d to them.  See <em>id.</em>, at 639\xe2\x80\x93640.

The difficulty of delineating the boundary between water and land was central to our reasoning in the case: \xe2\x80\x9cIn view of the breadth of federal regulatory authority contemplated by the Act itself and <em>the inherent difficulties of defining precise bounds to regulable waters</em>, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 ecological judgment about the relationship between waters and their adjacent wetlands provides an adequate basis for a legal judgment that adjacent wetlands may be defined as waters under the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 134 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When we characterized the holding of <em>Riverside Bayview</em> in <em>SWANCC</em>, we referred to the close connection between waters and the wetlands that they gradually blend into: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the <em>significant nexus</em> between the wetlands and \xe2\x80\x98navigable waters\xe2\x80\x99 that informed our reading of the CWA in <em>Riverside Bayview Homes</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U. S., at 167 (emphasis added).  In particular, <em>SWANCC</em> rejected the notion that the ecological considerations upon which the Corps relied in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>\xe2\x80\x94and upon which the dissent repeatedly relies today, see <em>post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 12, 13\xe2\x80\x9314, 15, 18\xe2\x80\x9319, 21\xe2\x80\x9322, 24\xe2\x80\x9325\xe2\x80\x94provided an <em>independent</em> basis for including entities like \xe2\x80\x9cwetlands\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cephemeral streams\xe2\x80\x9d) within the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>SWANCC</em> found such ecological considerations irrelevant to the question whether physically isolated waters come within the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.  It thus confirmed that <em>Riverside Bayview</em> rested upon the inherent ambiguity in defining where water ends and abutting (\xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d) wetlands begin, permitting the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on ecological considerations <em>only to resolve that ambiguity</em> in favor of treating all abutting wetlands as waters.  Isolated ponds were not \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in their own right, see 531 U. S., at 167, 171, and presented no boundary-drawing problem that would have justified the invocation of ecological factors to treat them as such.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Therefore, <em>only</em> those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d and wetlands, are \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent to\xe2\x80\x9d such waters and covered by the Act.  Wetlands with only an intermittent, physically remote hydrologic connection to \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d do not implicate the boundary-drawing problem of <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, and thus lack the necessary connection to covered waters that we described as a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>SWANCC</em>.  531 U. S., at 167.  Thus, establishing that wetlands such as those at the Rapanos and Carabell sites are covered by the Act requires two findings: First, that the adjacent channel contains a \xe2\x80\x9cwate[r] of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e., </em>a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters); and second, that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to determine where the \xe2\x80\x9cwater\xe2\x80\x9d ends and the \xe2\x80\x9cwetland\xe2\x80\x9d begins.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents and their <em>amici</em> urge that such restrictions on the scope of \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d will frustrate enforcement against traditional water polluters under 33 U.

Thus, from the time of the CWA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, lower courts have held that the discharge into intermittent channels of any pollutant <em>that naturally washes downstream</em> likely violates \xc2\xa71311(a), even if the pollutants discharged from a point source do not emit \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly into\xe2\x80\x9d covered waters, but pass \xe2\x80\x9cthrough conveyances\xe2\x80\x9d in between.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Velsicol Chemical Corp.</em>, 438 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 945, 946\xe2\x80\x93947 (WD Tenn. 1976) (a municipal sewer system separated the \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d and covered navigable waters).  See also <em>Sierra Club</em> v. <em>El Paso Gold Mines, Inc.</em>, 421 F.\xc2\xa03d 1133, 1137, 1141 (CA10 2005) (2.5 miles of tunnel separated the \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, many courts have held that such upstream, intermittently flowing channels themselves constitute \xe2\x80\x9cpoint sources\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.  The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d includes \xe2\x80\x9cany pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(14).  We have held that the Act \xe2\x80\x9cmakes plain that a point source need not be the original source of the pollutant; it need only convey the pollutant to \xe2\x80\x98navigable waters.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>South Fla. Water Management Dist.</em> v. <em>Miccosukee Tribe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/95/index.html">541 U. S. 95</a>, 105 (2004).  Cases holding the intervening channel to be a point source include <em>United States</em> v. <em>Ortiz</em>, 427 F.\xc2\xa03d 1278, 1281 (CA10 2005) (a storm drain that carried flushed chemicals from a toilet to the Colorado River was a \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d), and <em>Dague</em> v. <em>Burlington</em>, 935 F.\xc2\xa02d 1343, 1354\xe2\x80\x931355 (CA2 1991) (a culvert connecting two bodies of navigable water was a \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d), rev\xe2\x80\x99d on other grounds, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/557/index.html">505 U. S. 557</a> (1992).  Some courts have even adopted both the \xe2\x80\x9cindirect discharge\xe2\x80\x9d rationale and the \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d rationale in the alternative, applied to the same facts.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Concerned Area Residents for Environment</em> v. <em>Southview Farm</em>, 34 F.\xc2\xa03d 114, 118\xe2\x80\x93119 (CA2 1994).  On either view, however, the lower courts have seen no need to classify the intervening conduits as \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to the pollutants normally covered by the permitting requirement of \xc2\xa71342(a), \xe2\x80\x9cdredged or fill material,\xe2\x80\x9d which is typically deposited for the sole purpose of staying put, does not normally wash downstream,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and thus does not normally constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caddition \xe2\x80\xa6 to navigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d when deposited in upstream isolated wetlands.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71344(a), 1362(12).  The Act recognizes this distinction by providing a separate permitting program for such discharges in \xc2\xa71344(a).  It does not appear, therefore, that the interpretation we adopt today significantly reduces the scope of \xc2\xa71342 of the Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents also urge that the narrower interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d will impose a more difficult burden of proof in enforcement proceedings under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a) and 1342(a), by requiring the agency to demonstrate the downstream flow of the pollutant along the intermittent channel to traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwaters.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57.  But, as noted above, the lower courts do not generally rely on characterization of intervening channels as \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in applying \xc2\xa71311 to the traditional pollutants subject to \xc2\xa71342.  Moreover, the proof of downstream flow of pollutants required under \xc2\xa71342 appears substantially similar, if not identical, to the proof of a hydrologic connection that would be required, on the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s theory of jurisdiction, to prove that an upstream channel or wetland is a \xe2\x80\x9cwate[r] of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Rapanos II</em>, 376 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 639.  Compare, <em>e.g.</em>, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931034, at B11, B20, B26 (testimony of hydrologic connections based on observation of surface water connections), with <em>Southview Farm</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 118\xe2\x80\x93121 (testimony of discharges based on observation of the flow of polluted water).  In either case, the agency must prove that the contaminant-laden waters ultimately reach covered waters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents and many <em>amici</em> admonish that narrowing the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d will hamper federal efforts to preserve the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s wetlands.  It is not clear that the state and local conservation efforts that the CWA explicitly calls for, see 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(b), are in any way inadequate for the goal of preservation.  In any event, a Comprehensive National Wetlands Protection Act is not before us, and the \xe2\x80\x9cwis[dom]\xe2\x80\x9d of such a statute, <em>post</em>, at 19 (opinion of Stevens, J.), is beyond our ken.  What is clear, however, is that Congress did not enact one when it granted the Corps jurisdiction over only \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>waters</em> of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an opinion long on praise of environmental protection and notably short on analysis of the statutory text and structure, the dissent would hold that \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d include any wetlands \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d (no matter how broadly defined) to \xe2\x80\x9ctributaries\xe2\x80\x9d (again, no matter how broadly defined) of traditional navigable waters.  For legal support of its policy-laden conclusion, the dissent relies exclusively on two sources: \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur unanimous opinion in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 6; and \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 deliberate acquiescence in the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulations in 1977,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 11.  Each of these is demonstrably inadequate to support the apparently limitless scope that the dissent would permit the Corps to give to the Act.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that <em>Riverside Bayview</em> \xe2\x80\x9csquarely controls these cases,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 6, is wholly implausible.  First, <em>Riverside Bayview</em> could not possibly support the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 inclusion of dry beds as \xe2\x80\x9ctributaries,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 19, because the definition of tributaries was not at issue in that case.  <em>Riverside Bayview</em> addressed only the Act\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of wetlands abutting navigable-in-fact waters, and said nothing at all about what non-navigable tributaries the Act might also cover.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Riverside Bayview</em> likewise provides no support for the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s complacent acceptance of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 definition of \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent,\xe2\x80\x9d which (as noted above) has been extended beyond reason to include, <em>inter alia</em>, the 100-year floodplain of covered waters.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9.  The dissent notes that <em>Riverside Bayview</em> quoted without comment the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 description of \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d wetlands as those \xe2\x80\x9cthat form the border of or are in reasonable proximity to other waters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 8 (citing 474 U. S., at 134 (quoting 42 Fed. Reg. 37128)).  As we have already discussed, this quotation provides no support for the inclusion of physically unconnected wetlands as covered \xe2\x80\x9cwaters.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323, n.\xc2\xa010.  The dissent relies principally on a footnote in <em>Riverside Bayview</em> recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not every adjacent wetland is of great importance to the environment of adjoining bodies of water,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that all \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adjacent\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d wetlands are nevertheless covered by the Act, <em>post</em>, at 8 (quoting 474 U. S., at 135, n.\xc2\xa09).  Of course, this footnote says <em>nothing</em> to support the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s broad definition of \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94quite the contrary, the quoted sentence uses \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadjoining\xe2\x80\x9d <em>interchangeably</em>, and the footnote qualifies a sentence holding that the wetland was covered \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[b]ecause</em>\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cactually abut[ted] on a navigable waterway.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 135 (emphasis added).  Moreover, that footnote\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the Act may be interpreted to include even those adjoining wetlands that are \xe2\x80\x9clacking in importance to the aquatic environment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 135, n.\xc2\xa09, confirms that the scope of ambiguity of \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d is determined by a wetland\xe2\x80\x99s <em>physical connection</em> to covered waters, <em>not</em> its ecological relationship thereto.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent reasons (1) that <em>Riverside Bayview</em> held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d include \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent wetlands,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) we must defer to the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the ambiguous word \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  But this is mere legerdemain.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent wetlands\xe2\x80\x9d is not part of the statutory definition that the Corps is authorized to interpret, which refers only to \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(7).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  In expounding the term \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d as used in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, we are explaining <em>our own</em> prior use of that word to interpret the definitional phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  However ambiguous the term may be in the abstract, as we have explained earlier, \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d as used in <em>Riverside Bayview</em> is not ambiguous between \xe2\x80\x9cphysically abutting\xe2\x80\x9d and merely \xe2\x80\x9cnearby.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent would distinguish <em>SWANCC</em> on the ground that it \xe2\x80\x9chad nothing to say about wetlands,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> it concerned \xe2\x80\x9cisolated <em>ponds</em>\xe2\x80\x9d rather than isolated <em>wetlands</em>.  This is the ultimate distinction without a difference.  If isolated \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent and seasonal ponds of varying size \xe2\x80\xa6 and depth,\xe2\x80\x9d 531 U.

S., at 132.  As the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent has written, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f, as I believe, actually navigable waters lie at the very heart of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power and \xe2\x80\x98isolated,\xe2\x80\x99 nonnavigable waters lie closer to \xe2\x80\xa6 the margin, \xe2\x80\x98isolated wetlands,\xe2\x80\x99 which are themselves only marginally \xe2\x80\x98waters,\xe2\x80\x99 are the most marginal category of \xe2\x80\x98waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 potentially covered by the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U. S., at 187, n.\xc2\xa013 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only other ground that the dissent offers to distinguish <em>SWANCC</em> is that, unlike the ponds in <em>SWANCC</em>, the wetlands in these cases are \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent to navigable bodies of water and their tributaries\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94where \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d may be interpreted who-knows-how broadly.  It is not clear why roughly defined physical proximity should make such a difference\xe2\x80\x94without actual abutment, it raises no boundary-drawing ambiguity, and it is undoubtedly a poor proxy for ecological significance.  In fact, though the dissent is careful to restrict its discussion to wetlands \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d to tributaries, its <em>reasons</em> for including those wetlands are strictly ecological\xe2\x80\x94such wetlands would be included because they \xe2\x80\x9cserve \xe2\x80\xa6 important water quality roles,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 11, and \xe2\x80\x9cplay important roles in the watershed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  This reasoning would swiftly overwhelm <em>SWANCC</em> altogether; after all, the ponds at issue in <em>SWANCC</em> could, no less than the wetlands in these cases, \xe2\x80\x9coffer \xe2\x80\x98nesting, spawning, rearing and resting sites for aquatic or land species,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98serve as valuable storage areas for storm and flood waters,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive focus on ecological factors, combined with its total deference to the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 ecological judgments, would permit the Corps to regulate the entire country as \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Absent a plausible ground in our case law for its sweeping position, the dissent relies heavily on \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 deliberate acquiescence in the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulations in 1977,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x94noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e found [this acquiescence] significant in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and even \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledged in <em>SWANCC</em>\xe2\x80\x9d that we had done so, <em>post</em>, at 12.  <em>SWANCC</em> \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledged\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>Riverside Bayview</em> had relied on congressional acquiescence only to criticize that reliance.

Failed legislative proposals are a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute. \xe2\x80\xa6 The relationship between the actions and inactions of the 95th Congress and the intent of the 92d Congress in passing [\xc2\xa71344(a)] is also considerably attenuated.  Because subsequent history is less illuminating than the contemporaneous evidence, respondents face a difficult task in overcoming the plain text and import of [\xc2\xa71344(a)].\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U.

What the dissent refers to as \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 deliberate acquiescence\xe2\x80\x9d should more appropriately be called Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to express any opinion.  We have no idea whether the Members\xe2\x80\x99 failure to act in 1977 was attributable to their belief that the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulations were correct, or rather to their belief that the courts would eliminate any excesses, or indeed simply to their unwillingness to confront the environmental lobby.  To be sure, we have sometimes relied on congressional acquiescence when there is evidence that Congress considered and rejected the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>precise</em> issue\xe2\x80\x9d presented before the Court, <em>Bob Jones Univ.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/574/index.html">461 U.

However, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bsent such <em>overwhelming evidence</em> of acquiescence, we are loath to replace the plain text and original understanding of a statute with an amended agency interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>SWANCC</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 169, n.\xc2\xa05 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent falls far short of producing \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress considered and failed to act upon the \xe2\x80\x9cprecise issue\xe2\x80\x9d before the Court today\xe2\x80\x94namely, what constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d wetland covered by the Act.  Citing <em>Riverside Bayview</em>\xe2\x80\x99s account of the 1977 debates, the dissent claims nothing more than that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cconducted extensive debates about the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands [and] rejected efforts to limit that jurisdiction\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 11.  In fact, even that vague description goes too far.  As recounted in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, the 1977 debates concerned a proposal to \xe2\x80\x9climi[t] the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 authority under [\xc2\xa71344] to waters navigable in fact and their adjacent wetlands (defined as wetlands periodically inundated by contiguous navigable waters),\xe2\x80\x9d 474 U. S., at 136.  In rejecting this proposal, Congress merely failed to enact a limitation of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d to include only navigable-in-fact waters\xe2\x80\x94an interpretation we affirmatively reject today, see <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x94and a definition of wetlands based on \xe2\x80\x9cperiodi[c] inundat[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d that appears almost nowhere in the briefs or opinions of these cases.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  No plausible interpretation of this legislative inaction can construe it as an implied endorsement of every jot and tittle of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 1977 regulations.  In fact, <em>Riverside Bayview</em> itself relied on this legislative inaction only as \xe2\x80\x9cat least some evidence of the reasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of adjacent wetlands under the Act, 474 U. S., at 137, and for the observation that \xe2\x80\x9ceven those who would have restricted the reach of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d would not have excised adjacent wetlands, <em>ibid.</em>  Both of these conclusions are perfectly consistent with our interpretation, and neither illuminates the disputed question of what constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d wetland.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a curious appeal to entrenched Executive error, the dissent contends that \xe2\x80\x9cthe appropriateness of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 30-year implementation of the Clean Water Act should be addressed to Congress or the Corps rather than to the Judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post, </em>at 14; see also <em>post</em>, at 2, 22. Surely this is a novel principle of administrative law\xe2\x80\x94a sort of 30-year adverse possession that insulates disregard of statutory text from judicial review.  It deservedly has no precedent in our jurisprudence.

Two defects in a single sentence: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]aters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d is in <em>some</em> respects ambiguous.  The <em>scope </em>of that ambiguity, however, does not conceivably extend to whether storm drains and dry ditches are \xe2\x80\x9cwaters,\xe2\x80\x9d and hence does not support the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation.  And as for advancing \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of the Act\xe2\x80\x9d: We have often criticized that last resort of extravagant interpretation, noting that no law pursues its purpose at all costs, and that the textual limitations upon a law\xe2\x80\x99s scope are no less a part of its \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d than its substantive authorizations.

It is the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and not ours, which appeals not to a reasonable interpretation of enacted text, but to the great environmental benefits that a patently unreasonable interpretation can achieve.  We have begun our discussion by mentioning, to be sure, the high costs imposed by that interpretation\xe2\x80\x94but they are in no way the basis for our decision, which rests, plainly and simply, upon the limited meaning that can be borne by the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">VII</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s opinion concludes that our reading of the Act \xe2\x80\x9cis inconsistent with its text, structure, and purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post, </em>at 19.

To establish a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Kennedy would require the Corps to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish \xe2\x80\xa6 on a case-by-case basis\xe2\x80\x9d that wetlands adjacent to nonnavigable tributaries \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters more readily understood as \xe2\x80\x98navigable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 25, 23.  This standard certainly does not come from <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, which explicitly rejected such case-by-case determinations of ecological significance for the <em>jurisdictional</em> question whether a wetland is covered, holding instead that <em>all </em>physically connected wetlands are covered.  474 U. S., at 135, n.\xc2\xa09.  It is true enough that one reason for accepting that physical-connection criterion was the likelihood that a physically connected wetland would have an ecological effect upon the adjacent waters.  But case-by-case determination of ecological effect <em>was not the test</em>.  Likewise, that test cannot be derived from <em>SWANCC</em>\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, which emphasized that the wetlands which possessed a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d in that earlier case \xe2\x80\x9cactually abutted on a navigable waterway,\xe2\x80\x9d 531 U. S., at 167, and which <em>specifically rejected</em> the argument that physically unconnected ponds could be included based on their ecological connection to covered waters.  In fact, Justice Kennedy acknowledges that neither <em>Riverside Bayview</em> nor <em>SWANCC</em> required, for wetlands abutting navigable-in-fact waters, the case-by-case ecological determination that he proposes for wetlands that neighbor nonnavigable tributaries.  See <em>post</em>, at 23.  Thus, Justice Kennedy misreads <em>SWANCC\xe2\x80\x99s</em> \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d statement as mischaracterizing <em>Riverside Bayview</em> to adopt a case-by-case test of ecological significance; and then transfers that standard to a context that <em>Riverside Bayview</em> expressly declined to address (namely, wetlands nearby non-navigable tributaries); while all the time <em>conceding</em> that this standard does not apply in the context that <em>Riverside Bayview</em> <em>did</em> address (wetlands abutting navigable waterways).  Truly, this is \xe2\x80\x9cturtles all the way down.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But misreading our prior decisions is not the principal problem.  The principal problem is reading them in utter isolation from the text of the Act.  One would think, after reading Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s exegesis, that the crucial provision of the text of the CWA was a jurisdictional requirement of \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d between wetlands and navigable waters.  In fact, however, that phrase appears nowhere in the Act, but is taken from <em>SWANCC</em>\xe2\x80\x99s cryptic characterization of the holding of <em>Riverside Bayview</em>.  <em>Our</em> interpretation of the phrase is both consistent with those opinions <em>and </em>compatible with what the Act <em>does </em>establish as the jurisdictional criterion: \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wetlands are \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d if they bear the \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d of physical connection, which makes them as a practical matter <em>indistinguishable </em>from waters of the United States.  What other nexus could <em>conceivably </em>cause them to <em>be </em>\xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d?  Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s test is that they, \xe2\x80\x9ceither alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly <em>affect</em> the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters more readily understood as \xe2\x80\x98navigable,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 23 (emphasis added).  But what possible linguistic usage would accept that whatever (alone or in combination) <em>affects </em>waters of the United States <em>is </em>waters of the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Only by ignoring the text of the statute and by assuming that the phrase of <em>SWANCC</em> (\xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d) can properly be interpreted in isolation from that text<em> </em>does Justice Kennedy reach the conclusion he has arrived at.  Instead of limiting its meaning by reference to the text it was applying, he purports to do so by reference to what he calls the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute.  Its purpose is to clean up the waters of the United States, and therefore anything that might \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly affect\xe2\x80\x9d the purity of those waters bears a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d to those waters, and thus (he never says this, but the text of the statute demands that he mean it) <em>is </em>those waters.  This is the familiar tactic of substituting the purpose of the statute for its text, freeing the Court to write a different statute that achieves the same purpose.  To begin with, as we have discussed earlier, clean water is not the <em>only </em>purpose of the statute.  So is the preservation of primary state responsibility for ordinary land-use decisions.  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(b).  Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s test takes no account of this purpose.  More fundamentally, however, the test simply rewrites the statute, using for that purpose the gimmick of \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus.\xe2\x80\x9d  It would have been an easy matter for Congress to give the Corps jurisdiction over all wetlands (or, for that matter, all dry lands) that \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d waters of the United States.  It did not do that, but instead explicitly limited jurisdiction to \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s disposition would disallow some of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 excesses, and in that respect is a more moderate flouting of statutory command than Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  In another respect, however, it is more extreme.  At least Justice Stevens can blame his implausible reading of the statute upon the Corps.  His error consists of giving that agency more deference than reason permits.  Justice Kennedy, however, has devised his new statute all on his own.  It purports to be, not a grudging acceptance of an agency\xe2\x80\x99s close-to-the-edge expansion of its own powers, but rather <em>the </em>most reasonable interpretation of the law.  It is far from that, unless whatever affects waters is waters.</p>\n<p align="left">VIII</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Sixth Circuit applied the wrong standard to determine if these wetlands are covered \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and because of the paucity of the record in both of these cases, the lower courts should determine, in the first instance, whether the ditches or drains near each wetland are \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d in the ordinary sense of containing a relatively permanent flow; and (if they are) whether the wetlands in question are \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d to these \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense of possessing a continuous surface connection that creates the boundary-drawing problem we addressed in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We vacate the judgments of the Sixth Circuit in both No. 04\xe2\x80\x931034 and No. 04\xe2\x80\x931384, and remand both cases for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left"><right><em>It is so ordered.</em></right></p><em>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In issuing permits, the Corps directs that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll factors which may be relevant to the proposal must be considered including the cumulative effects thereof: among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7320.4(a).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a></casctfnt></em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0We are indebted to the Sonoran </em>court for a famous exchange, from the movie Casablanca (Warner Bros. 1942), which portrays most vividly the absurdity of finding the desert filled with waters:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Captain Renault [Claude Rains]: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat in heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name brought you to Casablanca?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Rick [Humphrey Bogart]: \xe2\x80\x9cMy health.

Of course Justice Kennedy himself fails to observe this supposed presumption, since his \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d test makes no exception for wetlands created by inundation.  In any event, the language from <em>Riverside Bayview</em> in Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s parenthetical is wrenched out of context.  The sentence which Justice Kennedy quotes in part immediately followed the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d wetlands are included because of \xe2\x80\x9cthe inherent difficulties of defining precise bounds to regulable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d 474 U.

And the full sentence reads as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cThis holds true even for wetlands that are not the result of flooding or permeation by water having its source in <em>adjacent</em> bodies of open water,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  Clearly, the \xe2\x80\x9cwetlands\xe2\x80\x9d referred to in the sentence are only \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d wetlands\xe2\x80\x94namely, those with the continuous physical connection that the rest of the <em>Riverside Bayview</em> opinion required, see <em>supra</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9323.  Thus, it is evident that the quoted language was not at all a rejection of the physical-connection requirement, but rather a rejection of the alternative position (which had been adopted by the lower court in that case, see <em>id.</em>, at 125) that the <em>only </em>covered wetlands are those created by inundation.  As long as the wetland is \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d to covered waters, said <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, its creation <em>vel non</em> by inundation is irrelevant.</p>\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The allusion is to a classic story told in different forms and attributed to various authors.

They are defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthose areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.  Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7328.3(b).  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 Wetlands Delineation Manual, including over 100 pages of technical guidance for Corps officers, interprets this definition of wetlands to require: (1) prevalence of plant species typically adapted to saturated soil conditions, determined in accordance with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service\xe2\x80\x99s National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands; (2) hydric soil, meaning soil that is saturated, flooded, or ponded for sufficient time during the growing season to become anaerobic, or lacking in oxygen, in the upper part; and (3) wetland hydrology, a term generally requiring continuous inundation or saturation to the surface during at least five percent of the growing season in most years.  See Wetlands Research Program Technical Report Y\xe2\x80\x9387\xe2\x80\x931 (on-line edition), pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9334 (Jan. 1987), http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/permit/documents/87manual.pdf (all Internet material as visited June 16, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Under the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulations, wetlands are adjacent to tributaries, and thus covered by the Act, even if they are \xe2\x80\x9cseparated from other waters of the United States by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes and the like.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7328.3(c).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first consolidated case before the Court, <em>Rapanos</em> v. <em>United States</em>, No. 04\xe2\x80\x931034, relates to a civil enforcement action initiated by the United States in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the owners of three land parcels near Midland, Michigan.  The first parcel, known as the Salzburg site, consists of roughly 230 acres.  The District Court, applying the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 definition of wetlands, found based on expert testimony that the Salzburg site included 28 acres of wetlands.  The District Court further found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Salzburg wetlands have a surface water connection to tributaries of the Kawkawlin River which, in turn, flows into the Saginaw River and ultimately into Lake Huron.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. B11.  Water from the site evidently spills into the Hoppler Drain, located just north of the property, which carries water into the Hoppler Creek and thence into the Kawkawlin River, which is navigable.  A state official testified that he observed carp spawning in a ditch just north of the property, indicating a direct surface-water connection from the ditch to the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second parcel, known as the Hines Road site, consists of 275 acres, which the District Court found included 64 acres of wetlands.  The court found that the wetlands have a surface-water connection to the Rose Drain, which carries water into the Tittabawassee River, a navigable waterway.  The final parcel, called the Pine River site, consists of some 200 acres.  The District Court found that 49 acres were wetlands and that a surface water connection linked the wetlands to the nearby Pine River, which flows into Lake Huron.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At all relevant times, John Rapanos owned the Salzburg site; a company he controlled owned the Hines Road site; and Rapanos\xe2\x80\x99 wife and a company she controlled (possibly in connection with another entity) owned the Pine River site.  All these parties are petitioners here.  In December 1988, Mr. Rapanos, hoping to construct a shopping center, asked the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to inspect the Salzburg site.  A state official informed Rapanos that while the site likely included regulated wetlands, Rapanos could proceed with the project if the wetlands were delineated (that is, identified and preserved) or if a permit were obtained.  Pursuing the delineation option, Rapanos hired a wetlands consultant to survey the property.  The results evidently displeased Rapanos: Informed that the site included between 48 and 58 acres of wetlands, Rapanos allegedly threatened to \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy\xe2\x80\x9d the consultant unless he eradicated all traces of his report.  Rapanos then ordered $350,000-worth of earthmoving and landclearing work that filled in 22 of the 64 wetlands acres on the Salzburg site.  He did so without a permit and despite receiving cease-and-desist orders from state officials and the EPA.  At the Hines Road and Pine River sites, construction work\xe2\x80\x94again conducted in violation of state and federal compliance orders\xe2\x80\x94altered an additional 17 and 15 wetlands acres, respectively.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Government brought criminal charges against Rapanos.  In the suit at issue here, however, the United States alleged civil violations of the Clean Water Act against all the <em>Rapanos</em> petitioners.  Specifically, the Government claimed that petitioners discharged fill into jurisdictional wetlands, failed to respond to requests for information, and ignored administrative compliance orders.  See 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a), 1318(a), 1319(a).  After a 13-day bench trial, the District Court made the findings noted earlier and, on that basis, upheld the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over wetlands on the three parcels.  On the merits the court ruled in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor, finding that violations occurred at all three sites.  As to two other sites, however, the court rejected the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 claim to jurisdiction, holding that the Government had failed to carry its burden of proving the existence of wetlands under the three-part regulatory definition.  (These two parcels are no longer at issue.)  The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  376 F.\xc2\xa03d 629, 634 (2004).  This Court granted certiorari to consider the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over wetlands on the Salzburg, Hines Road, and Pine River sites.  546 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second consolidated case, <em>Carabell</em>, No. 04\xe2\x80\x931384, involves a parcel shaped like a right triangle and consisting of some 19.6 acres, 15.9 of which are forested wetlands.  257 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 917, 923 (ED Mich. 2003).  The property is located roughly one mile from Lake St. Clair, a 430-square-mile lake located between Michigan and Canada that is popular for boating and fishing and produces some 48 percent of the sport fish caught in the Great Lakes, see Brief for Macomb County, Michigan as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 2.  The right-angle corner of the property is located to the northwest.  The hypotenuse, which runs from northeast to southwest, lies alongside a man-made berm that separates the property from a ditch.  At least under current conditions\xe2\x80\x94that is, without the deposit of fill in the wetlands that the landowners propose\xe2\x80\x94the berm ordinarily, if not always, blocks surface-water flow from the wetlands into the ditch. But cf. App. 186a (administrative hearing testimony by consultant for Carabells indicating \xe2\x80\x9cyou would start seeing some overflow\xe2\x80\x9d in a \xe2\x80\x9cten year storm\xe2\x80\x9d).  Near the northeast corner of the property, the ditch connects with the Sutherland-Oemig Drain, which carries water continuously throughout the year and empties into Auvase Creek.  The creek in turn empties into Lake St. Clair.  At its southwest end, the ditch connects to other ditches that empty into the Auvase Creek and thence into Lake St. Clair.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1993 petitioners Keith and June Carabell sought a permit from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), which has assumed permitting functions of the Corps pursuant to \xc2\xa71344(g).  Petitioners hoped to fill in the wetlands and construct 130 condominium units.  Although the MDEQ denied the permit, a State Administrative Law Judge directed the agency to approve an alternative plan, proposed by the Carabells, that involved the construction of 112 units.  This proposal called for filling in 12.2 acres of the property while creating retention ponds on 3.74 acres.  Because the EPA had objected to the permit, jurisdiction over the case transferred to the Corps.  See \xc2\xa71344(j).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 district office concluded that the Carabells\xe2\x80\x99 property \xe2\x80\x9cprovides water storage functions that, if destroyed, could result in an increased risk of erosion and degradation of water quality in the Sutherland-Oemig Drain, Auvase Creek, and Lake St. Clair.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 127a.  The district office denied the permit, and the Corps upheld the denial in an administrative appeal.  The Carabells, challenging both the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction and the merits of the permit denial, sought judicial review pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted summary judgment to the Corps, 257 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 917, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, 391 F.\xc2\xa03d 704 (2005).  This Court granted certiorari to consider the jurisdictional question.  546 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twice before the Court has construed the term \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d in the Clean Water Act.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/121/index.html">474 U. S. 121</a> (1985), the Court upheld the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to navigable-in-fact waterways.  <em>Id.</em>, at 139.  The property in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, like the wetlands in the <em>Carabell</em> case now before the Court, was located roughly one mile from Lake St. Clair, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.</em>, 729 F.\xc2\xa02d 391, 392 (CA6 1984) (decision on review in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>), though in that case, unlike <em>Carabell</em>, the lands at issue formed part of a wetland that directly abutted a navigable-in-fact creek, 474 U. S., at 131.  In regulatory provisions that remain in effect, the Corps had concluded that wetlands perform important functions such as filtering and purifying water draining into adjacent water bodies, 33 CFR \xc2\xa7320.4(b)(2)(vii), slowing the flow of runoff into lakes, rivers, and streams so as to prevent flooding and erosion, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7320.4(b)(2)(iv), (v), and providing critical habitat for aquatic animal species, \xc2\xa7320.4(b)(2)(i).  474 U. S., at 134\xe2\x80\x93135.  Recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n agency\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a statute it is charged with enforcing is entitled to deference if it is reasonable and not in conflict with the expressed intent of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 131 (citing <em>Chemical Mfrs. Assn.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/116/index.html">470 U. S. 116</a>, 125 (1985), and <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A.

S. 837</a>, 842\xe2\x80\x93845 (1984)), the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Corps\xe2\x80\x99 ecological judgment about the relationship between waters and their adjacent wetlands provides an adequate basis for a legal judgment that adjacent wetlands may be defined as waters under the Act,\xe2\x80\x9d 474 U. S., at 134.  The Court reserved, however, the question of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 authority to regulate wetlands other than those adjacent to open waters.  See <em>id.</em>, at 131\xe2\x80\x93132, n.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>SWANCC</em>, the Court considered the validity of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over ponds and mudflats that were isolated in the sense of being unconnected to other waters covered by the Act.  531 U. S., at 171.  The property at issue was an abandoned sand and gravel pit mining operation where \xe2\x80\x9cremnant excavation trenches\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9cevolv[ed] into a scattering of permanent and seasonal ponds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 163.  Asserting jurisdiction pursuant to a regulation called the \xe2\x80\x9cMigratory Bird Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d the Corps argued that these isolated ponds were \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d (and thus \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act) because they were used as habitat by migratory birds.  <em>Id.</em>, at 164\xe2\x80\x93165.  The Court rejected this theory.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the significant nexus between wetlands and \xe2\x80\x98navigable waters,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held, \xe2\x80\x9cthat informed our reading of the [Act] in <em>Riverside Bayview Homes</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 167.  Because such a nexus was lacking with respect to isolated ponds, the Court held that the plain text of the statute did not permit the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 action.  <em>Id.</em>, at 172.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Riverside Bayview</em> and <em>SWANCC</em> establish the framework for the inquiry in the cases now before the Court: Do the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulations, as applied to the wetlands in <em>Carabell</em> and the three wetlands parcels in <em>Rapanos</em>, constitute a reasonable interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d as in <em>Riverside Bayview</em> or an invalid construction as in <em>SWANCC?</em>  Taken together these cases establish that in some instances, as exemplified by <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, the connection between a nonnavigable water or wetland and a navigable water may be so close, or potentially so close, that the Corps may deem the water or wetland a \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable water\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.  In other instances, as exemplified by <em>SWANCC</em>, there may be little or no connection.  Absent a significant nexus, jurisdiction under the Act is lacking.  Because neither the plurality nor the dissent addresses the nexus requirement, this separate opinion, in my respectful view, is necessary.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion begins from a correct premise.  As the plurality points out, and as <em>Riverside Bayview</em> holds, in enacting the Clean Water Act Congress intended to regulate at least some waters that are not navigable in the traditional sense.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12; <em>Riverside Bayview,</em> 474 U. S., at 133; see also <em>SWANCC</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 167.  This conclusion is supported by \xe2\x80\x9cthe evident breadth of congressional concern for protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 133; see also <em>Milwaukee</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/index.html">451 U. S. 304</a>, 318 (1981) (describing the Act as \xe2\x80\x9can all-encompassing program of water pollution regulation\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is further compelled by statutory text, for the text is explicit in extending the coverage of the Act to some nonnavigable waters.  In a provision allowing States to assume some regulatory functions of the Corps (an option Michigan has exercised), the Act limits States to issuing permits for:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters (other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce shoreward to their ordinary high water mark, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide shoreward to their ordinary high water mark, or mean higher high water mark on the west coast, including wetlands adjacent thereto) within its jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(g)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWere there no Clean Water Act \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d apart from waters \xe2\x80\x9cpresently used\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible to use\xe2\x80\x9d in interstate commerce, the \xe2\x80\x9cother than\xe2\x80\x9d clause, which begins the long parenthetical statement, would overtake the delegation of authority the provision makes at the outset.  Congress, it follows, must have intended a broader meaning for navigable waters.  The mention of wetlands in the \xe2\x80\x9cother than\xe2\x80\x9d clause, moreover, makes plain that at least some wetlands fall within the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 138\xe2\x80\x93139, and n. 11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From this reasonable beginning the plurality proceeds to impose two limitations on the Act; but these limitations, it is here submitted, are without support in the language and purposes of the Act or in our cases interpreting it.  First, because the dictionary defines \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cwater \xe2\x80\x98[a]s found in streams and bodies forming geographical features such as oceans, rivers, [and] lakes,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98the flowing or moving masses, as of waves or floods, making up such streams or bodies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second)), the plurality would conclude that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d permits Corps and EPA jurisdiction only over \xe2\x80\x9crelatively permanent, standing or flowing bodies of water,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x94a category that in the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s view includes \xe2\x80\x9cseasonal\xe2\x80\x9d rivers, that is, rivers that carry water continuously except during \xe2\x80\x9cdry months,\xe2\x80\x9d but not intermittent or ephemeral streams, <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315, and n.\xc2\xa05.  Second, the plurality asserts that wetlands fall within the Act only if they bear \xe2\x80\x9ca continuous surface connection to bodies that are \xe2\x80\x98waters of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 in their own right\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94waters, that is, that satisfy the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of permanent standing water or continuous flow.  <em>Ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s first requirement\xe2\x80\x94permanent standing water or continuous flow, at least for a period of \xe2\x80\x9csome months,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, and n.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x94makes little practical sense in a statute concerned with downstream water quality.  The merest trickle, if continuous, would count as a \xe2\x80\x9cwater\xe2\x80\x9d subject to federal regulation, while torrents thundering at irregular intervals through otherwise dry channels would not.  Though the plurality seems to presume that such irregular flows are too insignificant to be of concern in a statute focused on \xe2\x80\x9cwaters,\xe2\x80\x9d that may not always be true.  Areas in the western parts of the Nation provide some examples.  The Los Angeles River, for instance, ordinarily carries only a trickle of water and often looks more like a dry roadway than a river.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> B. Gumprecht, The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth 1\xe2\x80\x932 (1999); Martinez, City of Angels\xe2\x80\x99 Signature River Tapped for Rebirth, Chicago Tribune, Apr. 10, 2005, section 1, p.\xc2\xa08.  Yet it periodically releases water-volumes so powerful and destructive that it has been encased in concrete and steel over a length of some 50 miles.  See Gumprecht, <em>supra</em>, at 227.  Though this particular waterway might satisfy the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s test, it is illustrative of what often-dry watercourses can become when rain waters flow.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> County of Los Angeles Dept. of Public Works, Water Resources Division:\n2002\xe2\x80\x932003 Hydrologic Report, Runoff, Daily Discharge, F377\xe2\x80\x93R BOUQUET CANYON CREEK at Urbandale Avenue 11107860 Bouquet Creek Near Saugus,\nCA, http://ladpw.org/wrd/report/0203/runoff/discharge.cfm (indicating creek carried no flow for much of the year but carried 122 cubic feet per second on Feb. 12, 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, Congress could draw a line to exclude irregular waterways, but nothing in the statute suggests it has done so.  Quite the opposite, a full reading of the dictionary definition precludes the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on permanence: The term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d may mean \xe2\x80\x9cflood or inundation,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 2882, events that are impermanent by definition.  Thus, although of course the Act\xe2\x80\x99s use of the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable\xe2\x80\x9d indicates a focus on waterways rather than floods, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cwater,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, does not necessarily carry the connotation of \xe2\x80\x9crelatively permanent, standing or flowing bodies of water,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  (And contrary to the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n.\xc2\xa04, there is no indication in the dictionary that the \xe2\x80\x9cflood or inundation\xe2\x80\x9d definition is limited to poetry.)  In any event, even granting the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s preferred definition\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cwater \xe2\x80\x98[a]s found in streams and bodies forming geographical features such as oceans, rivers, [and] lakes,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 2882)\xe2\x80\x94the dissent is correct to observe that an intermittent flow can constitute a stream, in the sense of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a current or course of water or other fluid, flowing on the earth,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa06 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 2493), while it is flowing.  See <em>post</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (Stevens,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (also noting Court\xe2\x80\x99s use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98intermittent stream\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Harrisonville</em> v. <em>W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/289/334/index.html">289 U. S. 334</a>, 335 (1933)).  It follows that the Corps can reasonably interpret the Act to cover the paths of such impermanent streams.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from the dictionary, the plurality invokes <em>Riverside Bayview</em> to support its interpretation that the term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d is so confined, but this reliance is misplaced.  To be sure, the Court there compared wetlands to \xe2\x80\x9crivers, streams, and other hydrographic features more conventionally identifiable as \xe2\x80\x98waters.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  474 U. S., at 131.  It is quite a stretch to claim, however, that this mention of hydrographic features \xe2\x80\x9cechoe[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the dictionary\xe2\x80\x99s reference to <em>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98geographical features</em> such as oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 2882).  In fact the <em>Riverside Bayview</em> opinion does not cite the dictionary definition on which the plurality relies, and the phrase \xe2\x80\x9chydrographic features\xe2\x80\x9d could just as well refer to intermittent streams carrying substantial flow to navigable waters.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 1221 (defining \xe2\x80\x9chydrography\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he description and study of seas, lakes, rivers, and other waters; specif[ically] \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]he measurement of flow and investigation of the behavior of streams, esp[ecially] with reference to the control or utilization of their waters\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Also incorrect is the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to draw support from the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpoint source\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(14).  This definition is central to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory structure, for the term \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d is defined in relevant part to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71362(12).  Interpreting the point-source definition, the plurality presumes, first, that the point-source examples describe \xe2\x80\x9cwatercourses through which <em>intermittent</em> waters typically flow,\xe2\x80\x9d and second, that point sources and navigable waters are \xe2\x80\x9cseparate and distinct categories.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  From this the plurality concludes, by a sort of negative inference, that navigable waters may not be intermittent.  The conclusion is unsound.  Nothing in the point-source definition requires an intermittent flow.  Polluted water could flow night and day from a pipe, channel, or conduit and yet still qualify as a point source; any contrary conclusion would likely exclude, among other things, effluent streams from sewage treatment plants.  As a result, even were the statute read to require continuity of flow for navigable waters, certain water-bodies could conceivably constitute both a point source and a water.  At any rate, as the dissent observes, the fact that point sources may carry continuous flow undermines the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that covered \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act may not be discontinuous.  See <em>post</em>, at 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s second limitation\xe2\x80\x94exclusion of wetlands lacking a continuous surface connection to other jurisdictional waters\xe2\x80\x94is also unpersuasive.  To begin with, the plurality is wrong to suggest that wetlands are \xe2\x80\x9c<em>indistinguishable</em>\xe2\x80\x9d from waters to which they bear a surface connection.  <em>Ante</em>, at 37.  Even if the precise boundary may be imprecise, a bog or swamp is different from a river.  The question is what circumstances permit a bog, swamp, or other nonnavigable wetland to constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable water\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act\xe2\x80\x94as \xc2\xa71344(g)(1), if nothing else, indicates is sometimes possible, see <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  <em>Riverside Bayview</em> addressed that question and its answer is inconsistent with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s theory.  There, in upholding the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 authority to regulate \xe2\x80\x9cwetlands adjacent to other bodies of water over which the Corps has jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court deemed it irrelevant whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe moisture creating the wetlands \xe2\x80\xa6 find[s] its source in the adjacent bodies of water.\xe2\x80\x9d  474 U. S., at 135.  The Court further observed that adjacency could serve as a valid basis for regulation even as to \xe2\x80\x9cwetlands that are not significantly intertwined with the ecosystem of adjacent waterways.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 135, n.\xc2\xa09.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the Corps to conclude that in the majority of cases, adjacent wetlands have significant effects on water quality and the aquatic ecosystem, its definition can stand.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court in <em>Riverside Bayview</em> did note, it is true, the difficulty of defining where \xe2\x80\x9cwater ends and land begins,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 132, and the Court cited that problem as one reason for deferring to the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 view that adjacent wetlands could constitute waters.  Given, however, the further recognition in <em>Riverside Bayview</em> that an overinclusive definition is permissible even when it reaches wetlands holding moisture disconnected from adjacent water-bodies, <em>id.,</em> at 135, and n.\xc2\xa09, <em>Riverside Bayview</em>\xe2\x80\x99s observations about the difficulty of defining the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge cannot be taken to establish that when a clear boundary is evident, wetlands beyond the boundary fall outside the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the same reason <em>Riverside Bayview</em> also cannot be read as rejecting only the proposition, accepted by the Court of Appeals in that case, that wetlands covered by the Act must contain moisture originating in neighboring waterways.  See <em>id.,</em> at 125, 134.  Since the Court of Appeals had accepted that theory, the Court naturally addressed it.  Yet to view the decision\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning as limited to that issue\xe2\x80\x94an interpretation the plurality urges here, <em>ante</em>, at 33, n.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x94would again overlook the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s broader focus on wetlands\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csignificant effects on water quality and the aquatic ecosystem,\xe2\x80\x9d 474 U. S., at 135, n.\xc2\xa09.  In any event, even were this reading of <em>Riverside Bayview</em> correct, it would offer no support for the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s proposed requirement of a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous surface connection,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 23.  The Court in <em>Riverside Bayview</em> rejected the proposition that origination in flooding was necessary for jurisdiction over wetlands.  It did not suggest that a flood-based origin would not support jurisdiction; indeed, it presumed the opposite.  See 474 U. S., at 134 (noting that the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 view was valid \xe2\x80\x9c<em>even</em> for wetlands that are not the result of flooding or permeation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Needless to say, a continuous connection is not necessary for moisture in wetlands to result from flooding\xe2\x80\x94the connection might well exist only during floods.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>SWANCC</em>, likewise, does not support the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s surface-connection requirement.  <em>SWANCC</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that \xe2\x80\x9cnonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters,\xe2\x80\x9d 531 U. S., at 171, are not \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d is not an explicit or implicit overruling of <em>Riverside Bayview</em>\xe2\x80\x99s approval of adjacency as a factor in determining the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.  In rejecting the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 claimed authority over the isolated ponds in <em>SWANCC</em>, the Court distinguished adjacent nonnavigable waters such as the wetlands addressed in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>.  531 U. S., at 167, 170\xe2\x80\x93171.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As <em>Riverside Bayview</em> recognizes, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 adjacency standard is reasonable in some of its applications.  Indeed, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 view draws support from the structure of the Act, while the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s surface-water-connection requirement does not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As discussed above, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters, 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71311(a), covers both the discharge of toxic materials such as sewage, chemical waste, biological material, and radioactive material and the discharge of dredged spoil, rock, sand, cellar dirt, and the like.  All these substances are defined as pollutants whose discharge into navigable waters violates the Act.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a), 1362(6), (12).  One reason for the parallel treatment may be that the discharge of fill material can impair downstream water quality.  The plurality argues otherwise, asserting that dredged or fill material \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not normally wash downstream.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  As the dissent points out, this proposition seems questionable as an empirical matter.  See <em>post</em>, at 22.  It seems plausible that new or loose fill, not anchored by grass or roots from other vegetation, could travel downstream through waterways adjacent to a wetland; at the least this is a factual possibility that the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 experts can better assess than can the plurality.  Silt, whether from natural or human sources, is a major factor in aquatic environments, and it may clog waterways, alter ecosystems, and limit the useful life of dams.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Fountain, Unloved, But Not Unbuilt, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, June 5, 2005 section 4, p.\xc2\xa03, col. 1; DePalma, Dam to Be Demolished to Save an Endangered Species, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Apr. 26, 2004, section B, p.\xc2\xa01, col. 2; MacDougall, Damage Can Be Irreversible, Los Angeles Times, June 19, 1987, pt. 1, p.\xc2\xa010, col. 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even granting, however, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that fill material will stay put, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 parallel treatment of fill material and toxic pollution may serve another purpose.  As the Court noted in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Corps has concluded that wetlands may serve to filter and purify water draining into adjacent bodies of water, 33 CFR \xc2\xa7320.4(b)(2)(vii) (1985), and to slow the flow of surface runoff into lakes, rivers, and streams and thus prevent flooding and erosion, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7320.4(b)(2)(iv) and (v).\xe2\x80\x9d  474 U. S., at 134.  Where wetlands perform these filtering and runoff-control functions, filling them may increase downstream pollution, much as a discharge of toxic pollutants would.  Not only will dirty water no longer be stored and filtered but also the act of filling and draining itself may cause the release of nutrients, toxins, and pathogens that were trapped, neutralized, and perhaps amenable to filtering or detoxification in the wetlands.  See U. S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Wetlands: Their Use and Regulation, OTA\xe2\x80\x93O\xe2\x80\x93206 pp.\xc2\xa043, 48\xe2\x80\x9352 (Mar. 1984), http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/OTA_4/DATA/1984/8433.pdf (hereinafter OTA).  In many cases, moreover, filling in wetlands separated from another water by a berm can mean that flood water, impurities, or runoff that would have been stored or contained in the wetlands will instead flow out to major waterways.  With these concerns in mind, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 definition of adjacency is a reasonable one, for it may be the absence of an interchange of waters prior to the dredge and fill activity that makes protection of the wetlands critical to the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is inconsistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, and purpose.  As a fallback the plurality suggests that avoidance canons would compel its reading even if the text were unclear.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9320.  In <em>SWANCC</em>, as one reason for rejecting the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of jurisdiction over the isolated ponds at issue there, the Court observed that this \xe2\x80\x9capplication of [the Corps\xe2\x80\x99] regulations\xe2\x80\x9d would raise significant questions of Commerce Clause authority and encroach on traditional state land-use regulation.  531 U. S., at 174.  As <em>SWANCC</em> observed, <em>ibid.</em>, and as the plurality points out here, <em>ante</em>, at 18, the Act states that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the policy of the Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, [and] to plan the development and use \xe2\x80\xa6 of land and water resources,\xe2\x80\x9d 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(b).  The Court in <em>SWANCC</em> cited this provision as evidence that a clear statement supporting jurisdiction in applications raising constitutional and federalism difficulties was lacking.  531 U. S., at 174.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concerns addressed in <em>SWANCC</em> do not support the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Act.  In <em>SWANCC</em>, by interpreting the Act to require a significant nexus with navigable waters, the Court avoided applications\xe2\x80\x94those involving waters without a significant nexus\xe2\x80\x94that appeared likely, as a category, to raise constitutional difficulties and federalism concerns.  Here, in contrast, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation does not fit the avoidance concerns it raises.  On the one hand, when a surface-water connection is lacking, the plurality forecloses jurisdiction over wetlands that abut navigable-in-fact waters\xe2\x80\x94even though such navigable waters were traditionally subject to federal authority.  On the other hand, by saying the Act covers wetlands (however remote) possessing a surface-water connection with a continuously flowing stream (however small), the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reading would permit applications of the statute as far from traditional federal authority as are the waters it deems beyond the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Even assuming, then, that federal regulation of remote wetlands and nonnavigable waterways would raise a difficult Comerce Clause issue notwithstanding those waters\xe2\x80\x99 aggregate effects on national water quality, but cf. <em>Wickard</em> v. <em>Filburn,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/111/index.html">317 U. S. 111</a> (1942); see also <em>infra</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reading is not responsive to this concern.  As for States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibilities and rights,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71251(b), it is noteworthy that 33 States plus the District of Columbia have filed an <em>amici</em> brief in this litigation asserting that the Clean Water Act is important to their own water policies.  See Brief for States of New York et\xc2\xa0al. 1\xe2\x80\x933.  These <em>amici</em> note, among other things, that the Act protects downstream States from out-of-state pollution that they cannot themselves regulate.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It bears mention also that the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s overall tone and approach\xe2\x80\x94from the characterization of acres of wetlands destruction as \xe2\x80\x9cbackfilling \xe2\x80\xa6 wet fields,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 2, to the rejection of Corps authority over \xe2\x80\x9cman-made drainage ditches\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdry arroyos\xe2\x80\x9d without regard to how much water they periodically carry, <em>ante</em>, at 15, to the suggestion, seemingly contrary to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment, that discharge of fill material is inconsequential for adjacent waterways, <em>ante</em>, at 26, and n. 11\xe2\x80\x94seems unduly dismissive of the interests asserted by the United States in these cases.  Important public interests are served by the Clean Water Act in general and by the protection of wetlands in particular.  To give just one example, <em>amici</em> here have noted that nutrient-rich runoff from the Mississippi River has created a hypoxic, or oxygen-depleted, \xe2\x80\x9cdead zone\xe2\x80\x9d in the Gulf of Mexico that at times approaches the size of Massachusetts and New Jersey.  Brief for Association of State Wetland Managers et\xc2\xa0al. 21\xe2\x80\x9323; Brief for Environmental Law Institute 23.  Scientific evidence indicates that wetlands play a critical role in controlling and filtering runoff.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> OTA 43, 48\xe2\x80\x9352; R. Tiner, In Search of Swampland:  A Wetland Sourcebook and Field Guide 93\xe2\x80\x9395 (2d ed. 2005); Whitmire &amp; Hamilton, Rapid Removal of Nitrate and Sulfate in Freshwater Wetland Sediments, 34 J. Env. Quality 2062 (2005).  It is true, as the plurality indicates, that environmental concerns provide no reason to disregard limits in the statutory text, <em>ante</em>, at 27, but in my view the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is not a correct reading of the text.  The limits the plurality would impose, moreover, give insufficient deference to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purposes in enacting the Clean Water Act and to the authority of the Executive to implement that statutory mandate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it should go without saying that because the plurality presents its interpretation of the Act as the only permissible reading of the plain text, <em>ante</em>, at 20, 23\xe2\x80\x9324, the Corps would lack discretion, under the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s theory, to adopt contrary regulations.  The Chief Justice suggests that if the Corps and EPA had issued new regulations after <em>SWANCC</em> they would have \xe2\x80\x9cenjoyed plenty of room to operate in developing <em>some</em> notion of an outer bound to the reach of their authority\xe2\x80\x9d and thus could have avoided litigation of the issues we address today.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  That would not necessarily be true under the opinion The Chief Justice has joined.  New rulemaking could have averted the disagreement here only if the Corps had anticipated the unprecedented reading of the Act that the plurality advances.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the plurality reads nonexistent requirements into the Act, the dissent reads a central requirement out\xe2\x80\x94namely, the requirement that the word \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d be given some importance.  Although the Court has held that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language invokes Congress\xe2\x80\x99 traditional authority over waters navigable in fact or susceptible of being made so, <em>SWANCC</em>, 531 U. S., at 172 (citing <em>Appalachian Power</em>, 311 U. S., at 407\xe2\x80\x93408), the dissent would permit federal regulation whenever wetlands lie alongside a ditch or drain, however remote and insubstantial, that eventually may flow into traditional navigable waters.  The deference owed to the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the statute does not extend so far.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of words creates difficulties, for the Act contemplates regulation of certain \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d that are not in fact navigable.  <em>Supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  Nevertheless, the word \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act must be given some effect.  See <em>SWANCC</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 172.  Thus, in <em>SWANCC</em> the Court rejected the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of jurisdiction over isolated ponds and mudflats bearing no evident connection to navigable-in-fact waters.  And in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, while the Court indicated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe term \xe2\x80\x98navigable\xe2\x80\x99 as used in the Act is of limited import,\xe2\x80\x9d 474 U. S., at 133, it relied, in upholding jurisdiction, on the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 judgment that \xe2\x80\x9cwetlands adjacent to lakes, rivers, streams, and other bodies of water may function as integral parts of the aquatic environment even when the moisture creating the wetlands does not find its source in the adjacent bodies of water,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 135.  The implication, of course, was that wetlands\xe2\x80\x99 status as \xe2\x80\x9cintegral parts of the aquatic environment\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, their significant nexus with navigable waters\xe2\x80\x94was what established the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over them as waters of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with <em>SWANCC</em> and <em>Riverside Bayview</em> and with the need to give the term \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable\xe2\x80\x9d some meaning, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over wetlands depends upon the existence of a significant nexus between the wetlands in question and navigable waters in the traditional sense.  The required nexus must be assessed in terms of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s goals and purposes.  Congress enacted the law to \xe2\x80\x9crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters,\xe2\x80\x9d 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(a), and it pursued that objective by restricting dumping and filling in \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a), 1362(12).  With respect to wetlands, the rationale for Clean Water Act regulation is, as the Corps has recognized, that wetlands can perform critical functions related to the integrity of other waters\xe2\x80\x94functions such as pollutant trapping, flood control, and runoff storage.  33 CFR \xc2\xa7320.4(b)(2).  Accordingly, wetlands possess the requisite nexus, and thus come within the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d if the wetlands, either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters more readily understood as \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable.\xe2\x80\x9d  When, in contrast, wetlands\xe2\x80\x99 effects on water quality are speculative or insubstantial, they fall outside the zone fairly encompassed by the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the dissent acknowledges that wetlands\xe2\x80\x99 ecological functions vis-\xc3\x80-vis other covered waters are the basis for the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulation of them, <em>post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, it concludes that the ambiguity in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d allows the Corps to construe the statute as reaching all \xe2\x80\x9cnon-isolated wetlands,\xe2\x80\x9d just as it construed the Act to reach the wetlands adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, see <em>post</em>, at 11.  This, though, seems incorrect.  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 theory of jurisdiction in these consolidated cases\xe2\x80\x94adjacency to tributaries, however remote and insubstantial\xe2\x80\x94raises concerns that go beyond the holding of <em>Riverside Bayview;</em> and so the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of jurisdiction cannot rest on that case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As applied to wetlands adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 conclusive standard for jurisdiction rests upon a reasonable inference of ecologic interconnection, and the assertion of jurisdiction for those wetlands is sustainable under the Act by showing adjacency alone.  That is the holding of <em>Riverside Bayview</em>.  Furthermore, although the <em>Riverside Bayview</em> Court reserved the question of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 authority over \xe2\x80\x9cwetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of open water,\xe2\x80\x9d 474 U. S., at 131\xe2\x80\x93132, n.\xc2\xa08, and in any event addressed no factual situation other than wetlands adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters, it may well be the case that <em>Riverside Bayview</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning\xe2\x80\x94supporting jurisdiction without any inquiry beyond adjacency\xe2\x80\x94could apply equally to wetlands adjacent to certain major tributaries.  Through regulations or adjudication, the Corps may choose to identify categories of tributaries that, due to their volume of flow (either annually or on average), their proximity to navigable waters, or other relevant considerations, are significant enough that wetlands adjacent to them are likely, in the majority of cases, to perform important functions for an aquatic system incorporating navigable waters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 existing standard for tributaries, however, provides no such assurance.  As noted earlier, the Corps deems a water a tributary if it feeds into a traditional navigable water (or a tributary thereof) and possesses an ordinary high-water mark, defined as a \xe2\x80\x9cline on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by [certain] physical characteristics,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7328.3(e).  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.  This standard presumably provides a rough measure of the volume and regularity of flow.  Assuming it is subject to reasonably consistent application, but see U. S. General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Natural Resources and Regulating Affairs, Committee on Reform, House of Representatives, Waters and Wetlands: Corps of Engineers Needs to Evaluate Its District Office Practices in Determining Jurisdiction, GAO\xe2\x80\x9304\xe2\x80\x93297 pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934 (Feb. 2004), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04297.pdf (noting variation in results among Corps district offices), it may well provide a reasonable measure of whether specific minor tributaries bear a sufficient nexus with other regulated waters to constitute \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.  Yet the breadth of this standard\xe2\x80\x94which seems to leave wide room for regulation of drains, ditches, and streams remote from any navigable-in-fact water and carrying only minor water-volumes towards it\xe2\x80\x94precludes its adoption as the determinative measure of whether adjacent wetlands are likely to play an important role in the integrity of an aquatic system comprising navigable waters as traditionally understood.  Indeed, in many cases wetlands adjacent to tributaries covered by this standard might appear little more related to navigable-in-fact waters than were the isolated ponds held to fall beyond the Act\xe2\x80\x99s scope in <em>SWANCC</em>.  Cf. Leibowitz &amp; Nadeau, Isolated Wetlands: State-of-the-Science and Future Directions, 23 Wetlands 663, 669 (2003) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98isolated\xe2\x80\x99 is generally a matter of degree\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the Corps seeks to regulate wetlands adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters, it may rely on adjacency to establish its jurisdiction.  Absent more specific regulations, however, the Corps must establish a significant nexus on a case-by-case basis when it seeks to regulate wetlands based on adjacency to nonnavigable tributaries.  Given the potential overbreadth of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulations, this showing is necessary to avoid unreasonable applications of the statute.  Where an adequate nexus is established for a particular wetland, it may be permissible, as a matter of administrative convenience or necessity, to presume covered status for other comparable wetlands in the region.  That issue, however, is neither raised by these facts nor addressed by any agency regulation that accommodates the nexus requirement outlined here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation of the Act does not raise federalism or Commerce Clause concerns sufficient to support a presumption against its adoption.  To be sure, the significant nexus requirement may not align perfectly with the traditional extent of federal authority.  Yet in most cases regulation of wetlands that are adjacent to tributaries and possess a significant nexus with navigable waters will raise no serious constitutional or federalism difficulty.

[T]he exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce may be aided by appropriate and needful control of activities and agencies which, though intrastate, affect that commerce\xe2\x80\x9d).  As explained earlier, moreover, and as exemplified by <em>SWANCC</em>, the significant-nexus test itself prevents problematic applications of the statute.  See <em>supra</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320; 531 U. S., at 174.  The possibility of legitimate Commerce Clause and federalism concerns in some circumstances does not require the adoption of an interpretation that departs in all cases from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure.

Thus the end result in these cases and many others to be considered by the Corps may be the same as that suggested by the dissent, namely, that the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of jurisdiction is valid.  Given, however, that neither the agency nor the reviewing courts properly considered the issue, a remand is appropriate, in my view, for application of the controlling legal standard.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Rapanos</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the dissent points out, in Rapanos</em>, No. 04\xe2\x80\x931034, an expert whom the District Court found \xe2\x80\x9ceminently qualified\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chighly credible,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert.

Although the expert had \xe2\x80\x9cnot studied the upstream drainage of these sites\xe2\x80\x9d and thus could not assert that the wetlands were performing important pollutant-trapping functions, <em>ibid.,</em> he did observe:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwe have a situation in which the flood water attenuation in that water is held on the site in the wetland \xe2\x80\xa6 such that it does not add to flood peak.  By the same token it would have some additional water flowing into the rivers during the drier periods, thus, increasing the low water flow\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  By the same token on all of the sites to the extent that they slow the flow of water off of the site they will also accumulate sediment and thus trap sediment and hold nutrients for use in those wetlands systems later in the season as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn addition, in assessing the hydrology prong of the three-part wetlands test, see <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, the District Court made extensive findings regarding water tables and drainage on the parcels at issue.  In applying the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdictional regulations, the District Court found that each of the wetlands bore surface water connections to tributaries of navigable-in-fact waters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Much the same evidence should permit the establishment of a significant nexus with navigable-in-fact waters, particularly if supplemented by further evidence about the significance of the tributaries to which the wetlands are connected.  The Court of Appeals, however, though recognizing that under <em>SWANCC</em> such a nexus was required for jurisdiction, held that a significant nexus \xe2\x80\x9ccan be satisfied by the presence of a hydrologic connection.\xe2\x80\x9d  376 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 639.  Absent some measure of the significance of the connection for downstream water quality, this standard was too uncertain.  Under the analysis described earlier,\n<em>supra</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323, 25, mere hydrologic connection should not suffice in all cases; the connection may be too insubstantial for the hydrologic linkage to establish the required nexus with navigable waters as traditionally understood.  In my view this case should be remanded so that the District Court may reconsider the evidence in light of the appropriate standard.  See,<em> e.g., Pullman&amp;nbhyph;Standard</em> v. <em>Swint,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/273/index.html">456 U. S. 273</a>, 291 (1982) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen an appellate court discerns that a district court has failed to make a finding because of an erroneous view of the law, the usual rule is that there should be a remand for further proceedings to permit the trial court to make the missing findings\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Carabell</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Carabell</em>, No. 04\xe2\x80\x931384, the record also contains evidence bearing on the jurisdictional inquiry.  The Corps noted in deciding the administrative appeal that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]esides the effects on wildlife habitat and water quality, the [district office] also noted that the project would have a major, long-term detrimental effect on wetlands, flood retention, recreation and conservation and overall ecology,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 218a.  Similarly, in the district office\xe2\x80\x99s permit evaluation, Corps officers observed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe proposed work would destroy/adversely impact an area that retains rainfall and forest nutrients and would replace it with a new source area for runoff pollutants.  Pollutants from this area may include lawn fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, road salt, oil, and grease.  These pollutants would then runoff directly into the waterway\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Overall, the operation and use of the proposed activity would have a major, long term, negative impact on water quality.  The cumulative impacts of numerous such projects would be major and negative as the few remaining wetlands in the area are developed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 97a\xe2\x80\x9398a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Corps\xe2\x80\x99 evaluation further noted that by \xe2\x80\x9celiminat[ing] the potential ability of the wetland to act as a sediment catch basin,\xe2\x80\x9d the proposed project \xe2\x80\x9cwould contribute to increased runoff and accretion \xe2\x80\xa6 along the drain and further downstream in Auvase Creek.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 98a.  And it observed that increased runoff from the site would likely cause downstream areas to \xe2\x80\x9csee an increase in possible flooding magnitude and frequency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 99a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conditional language in these assessments\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpotential ability,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpossible flooding\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94could suggest an undue degree of speculation, and a reviewing court must identify substantial evidence supporting the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 claims, see 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(E).  Nevertheless, the record does show that factors relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry have already been noted and considered.  As in <em>Rapanos</em>, though, the record gives little indication of the quantity and regularity of flow in the adjacent tributaries\xe2\x80\x94a consideration that may be important in assessing the nexus.  Also, as in <em>Rapanos</em>, the legal standard applied to the facts was imprecise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, considering the <em>Carabell</em> case after its <em>Rapanos</em> decision, framed the inquiry in terms of whether hydrologic connection is required to establish a significant nexus.  The court held that it is not, and that much of its holding is correct.  Given the role wetlands play in pollutant filtering, flood control, and runoff storage, it may well be the absence of hydrologic connection (in the sense of interchange of waters) that shows the wetlands\xe2\x80\x99 significance for the aquatic system.  In the administrative decision under review, however, the Corps based its jurisdiction solely on the wetlands\xe2\x80\x99 adjacency to the ditch opposite the berm on the property\xe2\x80\x99s edge.  As explained earlier, mere adjacency to a tributary of this sort is insufficient; a similar ditch could just as well be located many miles from any navigable-in-fact water and carry only insubstantial flow towards it.  A more specific inquiry, based on the significant nexus standard, is therefore necessary.  Thus, a remand is again required to permit application of the appropriate legal standard.

See<em> Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.</em> v. <em>Army Corps of Engineers, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/531/159/index.html">531 U. S. 159</a>, 181\xe2\x80\x93182 (2001) (<em>SWANCC</em>) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  I therefore have no difficulty finding that the wetlands at issue in these cases are within the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction, and I join Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My view of the statute rests in part upon the nature of the problem.  The statute seeks to \xe2\x80\x9crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  33  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(a).  Those waters are so various and so intricately interconnected that Congress might well have decided the only way to achieve this goal is to write a statute that defines \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d broadly and to leave the enforcing agency with the task of restricting the scope of that definition, either wholesale through regulation or retail through development permissions.  That is why I believe that Congress, in using the term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71362(7), intended fully to exercise its relevant Commerce Clause powers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I mention this because the Court, contrary to my view, has written a \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d requirement into the statute.  <em>SWANCC</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 167; <em>ante, </em>at 22 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over wetlands depends upon the existence of a significant nexus between the wetlands in question and navigable waters in the traditional sense\xe2\x80\x9d).  But it has left the administrative powers of the Army Corps of Engineers untouched.  That agency may write regulations defining the term\xe2\x80\x94something that it has not yet done.  And the courts must give those regulations appropriate deference.  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A.

In the absence of updated regulations, courts will have to make ad\xc2\xa0hoc<em> </em>determinations that run the risk of transforming scientific questions into matters of law.  That is not the system Congress intended.  Hence I believe that today\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, taken together, call for the Army Corps of Engineers to write new regulations, and speedily so.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962031">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nRAPANOS V.

The costs of achieving the Herculean goal of ending water pollution by 1985, see \xc2\xa71251(a), persuaded President Nixon to veto its enactment, but both Houses of Congress voted to override that veto by overwhelming margins.<font super="1">  To achieve its goal, Congress prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge of any pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94defined to include \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94without a permit issued by the Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps or Corps) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311(a), 1362(12)(A).

The broader question is whether regulations that have protected the quality of our waters for decades, that were implicitly approved by Congress, and that have been repeatedly enforced in case after case, must now be revised in light of the creative criticisms voiced by the plurality and Justice Kennedy today.  Rejecting more than 30 years of practice by the Army Corps, the plurality disregards the nature of the congressional delegation to the agency and the technical and complex character of the issues at stake.  Justice Kennedy similarly fails to defer sufficiently to the Corps, though his approach is far more faithful to our precedents and to principles of statutory interpretation than is the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the proper analysis is straightforward.  The Army Corps has determined that wetlands adjacent to tributaries of traditionally navigable waters preserve the quality of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters by, among other things, providing habitat for aquatic animals, keeping excessive sediment and toxic pollutants out of adjacent waters, and reducing downstream flooding by absorbing water at times of high flow.  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 resulting decision to treat these wetlands as encompassed within the term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d is a quintessential example of the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation of a statutory provision.

Because the plurality gives short shrift to the facts of this case\xe2\x80\x94as well as to those of No. 04\xe2\x80\x931384\xe2\x80\x94I shall discuss them at some length.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The facts related to the 230-acre Salzburg site are illustrative.  In 1988, John Rapanos asked the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) to inspect the site \xe2\x80\x9cin order to discuss with him the feasibility of building a shopping center there.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931034, p. B15.  An MDNR inspector informed Rapanos that the land probably included wetlands that were \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and sent him an application for a permit under \xc2\xa7404 of the Act.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Rapanos then hired a wetland consultant, Dr. Frederick Goff.  After Dr. Goff concluded that the land did in fact contain many acres of wetlands, \xe2\x80\x9cRapanos threatened to \xe2\x80\x98destroy\xe2\x80\x99 Dr. Goff if he did not destroy the wetland report, and refused to pay Dr. Goff unless and until he complied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In the meantime, without applying for a permit, Rapanos hired construction companies to do $350,000 worth of work clearing the land, filling in low spots, and draining subsurface water.  After Rapanos prevented MDNR inspectors from visiting the site, ignored an MDNR cease-and-desist letter, and refused to obey an administrative compliance order issued by the EPA, the matter was referred to the Department of Justice.  In the civil case now before us, the District Court found that Rapanos unlawfully filled 22 acres of wetlands.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rapanos and his wife engaged in similar behavior at the Hines Road and Pine River sites.  Without applying for \xc2\xa7404 permits, they hired construction companies to perform extensive clearing and filling activities.  They continued these activities even after receiving EPA administrative compliance orders directing them to cease the work immediately.  They ultimately spent $158,000 at the 275-acre Hines Road site, filling 17 of its existing 64 acres of wetlands.  At the 200-acre Pine River site, they spent $463,000 and filled 15 of its 49 acres of wetlands.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to their destruction, the wetlands at all three sites had surface connections to tributaries of traditionally navigable waters.  The Salzburg wetlands connected to a drain that flows into a creek that flows into the navigable Kawkawlin River.

The petitioners in that case own a 20-acre tract of land, of which 16 acres are wetlands, located in Macomb County a mile from Lake St. Clair.  These wetlands border a ditch that flows into a drain that flows into a creek that flows into Lake St. Clair.

The minimization of impacts to these wetlands is important for conservation and the overall ecology of the region.  Because the project development area is a forested wetland, the proposed project would destroy the resources in such a manner that they would not soon recover from impacts of the discharges.

In stark contrast to <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, however, <em>SWANCC</em> had nothing to say about wetlands, let alone about wetlands adjacent to traditionally navigable waters or their tributaries.  Instead, <em>SWANCC</em> dealt with a question specifically reserved by <em>Riverside Bayview, </em>see n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra</em>, namely, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over isolated waters\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98waters that are <em>not </em>part of a tributary system to interstate waters or to navigable waters of the United States, the degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U.

At issue in <em>SWANCC</em> was \xe2\x80\x9can abandoned sand and gravel pit . . . which provide[d] habitat for migratory birds\xe2\x80\x9d and contained a few pools of \xe2\x80\x9cnonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U. S., at 162, 166.  The Corps had asserted jurisdiction over the gravel pit under its 1986 Migratory Bird Rule, which treated isolated waters as within its jurisdiction if migratory birds depended upon these waters.  The Court rejected this jurisdictional basis since these isolated pools, unlike the wetlands at issue in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, had no \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d to traditionally navigable waters.  531 U.

In the process, the Court distinguished <em>Riverside Bayview</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to leave the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 regulations alone when it amended the Act in 1977, since \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]n both Chambers, debate on the proposals to narrow the definition of navigable waters centered largely on the issue of wetlands preservation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rather than on the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over truly isolated waters.  531 U.

As we recognized in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, the Corps has concluded that such wetlands play important roles in maintaining the quality of their adjacent waters, see <em>id.,</em> at 134\xe2\x80\x93135, and consequently in the waters downstream.  Among other things, wetlands can offer \xe2\x80\x9cnesting, spawning, rearing and resting sites for aquatic or land species\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cserve as valuable storage areas for storm and flood waters\xe2\x80\x9d; and provide \xe2\x80\x9csignificant water purification functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 CFR \xc2\xa7320.4(b)(2) (2005); 474 U.

Given that wetlands serve these important water quality roles and given the ambiguity inherent in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d the Corps has reasonably interpreted its jurisdiction to cover non-isolated wetlands.

S., at 135, n.\xc2\xa09.  Instead, it is enough that wetlands adjacent to tributaries generally have a significant nexus to the watershed\xe2\x80\x99s water quality.  If a particular wetland is \xe2\x80\x9cnot significantly intertwined with the ecosystem of adjacent waterways,\xe2\x80\x9d then the Corps may allow its development \xe2\x80\x9csimply by issuing a permit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </em>Accordingly, for purposes of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction it is of no significance that the wetlands in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931034 serve flood control and sediment sink functions, but may not do much to trap other pollutants, <em>supra,</em> at 4\xe2\x80\x935, and n.\xc2\xa02, or that the wetland in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931328 keeps excess water from Lake St. Clair but may not trap sediment, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seemingly alarmed by the costs involved, the plurality shies away from <em>Riverside Bayview</em>\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that jurisdiction is not a case-by-case affair.  I do not agree with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that the costs of preserving wetlands are unduly high.  It is true that the cost of \xc2\xa7404 permits are high for those who must obtain them[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]\xe2\x80\x94but these costs amount to only a small fraction of 1% of the $760 billion spent each year on private and public construction and development activity.  Sunding &amp; Zilberman 80.  More significant than the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s exaggerated concern about costs, however, is the fact that its omission of any discussion of the benefits that the regulations at issue have produced sheds a revelatory light on the quality (and indeed the impartiality) of its cost-benefit analysis.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The importance of wetlands for water quality\nis hard to overstate.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> U. S. Congress, Office\nof Technology Assessment, Wetlands: Their Use and Regulation, OTA\xe2\x80\x93206, pp. 43\xe2\x80\x9361 (Mar. 1984), http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/Ota_4/DATA/1984/8433.PDF (hereinafter OTA) (describing wetlands\xe2\x80\x99 role in floodpeak reduction, shoreline protection, ground water recharge, trapping of suspended sediment, filtering of toxic pollutants, and protection of fish and wildlife).  See also <em>ante</em>, at 20 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  Unsurprisingly, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 approach has the overwhelming endorsement of numerous <em>amici curiae</em>, including 33 States and the county in which the property in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931384 is located.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In final analysis, however, concerns about the appropriateness of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 30-year implementation of the Clean Water Act should be addressed to Congress or the Corps rather than to the Judiciary.  Whether the benefits of particular conservation measures outweigh their costs is a classic question of public policy that should not be answered by appointed judges.  The fact that large investments are required to finance large developments merely means that those who are most adversely affected by the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 permitting decisions are persons who have the ability to communicate effectively with their representatives.  Unless and until they succeed in convincing Congress (or the Corps) that clean water is less important today than it was in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, we continue to owe deference to regulations satisfying the \xe2\x80\x9cevident breadth of congressional concern for protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems\xe2\x80\x9d that all of the Justices on the Court in 1985 recognized in <em>Riverside Bayview, </em>474 U.

Under the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s view, then, the Corps can regulate polluters who dump dredge into a stream that flows year round but may not be able to regulate polluters who dump into a neighboring stream that flows for only 290 days of the year\xe2\x80\x94even if the dredge in this second stream would have the same effect on downstream waters as the dredge in the year-round one.  <em>Ante,</em> at 14, n.\xc2\xa05.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To find this arbitrary distinction compelled by the statute, the plurality cites a dictionary for a proposition that it does not contain.  The dictionary treats \xe2\x80\x9cstreams\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d but has nothing to say about whether streams must contain water year round to qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cstreams.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, and n.\xc2\xa06 (citing Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2493 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second), as defining stream as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98current or course of water or other fluid, flowing on the earth\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).

Even focusing only on the Act as it stood between 1972 and 1977, but see <em>International Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Ouellette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/481/index.html">479 U. S. 481</a>, 489\xe2\x80\x93490 (1987) (interpreting \xc2\xa71251(b) in light of the 1977 additions), broad exercise of jurisdiction by the Corps still left the States with ample rights and responsibilities.  See <em>S.\xc2\xa0D. Warren Co.</em> v. <em>Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection</em>, 547 U. S. __, __ (2006) (slip op., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315).  States had the power to impose tougher water pollution standards than required by the Act, \xc2\xa71370, and to prevent the Corps and the EPA from issuing permits, \xc2\xa71341(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94not to mention nearly exclusive responsibility for containing pollution from nonpoint sources.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The two canons of construction relied on by the plurality similarly fail to overcome the deference owed to the Corps.  First, the plurality claims that concerns about intruding on state power to regulate land use compel the conclusion that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d does not cover intermittent streams.  As we have recognized, however, Congress found it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98essential that discharge of pollutants be controlled at the source,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Riverside Bayview,</em> 474 U. S., at 133 (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 92\xe2\x80\x93414, p. 77 (1972)), and the Corps can define \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d broadly to accomplish this aim.  Second, the plurality suggests that the canon of constitutional avoidance applies because the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 approach might exceed the limits of our Commerce Clause authority.  Setting aside whether such a concern was proper in <em>SWANCC</em>, 531 U. S., at 173; but see <em>id.,</em> at 192\xe2\x80\x93196 (Stevens, J., dissenting), it is plainly not warranted here.  The wetlands in these cases are not \xe2\x80\x9cisolated\xe2\x80\x9d but instead are adjacent to tributaries of traditionally navigable waters and play important roles in the watershed, such as keeping water out of the tributaries or absorbing water from the tributaries.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no constitutional reason why Congress cannot, under the commerce power, treat the watersheds as a key to flood control on navigable streams and their tributaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oklahoma ex rel.</em> <em>Phillips</em> v. <em>Guy F. Atkinson Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/313/508/index.html">313 U. S. 508</a>, 525 (1941).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most importantly, the plurality disregards the fundamental significance of the Clean Water Act.  As then-Justice Rehnquist explained when writing for the Court in 1981, the Act was \xe2\x80\x9cnot merely another law\xe2\x80\x9d but rather was \xe2\x80\x9cviewed by Congress as a \xe2\x80\x98total restructuring\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98complete rewriting\xe2\x80\x99 of the existing water pollution legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milwaukee</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/index.html">451 U. S. 304</a>, 317.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 intent in enacting the [Act] was clearly to establish an all-encompassing program of water pollution regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe most casual perusal of the legislative history demonstrates that . . . views on the comprehensive nature of the legislation were practically universal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 318, and n.\xc2\xa012; see also 531 U. S., at 177\xe2\x80\x93181 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The Corps has concluded that it must regulate pollutants at the time they enter ditches or streams with ordinary high-water marks\xe2\x80\x94whether perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral\xe2\x80\x94in order to properly control water pollution.  65 Fed. Reg. 12823 (2000).  Because there is ambiguity in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and because interpreting it broadly to cover such ditches and streams advances the purpose of the Act, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 approach should command our deference<em>.</em>  Intermittent streams can carry pollutants just as perennial streams can, and their regulation may prove as important for flood control purposes.  The inclusion of all identifiable tributaries that ultimately drain into large bodies of water within the mantle of federal protection is surely wise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s second statutory invention is as arbitrary as its first.  Trivializing the significance of changing conditions in wetlands environments, the plurality imposes a separate requirement that \xe2\x80\x9cthe wetland has a continuous surface connection\xe2\x80\x9d with its abutting waterway such that it is \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to determine where the \xe2\x80\x98water\xe2\x80\x99 ends and the \xe2\x80\x98wetland\xe2\x80\x99 begins.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 24.  An \xe2\x80\x9cintermittent, physically remote hydrologic connection\xe2\x80\x9d between the wetland and other waters is not enough.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Under this view, wetlands that border traditionally navigable waters or their tributaries and perform the essential function of soaking up overflow waters during hurricane season\xe2\x80\x94thus reducing flooding downstream\xe2\x80\x94can be filled in by developers with impunity, as long as the wetlands lack a surface connection with the adjacent waterway the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality begins reasonably enough by recognizing that the Corps may appropriately regulate all wetlands \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adjacent to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d other waters.  <em>Ante,</em> at 21.  This recognition is wise, since the statutory text clearly accepts this standard.  Title 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(g)(1), added in 1977, includes \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent wetlands\xe2\x80\x9d in its description of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters\xe2\x80\x9d and thus \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly stated that the term \xe2\x80\x98waters\xe2\x80\x99 included adjacent wetlands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Riverside Bayview,</em> 474 U. S., at 138.  While this may not \xe2\x80\x9cconclusively determine the construction to be placed on the use of the term \xe2\x80\x98waters\xe2\x80\x99 elsewhere in the Act . . . , in light of the fact that the various provisions of the Act should be read <em>in pari materia</em>, it does at least suggest strongly that the term \xe2\x80\x98waters\xe2\x80\x99 as used in the Act does not necessarily exclude \xe2\x80\x98wetlands.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 138, n.\xc2\xa011.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality goes on, however, to define \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adjacent to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as meaning \xe2\x80\x9cwith a continuous surface connection to\xe2\x80\x9d other water.  <em>Ante,</em> at 21\xe2\x80\x9324.  It is unclear how the plurality reached this conclusion, though it plainly neglected to consult a dictionary.  Even its preferred Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second defines the term as \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ying near, close, <em>or</em> contiguous; neighboring; bordering on\xe2\x80\x9d and acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]bjects are Adjacent when they lie close to each other, but <em>not necessarily in actual contact.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 32 (emphasis added); see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third 26.  In any event, the proper question is not how the plurality would define \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent,\xe2\x80\x9d but whether the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 definition is reasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Corps defines \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cbordering, contiguous, or neighboring,\xe2\x80\x9d and specifies that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]etlands separated from other waters of the United States by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes and the like are \xe2\x80\x98adjacent wetlands.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  33 CFR \xc2\xa7328.3(c) (2005).  This definition is plainly reasonable, both on its face and in terms of the purposes of the Act.  While wetlands that are physically separated from other waters may perform less valuable functions, this is a matter for the Corps to evaluate in its permitting decisions.  We made this clear in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, 474 U. S., at 135, n. 9\xe2\x80\x94which did not impose the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s new requirement despite an absence of evidence that the wetland at issue had the sort of continuous surface connection required by the plurality today.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7; see also <em>ante,</em> at 15\xe2\x80\x9317 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (observing that the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s requirement is inconsistent with <em>Riverside Bayview</em>).  And as the facts of No. 04\xe2\x80\x931384 demonstrate, wetland separated by a berm from adjacent tributaries may still prove important to downstream water quality.  Moreover, Congress was on notice of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 definition of \xe2\x80\x9cadjacent\xe2\x80\x9d when it amended the Act in 1977 and added 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71344(g)(1).  See 42 Fed. Reg. 37129 (1977).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, implicitly recognizing that its approach endangers the quality of waters which Congress sought to protect, the plurality suggests that the EPA can regulate pollutants before they actually enter the \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 24\xe2\x80\x9327.  I express no view on the merits of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, which relies heavily on a respect for lower court judgments that is conspicuously lacking earlier in its opinion, <em>ante,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do fail to understand, however, why the plurality would not similarly apply this logic to dredged and fill material.  The EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority over pollutants (other than dredged and fill materials) stems from the identical statutory language that gives rise to the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7404 jurisdiction.  The plurality claims that there is a practical difference, asserting that dredged and fill material \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not normally wash downstream.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 26.  While more of this material will probably stay put than is true of soluble pollutants, the very existence of words like \xe2\x80\x9calluvium\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csilt\xe2\x80\x9d in our language, see Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third 59, 2119, suggests that at least some fill makes its way downstream.  See also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Deaton,</em> 332 F.\xc2\xa03d 698, 707 (CA4 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny pollutant or fill material that degrades water quality in a tributary has the potential to move downstream and degrade the quality of the navigable waters themselves\xe2\x80\x9d).<font b="1">  Moreover, such fill can harm the biological integrity of downstream waters even if it largely stays put upstream.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of protecting fish, see 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(a)(2); <em>S.\xc2\xa0D. Warren Co.,</em> 547 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314), could be seriously impaired by sediment in upstream waters where fish spawn, since excessive sediment can \xe2\x80\x9csmother bottom-dwelling invertebrates and impair fish spawning,\xe2\x80\x9d OTA 48.

S., at 167.  Because <em>Riverside Bayview</em> was written to encompass \xe2\x80\x9cwetlands adjacent to navigable waters and their tributaries,\xe2\x80\x9d 474 U. S., at 123, and reserved only the question of isolated waters, see <em>id., </em>at 131\xe2\x80\x93132, n.\xc2\xa08; see also n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra</em>, its determination of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction applies to the wetlands at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even setting aside the apparent applicability of <em>Riverside Bayview</em>. I think it clear that wetlands adjacent to tributaries of navigable waters generally have a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d with the traditionally navigable waters downstream.  Unlike the \xe2\x80\x9cnonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>SWANCC</em>, 531 U. S., at 171, these wetlands can obviously have a cumulative effect on downstream water flow by releasing waters at times of low flow or by keeping waters back at times of high flow.  This logical connection alone gives the wetlands the \xe2\x80\x9climited\xe2\x80\x9d connection to traditionally navigable waters that is all the statute requires, see <em>id.,</em> at 172; 474 U. S., at 133\xe2\x80\x94and disproves Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s claim that my approach gives no meaning to the word \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0navigable,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 21 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Similarly, these wetlands can preserve downstream water quality by trapping sediment, filtering toxic pollutants, protecting fish-spawning grounds, and so forth.  While there may exist categories of wetlands adjacent to tributaries of traditionally navigable waters that, taken cumulatively, have no plausibly discernable relationship to any aspect of downstream water quality, I am skeptical.  And even given Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d test, in the absence of compelling evidence that many such categories do exist I see no reason to conclude that the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 longstanding regulations are overbroad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csignificant nexus\xe2\x80\x9d test will probably not do much to diminish the number of wetlands covered by the Act in the long run.  Justice Kennedy himself recognizes that the records in both cases contain evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cshould permit the establishment of a significant nexus,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 27, see also <em>ante,</em> at 26, and it seems likely that evidence would support similar findings as to most (if not all) wetlands adjacent to tributaries of navigable waters.  But Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s approach will have the effect of creating additional work for all concerned parties.  Developers wishing to fill wetlands adjacent to ephemeral or intermittent tributaries of traditionally navigable waters will have no certain way of knowing whether they need to get \xc2\xa7404 permits or not.  And the Corps will have to make case-by-case (or category-by-category) jurisdictional determinations, which will inevitably increase the time and resources spent processing permit applications.  These problems are precisely the ones that <em>Riverside Bayview</em>\xe2\x80\x99s deferential approach avoided.  See 474 U. S., at 135, n.\xc2\xa09 (noting that it \xe2\x80\x9cis of little moment\xe2\x80\x9d if the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction encompasses some wetlands \xe2\x80\x9cnot significantly intertwined\xe2\x80\x9d with other waters of the United States).  Unlike Justice Kennedy, I see no reason to change <em>Riverside Bayview</em>\xe2\x80\x99s approach\xe2\x80\x94and every reason to continue to defer to the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s sensible, bright-line rule.</p>\n<p align="left">V </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I explained in <em>SWANCC</em>, Congress passed the Clean Water Act in response to wide-spread recognition\xe2\x80\x94based on events like the 1969 burning of the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland\xe2\x80\x94that our waters had become appallingly\npolluted.  531 U.

By curtailing the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction of more than 30 years, the plurality needlessly jeopardizes the quality of our waters.  In doing so, the plurality disregards the deference it owes the Executive, the congressional acquiescence in the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s position that we recognized in <em>Riverside Bayview</em>, and its own obligation to interpret laws rather than to make them.  While Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s approach has far fewer faults, nonetheless it also fails to give proper deference to the agencies entrusted by Congress to implement the Clean Water Act.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would affirm the judgments in both cases, and respectfully dissent from the decision of five Members of this Court to vacate and remand.  I close, however, by noting an unusual feature of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgments in these cases.  It has been our practice in a case coming to us from a lower federal court to enter a judgment commanding that court to conduct any further proceedings pursuant to a specific mandate.  That prior practice has, on occasion, made it necessary for Justices to join a judgment that did not conform to their own views.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  In these cases, however, while both the plurality and Justice Kennedy agree that there must be a remand for further proceedings, their respective opinions define different tests to be applied on remand.
