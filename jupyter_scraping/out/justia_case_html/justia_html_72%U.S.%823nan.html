No appeal was prayed or allowed until the June Term 1865.  At that term, on motion of the defendants below, an appeal was allowed <em>nunc pro tunc</em> as of 13 June, 1861.</p>\n<p>There is nothing in the record which warranted the making of this order, nor, if it could have been lawfully made, would it avail the defendant, for there was no citation to the appellees, and the record was not brought up at the next term of this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="824">Page 72 U.
