S. 321 .</p> <p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p> <p>Syllabus</p> <p><b>Yates v. United States</b></p> <p>certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p> <p>No. 13   7451.   Argued November 5, 2014   Decided February 25, 2015</p> <p>While conducting an offshore inspection of a commercial fishing vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, a federal agent found that the ship   s catch contained undersized red grouper, in violation of federal conservation regulations.  The officer instructed the ship   s captain, petitioner Yates, to keep the undersized fish segregated from the rest of the catch until the ship returned to port.  After the officer departed, Yates instead told a crew member to throw the undersized fish overboard.  For this offense, Yates was charged with destroying, concealing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in violation of  18 U.  S.  C.   1519.  That section provides that a person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if he    knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence    a federal investigation.  At trial, Yates moved for a judgment of acquittal on the   1519 charge.  Pointing to   1519   s origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a law designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Yates argued that   1519   s reference to    tangible object    subsumes objects used to store information, such as computer hard drives, not fish.  The District Court denied Yates   s motion, and a jury found him guilty of violating   1519.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, concluding that   1519 applies to the destruction or concealment of fish because, as objects having physical form, fish fall within the dictionary definition of    tangible object.   </p> <p><i>Held</i>:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p> <p>733 F.  3d 1059, reversed and remanded.</p> <p>                      Justice Ginsburg, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor, concluded that a    tangible object    within   1519   s compass is one used to record or preserve information.  Pp.  6   20.</p> <p>                      (a) Although dictionary definitions of the words    tangible    and    object    bear consideration in determining the meaning of    tangible object    in   1519, they are not dispositive.  Whether a statutory term is unambiguous    is determined [not only] by reference to the language itself, [but also by] the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.     <i>Robinson </i>v. <i>Shell Oil Co.</i>,  519 U.  S. 337 .  Identical language may convey varying content when used in different statutes, sometimes even in different provisions of the same statute.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>FAA</i> v. <i>Cooper</i>, 566 U.  S. ___, <b>___.</b>  Pp.  7   10.</p> <p>                      (b) Familiar interpretive guides aid the construction of    tangible object.     Though not commanding,   1519   s heading      Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy      conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records.  </p> <p>                      Section 1519   s position within Title 18, Chapter 73, further signals that   1519 was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the destruction of physical evidence.  Congress placed   1519 at the end of Chapter 73 following immediately after pre-existing specialized provisions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits.  </p> <p>                      The contemporaneous passage of   1512(c)(1), which prohibits a person from    alter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing] a record, document, or other object .  .  . with the intent to impair the object   s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding,    is also instructive.  The Government argues that   1512(c)(1)   s reference to    other object    includes any and every physical object.  But if   1519   s reference to    tangible object    already included all physical objects, as the Government also contends, then Congress had no reason to enact   1512(c)(1).  Section 1519 should not be read to render superfluous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act.  See <i>Marx</i> v. <i>General Revenue Corp.</i>, 568 U.  S. ___, ___.</p> <p>                      The words immediately surrounding    tangible object    in   1519      falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document      also cabin the contextual meaning of that term.  Applying the canons <i>noscitur a sociis </i>and <i>ejusdem generis</i>,    tangible object,    as the last in a list of terms that begins    any record [or] document,    is appropriately read to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the subset of tangible objects used to record or preserve information.  This moderate interpretation accords with the list of actions   1519 proscribes; the verbs    falsif[y]    and    mak[e] a false entry in    typically take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives.  See <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.</i>,  513 U.  S. 561 .    </p> <p>                      Use of traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and   1519 itself thus call for rejection of an aggressive interpretation of    tangible object.   </p> <p>                      Furthermore, the meaning of    record, document, or thing    in a provision of the 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) that has been interpreted to prohibit tampering with any kind of physical evidence is not a reliable indicator of the meaning Congress assigned to    record, document, or tangible object    in   1519.  There are significant differences between the offense described by the MPC provision and the offense created by   1519.  Pp.  10   18.</p> <p>                      (c) Finally, if recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction leaves any doubt about the meaning of    tangible object    in   1519, it would be appropriate to invoke the rule of lenity.  Pp.  18   19.</p> <p>                      Justice Alito concluded that traditional rules of statutory construction confirm that Yates has the better argument.  Title  18 U.  S.  C.   1519   s list of nouns, list of verbs, and title, when combined, tip the case in favor of Yates.  Applying the canons<i> noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis</i> to the list of nouns      any record, document, or tangible object      the term    tangible object    should refer to something similar to records or documents.  And while many of   1519   s verbs      alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in      could apply to far-flung nouns such as salamanders or sand dunes, the term    makes a false entry in    makes no sense outside of filekeeping.  Finally,   1519   s title      Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy      also points toward filekeeping rather than fish.

To prevent federal authorities from confirming that he had harvested undersized fish, Yates ordered a crew member to toss the suspect catch into the sea.  For this offense, he was charged with, and convicted of, violating18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71519, which provides:</p><p>                    \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Yates was also indicted and convicted under \xc2\xa72232(a), which provides:</p><p>                    \xe2\x80\x9cDestruction or Removal of Property to Prevent Seizure.\xe2\x80\x94Whoever, before, during, or after any search for or seizure of property by any person authorized to make such search or seizure, knowingly destroys, damages, wastes, disposes of, transfers, or otherwise takes any action, or knowingly attempts to destroy, damage, waste, dispose of, transfer, or otherwise take any action, for the purpose of preventing or impairing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s lawful authority to take such property into its custody or control or to continue holding such property under its lawful custody and control, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Yates does not contest his conviction for violating \xc2\xa72232(a), but he maintains that fish are not trappedwithin the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in \xc2\xa71519.</p><p>                    Section 1519 was enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,116Stat.745, legislation designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation.  A fish is no doubt an object that is tangible; fish can be seen, caught, andhandled, and a catch, as this case illustrates, is vulnerable to destruction.  But it would cut \xc2\xa71519 loose from itsfinancial-fraud mooring to hold that it encompasses any and all objects, whatever their size or significance, destroyed with obstructive intent.  Mindful that in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and accounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a matching construction of \xc2\xa71519 is in order: A tangible object captured by \xc2\xa71519, we hold, must be one used to record or preserve information.</p><p>I</p><p>                    On August 23, 2007, the <i>Miss Katie</i>, a commercial fishing boat, was six days into an expedition in the Gulf of Mexico. Her crew numbered three, including Yates, the captain.  Engaged in a routine offshore patrol to inspect both recreational and commercial vessels, Officer John Jones of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission decided to board the <i>Miss Katie</i> to check on the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with fishing rules.  Although the <i>Miss Katie </i>was far enough from the Florida coast to be in exclusively federal waters, she was nevertheless within Officer Jones\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  Because he had been deputized as a federal agent by the National Marine Fisheries Service, Officer Jones had authority to enforce federal, as well as state, fishing laws.</p><p>                    Upon boarding the <i>Miss Katie</i>, Officer Jones noticed three red grouper that appeared to be undersized hanging from a hook on the deck.  At the time, federal conservation regulations required immediate release of red grouper less than 20 inches long.  50 CFR \xc2\xa7622.37(d)(2)(ii) (effective April 2, 2007). Violation of those regulations is a civil offense punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension.  See 16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71857(1)(A), (G), 1858(a), (g).</p><p>                    Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on board, Officer Jones proceeded to inspect the ship\xe2\x80\x99s catch, setting aside and measuring only fish that appeared to him to be shorter than 20 inches.  Officer Jones ultimately determined that 72 fish fell short of the 20inch mark.  A fellow officer recorded the length of each of the undersized fish on a catch measurement verification form.  With few exceptions, the measured fish were between 19 and 20 inches; three were less than 19 inches; none were less than 18.75 inches.  After separating the fish measuring below 20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them in wooden crates, Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the fish, thus segregated, in the crates until the <i>Miss Katie </i>returned to port.  Before departing, Officer Jones issued Yates a citation for possession of undersized fish.</p><p>                    Four days later, after the <i>Miss Katie </i>had docked in Cortez, Florida, Officer Jones measured the fish contained in the wooden crates.  This time, however, the measured fish, although still less than 20 inches, slightly exceeded the lengths recorded on board.  Jones surmised that the fish brought to port were not the same as those he had detected during his initial inspection.  Under questioning, one of the crew members admitted that, at Yates\xe2\x80\x99s direction, he had thrown overboard the fish Officer Jones had measured at sea, and that he and Yates had replaced the tossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.</p><p>                    For reasons not disclosed in the record before us, more than 32 months passed before criminal charges were lodged against Yates.  On May 5, 2010, he was indicted for destroying property to prevent a federal seizure, in violation of \xc2\xa72232(a), and for destroying, concealing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in violation of \xc2\xa71519.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  By the time of the indictment, the minimum legal length for Gulf red grouper had been lowered from 20 inches to 18 inches.  See 50 CFR \xc2\xa7622.37(d)(2)(iv) (effective May 18, 2009).  No measured fish in Yates\xe2\x80\x99s catch fell below that limit.  The record does not reveal what civil penalty, if any, Yates received for his possession of fish undersized under the 2007 regulation.  See16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71858(a).</p><p>                    Yates was tried on the criminal charges in August 2011.  At the end of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief, he moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \xc2\xa71519 charge.  Pointing to \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s title and its origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Yates argued that the section sets forth \xe2\x80\x9ca documents offense\xe2\x80\x9d and that its reference to \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object[s]\xe2\x80\x9d subsumes \xe2\x80\x9ccomputer hard drives, logbooks, [and] things of that nature,\xe2\x80\x9d not fish.  App. 91\xe2\x80\x9392.  Yates acknowledged that the Criminal Code contains \xe2\x80\x9csections that would have been appropriate for the [G]overnment to pursue\xe2\x80\x9d if it wished to prosecute him for tampering with evidence.  App. 91.  Section 2232(a), set out <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932, fit that description.<i> </i>But \xc2\xa71519, Yates insisted, did not.</p><p>                    The Government countered that a \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d within \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s compass is \xe2\x80\x9csimply something other than a document or record.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 93.  The trial judge expressed misgivings about reading \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d as broadly as the Government urged:  \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there a Latin phrase [about] construction of a statute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. .  The gist of it is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. you take a look at [a] line of words, and you interpret the words consistently.  So if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about documents, and records, tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature of a document or a record, as opposed to a fish.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The first-instance judge nonetheless followed controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent.  While recognizing that \xc2\xa71519 was passed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud, the Court of Appeals had instructed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe broad language of \xc2\xa71519 is not limited to corporate fraud cases, and \xe2\x80\x98Congress is free to pass laws with language covering areas well beyond the particular crisis <i>du jour</i> that initially prompted legislative action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  No. 2:10\xe2\x80\x93cr\xe2\x80\x9366\xe2\x80\x93FtM\xe2\x80\x9329SPC (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2011), App. 116 (quoting <i>United States </i>v. <i>Hunt</i>, 526 F.\xc2\xa03d 739, 744 (CA11 2008)).  Accordingly, the trial court read \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d as a term \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdocument.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 116.  For violating \xc2\xa71519 and \xc2\xa72232(a), the court sentenced Yates to imprisonment for 30 days, followed by supervised release for three years.  App. 118\xe2\x80\x93120.  For life, he will bear the stigma of having a federal felony conviction.</p><p>                    On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found the text of \xc2\xa71519 \xe2\x80\x9cplain.\xe2\x80\x9d  733 F.\xc2\xa03d 1059, 1064 (2013).  Because \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cundefined\xe2\x80\x9d in the statute, the Court of Appeals gave the term its \xe2\x80\x9cordinary or natural meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, its dictionary definition, \xe2\x80\x9c[h]aving or possessing physical form.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1592 (9th ed. 2009)).</p><p>                    We granted certiorari, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), and now reverse the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p><p>II</p><p>                    The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company\xe2\x80\x99s outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents.  The Government acknowledges that \xc2\xa71519 was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrong-doing.  Brief for United States 46.  Prior law made it an offense to \xe2\x80\x9cintimidat[e], threate[n], or corruptly persuad[e] <i>another person</i>\xe2\x80\x9d to shred documents.  \xc2\xa71512(b) (emphasis added).  Section 1519 cured a conspicuous omission by imposing liability on a person who destroys records himself.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 107\xe2\x80\x93146, p. 14 (2002) (describing \xc2\xa71519 as \xe2\x80\x9ca new general anti shredding provision\xe2\x80\x9d and explaining that \xe2\x80\x9ccertain current provisions make it a crime to persuade another person to destroy documents, but not a crime to actually destroy the same documents yourself\xe2\x80\x9d).  The new section also expanded prior law by including within the provision\xe2\x80\x99s reach \xe2\x80\x9cany matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p><p>                    In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xc2\xa71519 extends beyond the principal evil motivating its passage.  The words of \xc2\xa71519, the Government argues, support reading the provision as a general ban on the spoliation of evidence, covering all physical items that might be relevant to any matter under federal investigation.</p><p>                    Yates urges a contextual reading of \xc2\xa71519, tying \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d to the surrounding words, the placement of the provision within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related provisions enacted at the same time, in particular \xc2\xa71520 and \xc2\xa71512(c)(1), see <i>infra</i>, at<i> </i>10, 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Section 1519, he maintains, targets not all manner of evidence, but records, documents, and tangible objects used to preserve them, <i>e.g.</i>, computers, servers, and other media on which information is stored.</p><p>                    We agree with Yates and reject the Government\xe2\x80\x99s unrestrained reading.  \xe2\x80\x9cTangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519, we conclude, is better read to cover only objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects in the physical world.</p><p>A</p><p>                    The ordinary meaning of an \xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9ctangible,\xe2\x80\x9d as stated in dictionary definitions, is \xe2\x80\x9ca discrete .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1555 (2002), that \xe2\x80\x9cpossess[es] physical form,\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1683 (10th ed. 2014).  From this premise, the Government concludes that \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term appears in \xc2\xa71519, covers the waterfront, including fish from the sea.</p><p>                    Whether a statutory term is unambiguous, however, does not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component words.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined [not only] by reference to the language itself, [but as well by] the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Robinson </i>v. <i>Shell Oil Co.</i>,519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 337,341 (1997).  See also <i>Deal</i> v. <i>United States</i>,508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129,132 (1993) (it is a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used\xe2\x80\x9d).

That Rule requires the prosecution to grant a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s request to inspect \xe2\x80\x9ctangible objects\xe2\x80\x9d within the Government\xe2\x80\x99s control that have utility for the defense.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(E).</p><p>                    Rule 16\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9ctangible objects\xe2\x80\x9d has been interpreted to include any physical evidence.  See 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa720.3(g), pp. 405\xe2\x80\x93406, and n.\xc2\xa0120 (3d ed. 2007).  Rule 16 is a discovery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the prosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material to the charges at issue.  In that context, a comprehensive construction of \xe2\x80\x9ctangible objects\xe2\x80\x9d is fitting.  In contrast, \xc2\xa71519 is a penal provision that refers to \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d not in relation to a request for information relevant to a specific court proceeding, but rather in relation to federal investigations or proceedings of every kind, including those not yet begun.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  See <i>Commissioner </i>v. <i>National Carbide Corp.</i>, 167 F.\xc2\xa02d 304, 306 (CA2 1948) (Hand, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cwords are chameleons, which reflect the color of their environment\xe2\x80\x9d).<i> </i>Just as the context of Rule 16 supports giving \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d a meaning as broad as its dictionary definition, the context of \xc2\xa71519 tugs strongly in favor of a narrower reading.</p><p>B</p><p>                    Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the words \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d as they appear in \xc2\xa71519.</p><p>                    We note first \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s caption: \xe2\x80\x9cDestruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d  That heading conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records.  Neither does the title of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which \xc2\xa71519 was placed, \xc2\xa7802: \xe2\x80\x9cCriminal penalties for altering documents.\xe2\x80\x9d116Stat.800.  Furthermore, \xc2\xa71520, the only other provision passed as part of \xc2\xa7802, is titled \xe2\x80\x9cDestruction of corporate audit records\xe2\x80\x9d and addresses only that specific subset of records and documents.  While these headings are not commanding, they supply cues that Congress did not intend \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519 to sweep within its reach physical objects of every kind, including things no one would describe as records, documents, or devices closely associated with them.  See<i>Almendarez-Torres</i> v. <i>United States</i>,523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224,234 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he title of a statute and the heading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  If Congress indeed meant to make \xc2\xa71519 an all-encompassing ban on the spoliation of evidence, as the dissent believes Congress did, one would have expected a clearer indication of that intent.</p><p>                    Section 1519\xe2\x80\x99s position within Chapter 73 of Title 18 further signals that \xc2\xa71519 was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the destruction of physical evidence of every kind.  Congress placed \xc2\xa71519 (and its companion provision \xc2\xa71520) at the end of the chapter, following immediately after the pre-existing \xc2\xa71516, \xc2\xa71517, and \xc2\xa71518, each of them prohibiting obstructive acts in specific contexts.  See \xc2\xa71516 (audits of recipients of federal funds); \xc2\xa71517 (federal examinations of financial institutions); \xc2\xa71518 (criminal investigations of federal health care offenses).  See also S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 107\xe2\x80\x93146, at\xc2\xa07 (observing that \xc2\xa71517 and \xc2\xa71518 \xe2\x80\x9capply to obstruction in certain limited types of cases, such as bankruptcy fraud, examinations of financial institutions, and healthcare fraud\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    But Congress did not direct codification of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\xe2\x80\x99s other additions to Chapter 73 adjacent to these specialized provisions.  Instead, Congress directed placement of those additions within or alongside retained provisions that address obstructive acts relating broadly to official proceedings and criminal trials:  Section 806, \xe2\x80\x9cCivil Action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases,\xe2\x80\x9d was codified as \xc2\xa71514A and inserted between the pre-existing \xc2\xa71514, which addresses civil actions to restrain harassment of victims and witnesses in criminal cases, and \xc2\xa71515, which defines terms used in \xc2\xa71512 and \xc2\xa71513.  Section 1102, \xe2\x80\x9cTampering with a record or otherwise impeding an official proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d was codified as \xc2\xa71512(c) and inserted within the pre-existing \xc2\xa71512, which addresses tampering with a victim, witness, or informant to impede any official proceeding.  Section 1107, \xe2\x80\x9cRetaliation against informants,\xe2\x80\x9d was codified as \xc2\xa71513(e) and inserted within the pre-existing \xc2\xa71513, which addresses retaliation against a victim, witness, or informant in any official proceeding.  Congress thus ranked \xc2\xa71519, not among the broad proscriptions, but together with specialized provisions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits.  This placement accords with the view that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 conception of \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s coverage was considerably more limited than the Government\xe2\x80\x99s.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p><p>                    The contemporaneous passage of \xc2\xa71512(c)(1), which was contained in a section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act discrete from the section embracing \xc2\xa71519 and \xc2\xa71520, is also instructive.

See 148 Cong. Rec. 12518, 13088\xe2\x80\x9313089 (2002).  The Government argues, and Yates does not dispute, that \xc2\xa71512(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cother object\xe2\x80\x9d includes any and every physical object.  But if \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d already included all physical objects, as the Government and the dissent contend, then Congress had no reason to enact \xc2\xa71512(c)(1): Virtually any act that would violate \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) no doubt would violate \xc2\xa71519 as well, for \xc2\xa71519 applies to \xe2\x80\x9cthe investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States . . . or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter,\xe2\x80\x9d not just to \xe2\x80\x9can official proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>                    The Government acknowledges that, under its reading, \xc2\xa71519 and \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly overlap.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 49.  Nowhere does the Government explain what independent function \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) would serve if the Government is right about the sweeping scope of \xc2\xa71519.  We resist a reading of \xc2\xa71519 that would render superfluous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  See <i>Marx</i> v. <i>General Revenue Corp.</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he canon against surplusage is strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    The words immediately surrounding \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfalsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94also cabin the contextual meaning of that term.  As explained in <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.</i>,513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561,575 (1995), we rely on the principle of <i>noscitur a sociis\xe2\x80\x94</i>a word is known by the company it keeps\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9cavoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Williams</i>,553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 285,294 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9ca word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated\xe2\x80\x9d).  In <i>Gustafson</i>, we interpreted the word \xe2\x80\x9ccommunication\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 to refer to a public communication, rather than any communication, because the word appeared in a list with other words, notably \xe2\x80\x9cnotice, circular, [and] advertisement,\xe2\x80\x9d making it \xe2\x80\x9capparent that the list refer[red] to documents of wide dissemination.\xe2\x80\x9d  513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 575\xe2\x80\x93576.  And we did so even though the list began with the word \xe2\x80\x9cany.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>                    The <i>noscitur a sociis</i> canon operates in a similar manner here.  \xe2\x80\x9cTangible object\xe2\x80\x9d is the last in a list of terms that begins \xe2\x80\x9cany record [or] document.\xe2\x80\x9d  The term is therefore appropriately read to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the subset of tangible objects involving records and documents, <i>i.e., </i>objects used to record or preserve information.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72J1.2, comment., n.\xc2\xa01 (Nov. 2014) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Records, documents, or tangible objects\xe2\x80\x99 includes (A) records, documents, or tangible objects that are stored on, or that are, magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic, or other storage mediums or devices; and (B) wire or electronic communications.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    This moderate interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d accords with the list of actions \xc2\xa71519 proscribes.  The section applies to anyone who \xe2\x80\x9calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, <i>falsifies</i>, or <i>makes a false entry in</i> any record, document, or tangible object\xe2\x80\x9d with the requisite obstructive intent.  (Emphasis added.)  The last two verbs, \xe2\x80\x9cfalsif[y]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] a false entry in,\xe2\x80\x9d typically take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 720 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cfalsify\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o make deceptive; to counterfeit, forge, or misrepresent; esp., to tamper with (a document, record, etc.)\xe2\x80\x9d).  It would be unnatural, for example, to describe a killer\xe2\x80\x99s act of wiping his fingerprints from a gun as \xe2\x80\x9cfalsifying\xe2\x80\x9d the murder weapon.  But it would not be strange to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cfalsifying\xe2\x80\x9d data stored on a hard drive as simply \xe2\x80\x9cfalsifying\xe2\x80\x9d a hard drive.  Furthermore, Congress did not include on \xc2\xa71512(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s list of prohibited actions \xe2\x80\x9cfalsifies\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmakes a false entry in.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) (making it unlawful to \xe2\x80\x9calte[r], destro[y], mutilat[e], or concea[l] a record, document, or other object\xe2\x80\x9d with the requisite obstructive intent).  That contemporaneous omission also suggests that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519 to have a narrower scope than \xe2\x80\x9cother object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71512(c)(1).[<a href="#F7">7</a>]</p><p>                    A canon related to <i>noscitur a sociis</i>, <i>ejusdem generis</i>, counsels: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are [usually] construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</i> v. <i>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler</i>,537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371,384 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In<i> Begay</i> v. <i>United States</i>,553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137\xe2\x80\x93143 (2008), for example, we relied on this principle to determine what crimes were covered by the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany crime .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\xe2\x80\x9d18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  The enumeration of specific crimes, we explained, indicates that the \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involves\xe2\x80\x9d provision covers \xe2\x80\x9conly <i>similar </i>crimes, rather than <i>every </i>crime that \xe2\x80\x98presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 142.  Had Congress intended the latter \xe2\x80\x9call encompassing\xe2\x80\x9d meaning, we observed, \xe2\x80\x9cit is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  See also <i>CSX Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Alabama Dept. of Revenue</i>,562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 277, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe typically use <i>ejusdem generis </i>to ensure that a general word will not render specific words meaningless.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Just so here.  Had Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519 to be interpreted so generically as to capture physical objects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress would have had no reason to refer specifically to \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdocument.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s unbounded reading of \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d would render those words misleading surplusage.</p><p>                    Having used traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and \xc2\xa71519 itself, we are persuaded that an aggressive interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d must be rejected.  It is highly improbable that Congress would have buried a general spoliation statute covering objects of any and every kind in a provision targeting fraud in financial record-keeping.</p><p>                    The Government argues, however, that our inquiry would be incomplete if we failed to consider the origins of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9crecord, document, or tangible object.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress drew that phrase, the Government says, from a 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) provision, and reform proposals based on that provision.  The MPC provision and proposals prompted by it would have imposed liability on anyone who \xe2\x80\x9calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, or removes a record, document or thing.\xe2\x80\x9d See ALI, MPC \xc2\xa7241.7(1), p. 175 (1962).  Those proscriptions were understood to refer to all physical evidence.  See MPC \xc2\xa7241.7, Comment 3, at 179 (1980) (provision \xe2\x80\x9capplies to any physical object\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, the Government reasons, and the dissent exuberantly agrees, <i>post</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, Congress must have intended \xc2\xa71519 to apply to the universe of physical evidence.</p><p>                    The inference is unwarranted.  True, the 1962 MPC provision prohibited tampering with any kind of physical evidence.  But unlike \xc2\xa71519, the MPC provision did not prohibit actions that specifically relate to records, documents, and objects used to record or preserve information.  The MPC provision also ranked the offense as a misdemeanor and limited liability to instances in which the actor \xe2\x80\x9cbeliev[es] that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted.\xe2\x80\x9d  MPC \xc2\xa7241.7(1), at 175.  Yates would have had scant reason to anticipate a felony prosecution, and certainly not one instituted at a time when even the smallest of the fish he caught came within the legal limit.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4; cf. <i>Bond</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014), (slip op., at 14) (rejecting \xe2\x80\x9cboundless reading\xe2\x80\x9d of a statutory term given \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply serious consequences\xe2\x80\x9d that reading would entail).  A proposed federal offense in line with the MPC provision, advanced by a federal commission in 1971, was similarly qualified.  See Final Report of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws \xc2\xa71323, pp. 116\xe2\x80\x93117 (1971).</p><p>                    Section 1519 conspicuously lacks the limits built into the MPC provision and the federal proposal.  It describes not a misdemeanor, but a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.  And the section covers conduct intended to impede any federal investigation or proceeding, including one not even on the verge of commencement.  Given these significant differences, the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9crecord, document, or thing\xe2\x80\x9d in the MPC provision and a kindred proposal is not a reliable indicator of the meaning Congress assigned to \xe2\x80\x9crecord, document, or tangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519.  The MPC provision, in short, tells us neither \xe2\x80\x9cwhat Congress wrote [nor] what Congress wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d cf. <i>post</i>, at 15, concerning Yates\xe2\x80\x99s small fish as the subject of a federal felony prosecution.</p><p>C</p><p>                    Finally, if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction leaves any doubt about the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in \xc2\xa71519, we would invoke the rule that \xe2\x80\x9cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cleveland</i> v. <i>United States</i>,531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 12,25 (2000) (quoting <i>Rewis</i> v. <i>United States</i>,401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 808,812 (1971)).  That interpretative principle is relevant here, where the Government urges a reading of \xc2\xa71519 that exposes individuals to 20-year prison sentences for tampering with <i>any</i> physical object that <i>might</i> have evidentiary value in <i>any</i> federal investigation into <i>any</i> offense, no matter whether the investigation is pending or merely contemplated, or whether the offense subject to investigation is criminal or civil.  See <i>Liparota</i> v. <i>United States</i>,471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 419,427 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9cApplication of the rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate balance between the legislature, the prosecutor, and the court in defining criminal liability.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In determining the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519, \xe2\x80\x9cit is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Cleveland</i>, 531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25 (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Universal C.

And though the question is close, traditional tools of statutory construction confirm that John Yates has the better of the argument.  Three features of18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71519 stand out to me: the statute\xe2\x80\x99s list of nouns, its list of verbs, and its title.  Although perhaps none of these features by itself would tip the case in favor of Yates, the three combined do so.</p><p>                    Start with the nouns.  Section 1519 refers to \xe2\x80\x9cany record, document, or tangible object.\xe2\x80\x9d  The <i>noscitur a sociis</i> canon instructs that when a statute contains a list, each word in that list presumptively has a \xe2\x80\x9csimilar\xe2\x80\x9d meaning.  See, <i>e.g., Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.</i>,513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561,576 (1995).  A related canon, <i>ejusdem generis </i> teaches that general words following a list of specific words should usually be read in light of those specific words to mean something \xe2\x80\x9csimilar.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g., Christopher</i> v. <i>SmithKline Beecham Corp.</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___  (2012) (slip op., at 18).  Applying these canons to \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s list of nouns, the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d should refer to something similar to records or documents.  A fish does not spring to mind\xe2\x80\x94nor does an antelope, a colonial farmhouse, a hydrofoil, or an oil derrick.  All are \xe2\x80\x9cobjects\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9ctangible.\xe2\x80\x9d  But who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise an eyebrow if a neighbor, when asked to identify something similar to a \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdocument,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9ccrocodile\xe2\x80\x9d?</p><p>                    This reading, of course, has its shortcomings.  For instance, this is an imperfect <i>ejusdem generis</i> case because \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdocument\xe2\x80\x9d are themselves quite general.  And there is a risk that \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d may be made superfluous\xe2\x80\x94what is similar to a \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdocument\xe2\x80\x9d but yet is not one?  An e-mail, however, could be such a thing.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72J1.2 and comment. (Nov. 2003) (reading \xe2\x80\x9crecords, documents, or tangible objects\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[e]\xe2\x80\x9d what is found on \xe2\x80\x9cmagnetic, optical, digital, other electronic,or other storage mediums or devices\xe2\x80\x9d).  An e-mail, afterall, might not be a \xe2\x80\x9cdocument\xe2\x80\x9d if, as was \xe2\x80\x9ctraditionally\xe2\x80\x9d so, a document was a \xe2\x80\x9cpiece of paper with information on it,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cinformation stored on a computer, electronic storage device, or any other medium.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 587\xe2\x80\x93588 (10th ed. 2014).  E-mails might also not be \xe2\x80\x9crecords\xe2\x80\x9d if records are limited to \xe2\x80\x9cminutes\xe2\x80\x9d or other formal writings \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to memorialize [past] events.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1465.  A hard drive, however, is tangible and can contain files that are precisely akin to even these narrow definitions.  Both \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdocument\xe2\x80\x9d can be read more expansively, but adding \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa71519 would ensure beyond question that electronic files are included.  To be sure, \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d presumably can capture more than just e-mails; Congress enacts \xe2\x80\x9ccatchall[s]\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cknown unknowns.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Republic of Iraq</i> v. <i>Beaty</i>,556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 848,860 (2009).  But where <i>noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis</i> apply, \xe2\x80\x9cknown unknowns\xe2\x80\x9d should be similar to known knowns, <i>i.e., </i>here, records and documents.  This is especially true because reading \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d too broadly could render \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdocument\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.</p><p>                    Next, consider \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s list of verbs: \xe2\x80\x9calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although many of those verbs could apply to nouns as far-flung as salamanders, satellites, or sand dunes, the last phrase in the list\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmakes a false entry in\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94makes no sense outside of filekeeping.  How does one make a false entry in a fish?  \xe2\x80\x9cAlters\xe2\x80\x9d and especially \xe2\x80\x9cfalsifies\xe2\x80\x9d are also closely associated with filekeeping.  Not one of the verbs, moreover, <i>cannot</i> be applied to filekeeping\xe2\x80\x94certainly not in the way that \xe2\x80\x9cmakes a false entry in\xe2\x80\x9d is always inconsistent with the aquatic.</p><p>                    Again, the Government is not without a response.  One can imagine Congress trying to write a law so broadly that not every verb lines up with every noun.  But failure to \xe2\x80\x9cline up\xe2\x80\x9d may suggest that something has gone awry in one\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of a text.  Where, as here, each of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s verbs applies to a certain category of nouns, there is some reason to think that Congress had that category in mind.  Categories, of course, are often underinclusive or overinclusive\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa71519, for instance, applies to a bomb-threatening letter but not a bomb.  But this does not mean that categories are not useful or that Congress does not enact them.  See, <i>e.g., Vance</i> v. <i>Bradley</i>,440 U.\xc2\xa0S. 93\xe2\x80\x93109 (1979).  Here, focusing on the verbs, the category of nouns appears to be filekeeping.  This observation is not dispositive, but neither is it nothing.  The Government also contends that \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s verbs cut both ways because it is unnatural to apply \xe2\x80\x9cfalsifies\xe2\x80\x9d to tangible objects, and that is certainly true.  One does not falsify the outside casing of a hard drive, but one could falsify or alter data physically recorded on that hard drive.</p><p>                    Finally, my analysis is influenced by \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s title: \xe2\x80\x9cDestruction, alteration, or falsification of <i>records</i> in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  This too points toward filekeeping, not fish.  Titles can be useful devices to resolve \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98doubt about the meaning of a statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Porter</i> v. <i>Nussle</i>,534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 516\xe2\x80\x93528 (2002) (quoting <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> v. <i>United States</i>,523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224,234 (1998)); see also <i>Lawson</i> v. <i>FMR LLC</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2014) (Sotomayor,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x936).  The title is especially valuable here because it reinforces what the text\xe2\x80\x99s nouns and verbs independently suggest\xe2\x80\x94that no matter how other statutes might be read, this particular one does not cover every noun in the universe with tangible form.</p><p>                    Titles, of course, are also not dispositive.  Here, if the list of nouns did not already suggest that \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d should mean something similar to records or documents, especially when read in conjunction with \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar list of verbs with their focus on filekeeping, then the title would not be enough on its own.  In conjunction with those other two textual features, however, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, though colorable, becomes too implausible to accept.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</i> v. <i>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler</i>,537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371\xe2\x80\x93385 (2003) (focusing on the \xe2\x80\x9cproduct of [two] canons of construction\xe2\x80\x9d which was \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed\xe2\x80\x9d by other interpretative evidence); cf. <i>Al-Adahi</i> v. <i>Obama</i>, 613 F.\xc2\xa03d 1102, 1105\xe2\x80\x931106 (CADC 2010) (aggregating evidence).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3243031">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p><p>_________________________</p><p>No. 13\xe2\x80\x937451</p><p>_________________________</p><p>JOHN L.

S. C. \xc2\xa71519, prohibits tampering with \xe2\x80\x9cany record, document, or tangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in an attempt to obstruct a federal investigation.  This case raises the question whether the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d means the same thing in \xc2\xa71519 as it means in everyday language\xe2\x80\x94any object capable of being touched.  The answer should be easy: Yes.  The term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d is broad, but clear.  Throughout the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code and many States\xe2\x80\x99 laws, it invariably covers physical objects of all kinds.  And in \xc2\xa71519, context confirms what bare text says: All the words surrounding \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d show that Congress meant the term to have a wide range.  That fits with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s evident purpose in enacting \xc2\xa71519: to punish those who alter or destroy physical evidence\xe2\x80\x94<i>any </i>physical evidence\xe2\x80\x94with the intent of thwarting federal law enforcement.</p><p>                    The plurality instead interprets \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d to cover \xe2\x80\x9conly objects one can use to record or preserve information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 7.  The concurring opinion similarly, if more vaguely, contends that \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d should refer to \xe2\x80\x9csomething similar to records or documents\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t include colonial farmhouses, crocodiles, or fish.  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 1 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).  In my view, conventional tools of statutory construction all lead to a more conventional result: A \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d is an object that\xe2\x80\x99s tangible.  I would apply the statute that Congress enacted and affirm the judgment below.</p><p>I</p><p>                    While the plurality starts its analysis with \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s heading, see <i>ante</i>, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe note first \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s caption\xe2\x80\x9d),<i> </i>I would begin with \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s text.  When Congress has not supplied a definition, we generally give a statutory term its ordinary meaning.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Schindler Elevator Corp.</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Kirk</i>, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5).  As the plurality must acknowledge, the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9ca discrete thing that possesses physical form.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 7 (punctuation and citation omitted).  A fish is, of course, a discrete thing that possesses physical form.  See generally Dr. Seuss, One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960).  So the ordinary meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519, as noone here disputes, covers fish (including too-small red grouper).</p><p>                    That interpretation accords with endless uses of the term in statute and rule books as construed by courts.  Dozens of federal laws and rules of procedure (and hundreds of state enactments) include the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d or its first cousin \xe2\x80\x9ctangible thing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94some in association with documents, others not.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>7 U. S. C. \xc2\xa78302(2) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cany material or tangible object that could harbor a pest or disease\xe2\x80\x9d);15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa757b\xe2\x80\x931(c) (authorizing investigative demands for \xe2\x80\x9cdocumentary material or tangible things\xe2\x80\x9d);18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7668(a)(1)(D) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmuseum\xe2\x80\x9d as entity that owns \xe2\x80\x9ctangible objects that are exhibited to the public\xe2\x80\x9d);28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72507(b) (allowing discovery of \xe2\x80\x9crelevant facts, books, papers, documents or tangible things\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  To my knowledge, no court has ever read any such provision to exclude things that don\xe2\x80\x99t record or preserve data; rather, all courts have adhered to the statutory language\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary (<i>i.e.</i>,<i> </i>expansive) meaning.  For example, courts have understood the phrases \xe2\x80\x9ctangible objects\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctangible things\xe2\x80\x9d in the Federal Rules of Criminal and Civil Procedure to cover everything from guns to drugs to machinery to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. animals.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States </i>v. <i>Obiukwu</i>, 17 F.\xc2\xa03d 816, 819 (CA6 1994) (<i>per curiam</i>) (handgun); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Acarino</i>, 270 F. Supp. 526, 527\xe2\x80\x93528 (EDNY 1967) (heroin); <i>In re Newman</i>, 782 F. 2d 971, 972\xe2\x80\x93975 (CA Fed. 1986) (energy generation system); <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Reynolds Metals Corp.</i>, 297 F. 2d 49, 56\xe2\x80\x9357 (CA9 1961) (cattle).  No surprise, then, that\xe2\x80\x94until today\xe2\x80\x94courts have uniformly applied the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519 in the same way.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States</i> v. <i>McRae</i>, 702 F. 3d 806, 834\xe2\x80\x93838 (CA5 2012) (corpse); <i>United</i> <i>States</i> v. <i>Maury</i>, 695 F. 3d 227, 243\xe2\x80\x93244 (CA3 2012) (cement mixer).</p><p>                    That is not necessarily the end of the matter; I agree with the plurality (really, who does not?) that context matters in interpreting statutes.  We do not \xe2\x80\x9cconstrue the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tyler</i> v. <i>Cain</i>,533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 656,662 (2001).  Rather, we interpret particular words \xe2\x80\x9cin their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Michigan Dept. of Treasury</i>,489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 803,809 (1989).  And sometimes that means, as the plurality says, that the dictionary definition of a disputed term cannot control.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Bloate </i>v. <i>United States</i>,<i> </i>559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 196, n.\xc2\xa09 (2010).  But this is not such an occasion, for here the text and its context point the same way.  Stepping back from the words \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d provides only further evidence that Congress said what it meant and meant what it said.</p><p>                    Begin with the way the surrounding words in \xc2\xa71519 reinforce the breadth of the term at issue.  Section 1519 refers to \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d tangible object, thus indicating (in line with <i>that </i>word\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning) a tangible object \xe2\x80\x9cof whatever kind.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 97 (2002).  This Court has time and again recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d has \xe2\x80\x9can expansive meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d bringing within a statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach <i>all</i> types of the item (here, \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d) to which the law refers.  <i>Department of Housing and Urban Development</i> v. <i>Rucker</i>,535 U. S. 125,131 (2002); see, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Republic of Iraq</i> v. <i>Beaty</i>,556 U. S. 848,856 (2009); <i>Ali</i> v. <i>Federal Bureau of Prisons</i>,552 U. S. 214\xe2\x80\x93220 (2008).  And the adjacent laundry list of verbs in \xc2\xa71519 (\xe2\x80\x9calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry\xe2\x80\x9d) further shows that Congress wrote a statute with a wide scope.  Those words are supposed to ensure\xe2\x80\x94just as \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d is meant to\xe2\x80\x94that \xc2\xa71519 covers the whole world of evidence-tampering, in all its prodigious variety.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rodgers</i>,466 U. S. 475,480 (1984) (rejecting a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow, technical definition\xe2\x80\x9d of a statutory term when it \xe2\x80\x9cclashes strongly\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9csweeping\xe2\x80\x9d language in the same sentence).</p><p>                    Still more, \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d appears as part of a three-noun phrase (including also \xe2\x80\x9crecords\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdocuments\xe2\x80\x9d) common to evidence-tampering laws and always understood to embrace things of all kinds.  The Model Penal Code\xe2\x80\x99s evidence-tampering section, drafted more than 50 years ago, similarly prohibits a person from \xe2\x80\x9calter[ing], destroy[ing], conceal[ing] or remov[ing] any <i>record, document or thing</i>\xe2\x80\x9d in an effort to thwart an official investigation or proceeding.  ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7241.7(1),p. 175 (1962) (emphasis added).  The Code\xe2\x80\x99s commentary emphasizes that the offense described in that provision is \xe2\x80\x9cnot limited to conduct that [alters] a written instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, \xc2\xa7241.7, Comment 3, at 179.  Rather, the language extends to \xe2\x80\x9cany physical object.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Consistent with that statement\xe2\x80\x94and, of course, with ordinary meaning\xe2\x80\x94courts in the more than 15 States that have laws based on the Model Code\xe2\x80\x99s tampering provision apply them to all tangible objects, including drugs, guns, vehicles and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. yes, animals.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>State</i> v. <i>Majors</i>, 318 S. W. 3d 850, 859\xe2\x80\x93861 (Tenn. 2010) (cocaine); <i>Puckett</i> v. <i>State</i>, 328 Ark. 355, 357\xe2\x80\x93360, 944 S. W. 2d 111, 113\xe2\x80\x93114 (1997) (gun); <i>State</i> v. <i>Bruno</i>, 236 Conn. 514, 519\xe2\x80\x93520, 673 A. 2d 1117, 1122\xe2\x80\x931123 (1996) (bicycle, skeleton, blood stains); <i>State </i>v.<i> Crites</i>, 2007 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 615, *5\xe2\x80\x93*7 (Dec. 21, 2007) (deer antlers).  Not a one has limited the phrase\xe2\x80\x99s scope to objects that record or preserve information.</p><p>                    The words \xe2\x80\x9crecord, document, or tangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519 also track language in18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512, the federal witness-tampering law covering (as even the plurality accepts, see <i>ante</i>, at 12)<i> </i>physical evidence in all its forms.  Section 1512, both in its original version (preceding \xc2\xa71519) and today, repeatedly uses the phrase \xe2\x80\x9crecord, document, or other object\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94most notably, in a provision prohibiting the use of force or threat to induce another person to withhold any of those materials from an official proceeding.  \xc2\xa74(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982,96Stat.1249, as amended,18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512(b)(2).  That language, which itself likely derived from the Model Penal Code, encompasses no less the bloody knife than the incriminating letter, as all courts have for decades agreed.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kellington</i>, 217 F. 3d 1084, 1088 (CA9 2000) (boat); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Applewhaite</i>, 195 F. 3d 679, 688 (CA3 1999) (stone wall).  And typically \xe2\x80\x9conly the most compelling evidence\xe2\x80\x9d will persuade this Court that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cnearly identical language\xe2\x80\x9d in provisions dealing with related subjects to bear different meanings.  <i>Communication Workers </i>v. <i>Beck</i>,487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735,754 (1988); see A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 252 (2012).  Context thus again confirms what text indicates.</p><p>                    And legislative history, for those who care about it, puts extra icing on a cake already frosted.  Section 1519, as the plurality notes, see <i>ante</i>, at 2, 6, was enacted after the Enron Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s collapse, as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,116Stat.745.  But the provision began its life in a separate bill, and the drafters emphasized that Enron was \xe2\x80\x9conly a case study exposing the shortcomings in our current laws\xe2\x80\x9d relating to both \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate and criminal\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.  S. Rep. No. 107\xe2\x80\x93146, pp.\xc2\xa02, 11 (2002).  The primary \xe2\x80\x9cloophole[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d Congress identified, see <i>id.</i>, at 14, arose from limits in the part of \xc2\xa71512 just described: That provision, as uniformly construed, prohibited a person from inducing another to destroy \xe2\x80\x9crecord[s], document[s], or other object[s]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94of every type\xe2\x80\x94but not from doing so himself.  \xc2\xa71512(b)(2); see <i>supra</i>, at 5.  Congress (as even the plurality agrees, see <i>ante</i>, at 6) enacted \xc2\xa71519 to close that yawning gap.  But \xc2\xa71519 could fully achieve that goal only if it covered all the records, documents, and objects \xc2\xa71512 did, as well as all the means of tampering with them.  And so \xc2\xa71519 was written to do exactly that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto apply broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d as long as performed with the requisite intent.  S. Rep. No. 107\xe2\x80\x93146, at 14.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a person destroys evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d the drafters explained, \xe2\x80\x9coverly technical legal distinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 7.  Ah well: Congress, meet today\xe2\x80\x99s Court, which here invents just such a distinction with just such an effect.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Philadelphia Nat. Bank</i>,374 U.\xc2\xa0S. 321,343 (1963) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]reat[ing] a large loophole in a statute designed to close a loophole\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cillogical and disrespectful of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. congressional purpose\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    As Congress recognized in using a broad term, giving immunity to those who destroy non-documentary evidence has no sensible basis in penal policy.  A person who hides a murder victim\xe2\x80\x99s body is no less culpable than one who burns the victim\xe2\x80\x99s diary.  A fisherman, like John Yates, who dumps undersized fish to avoid a fine is no less blameworthy than one who shreds his vessel\xe2\x80\x99s catch logfor the same reason.  Congress thus treated both offenders in the same way.  It understood, in enacting \xc2\xa71519, that destroying evidence is destroying evidence, whether or not that evidence takes documentary form.</p><p>II</p><p>A</p><p>                    The plurality searches far and wide for anything\xe2\x80\x94<i>anything</i>\xe2\x80\x94to support its interpretation of \xc2\xa71519.  But its fishing expedition comes up empty.</p><p>                    The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s analysis starts with \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s title: \xe2\x80\x9cDestruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante</i>, at 10; see also <i>ante</i>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (opinion of Alito, J.).  That\xe2\x80\x99s already a sign something is amiss.  I know of no other case in which we have <i>begun</i> our interpretation of a statute with the title, or relied on a title to override the law\xe2\x80\x99s clear terms.  Instead, we have followed \xe2\x80\x9cthe wise rule that the title of a statute and the heading of a section cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Trainmen</i> v. <i>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.\xc2\xa0Co.</i>,331 U. S. 519\xe2\x80\x93529 (1947).</p><p>                    The reason for that \xe2\x80\x9cwise rule\xe2\x80\x9d is easy to see: A title is, almost necessarily, an abridgment.  Attempting to mention every term in a statute \xe2\x80\x9cwould often be ungainly as well as useless\xe2\x80\x9d; accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9cmatters in the text .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are frequently unreflected in the headings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 528.  Just last year, this Court observed that two titles in a nearby section of Sarbanes-Oxley serve as \xe2\x80\x9cbut a short-hand reference to the general subject matter\xe2\x80\x9d of the provision at issue, \xe2\x80\x9cnot meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lawson</i> v. <i>FMR LLC</i>, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 16) (quoting <i>Trainmen</i>, 331 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 528).  The \xe2\x80\x9cunder-inclusiveness\xe2\x80\x9d of the headings, we stated, was \xe2\x80\x9capparent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lawson</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at16).<i> </i>So too for \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s title, which refers to \xe2\x80\x9cdestruction, alteration, or falsification\xe2\x80\x9d but <i>not </i>to mutilation, concealment, or covering up, and likewise mentions \xe2\x80\x9crecords\xe2\x80\x9d but <i>not </i>other documents or objects.  Presumably, the plurality would not refuse to apply \xc2\xa71519 when a person only conceals evidence rather than destroying, altering, or falsifying it; instead, the plurality would say that a title is just a title, which cannot \xe2\x80\x9cundo or limit\xe2\x80\x9d more specific statutory text.  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Trainmen</i>, 331 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 529).  The same holds true when the evidence in question is not a \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d but something else whose destruction, alteration, etc., is intended to obstruct justice.</p><p>                    The plurality next tries to divine meaning from \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cposition within Chapter 73 of Title 18.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.  But that move is yet odder than the last.  As far as I can tell, this Court has never once suggested that the section number assigned to a law bears upon its meaning.  Cf. Scalia, <i>supra</i>, at xi\xe2\x80\x93xvi (listing more than 50 interpretive principles and canons without mentioning the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s new number-in-the-Code theory).  And even on its own terms, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s argument is hard to fathom.  The plurality claims that if \xc2\xa71519 applied to objects generally, Congress would not have placed it \xe2\x80\x9cafter the pre-existing \xc2\xa71516, \xc2\xa71517, and \xc2\xa71518\xe2\x80\x9d because those are \xe2\x80\x9cspecialized provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 11.<i> </i>But search me if I can find a better place for a broad ban on evidence-tampering.  The plural-ity seems to agree that the law properly goes in Chapter 73\xe2\x80\x94the criminal code\xe2\x80\x99s chapter on \xe2\x80\x9cobstruction of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the provision does not logically fit into any of that chapter\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing sections.  And with the first 18 numbers of the chapter already taken (starting with \xc2\xa71501 and continuing through \xc2\xa71518), the law naturally took the 19th place.  That is standard operating procedure.  Prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all of Chapter 73 was ordered chronologically: Section 1518 was later enacted than \xc2\xa71517, which was later enacted than \xc2\xa71516, which was .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. well, you get the idea.  And after Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress has continued in the same vein.  Section 1519 is thus right where you would expect it (as is the contemporaneously passed \xc2\xa71520)\xe2\x80\x94between \xc2\xa71518 (added in 1996) and \xc2\xa71521 (added in 2008).[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>                    The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s third argument, relying on the surplusage canon, at least invokes a known tool of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x94but it too comes to nothing.  Says the plurality: If read naturally, \xc2\xa71519 \xe2\x80\x9cwould render superfluous\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71512(c)(1), which Congress passed \xe2\x80\x9cas part of the same act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 13.  But that is not so: Although the two provisions significantly overlap, each applies to conduct the other does not.  The key difference between the two is that \xc2\xa71519 protects the integrity of \xe2\x80\x9cmatter[s] within the jurisdiction of any [federal] department or agency\xe2\x80\x9d whereas \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) safeguards \xe2\x80\x9cofficial proceeding[s]\xe2\x80\x9d as definedin \xc2\xa71515(a)(1)(A).  Section 1519\xe2\x80\x99s language often applies more broadly than \xc2\xa71512(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s, as the plurality notes.  For example, an FBI investigation counts as a matter within a federal department\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, but falls outside the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cofficial proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d as construed by courts.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Gabriel</i>, 125 F. 3d 89, 105, n. 13 (CA2 1997).  But conversely, \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) sometimes reaches more widely than \xc2\xa71519.  For example, because an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d includes any \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding before a judge or court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) prohibits tampering with evidence in federal litigation between private parties.  See \xc2\xa71515(a)(1)(A); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Burge</i>, 711 F.\xc2\xa03d 803, 808\xe2\x80\x93810 (CA7 2013); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Reich</i>, 479 F.\xc2\xa03d 179, 185\xe2\x80\x93187 (CA2 2007) (Sotomayor, J.).  By contrast, \xc2\xa71519 wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ordinarily operate in that context because a federal court isn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x9cdepartment or agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Hubbard</i> v. <i>United States</i>,514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 695,715 (1995).[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  So the surplusage canon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come into play.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  Overlap\xe2\x80\x94even significant overlap\xe2\x80\x94abounds in the criminal law.  See <i>Loughrin</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ \xe2\x80\x93 ___, n.\xc2\xa04 (2014) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937, n.\xc2\xa04).  This Court has never thought that of such ordinary stuff surplusage is made.  See <i>ibid.</i>;<i> Connecticut Nat. Bank</i> v. <i>Germain</i>,503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 249,253 (1992).</p><p>                    And the legislative history to which the plurality appeals, see <i>ante</i>, at 6,<i> </i>only cuts against it because those materials show that lawmakers knew that \xc2\xa71519 and \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) share much common ground.  Minority Leader Lott introduced the amendment that included \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) (along with other criminal and corporate fraud provisions) late in the legislative process, explaining that he did so at the specific request of the President.  See 148 Cong. Rec. 12509, 12512 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Lott).  Not only Lott but several other Senators noted the overlap between the President\xe2\x80\x99s package and provisions already in the bill, most notably \xc2\xa71519.  See <i>id.</i>, at 12512 (remarks of Sen. Lott); <i>id.</i>, at 12513 (remarks of Sen. Biden); <i>id.</i>, at 12517 (remarks of Sens. Hatch and Gramm).  The presence of both \xc2\xa71519 and \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) in the final Act may have reflected belt-and-suspenders caution: If \xc2\xa71519 contained some flaw, \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) would serve as a backstop.  Or the addition of \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) may have derived solely from legislators\xe2\x80\x99 wish \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy audiences other than courts\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, the President and his Justice Department.  Gluck &amp; Bressman, Statutory Interpretation from the Inside, 65 Stan. L. Rev. 901, 935 (2013) (emphasis deleted).  Whichever the case, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness of overlap between the two provisions removes any conceivable reason to cast aside \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning in service of preventing some statutory repetition.</p><p>                    Indeed, the inclusion of \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) in Sarbanes-Oxley creates a far worse problem for the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa71519 than for mine.  Section 1512(c)(1) criminalizes the destruction of any \xe2\x80\x9crecord, document, or other object\xe2\x80\x9d; \xc2\xa71519 of any \xe2\x80\x9crecord, document, or tangible object.\xe2\x80\x9d  On the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s view, one \xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d is really an object, whereas the other is only an object that preserves or stores information.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he normal rule of statutory construction assumes that identical words used in different parts of the same act,\xe2\x80\x9d passed at the same time, \xe2\x80\x9care intended to have the same meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sorenson</i> v. <i>Secretary of Treasury</i>,475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 851,860 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And that is especially true when the different provisions pertain to the same subject.  See <i>supra</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  The plurality doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94really, can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94explain why it instead interprets the same words used in two provisions of the same Act addressing the same basic problem to mean fundamentally different things.</p><p>                    Getting nowhere with surplusage, the plurality switches canons, hoping that <i>noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis </i>will save it.  See <i>ante</i>,<i> </i>at 13\xe2\x80\x9316; see also<i> ante</i>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (opinion of Alito, J.).<i> </i>The first of those related canons advises that words grouped in a list be given similar meanings.  The second counsels that a general term following specific words embraces only things of a similar kind.  According to the plurality, those Latin maxims change the English meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d to only things, like records and documents, \xe2\x80\x9cused to record or preserve information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]<i> </i>But understood as this Court always has, the canons have no such transformative effect on the workaday language Congress chose.</p><p>                    As an initial matter, this Court uses <i>noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis </i>to resolve ambiguity, not create it.  Those principles are \xe2\x80\x9cuseful rule[s] of construction where words are of obscure or doubtful meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Russell Motor Car Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,261 U. S. 514,520 (1923).  But when words have a clear definition, and all other contextual clues support that meaning, the canons cannot properly defeat Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to draft broad legislation.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Ali</i>, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227 (rejecting the invocation of these canons as an \xe2\x80\x9cattempt to create ambiguity where the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure suggest none\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    Anyway, assigning \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d its ordinary meaning comports with <i>noscitur a sociis </i>and <i>ejusdem generis </i>when applied, as they should be, with attention to \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s subject and purpose.  Those canons require identifying a common trait that links all the words in a statutory phrase.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist.</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Wilson</i>,559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280,289, n.7 (2010); <i>Ali</i>,<i> </i>552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 224\xe2\x80\x93226.  In responding to that demand, the plurality characterizes records and documents as things that preserve information\xe2\x80\x94and so they are.  But just as much, they are things that provide information, and thus potentially serve as evidence relevant to matters under review.  And in a statute pertaining to obstruction of federal investigations, that evidentiary function comes to the fore.  The destruction of records and documents prevents law enforcement agents from gathering facts relevant to official inquiries.  And so too does the destruction of tangible objects\xe2\x80\x94of whatever kind.  Whether the item is a fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s ledger or an undersized fish, throwing it overboard has the identical effect on the administration of justice.  See <i>supra</i>, at 7.  For purposes of \xc2\xa71519, records, documents, and (all) tangible objects are therefore alike.</p><p>                    Indeed, even the plurality can\xe2\x80\x99t fully credit its <i>noscitur</i>/<i>ejusdem </i>argument.  The same reasoning would apply to <i>every </i>law placing the word \xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cthing\xe2\x80\x9d) after \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdocument.\xe2\x80\x9d  But as noted earlier, such statutes are common: The phrase appears (among other places) in many state laws based on the Model Penal Code, as well as in multiple provisions of \xc2\xa71512.  See <i>supra</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The plurality accepts that in those laws \xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d means object; its argument about superfluity positively <i>depends</i> on giving \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) that broader reading. <b> </b>See <i>ante</i>,<i> </i>at 13, 16.  What, then, is the difference here?  The plurality proposes that some of those statutes describe less serious offenses than \xc2\xa71519.  See <i>ante</i>, at 17.  How and why that distinction affects application of the <i>noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis</i> canons is left obscure: Count it asone more of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s never-before-propounded,not-readily-explained interpretive theories.  See <i>supra</i>, at 7, 8\xe2\x80\x939, 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  But in any event, that rationale cannot support the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to give \xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d its natural meaning in \xc2\xa71512, which (like \xc2\xa71519) sets out felonies with penalties of up to 20 years.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71512(a)(3)(C), (b), (c).<b> </b>The canons, in the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive world, apparently switch on and off whenever convenient.</p><p>                    And the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s verbs does nothing to buttress its canon-based argument.  See <i>ante</i>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315;<i> ante</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (opinion of Alito, J.).  The plurality observes that \xc2\xa71519 prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cfalsif[ying]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] a false entry in\xe2\x80\x9d a tangible object, and no one can do those things to, say, a murder weapon (or a fish).  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.  But of course someone can alter, destroy, mutilate, conceal, or cover up such a tangible object, and \xc2\xa71519 prohibits those actions too.  The Court has never before suggested that all the verbs in a statute need to match up with all the nouns.  See <i>Robers </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he law does not require legislators to write extra language specifically exempting, phrase by phrase, applications in respect to which a portion of a phrase is not needed\xe2\x80\x9d).  And for good reason.  It is exactly when Congress sets out to draft a statute broadly\xe2\x80\x94to include every imaginable variation on a theme\xe2\x80\x94that such mismatches will arise.  To respond by narrowing the law, as the plurality does, is thus to flout both what Congress wrote and what Congress wanted.</p><p>                    Finally, when all else fails, the plurality invokes the rule of lenity.  See <i>ante</i>, at 18.  But even in its most robust form, that rule only kicks in when, \xe2\x80\x9cafter all legitimate tools of interpretation have been exhausted, \xe2\x80\x98a reasonable doubt persists\xe2\x80\x99 regarding whether Congress has made the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct a federal crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Abramski </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Scalia,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12) (quoting <i>Moskal</i> v. <i>United States</i>,498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103,108 (1990)).  No such doubt lingers here.  The plural-ity points to the breadth of \xc2\xa71519, see <i>ante</i>, at 18, as though breadth were equivalent to ambiguity.  It is not.  Section 1519 <i>is </i>very broad.  It is also very clear.  Every traditional tool of statutory interpretation points in the same direction, toward \xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d meaning object.  Lenity offers no proper refuge from that straightforward (even though capacious) construction.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]</p><p>B</p><p>                    The concurring opinion is a shorter, vaguer version of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s.  It relies primarily on the <i>noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis</i> canons, tries to bolster them with \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clist of verbs,\xe2\x80\x9d and concludes with the section\xe2\x80\x99s title.  See <i>supra</i>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, 12\xe2\x80\x9313, 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (addressing each of those arguments).  (Notably, even the concurrence puts no stock in the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s section-number and superfluity claims.)  From those familiar materials, the concurrence arrives at the following definition: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tangible object\xe2\x80\x99 should mean something similar to records or documents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 4 (opinion of Alito, J.).  In amplifying that purported guidance, the concurrence suggests applying the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d in keeping with what \xe2\x80\x9ca neighbor, when asked to identify something similar to record or document,\xe2\x80\x9d might answer.  <i>Ante</i>, at 1.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]ho wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise an eyebrow,\xe2\x80\x9d the concurrence wonders, if the neighbor said \xe2\x80\x9ccrocodile\xe2\x80\x9d?  <i>Ante</i>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  Courts sometimes say, when explaining the Latin maxims, that the \xe2\x80\x9cwords of a statute should be interpreted consistent with their neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d  See,<i> e.g.</i>, <i>United States </i>v.<i> Locke</i>,<i> </i>529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89,105 (2000).  The concurrence takes that expression literally.</p><p>                    But \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s meaning should not hinge on the odd game of Mad Libs the concurrence proposes.  No one reading \xc2\xa71519 needs to fill in a blank after the words \xe2\x80\x9crecords\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdocuments.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is because Congress, quite helpfully, already did so\xe2\x80\x94adding the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object.\xe2\x80\x9d  The issue in this case is what that term means.  So if the concurrence wishes to ask its neighbor a question, I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend a more pertinent one: Do you think a fish (or, if the concurrence prefers, a crocodile) is a \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d?  As to that query, \xe2\x80\x9cwho wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise an eyebrow\xe2\x80\x9d if the neighbor said \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d? </p><p>                    In insisting on its different question, the concurrence neglects the proper function of catchall phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cor tangible object.\xe2\x80\x9d  The reason Congress uses such terms is precisely to reach things that, in the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cdo[\xc2\xa0] not spring to mind\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to my mind, to my neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s, or (most important) to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s.  <i>Ante</i>, at 1 (opinion of Alito, J.).  As this Court recently explained: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he whole value of a generally phrased residual [term] is that it serves as a catchall for matters not specifically contemplated\xe2\x80\x94known unknowns.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Beaty</i>, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 860.  Congress realizes that in a game of free association with \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdocument,\xe2\x80\x9d it will never think of all the other things\xe2\x80\x94including crocodiles and fish\xe2\x80\x94whose destruction or alteration can (less frequently but just as effectively) thwart law enforcement.  Cf. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Stubbs</i>, 11 F.\xc2\xa03d 632, 637\xe2\x80\x93638 (CA6 1993) (dead crocodiles used as evidence to support smuggling conviction).<i> </i>And so Congress adds the general term \xe2\x80\x9cor tangible object\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94again, exactly because such things \xe2\x80\x9cdo[\xc2\xa0] not spring to mind.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7">7</a>]</p><p><i> </i>The concurrence suggests that the term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d serves not as a catchall for physical evidence but to \xe2\x80\x9censure beyond question\xe2\x80\x9d that e-mails and other electronic files fall within \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  <i>Ante</i>, at 2.  But that claim is eyebrow-raising in its own right.  Would a Congress wishing to make certain that \xc2\xa71519 applies toe-mails add the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d (as opposed, say, to \xe2\x80\x9celectronic communications\xe2\x80\x9d)?  Would a judge or jury member predictably find that \xe2\x80\x9ctangible object\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses something as virtual as e-mail (as compared, say, with something as real as a fish)?  If not (and the answer is not), then that term cannot function as a failsafe fore-mails.</p><p>                    The concurrence acknowledges that no one of its arguments can carry the day; rather, it takes the Latin canons plus \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s verbs plus \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s title to \xe2\x80\x9ctip the case\xe2\x80\x9d for Yates.  <i>Ante</i>, at 1.  But the sum total of three mistaken arguments is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. three mistaken arguments.  They do not get better in the combining.  And so the concurrence ends up right where the plurality does, except that the concurrence, eschewing the rule of lenity, has nothing to fallback on.</p><p>III</p><p>                    If none of the traditional tools of statutory interpretation can produce today\xe2\x80\x99s result, then what accounts for it?  The plurality offers a clue when it emphasizes the disproportionate penalties \xc2\xa71519 imposes if the law is read broadly.  See<i> ante</i>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  Section 1519, the plurality objects, would then \xe2\x80\x9cexpose[\xc2\xa0] individuals to 20-year prison sentences for tampering with <i>any </i>physical object that <i>might </i>have evidentiary value in <i>any</i> federal investigation into <i>any </i>offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 18.  That brings to the surface the real issue: overcriminalization and excessive punishment in the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code.</p><p>                    Now as to this statute, I think the plurality somewhat\xe2\x80\x94though only somewhat\xe2\x80\x94exaggerates the matter.  The plurality omits from its description of \xc2\xa71519 the requirement that a person act \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d and with \xe2\x80\x9cthe intent to impede, obstruct, or influence\xe2\x80\x9d federal law enforcement.  And in highlighting \xc2\xa71519\xe2\x80\x99s maximum penalty, the plurality glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum.  (Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that Yates\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was not 20 years, but 30 days.)  Congress presumably enacts laws with high maximums and no minimums when it thinks the prohibited conduct may run the gamut from major to minor.  Thatis assuredly true of acts obstructing justice.  Compare this case with the following, all of which properly come within, but now fall outside, \xc2\xa71519: <i>McRae</i>, 702 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 834\xe2\x80\x93838 (burning human body to thwart murder investigation); <i>Maury</i>, 695 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 243\xe2\x80\x93244 (altering cement mixer to impede inquiry into amputation of employee\xe2\x80\x99s fingers); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Natal</i>, 2014 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 108852, *24\xe2\x80\x93*26 (D Conn., Aug. 7, 2014) (repainting van to cover up evidence of fatal arson).  Most district judges, as Congress knows, will recognize differences between such cases and prosecutions like this one, and will try to make the punishment fit the crime.  Still and all, I tend to think, for the reasons the plurality gives, that \xc2\xa71519 is a bad law\xe2\x80\x94too broad and undifferentiated, with too-high maximum penalties, which give prosecutors too much leverage and sentencers too much discretion.

It cannot take issue with <i>Hubbard</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that \xe2\x80\x9ca federal court is neither a \xe2\x80\x98department\xe2\x80\x99 nor an \xe2\x80\x98agency\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in a statute referring, just as \xc2\xa71519 does, to \xe2\x80\x9cany matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 698, 715.  So the plurality suggests that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin relation to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any such matter\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71519 somehow changes <i>Hubbard</i>\xe2\x80\x99s result.

That is why the federal government, as far asI can tell, has never once brought a prosecution under \xc2\xa71519 forevidence-tampering in litigation between private parties.  It instead uses \xc2\xa71512(c)(1) for that purpose.</span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"><span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T4">4</a></span><span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Section 1512(c)(1) also applies more broadly than \xc2\xa71519 in proceedings relating to insurance regulation.
