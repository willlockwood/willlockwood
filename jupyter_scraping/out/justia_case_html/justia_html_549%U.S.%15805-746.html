FELA reduces any damages awarded to an employee \xe2\x80\x9cin proportion to the amount [of negligence] attributable to\xe2\x80\x9d the employee, Section 3.  Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s jury instructions apply different causation standards to railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence in FELA actions.  An employee will be found contributorily negligent if his negligence \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly contributed to cause\xe2\x80\x9d the injury, while railroad negligence is measured by whether the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence \xe2\x80\x9ccontributed in whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d to the injury.  After the trial court overruled Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s objection that the instruction on contributory negligence contained a different standard than the railroad negligence instruction, the jury awarded Sorrell $1.5 million.  The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the same causation standard should apply to both parties\xe2\x80\x99 negligence.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to expand the question presented to encompass what</em> the FELA causation standard should be, not simply whether the standard should be the same for railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence, is rejected.  This Court is typically reluctant to permit parties to smuggle additional questions into a case after the grant of certiorari.  Although the Court could consider the question of what standard applies as anterior to the question whether the standards may differ, the substantive content of the causation standard is a significant enough issue that the Court prefers not to address it when it has not been fully presented.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The same causation standard applies to railroad negligence under FELA Section 1 as to employee contributory negligence under Section 3.  Absent express language to the contrary, the elements of a FELA claim are determined by reference to the common law, <em>Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/163/index.html">337 U. S. 163</a>, 182, and unless common-law principles are expressly rejected in FELA\xe2\x80\x99s text, they are entitled to great weight, <em>Consolidated Rail Corporation</em> v. <em>Gottshall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/532/index.html">512 U. S. 532</a>, 544.  The prevailing common-law view at the time FELA was enacted was that the causation standards for negligence and contributory negligence were the same, and FELA did not expressly depart from this approach.  This is strong evidence against Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s practice of applying different standards, which is apparently unique among the States.  Departing from the common-law practice would in any event have been a peculiar approach for Congress to take in FELA: As a practical matter, it is difficult to reduce damages \xe2\x80\x9cin proportion\xe2\x80\x9d to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s negligence if the relevance of each party\xe2\x80\x99s negligence is measured by a different causation standard.  The Court thinks it far simpler for a jury to conduct the apportionment FELA mandates if the jury compares like with like.  Contrary to Sorrell\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the use of the language \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to railroad negligence in FELA Section 1, but not with respect to employee contributory negligence in Section 3, does not justify a departure from the common-law practice of applying a single causation standard.  It would have made little sense to include the \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d language in Section 3; if the employee\xe2\x80\x99s contributory negligence contributed \xe2\x80\x9cin whole\xe2\x80\x9d to his injury, there would be no recovery against the railroad in the first place.  The language made sense in Section 1, however, to clarify that there could be recovery against the railroad even if it were only partially responsible for the injury.  In any event, there is no reason to read the statute as a whole to encompass different causation standards, since Section 3 simply does not address causation.  Finally, FELA\xe2\x80\x99s remedial purpose cannot compensate for the lack of statutory text:\xc2\xa0FELA does not abrogate the common-law approach.  A review of FELA model instructions indicates that there are a variety of ways to instruct a jury to apply the same causation standard to railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence.  Missouri has the same flexibility as other jurisdictions in deciding how to do so, so long as it now joins them in applying a single standard.  On remand, the Missouri Court of Appeals should address Sorrell\xe2\x80\x99s argument that any error in the jury instructions was harmless, and should determine whether a new trial is required.

He filed suit in Missouri state court under the Federal Employers\xe2\x80\x99 Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa751\xe2\x80\x9360, which makes railroads liable to their employees for injuries \xe2\x80\x9cresulting in whole or in part from the negligence\xe2\x80\x9d of the railroad, \xc2\xa751.  Contributory negligence is not a bar to recovery under FELA, but damages are reduced \xe2\x80\x9cin proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to\xe2\x80\x9d the employee, \xc2\xa753.  Sorrell was awarded $1.5 million in damages by a jury; Norfolk objects that the jury instructions reflected a more lenient causation standard for railroad negligence than for employee contributory negligence.  We conclude that the causation standard under FELA should be the same for both categories of negligence, and accordingly vacate the decision below and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 1, 1999, while working for Norfolk in Indiana, Sorrell was driving a dump truck loaded with asphalt to be used to repair railroad crossings.  While he was driving between crossings on a gravel road alongside the tracks, another Norfolk truck approached, driven by fellow employee Keith Woodin.  The two men provided very different accounts of what happened next, but somehow Sorrell\xe2\x80\x99s truck veered off the road and tipped on its side, injuring him.  According to Sorrell\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, Woodin forced Sorrell\xe2\x80\x99s truck off the road; according to Woodin, Sorrell drove his truck into a ditch.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On June 18, 2002, Sorrell filed suit against Norfolk in Missouri state court under FELA, alleging that Norfolk failed to provide him with a reasonably safe place to work and that its negligence caused his injuries.  Norfolk responded that Sorrell\xe2\x80\x99s own negligence caused the accident.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Missouri purports to apply different standards of causation to railroad and employee contributory negligence in its approved jury instructions for FELA liability.  The instructions direct a jury to find an employee contributorily negligent if the employee was negligent and his negligence \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly contributed to cause\xe2\x80\x9d the injury, Mo.

After the jury returned a verdict in favor of Sorrell, Norfolk moved for a new trial, repeating its contention that the different standards were improper because FELA\xe2\x80\x99s comparative fault system requires that the same causation standard apply to both categories of negligence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 20.  The trial court denied the motion.  The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s contention that \xe2\x80\x9cthe causation standard should be the same as to the plaintiff and the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a, judgt. order reported at 170 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 35 (2005) <em>(per curiam)</em>.

Proc. 70.02(b) (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the Missouri Supreme Court denied discretionary review, App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a, Norfolk sought certiorari in this Court, asking whether the Missouri courts erred in determining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe causation standard for employee <em>contributory negligence</em> under [FELA] differs from the causation standard for railroad <em>negligence</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  Norfolk stated that Missouri was the only jurisdiction to apply different standards, and that this conflicted with several federal court of appeals decisions insisting on a single standard of causation for both railroad and employee negligence.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Page</em> v. <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis Southwestern R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 349 F.\xc2\xa02d 820, 823 (CA5 1965) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he better rule is one of a single standard\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Ganotis</em> v. <em>New York Central R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 342 F.\xc2\xa02d 767, 768\xe2\x80\x93769 (CA6 1965) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not believe that [FELA] intended to make a distinction between proximate cause when considered in connection with the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s negligence and proximate cause when considered in connection with the employee\xe2\x80\x99s contributory negligence\xe2\x80\x9d).  In response, Sorrell did not dispute that Missouri courts apply \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent causation standards \xe2\x80\xa6 to plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s and defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence in FELA actions: The defendant is subject to a more relaxed causation standard, but the plaintiff is subject only to the traditional common-law standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief in Opposition 2.  We granted certiorari.  547 U. S. __ (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In briefing and argument before this Court, Norfolk has attempted to expand the question presented to encompass <em>what</em> the standard of causation under FELA should be, not simply whether the standard should be the same for railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence.  In particular, Norfolk contends that the proximate cause standard reflected in the Missouri instruction for employee contributory negligence should apply to the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sorrell raises both a substantive and procedural objection in response.  Substantively, he argues that this Court departed from a proximate cause standard for railroad negligence under FELA in <em>Rogers</em> v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/500/index.html">352 U. S. 500</a> (1957).  There we stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cUnder [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.</p>\n<p>\n\n.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[F]or practical purposes the inquiry in these cases today rarely presents more than the single question whether negligence of the employer played any part, however small, in the injury or death which is the subject of the suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 506, 508.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSorrell argues that these passages from <em>Rogers</em> have been interpreted to mean that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof on the question whether the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence caused his injury is less onerous than the proximate cause standard prevailing at common law, citing cases such as <em>Consolidated Rail Corporation</em> v. <em>Gottshall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/532/index.html">512 U. S. 532</a>, 542\xe2\x80\x93543 (1994); <em>Holbrook</em> v. <em>Norfolk Southern R. Co.</em>, 414 F.\xc2\xa03d 739, 741\xe2\x80\x93742 (CA7 2005); <em>Hernandez</em> v. <em>Trawler Miss Vertie Mae, Inc.</em>, 187 F.\xc2\xa03d 432, 436 (CA4 1999); and <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em>, 132 F.\xc2\xa03d 599, 606\xe2\x80\x93607 (CA10 1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Norfolk counters that <em>Rogers</em> did not alter the established common-law rule of proximate cause, but rather simply rejected a flawed and unduly stringent version of the rule, the so-called \xe2\x80\x9csole proximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d test.  According to Norfolk, while most courts of appeals may have read <em>Rogers</em> as Sorrell does, several state supreme courts disagree, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Chapman</em> v. <em>Union Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 237 Neb. 617, 626\xe2\x80\x93629, 467 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 388, 395\xe2\x80\x93396 (1991); <em>Marazzato</em> v. <em>Burlington Northern\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 249 Mont. 487, 490\xe2\x80\x93491, 817 P.\xc2\xa02d 672, 674 (1991), and \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a deep conflict of authority on precisely that issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 20, n. 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sorrell\xe2\x80\x99s procedural objection is that we did not grant certiorari to determine the proper standard of causation for railroad negligence under FELA, but rather to decide whether different standards for railroad and employee negligence were permissible under the Act.  What is more, Norfolk is not only enlarging the question presented, but taking a position on that enlarged question that is contrary to the position it litigated below.  In the Missouri courts, Norfolk argued that Missouri applies different standards, and that the less rigorous standard applied to railroad negligence should also apply to employee contributory negligence.  Thus, Norfolk did not object below on causation grounds to the railroad liability instruction, but only to the employee contributory negligence instruction.  App. 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Now Norfolk wants to argue the opposite\xe2\x80\x94that the disparity in the standards should be resolved by applying the more rigorous contributory negligence standard to the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with Sorrell that we should stick to the question on which certiorari was sought and granted.  We are typically reluctant to permit parties to smuggle additional questions into a case before us after the grant of certiorari.  See <em>Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha</em> v. <em>U. S. Philips Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/27/index.html">510 U. S. 27</a>, 31\xe2\x80\x9334 (1993) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Although Norfolk is doubtless correct that we could consider the question of what standard applies as anterior to the question whether the standards may differ, the issue of the substantive content of the causation standard is significant enough that we prefer not to address it when it has not been fully presented.  We also agree with Sorrell that it would be unfair at this point to allow Norfolk to switch gears and seek a ruling from us that the standard should be proximate cause across the board.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What Norfolk <em>did</em> argue throughout is that the instructions, when given together, impermissibly created different standards of causation.  It chose to present in its petition for certiorari the more limited question whether the courts below erred in applying standards that differ.  That is the question on which we granted certiorari and the one we decide today.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to mounting concern about the number and severity of railroad employees\xe2\x80\x99 injuries, Congress in 1908 enacted FELA to provide a compensation scheme for railroad workplace injuries, pre-empting state tort remedies.  <em>Second Employers\xe2\x80\x99 Liability Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/223/1/index.html">223 U. S. 1</a>, 53\xe2\x80\x9355 (1912).  Unlike a typical workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation scheme, which provides relief without regard to fault, Section 1 of FELA provides a statutory cause of action sounding in negligence:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[E]very common carrier by railroad \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier \xe2\x80\xa6 for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa751.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FELA provides for concurrent jurisdiction of the state and federal courts, \xc2\xa756, although substantively FELA actions are governed by federal law.  <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. Co.</em> v. <em>Stapleton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/279/587/index.html">279 U. S. 587</a>, 590 (1929).  Absent express language to the contrary, the elements of a FELA claim are determined by reference to the common law.  <em>Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/163/index.html">337 U. S. 163</a>, 182 (1949).  One notable deviation from the common law is the abolition of the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s common-law defenses of assumption of the risk, \xc2\xa754; <em>Tiller</em> v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R.

Norfolk claims that Missouri is the only jurisdiction to allow such a disparity, and Sorrell has not identified another.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It is of course possible that everyone is out of step except Missouri, but we find no basis for concluding that Congress in FELA meant to allow disparate causation standards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have explained that \xe2\x80\x9calthough common-law principles are not necessarily dispositive of questions arising under FELA, unless they are expressly rejected in the text of the statute, they are entitled to great weight in our analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gottshall</em>, 512 U. S., at 544.  In <em>Gottshall</em> we \xe2\x80\x9ccataloged\xe2\x80\x9d the ways in which FELA expressly departed from the common law: it abolished the fellow servant rule, rejected contributory negligence in favor of comparative negligence, prohibited employers from contracting around the Act, and abolished the assumption of risk defense.  <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Ayers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/135/index.html">538 U. S. 135</a>, 145 (2003); <em>Gottshall</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 542\xe2\x80\x93543.  The fact that the common law applied the same causation standard to defendant and plaintiff negligence, and FELA did not expressly depart from that approach, is strong evidence against Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s disparate standards.  See also <em>Monessen Southwestern R. Co.</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/330/index.html">486 U. S. 330</a>, 337\xe2\x80\x93338 (1988) (holding that, because FELA abrogated some common-law rules explicitly but did not address \xe2\x80\x9cthe equally well-established doctrine barring the recovery of prejudgment interest, \xe2\x80\xa6 we are unpersuaded that Congress intended to abrogate that doctrine <em>sub silentio</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Departing from the common-law practice of applying a single standard of causation for negligence and contributory negligence would have been a peculiar approach for Congress to take in FELA.  As one court explained, under FELA,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[a]s to both attack or defense, there are two common elements, (1) negligence, i.e., the standard of care, and (2) causation, i.e., the relation of the negligence to the injury.  So far as negligence is concerned, that standard is the same\xe2\x80\x94ordinary prudence\xe2\x80\x94for both Employee and Railroad alike.  Unless a contrary result is imperative, it is, at best, unfortunate if two standards of causation are used.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Page</em>, 349 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 823.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a practical matter, it is difficult to reduce damages \xe2\x80\x9cin proportion\xe2\x80\x9d to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s negligence if the relevance of each party\xe2\x80\x99s negligence to the injury is measured by a different standard of causation.  Norfolk argues, persuasively we think, that it is far simpler for a jury to conduct the apportionment FELA mandates if the jury compares like with like\xe2\x80\x94apples to apples.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other courts to address this question concur.  See <em>Fashauer</em> v. <em>New Jersey Transit Rail Operations, Inc.</em>, 57 F.\xc2\xa03d 1269, 1282\xe2\x80\x931283 (CA3 1995); <em>Caplinger</em> v. <em>Northern Pacific Terminal</em>, 244 Ore. 289, 290\xe2\x80\x93292, 418 P.\xc2\xa02d 34, 35\xe2\x80\x9336 (1966) (in banc); <em>Page</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 822\xe2\x80\x93823; <em>Ganotis</em>, 342 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 768\xe2\x80\x93769.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The most thoughtful treatment comes in <em>Page</em>, in which the Fifth Circuit stated: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e think that from the very nature of comparative negligence, the standard of causation should be single\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Use of the terms \xe2\x80\x98in proportion to\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98negligence attributable to\xe2\x80\x99 the injured worker inescapably calls for a comparison\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [I]t is obvious that for a system of comparative fault to work, the basis of comparison has to be the same.\xe2\x80\x9d  349 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 824.  See also Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability \xc2\xa73, Reporters\xe2\x80\x99 Note, p. 37, Comment <em>a</em> (1999) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]omparative responsibility is difficult to administer when different rules govern different parts of the same lawsuit\xe2\x80\x9d).  We appreciate that there may well be reason to \xe2\x80\x9cdoubt that such casuistries have any practical significance [for] the jury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Page</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 823, but it seems to us that Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s idiosyncratic approach of applying different standards of causation unduly muddies what may, to a jury, be already murky waters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sorrell argues that FELA does contain an explicit statutory alteration from the common-law rule: Section 1 of FELA\xe2\x80\x94addressing railroad negligence\xe2\x80\x94uses the language \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part,\xe2\x80\x9d 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa751, while Section 3\xe2\x80\x94covering employee contributory negligence\xe2\x80\x94does not, \xc2\xa753.  This, Sorrell contends, evinces an intent to depart from the common-law causation standard with respect to railroad negligence under Section 1, but not with respect to any employee contributory negligence under Section 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The inclusion of this language in one section and not the other does not alone justify a departure from the common-law practice of applying a single standard of causation.  It would have made little sense to include the \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d language in Section 3, because if the employee\xe2\x80\x99s contributory negligence contributed \xe2\x80\x9cin whole\xe2\x80\x9d to his injury, there would be no recovery against the railroad in the first place.  The language made sense in Section 1, however, to make clear that there could be recovery against the railroad even if it were only partially negligent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the language in Section 1 is understood to address the standard of causation, and not simply to reflect the fact that contributory negligence is no longer a complete bar to recovery, there is no reason to read the statute as a whole to encompass different causation standards.  Section 3 simply does not address causation.  On the question whether a different standard of causation applies as between the two parties, the statutory text is silent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, in urging that a higher standard of causation for plaintiff contributory negligence is acceptable, Sorrell invokes FELA\xe2\x80\x99s remedial purpose and our history of liberal construction.  We are not persuaded.  FELA was indeed enacted to benefit railroad employees, as the express abrogation of such common-law defenses as assumption of risk, the contributory negligence bar, and the fellow servant rule make clear.  See <em>Ayers</em>, 538 U. S., at 145.  It does not follow, however, that this remedial purpose requires us to interpret every uncertainty in the Act in favor of employees.  See <em>Rodriguez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/522/index.html">480 U. S. 522</a>, 526 (1987) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that <em>whatever</em> furthers the statute\xe2\x80\x99s primarily objective must be the law\xe2\x80\x9d).  FELA\xe2\x80\x99s text does not support the proposition that Congress meant to take the unusual step of applying different causation standards in a comparative negligence regime, and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s remedial purpose cannot compensate for the lack of a statutory basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that FELA does not abrogate the common-law approach, and that the same standard of causation applies to railroad negligence under Section 1 as to plaintiff contributory negligence under Section 3.  Sorrell does not dispute that Missouri applies different standards, see Brief for Respondent 40\xe2\x80\x9341; see also Mo. Approved Jury Instr., Civ., No. 24.01, Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Comment (1978 New), and accordingly we vacate the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented in this case is a narrow one, and we see no need to do more than answer that question in today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  As a review of FELA model instructions indicates, n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>, there are a variety of ways to instruct a jury to apply the same causation standard to railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence.  Missouri has the same flexibility as the other States in deciding how to do so, so long as it now joins them in applying a single standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sorrell maintains that even if the instructions improperly contained different causation standards we should nonetheless affirm because any error was harmless.  He argues that the evidence of his negligence presented at trial, if credited by the jury, could only have been a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d cause, so that even with revised instructions the result would not change.  This argument is better addressed by the Missouri Court of Appeals, and we leave it to that court on remand to determine whether a new trial is required in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Missouri Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Missouri in the past directed a jury to find a railroad liable if the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly resulted in whole or in part in injury to plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mo.

Some jurisdictions recommend using the \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin any part\xe2\x80\x9d formulation for both railroad negligence and plaintiff contributory negligence, by using the same language in the respective pattern instructions, including a third instruction that the same causation standard is applied to both parties, or including in commentary an admonition to that effect.

Other jurisdictions use the statutory formulation (\xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d) for railroad negligence, and do not contain a pattern instruction for contributory negligence.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Mich. Non-Standard Jury Instr., Civ., \xc2\xa712:53 (Supp. 2006\xc2\xa0).  Both Alabama and Virginia use formulations containing language of both proximate cause and in whole or in part.  1 Ala. Pattern Jury Instr., Civ., Nos. 17.01, 17.05 (2d ed. 1993) (railroad negligence \xe2\x80\x9cproximately caused, in whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d; plaintiff contributory negligence \xe2\x80\x9cproximately contributed to cause\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 Va.

In New York, the pattern instructions provide that railroad causation is measured by whether the injury results \xe2\x80\x9cin whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d from the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence, and a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s contributory negligence diminishes recovery if it \xe2\x80\x9ccontributed to caus[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the injury.  1B N.\xc2\xa0Y.

Despite some courts\xe2\x80\x99 views to the contrary,<footcall num="*"> <em>Rogers</em> did not address, much less alter, existing law governing the degree of causation necessary for redressing negligence as the cause of negligently inflicted harm; the case merely instructed courts how to proceed when there are multiple cognizable causes of an injury.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to FELA, it was clear common law that a plaintiff had to prove that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence caused his injury proximately, not indirectly or remotely.  See, <em>e.g</em>., 3 J. Lawson, Rights, Remedies, and Practice 1740 (1890) (\xe2\x80\x9cNatural, proximate, and legal results are all that damages can be recovered for, even under a statute entitling one \xe2\x80\x98to recover <em>any</em> damage\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73 (2d ed. 1888) (same).  Defendants were held to the same standard: under the law of that day, a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s contributory negligence was an absolute bar to his recovery if, but only if, it was a proximate cause of his harm.  See <em>Grand Trunk R. Co.</em> v. <em>Ives</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/144/408/index.html">144 U.

S. 1</a>, 49\xe2\x80\x9350 (1912) (cataloguing FELA\xe2\x80\x99s departures from the common law).  Among FELA\xe2\x80\x99s explicit common law targets, the rule of contributory negligence as a categorical bar to a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s recovery was dropped and replaced with a comparative negligence regime.  45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa753; see <em>Grand Trunk Western R. Co.</em> v. <em>Lindsay</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/233/42/index.html">233 U. S. 42</a>, 49 (1914).  FELA said nothing, however, about the familiar proximate cause standard for claims either of a defendant-employer\xe2\x80\x99s negligence or a plaintiff-employee\xe2\x80\x99s contributory negligence, and throughout the half-century between FELA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment and the decision in <em>Rogers</em>, we consistently recognized and applied proximate cause as the proper standard in FELA suits.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Tennant</em> v. <em>Peoria &amp; Pekin Union R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/29/index.html">321 U. S. 29</a>, 32 (1944) (FELA plaintiff must prove that \xe2\x80\x9cnegligence was the proximate cause in whole or in part\xe2\x80\x9d of his injury); see also <em>Urie</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/163/index.html">337 U.

We granted certiorari in <em>Rogers</em> to establish the test for submitting a case to a jury when the evidence would permit a finding that an injury had multiple causes.  352 U. S., at 501, 506.  We rejected Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clanguage of proximate causation which ma[de] a jury question [about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liability] dependent upon whether the jury may find that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 506.  The notion that proximate cause must be exclusive proximate cause undermined Congress\xe2\x80\x99s chosen scheme of comparative negligence by effectively reviving the old rule of contributory negligence as barring any relief, and we held that a FELA plaintiff may recover even when the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s action was a partial cause of injury but not the sole one.  Recovery under the statute is possible, we said, even when an employer\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to injury was slight in relation to all other legally cognizable causes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0True, I would have to stipulate that clarity was not well served by the statement in <em>Rogers</em> that a case must go to a jury where \xe2\x80\x9cthe proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But that statement did not address and should not be read as affecting the necessary directness of cognizable causation, as distinct from the occasional multiplicity of causations.  It spoke to apportioning liability among parties, each of whom was understood to have had some hand in causing damage directly enough to be what the law traditionally called a proximate cause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of any intent to water down the common law requirement of proximate cause is evident from the prior cases on which <em>Rogers</em> relied.  To begin with, the \xe2\x80\x9cany part, even the slightest\xe2\x80\x9d excerpt of the opinion (cited by respondent in arguing that <em>Rogers</em> created a more \xe2\x80\x9crelaxed\xe2\x80\x9d standard of causation than proximate cause) itself cited <em>Coray</em> v. <em>Southern Pacific Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/520/index.html">335 U. S. 520</a> (1949).  See <em>Rogers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 506, n.\xc2\xa011.  There, just eight years before <em>Rogers</em>, Justice Black unambiguously recognized proximate cause as the standard applicable in FELA suits.  335 U. S., at 523 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]etitioner was entitled to recover if this defective equipment was the sole or a contributory proximate cause of the decedent employee\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, the <em>Rogers</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of causation under \xe2\x80\x9csafety-appliance statutes\xe2\x80\x9d contained a cross-reference to <em>Coray</em> and a citation to <em>Carter</em> v. <em>Atlanta &amp; St. Andrews Bay R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/338/430/index.html">338 U. S. 430</a> (1949), a case which likewise held there was liability only if \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury determines that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s breach is a \xe2\x80\x98contributory proximate cause\xe2\x80\x99 of injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 435.  <em>Rogers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 507, n.\xc2\xa013.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If more were needed to confirm the limited scope of what <em>Rogers</em> held, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s quotation of the Missouri trial court\xe2\x80\x99s jury charge in that case would supply it, for the instructions covered the requirement to show proximate cause connecting negligence and harm, a point free of controversy:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]f you further find that the plaintiff \xe2\x80\xa6 did not exercise ordinary care for his own safety and was guilty of negligence and that such negligence, if any[,] was the sole proximate cause of his injuries, if any, and that such alleged injuries, if any, were not directly contributed to or caused by any negligence of the defendant \xe2\x80\xa6 then, in that event, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover against the defendant, and you will find your verdict in favor of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  352 U. S., at 505, n.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, the trial judge spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d by plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s own negligence, and for defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence used the familiar term of art for proximate cause, in referring to a showing that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly contributed to or caused\xe2\x80\x9d the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injuries.  We took no issue with the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s instruction in this respect, but addressed the significance of multiple causations, as explained above.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether FELA is properly read today as requiring proof of proximate causation before recognizing negligence is up to the Missouri Court of Appeals to determine in the first instance, if necessary for the resolution of this case on remand.  If the state court decides to take on that issue, it will necessarily deal with <em>Rogers</em>, which in my judgment is no authority for anything less than proximate causation in an action under FELA.  The state court may likewise need to address post-<em>Rogers</em> cases (including some of our own); I do not mean to suggest any view of them except for the misreading of <em>Rogers</em> expressed here and there.  </p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Recently, some courts have taken the view that <em>Rogers</em> smuggled proximate cause out of the concept of defendant liability under FELA.

I concur in that judgment.  It should be recalled, however, that the Court has several times stated what a plaintiff must prove to warrant submission of a FELA case to a jury.  That question is long settled, we have no cause to reexamine it, and I do not read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to cast a shadow of doubt on the matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Consolidated Rail Corporation</em> v. <em>Gottshall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/532/index.html"></a><a href="/us/512/532/index.html">512 U. S. 532</a>, 543 (1994), we acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9ca relaxed causation standard applies under FELA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Decades earlier, in <em>Crane</em> v. <em>Cedar Rapids &amp; Iowa City R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/164/index.html"></a><a href="/us/395/164/index.html">395 U. S. 164</a> (1969), we said that a FELA plaintiff need prove \xe2\x80\x9conly that his injury resulted in whole or in part from the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 166 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Both decisions referred to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s oft-cited opinion in <em>Rogers</em> v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/500/index.html">352 U. S. 500</a> (1957), which declared: \xe2\x80\x9cUnder [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, <em>even the slightest</em>, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 506 (emphasis added).  <em>Rogers</em>, in turn, drew upon <em>Coray</em> v. <em>Southern Pacific Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/520/index.html">335 U. S. 520</a>, 524 (1949), in which the Court observed: \xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\xa6 imposed extraordinary safety obligations upon railroads and has commanded that if a breach of these obligations contributes in part to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s death, the railroad must pay damages.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These decisions answer the question Norfolk sought to \xe2\x80\x9csmuggle \xe2\x80\xa6 into\xe2\x80\x9d this case, see <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, <em>i.e.</em>, what is the proper standard of causation for railroad negligence under FELA.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion leaves in place precedent solidly establishing that the causation standard in FELA actions is more \xe2\x80\x9crelaxed\xe2\x80\x9d than in tort litigation generally.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few further points bear emphasis.  First, it is sometimes said that <em>Rogers</em> eliminated proximate cause in FELA actions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Crane</em>, 395 U. S., at 166 (A FELA plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cis not required to prove common-law proximate causation.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Summers</em> v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em>, 132 F. 3d 599, 606 (CA10 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the first half of this century, it was customary for courts to analyze liability under \xe2\x80\xa6 FELA in terms of proximate causation.  However, the Supreme Court definitively abandoned this approach in <em>Rogers</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)); <em>Oglesby</em> v. <em>Southern Pacific Transp. Co.</em>, 6 F.\xc2\xa03d 602, 609 (CA9 1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c[Our] holding is consistent with the case law of several other circuits which have found [that] \xe2\x80\x98proximate cause\xe2\x80\x99 is not required to establish causation under the FELA.\xe2\x80\x9d).  It would be more accurate, as I see it, to recognize that <em>Rogers </em>describes the test for proximate causation applicable in FELA suits.  That test is whether \xe2\x80\x9cemployer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  352 U. S., at 506.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligence is a proximate cause of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury entails a judgment, at least in part policy based, as to how far down the chain of consequences a defendant should be held responsible for its wrongdoing.  See <em>Palsgraf</em> v. <em>Long Island R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 248 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 339, 352, 162 N.\xc2\xa0E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we do mean by the word \xe2\x80\x98proximate\xe2\x80\x99 is, that because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In FELA cases, strong policy considerations inform the causation calculus.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FELA was prompted by concerns about the welfare of railroad workers.  \xe2\x80\x9cCognizant of the physical dangers of railroading that resulted in the death or maiming of thousands of workers every year,\xe2\x80\x9d and dissatisfied with the tort remedies available under state common law, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress crafted a federal remedy that shifted part of the human overhead of doing business from employees to their employers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gottshall</em>, 512 U. S., at 542 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Wilkerson</em> v. <em>McCarthy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/53/index.html">336 U. S. 53</a>, 68 (1949) (Douglas, J., concurring) (FELA \xe2\x80\x9cwas designed to put on the railroad industry some of the cost for the legs, eyes, arms, and lives which it consumed in its operations.\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have liberally construed FELA to further Congress\xe2\x80\x99 remedial goal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gottshall</em>, 512 U. S., at 543.  With the motivation for FELA center stage in <em>Rogers</em>, we held that a FELA plaintiff can get to a jury if he can show that his employer\xe2\x80\x99s negligence was even the slightest cause of his injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cslightest\xe2\x80\x9d cause sounds far less exacting than \xe2\x80\x9cproximate\xe2\x80\x9d cause, which may account for the statements in judicial opinions that <em>Rogers </em>dispensed with proximate cause for FELA actions.  These statements seem to me reflective of pervasive confusion engendered by the term \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  As Prosser and Keeton explains:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe word \xe2\x80\x98proximate\xe2\x80\x99 is a legacy of Lord Chancellor Bacon, who in his time committed other sins.  The word means nothing more than near or immediate; and when it was first taken up by the courts it had connotations of proximity in time and space which have long since disappeared.  It is an unfortunate word, which places an entirely wrong emphasis upon the factor of physical or mechanical closeness.  For this reason \xe2\x80\x98legal cause\xe2\x80\x99 or perhaps even \xe2\x80\x98responsible cause\xe2\x80\x99 would be a more appropriate term.\xe2\x80\x9d  W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa742, p.\xc2\xa0273 (5th ed. 1984) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIf we take up Prosser and Keeton\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion to substitute \xe2\x80\x9clegal cause\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause,\xe2\x80\x9d we can state\nmore clearly what <em>Rogers </em>held: Whenever a railroad\xe2\x80\x99s\nnegligence is the slightest cause of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury, it is a legal cause, for which the railroad is properly held responsible.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the term \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d is confounding to jurists, it is even more bewildering to jurors.  Nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion should encourage courts to use \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause,\xe2\x80\x9d or any term like it, in jury instructions.  \xe2\x80\x9c[L]egal concepts such as \xe2\x80\x98proximate cause\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98foreseeability\xe2\x80\x99 are best left to arguments between attorneys for consideration by judges or justices; they are not terms which are properly submitted to a lay jury, and when submitted can only serve to confuse jurors and distract them from deciding cases based on their merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Busta </em>v. <em>Columbus Hospital Corp.</em>, 276 Mont. 342, 371, 916 P.\xc2\xa02d 122, 139 (1996).

As to railroad negligence, the relevant instruction tells the jury:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe fourth element [of a FELA action] is whether an injury to the plaintiff resulted in whole or in part from the negligence of the railroad or its employees or agents.  In other words, did such negligence play any part, even the slightest, in bringing about an injury to the plaintiff?\xe2\x80\x9d  5 L. Sand, J. Siffert, W. Loughlin, S. Reiss, &amp; N. Batterman, Modern Federal Jury Instructions\xe2\x80\x94Civil \xc2\xb689.02, p.\xc2\xa089\xe2\x80\x9344 (3d ed. 2006).</p>\n<p align="left">\nRegarding contributory negligence, the relevant instruction reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTo determine whether the plaintiff was \xe2\x80\x98contributorily negligent,\xe2\x80\x99 you \xe2\x80\xa6 apply the same rule of causation, that is, did the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s negligence, if any, play any part in bringing about his injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., \xc2\xb689.03, p.\xc2\xa089\xe2\x80\x9353.</p>\n<p align="left">\nBoth instructions direct jurors in plain terms that they can be expected to understand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, as the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314, on remand, the Missouri Court of Appeals will determine whether a new trial is required in this case, owing to the failure of the trial judge properly to align the charges on negligence and contributory negligence.  The trial court instructed the jury to find Norfolk liable if the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s negligence \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in whole or in part in injury to plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 14.  In contrast, the court told the jury to find Sorrell contributorily negligent only if he engaged in negligent conduct that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>directly</em> contributed to cause his injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 15 (emphasis added).  At trial, Norfolk sought a different contributory negligence instruction.  Its proposed charge would have informed the jury that Sorrell could be held responsible, at least in part, if his own negligence \xe2\x80\x9ccontributed in whole or in part to cause his injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was superior to the contributory negligence instruction in fact delivered by the trial court, for the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s phrasing did not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  As Sorrell points out, however, the instructional error was almost certainly harmless.  Norfolk alleged that Sorrell drove his truck negligently, causing it to flip on its side.  Under the facts of this case, it is difficult to imagine that a jury could find Sorrell negligent in a manner that contributed to his injury, but only indirectly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Norfolk urged in this Court, belatedly and unsuccessfully, that the charge on negligence was erroneous and should have been revised to conform to the charge in fact delivered on contributory negligence.  See <em>ante</em>, at\xc2\xa04.  That argument cannot be reconciled with our precedent.  See <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  Even if it could, it would be unavailing in the circumstances here presented.  Again, there is little likelihood that a jury could find that Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s negligence contributed to Sorrell\xe2\x80\x99s injury, but only indirectly.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the above-described qualifications, I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I do not read Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion as taking a position on the appropriate causation standard as expressed in <em>Consolidated Rail Corporation</em> v. <em>Gottshall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/532/index.html"></a><a href="/us/512/532/index.html">512 U.
