His wife filed an I\xe2\x80\x93130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf that was denied in 2003.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged Dada with being removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act for overstaying his temporary nonimmigrant visa.  The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the request for a continuance pending adjudication of a second I\xe2\x80\x93130 petition, found Dada eligible for removal, and granted his request for voluntary departure under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229c(b).  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed and ordered Dada to depart within 30 days or suffer statutory penalties.  Two days before the end of the 30-day period, Dada sought to withdraw his voluntary departure request and filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7), contending that new and material evidence demonstrated a bona fide marriage and that his case should be continued until resolution of the second I\xe2\x80\x93130 petition.  After the voluntary departure period had expired, the BIA denied the request, reasoning that an alien who has been granted voluntary departure but does not depart in a timely fashion is statutorily barred from receiving adjustment of status.  It did not consider Dada\xe2\x80\x99s request to withdraw his voluntary departure request.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>An alien must be permitted an opportunity to withdraw a motion for voluntary departure, provided the request is made before expiration of the departure period.

It benefits the Government by, <em>e.g., </em>expediting the departure process and avoiding deportation expenses, and benefits the alien by, <em>e.g., </em>facilitating readmission.  To receive these benefits, the alien must depart timely.  As relevant here, when voluntary departure is requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings, the departure period may not exceed 60 days.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229c(b)(2).

The motion generally must be filed within 90 days of a final administrative removal order, \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(C)(1).  Although neither the text of \xc2\xa71229c or \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7) nor the applicable legislative history indicates whether Congress intended for an alien granted voluntary departure to be permitted to pursue a motion to reopen, the statutory text plainly guarantees to each alien the right to file \xe2\x80\x9cone motion to reopen proceedings under this section,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(A).  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Section 1229c(b)(2) unambiguously states that the voluntary departure period \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be valid\xe2\x80\x9d for more than \xe2\x80\x9c60 days,\xe2\x80\x9d but says nothing about the motion to reopen; and nothing in the statutes or past usage indicates that voluntary departure or motions to reopen cannot coexist.  In reading a statute, the Court must not \xe2\x80\x9clook merely to a particular clause,\xe2\x80\x9d but consider \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with it the whole statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kokoszka</em> v. <em>Belford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/642/index.html">417 U. S. 642</a>, 650.  Reading the Act as a whole, and considering the statutory scheme governing voluntary departure alongside \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s right to pursue \xe2\x80\x9cone motion to reopen,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position that an alien who has agreed to voluntarily depart is not entitled to pursue a motion to reopen is unsustainable.  It would render the statutory reopening right a nullity in most voluntary departure cases since it is foreseeable, and quite likely, that the voluntary departure time will expire long before the BIA decides a timely-filed motion to reopen.  Absent tolling or some other remedial action by this Court, then, the alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: The alien either may leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order, with the effect that the motion to reopen is deemed withdrawn, or may stay in the United States to pursue the case\xe2\x80\x99s reopening, risking expiration of the departure period and ineligibility for adjustment of status, the underlying relief sought.  Because a motion to reopen is meant to ensure a proper and lawful disposition, this Court is reluctant to assume that the voluntary departure statute is designed to make reopening unavailable for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by the same law, when the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain text reveals no such limitation.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0It is thus necessary to read the Act to preserve the alien\xe2\x80\x99s right to pursue reopening while respecting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the voluntary departure arrangement\xe2\x80\x99s <em>quid pro quo</em>.  There is no statutory authority for petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to automatically toll the voluntary departure period during the motion to reopen\xe2\x80\x99s pendency.  Voluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement.  An alien who is permitted to stay past the departure date to wait out the motion to reopen\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication cannot then demand the full benefits of voluntary departure, for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s benefit\xe2\x80\x94a prompt and costless departure\xe2\x80\x94would be lost.  It would also invite abuse by aliens who wish to stay in the country but whose cases are unlikely to be reopened.  Absent a valid regulation otherwise, the appropriate way to reconcile the voluntary departure and motion to reopen provisions is to allow an alien to withdraw from the voluntary departure agreement.  The Department of Justice, which has authority to adopt the relevant regulations, has made a preliminary determination that the Act permits an alien to withdraw a voluntary departure application before expiration of the departure period.  Although not binding in the present case, this proposed interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cwarrants respectful consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs.</em> v. <em>Blumer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/473/index.html">534 U. S. 473</a>, 497.  To safeguard the right to pursue a motion to reopen for voluntary departure recipients, the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary departure request before the departure period expires, without regard to the motion to reopen\xe2\x80\x99s underlying merits.  The alien has the option either to abide by the voluntary departure\xe2\x80\x99s terms, and receive its agreed-upon benefits; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and remain in the country to pursue an administrative motion.  An alien selecting the latter option gives up the possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the IJ\xe2\x80\x99s alternative order of removal.  The alien may be removed by the DHS within 90 days, even if the motion to reopen has yet to be adjudicated.  But the alien may request a stay of the removal order, and, though the BIA has discretion to deny a motion for a stay based on the merits of the motion to reopen, it may constitute an abuse of discretion for the BIA to deny a motion for stay where the motion states nonfrivolous grounds for reopening.  Though this interpretation still confronts the alien with a hard choice, it avoids both the quixotic results of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposal and the elimination of benefits to the Government that would follow from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s tolling rule.

MUKASEY<br/>\n554 U. S. ____ (2008)<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 06-1181<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">SAMSON TAIWO DADA, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> MICHAEL B.\nMUKASEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[June 16, 2008]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We decide in this case whether an alien who has requested and been granted voluntary departure from the United States, a form of discretionary relief that avoids certain statutory penalties, must adhere to that election and depart within the time prescribed, even if doing so causes the alien to forgo a ruling on a pending, unresolved motion to reopen the removal proceedings.  The case turns upon the interaction of relevant provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93546 (IIRIRA or Act).  The Act provides that every alien ordered removed from the United States has a right to file one motion to reopen his or her removal proceedings.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V).<em> </em>The statute also provides, however, that if the alien\xe2\x80\x99s request for voluntary departure is granted after he or she is found removable, the alien is required to depart within the period prescribed by immigration officials, which cannot exceed 60 days.  See \xc2\xa71229c(b)(2) (2000 ed.).  Failure to depart within the prescribed period renders the alien ineligible for certain forms of relief, including adjustment of status, for a period of 10 years.  \xc2\xa71229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  Pursuant to regulation, however, departure has the effect of withdrawing the motion to reopen.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(d) (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without some means, consistent with the Act, to reconcile the two commands\xe2\x80\x94one directing voluntary departure and the other directing termination of the motion to reopen if an alien departs the United States\xe2\x80\x94an alien who seeks reopening has two poor choices: The alien can remain in the United States to ensure the motion to reopen remains pending, while incurring statutory penalties for overstaying the voluntary departure date; or the alien can avoid penalties by prompt departure but abandon the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The issue is whether Congress intended the statutory right to reopen to be qualified by the voluntary departure process.  The alien, who is petitioner here, urges that filing a motion to reopen tolls the voluntary departure period pending the motion\xe2\x80\x99s disposition.  We reject this interpretation because it would reconfigure the voluntary departure scheme in a manner inconsistent with the statutory design.  We do not have the authority to interpret the statute as petitioner suggests.  Still, the conflict between the right to file a motion to reopen and the provision requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days remains untenable if these are the only two choices available to the alien.  Absent a valid regulation resolving the dilemma in a different way, we conclude the alien must be permitted an opportunity to withdraw the motion for voluntary departure, provided the request is made before the departure period expires.  Petitioner attempted to avail himself of this opportunity below.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not disturb the Board of Immigration Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 (BIA or Board) denial of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request to withdraw the voluntary departure election.  We now reverse its decision and remand the case.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Samson Taiwo Dada, a native and citizen of Nigeria, came to the United States in April 1998 on a temporary nonimmigrant visa.  He overstayed it.  In 1999, petitioner alleges, he married an American citizen.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s wife filed an I\xe2\x80\x93130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf.  The necessary documentary evidence was not provided, however, and the petition was denied in February 2003.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged petitioner with being removable under \xc2\xa7237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 201, as amended, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. V), for overstaying his visa.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s wife then filed a second I\xe2\x80\x93130 petition.  The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request for a continuance pending adjudication of the newly filed I\xe2\x80\x93130 petition and noted that those petitions take an average of about three years to process.  The IJ found petitioner to be removable but granted the request for voluntary departure under \xc2\xa71229c(b) (2000 ed.).  The BIA affirmed on November 4, 2005, without a written opinion.  It ordered petitioner to depart within 30 days or suffer statutory penalties, including a civil fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 and ineligibility for relief under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7240A, 240B, 245, 248, and 249 of the INA for a period of 10 years.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two days before expiration of the 30-day period, on December 2, 2005, petitioner sought to withdraw his request for voluntary departure.  At the same time he filed with the BIA a motion to reopen removal proceedings under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  He contended that his motion recited new and material evidence demonstrating a bona fide marriage and that his case should be continued until the second I\xe2\x80\x93130 petition was resolved.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 8, 2006, more than two months after the voluntary departure period expired, the BIA denied the motion to reopen on the ground that petitioner had overstayed his voluntary departure period.  Under \xc2\xa7240B(d) of the INA, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), the BIA reasoned, an alien who has been granted voluntary departure but fails to depart in a timely fashion is statutorily barred from applying for and receiving certain forms of discretionary relief, including adjustment of status.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3\xe2\x80\x934.  The BIA did not address petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to withdraw his request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  <em>Dada</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 207 Fed. Appx. 425 (2006)<em> (per curiam).</em>  Relying on its decision in <em>Banda-Ortiz</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 445 F.\xc2\xa03d 387 (2006), the court held that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the applicable statutes as rendering petitioner ineligible for relief was reasonable.  The Fifth Circuit joined the First and Fourth Circuits in concluding that there is no automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period.  See <em>Chedad </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>497 F.\xc2\xa03d 57 (CA1 2007); <em>Dekoladenu</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 459 F.\xc2\xa03d 500 (CA4 2006).  Four other Courts of Appeals have reached the opposite conclusion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Kanivets</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 424 F.\xc2\xa03d 330 (CA3 2005); <em>Sidikhouya</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 407 F.\xc2\xa03d 950 (CA8 2005); <em>Azarte</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 394 F.\xc2\xa03d 1278 (CA9 2005); <em>Ugokwe</em> v. <em>United States Atty.

Also after oral argument, on January 10, 2008, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s second I\xe2\x80\x93130 application was denied by the IJ on the ground that his marriage is a sham, contracted solely to obtain immigration benefits.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Resolution of the questions presented turns on the interaction of two statutory schemes\xe2\x80\x94the statutory right to file a motion to reopen in removal proceedings; and the rules governing voluntary departure.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief that allows certain favored aliens\xe2\x80\x94either before the conclusion of removal proceedings or after being found deportable\xe2\x80\x94to leave the country willingly.  Between 1927 to 2005, over 42 million aliens were granted voluntary departure; almost 13 million of those departures occurred between 1996 and 2005 alone.

The practice was first codified in the Alien Registration Act of 1940, \xc2\xa720, 54 Stat. 671.  The Alien Registration Act amended \xc2\xa719 of the Immigration Act of Feb. 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 889, to provide that an alien \xe2\x80\x9cdeportable under any law of the United States and who has proved good moral character for the preceding five years\xe2\x80\x9d may be permitted by the Attorney General to \xe2\x80\x9cdepart the United States to any country of his choice at his own expense, in lieu of deportation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa720(c), 54 Stat. 672.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1996, perhaps in response to criticism of immigration officials who had expressed frustration that aliens granted voluntary departure were \xe2\x80\x9cpermitted to continue their illegal presence in the United States for months, and even years,\xe2\x80\x9d Letter from Benjamin G.

In no event can the total period of time, including any extension, exceed 120 days or 60 days as set forth in section 240B of the Act\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The voluntary departure period typically does not begin to run until administrative appeals are concluded.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(47)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe order \xe2\x80\xa6 shall become final upon the earlier of\xe2\x80\x94(i) a determination by the Board of Immigration Appeals affirming such order; or (ii) the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the Board of Immigration Appeals\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71229c(b)(1) (Attorney General may permit voluntary departure at conclusion of removal proceedings); see also 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.6(a) (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he decision in any proceeding \xe2\x80\xa6 from which an appeal to the Board may be taken shall not be executed during the time allowed for the filing of an appeal \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition some Federal Courts of Appeals have found that they may stay voluntary departure pending consideration of a petition for review on the merits.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Thapa</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 460 F.\xc2\xa03d 323, 329\xe2\x80\x93332 (CA2 2006); <em>Obale</em> v. <em>Attorney General of United States</em>, 453 F.\xc2\xa03d 151, 155\xe2\x80\x93157 (CA3 2006).  But see <em>Ngarurih</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 371 F.\xc2\xa03d 182, 194 (CA4 2004).  This issue is not presented here, however, and we leave its resolution for another day.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Voluntary departure, under the current structure, allows the Government and the alien to agree upon a <em>quid pro quo</em>.  From the Government\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint, the alien\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to leave voluntarily expedites the departure process and avoids the expense of deportation\xe2\x80\x94including procuring necessary documents and detaining the alien pending deportation.  The Government also eliminates some of the costs and burdens associated with litigation over the departure.  With the apparent purpose of assuring that the Government attains the benefits it seeks, the Act imposes limits on the time for voluntary departure, see <em>supra, </em>at 7<em>, </em>and prohibits judicial review of voluntary departure decisions, see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71229c(f) and 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Benefits to the alien from voluntary departure are evident as well.  He or she avoids extended detention pending completion of travel arrangements; is allowed to choose when to depart (subject to certain constraints); and can select the country of destination.  And, of great importance, by departing voluntarily the alien facilitates the possibility of readmission.  The practice was first justified as involving \xe2\x80\x9cno warrant of deportation \xe2\x80\xa6 so that if [the alien reapplies] for readmission in the proper way he will not be barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement: Report on the Enforcement of the Deportation Laws of the United States 57, 102\xe2\x80\x93103 (1931) (Report No. 5).  The current statute likewise allows an alien who voluntarily departs to sidestep some of the penalties attendant to deportation.  Under the current Act, an alien involuntarily removed from the United States is ineligible for readmission for a period of 5, 10, or 20 years, depending upon the circumstances of removal.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(a)(9)(A)(i) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny alien who has been ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title or at the end of proceedings under section 1229a of this title initiated upon the alien\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in the United States and who again seeks admission within 5 years of the date of such removal (or within 20 years in the case of a second or subsequent removal\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0) is inadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71182(a)(9)\n(A)(ii) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny alien not described in clause (i) who\xe2\x80\x94(I) has been ordered removed under section [240] or any other provision of law, or (II) departed the United States while an order of removal was outstanding, and who seeks admission within 10 years of the date of such alien\xe2\x80\x99s departure or removal \xe2\x80\xa6 is inadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d).   An alien who makes a timely departure under a grant of voluntary departure, on the other hand, is not subject to these restrictions\xe2\x80\x94although he or she otherwise may be ineligible for readmission based, for instance, on an earlier unlawful presence in the United States, see \xc2\xa71182(a)(9)(B)(i).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A motion to reopen is a form of procedural relief that \xe2\x80\x9casks the Board to change its decision in light of newly discovered evidence or a change in circumstances since the hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Gordon \xc2\xa73.05[8][c].  Like voluntary departure, reopening is a judicial creation later codified by federal statute.  An early reference to the procedure was in 1916, when a Federal District Court addressed an alien\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reopen her case to provide evidence of her marriage to a United States citizen.  See <em>Ex parte Chan Shee</em>, 236 F. 579 (ND Cal. 1916); see also <em>Chew Hoy Quong</em> v. <em>White</em>, 244 F. 749, 750 (CA9 1917) (addressing an application to reopen to correct discrepancies in testimony).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe reopening of a case by the immigration authorities for the introduction of further evidence\xe2\x80\x9d was treated then, as it is now, as \xe2\x80\x9ca matter for the exercise of their discretion\xe2\x80\x9d; where the alien was given a \xe2\x80\x9cfull opportunity to testify and to present all witnesses and documentary evidence at the original hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d judicial interference was deemed unwarranted.  <em>Wong Shong Been </em>v. <em>Proctor</em>, 79 F.\xc2\xa02d 881, 883 (CA9 1935).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1958, when the BIA was established, the Attorney General promulgated a rule for the reopening and reconsideration of removal proceedings, 8 CFR \xc2\xa73.2, upon which the current regulatory provision is based.  See 23 Fed. Reg. 9115, 9118\xe2\x80\x939119 (1958), final rule codified at 8 CFR \xc2\xa73.2 (1959) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Board may on its own motion reopen or reconsider any case in which it has rendered a decision\xe2\x80\x9d upon a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten motion\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Board of Immigration Appeals: Powers; and Reopening or Reconsideration of Cases, 27 Fed. Reg. 96\xe2\x80\x9397 (Jan. 5, 1962).  Until 1996, there was no time limit for requesting the reopening of a case due to the availability of new evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then, in 1990, \xe2\x80\x9cfear[ful] that deportable or excludable aliens [were] try[ing] to prolong their stays in the U.

Finds Aliens Not Abusing Requests for Relief, 68 No. 27 Interpreter Releases 907 (July 22, 1991), Congress ordered the Attorney General to \xe2\x80\x9cissue regulations with respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 the period of time in which motions to reopen \xe2\x80\xa6 may be offered in deportation proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9ca limitation on the number of such motions that may be filed and a maximum time period for the filing of such motions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7545(d)(1), 104 Stat. 5066.  The Attorney General found little evidence of abuse, concluding that requirements for reopening are a disincentive to bad faith filings.  See 68 Interpreter Releases, <em>supra.</em>  Because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\xa6 neither rescinded [n]or amended its mandate to limit the number and time frames of motions,\xe2\x80\x9d however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a regulation imposing new time limits and restrictions on filings.  The new regulation allowed the alien to file one motion to reopen within 90 days.  Executive Office for Immigration Review; Motions and Appeals in Immigration Proceedings, 61 Fed.

It must be noted, though, that the Act transforms the motion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statutory form of relief available to the alien.  Nowhere in \xc2\xa71229c(b) or \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7) did Congress discuss the impact of the statutory right to file a motion to reopen on a voluntary departure agreement.  And no legislative history indicates what some Members of Congress might have intended with respect to the motion\xe2\x80\x99s status once the voluntary departure period has elapsed.  But the statutory text is plain insofar as it guarantees to each alien the right to file \xe2\x80\x9cone motion to reopen proceedings under this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Government argues that, by requesting and obtaining permission to voluntarily depart, the alien knowingly surrenders the opportunity to seek reopening.  See Brief for Respondent 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  Further, according to the Government, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule for tolling the voluntary departure period would undermine the \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully crafted rules governing voluntary departure,\xe2\x80\x9d including the statutory directive that these aliens leave promptly.  <em>Id.,</em> at 18, 46\xe2\x80\x9347.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, 8 U.

Further, \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7) does not forbid a scheme under which an alien knowingly relinquishes the right to seek reopening in exchange for other benefits, including those available to the alien under the voluntary departure statute.  That does not describe this case, however.  Nothing in the statutes or past usage with respect to voluntary departure or motions to reopen indicates they cannot coexist.  Neither \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7) nor \xc2\xa71229c(b)(2) says anything about the filing of a motion to reopen by an alien who has requested and been granted the opportunity to voluntarily depart.  And there is no other statutory language that would place the alien on notice of an inability to seek the case\xe2\x80\x99s reopening in the event of newly discovered evidence or changed circumstances bearing upon eligibility for relief.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reading a statute we must not \xe2\x80\x9clook merely to a particular clause,\xe2\x80\x9d but consider \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with it the whole statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kokoszka</em> v. <em>Belford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/642/index.html">417 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V) to pursue \xe2\x80\x9cone motion to reopen proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position that the alien is not entitled to pursue a motion to reopen if the alien agrees to voluntarily depart is unsustainable.  It would render the statutory right to seek reopening a nullity in most cases of voluntary departure.  (And this group is not insignificant in number; between 2002 and 2006, 897,267 aliens were found removable, of which 122,866, or approximately 13.7%, were granted voluntary departure.  See DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, FY 2006 Statistical Year Book, at Q\xc2\xa01 (Feb. 2007).)  It is foreseeable, and quite likely, that the time allowed for voluntary departure will expire long before the BIA issues a decision on a timely filed motion to reopen.  See Proposed Rules, DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 72 Fed. Reg. 67674, 67677, and n.\xc2\xa02 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cAs a practical matter, it is often the case that an immigration judge or the Board cannot reasonably be expected to adjudicate a motion to reopen or reconsider during the voluntary departure period\xe2\x80\x9d).  These practical limitations must be taken into account.  In the present case the BIA denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reopen 68 days after he filed the motion\xe2\x80\x94and 66 days after his voluntary departure period had expired.  Although the record contains no statistics on the average disposition time for motions to reopen, the number of BIA proceedings has increased over the last two decades, doubling between 1992 and 2000 alone; and, as a result, the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s backlog has more than tripled, resulting in a total of 63,763 undecided cases in 2000.  See Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP, Study Conducted for: the American Bar Association Commission on Immigration Policy, Practice and Pro Bono Re: Board of Immigration Appeals: Procedural Reforms to Improve Case Management 13 (2003), online at http://www.dorsey.\ncom/files/upload/DorseyStudyABA_8mgPDF.pdf.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since 2000, the BIA has adopted new procedures to reduce its backlog and shorten disposition times.  In 2002, the DOJ introduced rules to improve case management, including an increase in the number of cases referred to a single Board member and use of summary disposition procedures for cases without basis in law or fact.  See BIA: Procedural Reforms to Improve Case Management, 67 Fed. Reg. 54878 (2002), final rule codified at 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003 (2006); see also \xc2\xa71003.1(e)(4) (summary affirmance procedures).  Nevertheless, on September 30, 2005, there were 33,063 cases pending before the BIA, 18% of which were more than a year old.   See FY 2006 Statistical Year Book, <em>supra, </em>at U1.  On September 30, 2006, approximately 20% of the cases pending had been filed during fiscal year 2005.  See <em>ibid.</em>  Whether an alien\xe2\x80\x99s motion will be adjudicated within the 60-day statutory period in all likelihood will depend on pure happenstance\xe2\x80\x94namely, the backlog of the particular Board member to whom the motion is assigned.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/329/index.html">503 U. S. 329</a>, 334 (1992) (arbitrary results are \xe2\x80\x9cnot to be presumed lightly\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Absent tolling or some other remedial action by the Court, then, the alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis:  He or she can leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order; but, pursuant to regulation, the motion to reopen will be deemed withdrawn.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(d); see also 23 Fed. Reg. 9115, 9118, final rule codified at 8 CFR \xc2\xa73.2 (1958).  Alternatively, if the alien wishes to pursue reopening and remains in the United States to do so, he or she risks expiration of the statutory period and ineligibility for adjustment of status, the underlying relief sought.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (failure to timely depart renders alien \xe2\x80\x9cineligible, for a period of 10 years,\xe2\x80\x9d for cancellation of removal under \xc2\xa7240A, adjustment of status under \xc2\xa7245, change of nonimmigrant status under \xc2\xa7248, and registry under \xc2\xa7249 of the INA); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 3\xe2\x80\x934 (treating petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reopen as forfeited for failure to depart).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The purpose of a motion to reopen is to ensure a proper and lawful disposition.  We must be reluctant to assume that the voluntary departure statute was designed to remove this important safeguard for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by the same law.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71229c(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (barring aliens who have committed, <em>inter alia,</em> aggravated felonies or terrorism offenses from receiving voluntary departure); \xc2\xa71229c(b)(1)(B) (requiring an alien who obtains voluntary departure at the conclusion of removal proceedings to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9cgood moral character\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is particularly so when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation.  See <em>Costello</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/120/index.html">376 U.

Petitioner, as noted, proposes automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period during the pendency of the motion to reopen.  We do not find statutory authority for this result.  Voluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement.  In return for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she \xe2\x80\x9chas the means to depart the United States and intends to do so\xe2\x80\x9d promptly.  8 U.

Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period.

According to this proposal, there is nothing in the Act or the implementing regulations that makes the grant of voluntary departure irrevocable.  See 72 Fed. Reg. 67679.  Accordingly, the DOJ has proposed an amendment to 8 CFR \xc2\xa71240.26 that, prospectively, would \xe2\x80\x9cprovide for the automatic termination of a grant of voluntary departure upon the timely filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider, as long as the motion is filed prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period.\xe2\x80\x9d  72 Fed. Reg. 67679, Part IV\xe2\x80\x93D; cf. <em>id.,</em> at 67682, Part VI (\xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of this proposed rule will be applied prospectively only, that is, only with respect to immigration judge orders issued on or after the effective date of the final rule that grant a period of voluntary departure\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although not binding in the present case, the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s proposed interpretation of the statutory and regulatory scheme as allowing an alien to withdraw from a voluntary departure agreement \xe2\x80\x9cwarrants respectful consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs.</em> v. <em>Blumer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/473/index.html">534 U.

S. 504</a> (1994)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that, to safeguard the right to pursue a motion to reopen for voluntary departure recipients, the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary departure request before expiration of the departure period, without regard to the underlying merits of the motion to reopen.  As a result, the alien has the option either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the alien selects the latter option, he or she gives up the possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the IJ\xe2\x80\x99s alternate order of removal.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa71240.26(d).  The alien may be removed by the Department of Homeland Security within 90 days, even if the motion to reopen has yet to be adjudicated.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71231(a)(1)(A).  But the alien may request a stay of the order of removal, see BIA Practice Manual \xc2\xa76.3(a), online at http://\nwww.usdoj.gov/eoir/vll/qapracmanual/apptmtn4.htm; cf. 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that a removal order entered <em>in absentia </em>is stayed automatically pending a motion to reopen); and, though the BIA has discretion to deny the motion for a stay, it may constitute an abuse of discretion for the BIA to do so where the motion states nonfrivolous grounds for reopening.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though this interpretation still confronts the alien with a hard choice, it avoids both the quixotic results of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposal and the elimination of benefits to the Government that would follow from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s tolling rule.  Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, the rule we adopt does not alter the <em>quid pro quo </em>between the Government and the alien.  If withdrawal is requested prior to expiration of the voluntary departure period, the alien has not received benefits without costs; the alien who withdraws from a voluntary departure arrangement is in the same position as an alien who was not granted voluntary departure in the first instance.  Allowing aliens to withdraw from their voluntary departure agreements, moreover, establishes a greater probability that their motions to reopen will be considered.  At the same time, it gives some incentive to limit filings to nonfrivolous motions to reopen; for aliens with changed circumstances of the type envisioned by Congress in drafting \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) are the ones most likely to forfeit their previous request for voluntary departure in return for the opportunity to adjudicate their motions.  Cf. Supplemental Brief for Respondent 1\xe2\x80\x932 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is extraordinarily rare for an alien who has requested and been granted voluntary departure by the BIA to seek to withdraw from that arrangement within the voluntary departure period\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A more expeditious solution to the untenable conflict between the voluntary departure scheme and the motion to reopen might be to permit an alien who has departed the United States to pursue a motion to reopen postdeparture, much as Congress has permitted with respect to judicial review of a removal order.  See IIRIRA \xc2\xa7306(b), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93612 (repealing 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71105a(c) (1994 ed.), which prohibited an alien who \xe2\x80\x9cdeparted from the United States after the issuance of the order\xe2\x80\x9d to seek judicial review).  As noted previously, 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(d) provides that the alien\xe2\x80\x99s departure constitutes withdrawal of the motion to reopen.  This regulation, however, has not been challenged in these proceedings, and we do not consider it here.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner requested withdrawal of his motion for voluntary departure prior to expiration of his 30-day departure period.

This enables the alien to avoid detention pending involuntary deportation, to select his own country of destination, to leave according to his own schedule (within the prescribed period), and to avoid restrictions upon readmission that attend involuntary departure.  The statute specifies that the permission \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229c(b)(2), and that failure to depart within the prescribed period causes the alien to be ineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of status, for 10 years, \xc2\xa71229c(d)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  Moreover, pursuant to a regulation that the Court accepts as valid, departure (whether voluntary or involuntary) terminates the alien\xe2\x80\x99s ability to move for reopening of his removal proceeding, and withdraws any such motion filed before his departure.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(d) (2007).  All of these provisions were in effect when petitioner agreed to depart, and the Court cites no statute or regulation currently in force that permits an alien who has agreed voluntarily to depart to change his mind.  Yet the Court holds that petitioner must be permitted to renounce that agreement (the opinion dresses this up as \xe2\x80\x9cwithdraw[ing] the motion for voluntary departure\xe2\x80\x9d) provided the request is made before the departure period expires.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  That is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court says, to \xe2\x80\x9cpreserve the alien\xe2\x80\x99s right to pursue reopening,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, forfeiture of which was the known consequence of the departure he had agreed to.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s perceived \xe2\x80\x9cnecessity\xe2\x80\x9d does not exist, and the Court lacks the authority to impose its chosen remedy.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is resolute in its belief that there is a \xe2\x80\x9cconflict between the right to file a motion to reopen and the provision requiring voluntary departure no later than 60 days.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  The statute cannot be interpreted to put the alien to the choice of either (1) \xe2\x80\x9cremain[ing] in the United States to ensure [his] motion to reopen remains pending, while incurring statutory penalties for overstaying the voluntary departure date\xe2\x80\x9d or (2) \xe2\x80\x9cavoid[ing] penalties by prompt departure but abandon[ing] the motion to reopen.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This, according to the Court, would \xe2\x80\x9crender the statutory right to seek reopening a nullity in most cases of voluntary departure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  Indeed, the problem is of mythological proportions: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: He or she can leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order; but, pursuant to regulation, the motion to reopen will be deemed withdrawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  So certain is the Court of this premise that it is asserted no less than seven times during the course of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2, 13, 15\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The premise is false.  It would indeed be extraordinary (though I doubt it would justify a judicial rewrite) for a statute to impose that stark choice upon an alien: depart and lose your right to seek reopening, or stay and incur statutory penalties.  But that is <em>not </em>the choice this statute imposes.  It offers the alien a deal, if he finds it in his interest and wishes to take it: \xe2\x80\x9cAgree to depart voluntarily (within the specified period, of course) and you may lose your right to pursue reopening, but you will not suffer detention, you can depart at your own convenience rather than ours, and to the destination that you rather than we select, and you will not suffer the statutory restrictions upon reentry that accompany involuntary departure.  If you accept this deal, however, but do not live up to it\xe2\x80\x94if you fail to depart as promised within the specified period\xe2\x80\x94you will become ineligible for cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, and voluntary departure.\xe2\x80\x9d  Seems entirely reasonable to me.  Litigants are put to similar voluntary choices between the rock and the whirlpool all the time, without cries for a judicial rewrite of the law.  It happens, for example, whenever a criminal defendant is offered a plea bargain that gives him a lesser sentence than he might otherwise receive but deprives him of his right to trial by jury and his right to appeal.  It is indeed utterly commonplace that <em>electing</em> to pursue one avenue of relief may require the surrender of certain other remedies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner requested and accepted the above described deal, but now\xe2\x80\x94to put the point bluntly but entirely accurately\xe2\x80\x94he wants to back out.  The case is as simple as that.  Two days before the deadline for his promised voluntary departure, he filed a motion asking the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to reopen his removal proceedings and remand his case to the Immigration Judge for adjustment of status based on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s pending visa petition.  Administrative Record 3; see <em>id.</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9321.  The motion also asked the BIA to \xe2\x80\x9cwithdraw his request for voluntary departure\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinstead accep[t] an order of deportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 10.  After the voluntary departure period expired, the BIA denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reopen, explaining that under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229c(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), \xe2\x80\x9can alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure \xe2\x80\xa6 is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems to me that the BIA proceeded just as it should have, and just as petitioner had every reason to expect.  To be sure, the statute provides for the right to file (and presumably to have ruled upon in due course) a petition to reopen.  But it does not forbid the relinquishment of that right in exchange for other benefits that the BIA has discretion to provide.  Nor does it suggest any weird departure from the ancient rule that an offer (the offer to depart voluntarily in exchange for specified benefits, and with specified consequences for default) cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cwithdrawn\xe2\x80\x9d after it has been accepted and after the <em>quid pro quo</em> promise (to depart) has been made.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of this straightforward analysis is inconsistent with its treatment of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the statute requires automatic tolling of the voluntary departure period while a motion to reopen is pending.  With respect to that argument, the Court says:</p>\n<p align="left"> \xe2\x80\x9cVoluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement.  In return for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she \xe2\x80\x98has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so\xe2\x80\x99 promptly.  Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nPrecisely so.  But also among the substantive burdens is the inability to receive certain relief through a motion to reopen once the promised departure date has passed; and perhaps paramount among the substantive burdens is that the alien is <em>bound </em>to his agreement.  The Court is quite right that the Act does not allow us to require that an alien who agrees to depart voluntarily must receive the benefits of his bargain without the costs.  But why does it allow us to convert the alien\xe2\x80\x99s statutorily required promise to depart voluntarily into an \xe2\x80\x9coption either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  And why does it allow us to nullify the provision of \xc2\xa71229c(d)(1) that failure to depart within the prescribed and promised period causes the alien to be ineligible for certain relief, including adjustment of status (which is what petitioner seeks here) for 10 years?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course it is not unusual for the Court to blue-pencil a statute in this fashion, directing that one of its provisions, severable from the rest, be disregarded.  But that is done when the blue-penciled provision is <em>unconstitutional.  </em>It would be unremarkable, if the Court found that the alien had a constitutional right to reopen, and that conditioning permission for voluntary departure upon waiver of that right was an unconstitutional condition, for the Court to order that the alien cannot be held to his commitment.  But that is not the case here.  The Court holds that the plain requirement of the statute and of validly adopted regulations cannot be enforced <em>because the statute itself forbids it.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not so.  The Court derives this prohibition from its belief that an alien must, no matter what, be given the full benefit of the right to reopen, even if that means creating an extrastatutory option to renege upon the statutorily contemplated agreement to depart voluntarily.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe must be reluctant to assume,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court says, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the voluntary departure statute was designed to remove this important safeguard [of the motion to reopen],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly so when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  But in fact that safeguard is not sacrosanct.  The \xe2\x80\x9cplain text of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d does<em> cause</em> voluntary departure to remove that safeguard for at least 30 days of its 90-day existence, and <em>permits</em> voluntary departure to remove it almost entirely.  Section 1229a(c)(7) (2000 ed., Supp. V) generally permits the filing of a motion to reopen \xe2\x80\x9cwithin 90 days of \xe2\x80\xa6 entry of a final administrative order of removal.\xe2\x80\x9d  But as I have described, \xc2\xa71229c(b)(2) (2000 ed.) provides that a grant of voluntary departure issued at the conclusion of removal proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days.\xe2\x80\x9d  Since motions to reopen cannot be filed after removal or departure, the unquestionable effect of the statutory scheme is to deprive the alien who agrees to voluntary departure of the (sacrosanct) right to reopen for a full third of its existence.  And since 60 days is merely the maximum period for a voluntary departure, it is theoretically possible for the right to reopen to be limited to one week, or even one day.  Given that reality, it is not at all hard to believe that the statute allows nullification of motions to reopen requesting adjustment of status filed within the 60-day departure period and not ruled upon before departure.  Indeed, it seems to me much more likely that the statute allows that than that it allows judicial imposition of the unheard-of rule that a promise to depart is not a promise to depart, and judicial nullification of a statutorily prescribed penalty for failure to depart by the gimmick of allowing the request for voluntary departure to be \xe2\x80\x9cwithdrawn.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same analysis makes it true that, even under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reconstructed statute, a removable alien\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to depart voluntarily may limit, and in some instances foreclose, his ability to pursue a motion to reopen at a later date.  Even if the alien who has agreed to voluntary departure is permitted to renege within the specified departure period, that period can be no longer than 60 days after entry of the order of removal\xe2\x80\x94meaning that he has been deprived of at least 30 days of his right to reopen.  Thus, the Court has not \xe2\x80\x9creconciled\xe2\x80\x9d statutory provisions; it has simply rewritten two of them to satisfy its notion of sound policy\xe2\x80\x94the requirement of a commitment to depart and the prescription that a failure to do so prevents adjustment of status.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court suggests that the statute compels its conclusion because otherwise \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether an alien\xe2\x80\x99s motion will be adjudicated within the 60-day statutory period in all likelihood will depend on pure happenstance\xe2\x80\x94namely, the backlog of the particular Board member to whom the motion is assigned\xe2\x80\x9d and because \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary results are \xe2\x80\x98not to be presumed lightly.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  It is, however, a happenstance that the alien embraces when he makes his commitment to leave, and its effect upon him is therefore not arbitrary.  If he wants to be sure to have his motion to reopen considered, he should not enter into the voluntary departure agreement.  A reading of the statute that permits that avoidable happenstance seems to me infinitely more plausible than a reading that turns a commitment to depart into an option to depart.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the most problematic of all the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for allowing petitioner to withdraw his motion to depart voluntarily is its reliance on the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s (DOJ) as-yet-unadopted proposal that is in some respects (though not the crucial one) similar to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (citing Proposed Rules, DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 72 Fed. Reg. 67674, 67677, and n.\xc2\xa02 (2007)).  I shall assume that the proposed rule would be valid, even though it converts the statutory <em>requirement </em>of departure within the prescribed period (on pain of losing the right to seek adjustment of status) into an <em>option</em> to depart.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  According to the Court, the proposed regulation \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98warrants respectful consideration.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ante</em>, at 18.  What this evidently means is respectful adoption of that portion of the proposed regulation with which the Court agrees, and <em>sub silentio</em> rejection of that portion it disfavors, namely: \xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of this proposed rule will be applied \xe2\x80\xa6 only with respect to immigration judge orders issued on or after the effective date of the final rule that grant a period of voluntary departure,\xe2\x80\x9d 72 Fed.

Our administrative law jurisprudence is truly in a state of confused degeneration if this pick-and-choose technique constitutes \xe2\x80\x9crespectful\xe2\x80\x9d consideration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It must be acknowledged, however, that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s proposed regulation has some bearing upon this case: It demonstrates that the agency is actively considering whether the terms it has prescribed for its discretionary grants of voluntary departure are too harsh and should be revised for the future, perhaps along the very lines that the Justices in today\xe2\x80\x99s majority would choose if they were the Attorney General.  It shows, in other words, that today\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive gymnastics may have been performed, not for the enjoyment of innumerable aliens in the future, but for Mr. Dada alone.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the final analysis, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s entire approach to interpreting the statutory scheme can be summed up in this sentence from its opinion:  \xe2\x80\x9cAllowing aliens to withdraw from their voluntary departure agreements [\xc2\xa0] establishes a greater probability that their motions to reopen will be considered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  That is true enough.  What does not<em> </em>appear from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, however, is the source of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to increase that probability in flat contradiction to the text of the statute.  Just as the <em>Government</em> can (absent some other statutory restriction) relieve criminal defendants of their plea agreements for one reason or another, the <em>Government</em> may well be able to let aliens who have agreed to depart the country voluntarily repudiate their agreements.  This Court lacks such authority, and nothing in the statute remotely dictates the result that today\xe2\x80\x99s judgment decrees.

Moreover, the proposed rule, operating only prospectively, makes the ability to withdraw part of the deal that the alien accepts, and limits the alien\xe2\x80\x99s commitment accordingly.

He has argued only that the statute requires that he be allowed to withdraw.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962699">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n554 U.

S. ____ (2008)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 06-1181<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">SAMSON TAIWO DADA, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> MICHAEL B.\nMUKASEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[June 16, 2008]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito, dissenting.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case presents two questions: (1) \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether the filing of a motion to reopen removal proceedings automatically tolls the period within which an alien must depart \xe2\x80\xa6 under an order granting voluntary departure,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner i, and (2) \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether an alien who has been granted voluntary departure and has filed a timely motion to reopen should be permitted to withdraw the request for voluntary departure prior to the expiration of the departure period,\xe2\x80\x9d 552 U. S. ____ (2008).  I agree with the Court that the answer to the first question is no.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the second question, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning escapes me.  The Court holds as follows: \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Absent a valid regulation resolving the dilemma in a different way</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe appropriate way to reconcile the\xe2\x80\x9d relevant provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \xe2\x80\x9cis to allow an alien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2, 17 (emphasis added).  Thus, the Court apparently does not hold that the statute compels the Government to permit an alien to withdraw a request for voluntary departure, only that the statute permits that approach, a proposition with which I agree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the statute does not decide the question whether an alien should be permitted to withdraw a voluntary departure request, the authority to make that policy choice rests with the agency.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Smiley</em> v. <em>Citibank (South Dakota), N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/735/index.html">517 U. S. 735</a>, 740\xe2\x80\x93741 (1996) (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Department of Treasury, IRS</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/922/index.html">494 U. S. 922</a>, 932\xe2\x80\x93933 (1990) (refusing to sustain an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the ground that it was based on \xe2\x80\x9ca permissible (though not an inevitable) construction of [a] statute,\xe2\x80\x9d because the agency should define and adopt that construction \xe2\x80\x9cin the first instance\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, at the time of the decision in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) had the authority (a) to adopt the majority\xe2\x80\x99s automatic withdrawal rule (indeed, the agency has proposed a regulation to that effect, see <em>ante</em>, at 18), (b) to decide that withdrawal should be permitted in certain circumstances, which may or may not be present here, or (c) to hold that a motion to withdraw is never appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither the BIA nor the Fifth Circuit addressed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to withdraw, see <em>ante</em>, at 4, and therefore the ground for the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision is unclear.  I would affirm if the BIA either chose as a general matter not to permit the withdrawal of requests for voluntary departure or decided that permitting withdrawal was not appropriate under the facts of this case.  However, if the BIA rejected the withdrawal request on the ground that it lacked the statutory authority to permit it, the Board erred.  Because the ground for the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s decision is uncertain, I would vacate and remand.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
