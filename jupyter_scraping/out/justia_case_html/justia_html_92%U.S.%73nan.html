In April, 1866, John H. Surratt was a zouave in the military service of the Papal government, and the claimant was also a zouave in the same service.  During that month, he communicated to Mr. King, the American minister at Rome, the fact that he had discovered and identified Surratt, who had confessed to him his participation in the plot against the life of President Lincoln.  The claimant also subsequently communicated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 92 U.

Thereupon certain diplomatic correspondence passed between the government of the United States and the Papal government relative to the arrest and extradition of Surratt, and on the 6th November, 1866, the Papal government, at the request of the United States, ordered the arrest of Surratt and that he be brought to Rome, he then being at Veroli.  Under this order of the Papal government, Surratt was arrested, but, at the moment of leaving prison at Veroli, he escaped from the guard having him in custody and, crossing the frontier of the Papal territory, embarked at Naples and escaped to Alexandria in Egypt.  Immediately after his escape, and both before and after his embarkation at Naples, the American minister at Rome, being informed of the escape by the Papal government, took measures to trace and rearrest him, which was done in Alexandria.  From that place he was subsequently conveyed by the American government to the United States. but the American minister, having previously procured the discharge of the claimant from the Papal military service, sent him forward to Alexandria to identify Surratt.  At the time of the first interview between the claimant and the American minister, and at all subsequent times until the final capture of Surratt, they were ignorant of the fact that the reward offered by the Secretary of War for his arrest had been revoked by the President.  The discovery and arrest of Surratt were due entirely to the disclosures made by the claimant to the American minister at Rome, but the arrest was not made by the claimant, either at Veroli or subsequently at Alexandria.</p>\n<p>3.

JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We agree with the Court of Claims that the service rendered by the plaintiff\'s testator was not the apprehension of John H. Surratt, for which the War Department had offered a reward of $25,000, but giving information that conduced to the arrest.  These are quite distinct things, though one may have been a consequence of the other.  The proclamation of the Secretary of War treated them as different, and while a reward of $25,000 was offered for the apprehension, the offer for information was only a "liberal reward."  The findings of the Court of Claims also exhibit a clear distinction between making the arrest and giving the information that led to it.  It is found as a fact that the arrest was not made by the claimant, though the discovery and arrest were due entirely to the disclosures made by him.  The plain meaning of this is that Surratt\'s apprehension was a consequence of the disclosures made.  But the consequence of a man\'s act are not his acts.  Between the consequence and the disclosure that leads to it there may be, and in this case there were, intermediate agencies.  Other persons than the claimant made the arrest -- persons who were not his agents and who themselves were entitled to the proffered reward for his arrest if any persons were.  We think, therefore, that at most, the claimant was entitled to the "liberal reward" promised for information conducing to the arrest, and that reward he has received.</p>\n<p>But if this were not so, the judgment given by the Court of Claims is correct.</p>\n<p>The offer of a reward for the apprehension of Surratt was revoked on the twenty-fourth day of November, 1865, and notice of the revocation was published.  It is not to be doubted that the offer was revocable at any time before it was accepted and before anything had been done in reliance upon it.  There was no contract until its terms were complied with.  Like any other offer of a contract, it might therefore be withdrawn before rights had accrued under it, and it was withdrawn through the same channel in which it was made.  The same notoriety was given to the revocation that was given to the offer, and the findings of fact do not show that any information was given by the claimant or that he did anything to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="77">Page 92 U. S. 77</a></p><p> entitle him to the reward offered until five months after the offer had been withdrawn.  True, it is found that then and at all times until the arrest was actually made he was ignorant of the withdrawal, but that is an immaterial fact.  The offer of the reward not having been made to him directly, but by means of a published proclamation, he should have known that it could be revoked in the manner in which it was made.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
