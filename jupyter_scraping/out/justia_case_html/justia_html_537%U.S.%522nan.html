This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation. It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become "final" for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?</p><p>In accord with this Court\'s consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="525">525</a></p><p>court mandate as the triggering date. For the purpose of starting the clock on \xc2\xa7 2255\'s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court\'s affirmation of the conviction.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions. That court\'s mandate issued on December 15, 1998. See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals\' mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment). Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari. The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals\' judgment, see this Court\'s Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate court\'s mandate.</p><p>On February 22, 2000-one year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expired-Clay filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2255, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Congress has prescribed "[a] i-year period of limitation" for such motions "run[ning] from the latest of" four specified dates. \xc2\xa7 2255, ~ 6. Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, as in the generality of cases, is the first: "the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final." \xc2\xa7 2255, ~ 6(1).</p><p>Relying on Gendron v. United States, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/154/672/">154 F.3d 672</a>, 674 (CA7 1998) (per curiam), the District Court stated that "when a federal prisoner in this circuit does not seek certiorari ... , the conviction becomes \'final\' on the date the appellate court issues the mandate in the direct appeal."

That court declined Clay\'s "invitation to reconsider our holding in <i>Gendron," </i>although it acknowledged that <i>Gendron\'s </i>"construction of section 2255 represents the minority view." 30 Fed. Appx. 607, 609 (2002). "Bowing to <i>stare decisis," </i>the court expressed "reluctan[ce] to overrule [its own] recently-reaffirmed precedent without guidance from the Supreme Court." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The Fourth Circuit has agreed with <i>Gendron\'s </i>interpretation of \xc2\xa7 2255.

Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways with the Seventh and Fourth Circuits. These courts hold that, for federal prisoners like Clay who do not file petitions for certiorari following affirmance of their convictions, \xc2\xa7 2255\'s one-year limitation period begins to run when the defendant\'s time for seeking review by this Court expires.1 To secure uniformity in the application of \xc2\xa7 2255\'s time constraint, we granted certiorari, 536 U. S. 957 (2002), and now reverse the Seventh Circuit\'s judgment.2</p><p>1 See <i>Derman </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/298/34/">298 F.3d 34</a>, 39-42 (CA1 2002); <i>Kapral </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/166/565/">166 F.3d 565</a>, 567-577 (CA3 1999); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Gamble, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/208/536/">208 F.3d 536</a>, 537 (CA5 2000) <i>(per curiam); United States </i>v. <i>Garcia, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/210/1058/">210 F.3d 1058</a>, 1059-1061 (CA9 2000); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Burch, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/202/1274/">202 F.3d 1274</a>, 1275-1279 (CAW 2000); <i>Kaufmann </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/282/1336/">282 F.3d 1336</a>, 1337-1339 (CAll 2002).</p><p>2 Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts of appeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitioner Clay in urging that Clay\'s \xc2\xa7 2255 motion was timely filed.

Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment. See, <i>e. g., Quackenbush </i>v. <i>Allstate Ins. Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/517/706/case.html">517 U. S. 706</a>, 712 (1996); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa7 13, Comment <i>b </i>(1980). For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage. For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3161 <i>et seq., </i>and under a nowrepealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate court\'s mandate. See Brief for <i>Amicus Curiae </i>by Invitation of the Court 22-28 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases). For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, "[t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice)." This Court\'s Rule 13(3).</p><p>Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning:</p><p>Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires. See, <i>e. g., Caspari </i>v. <i>Bohlen, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/510/383/case.html">510 U. S. 383</a>, 390 <i>(1994); Griffith </i>v. <i>Kentucky, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/case.html">479 U.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1), which governs petitions for federal habeas corpus by state prisoners. See DeBruin Brief 8-20. Sections 2255 and 2244(d)(1), as now formulated, were reshaped by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101, 105, 110 Stat. 1217, 1220. Prior to that Act, no statute of limitations governed requests for federal habeas corpus or \xc2\xa7 2255 habeas-like relief. See <i>Vasquez </i>v. <i>Hillery, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/254/case.html">474 U.

Like \xc2\xa7 2255, \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1) establishes a one-year limitation period, running from the latest of four specified dates. Three of the four time triggers under \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1) closely track corresponding portions of \xc2\xa7 2255. Compare \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D) with \xc2\xa7 2255, ~~ 6(2)-(4). But where \xc2\xa7 2255, ~ 6(1), refers simply to "the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final," \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A) speaks of "the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review." 3</p><p>When "Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act," we have recognized, "it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion." <i>Russello </i>v. <i>United States, </i>464 U.

Invoking the maxim recited in <i>Russello, amicus </i>asserts that "becomes final" in \xc2\xa7 2255, ~ 6(1), cannot mean the same thing as "became final" in \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A); reading the two as synonymous, <i>amicus </i>maintains, would render superfluous the words "by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review" -words found only in the latter provision. DeBruin Brief 8-20. We can give effect to the discrete wording of the two prescriptions, <i>amicus </i>urges, if we adopt the following rule: When a convicted defendant does not seek certiorari on direct review, \xc2\xa7 2255\'s limitation period starts to run on the date the court of appeals issues its mandate. <i>Id., </i>at 36.4</p><p><i>Amicus </i>would have a stronger argument if \xc2\xa7 2255, ~ 6(1), explicitly incorporated the first of \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A)\'s finality formulations but not the second, so that the \xc2\xa7 2255 text read "becomes final <i>by </i>the conclusion of direct review." Had \xc2\xa7 2255 explicitly provided for the first of the two finality triggers set forth in \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A), one might indeed question the soundness of interpreting \xc2\xa7 2255 implicitly to incorporate \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A)\'s second trigger as well. As written, however, \xc2\xa7 2255 does not qualify "becomes final" at all. Using neither of the disjunctive phrases that follow the words "became final" in \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A), \xc2\xa7 2255 simply leaves "becomes final" undefined.</p><p><i>Russello, </i>we think it plain, hardly warrants the decision <i>amicus </i>urges, one that would hold the \xc2\xa7 2255 petitioner to</p><p>4 Although recognizing that "the question is not presented in this case," Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, <i>amicus </i>suggests that \xc2\xa72255\'s limitation period starts to run upon issuance of the court of appeals\' mandate even in cases in which the defendant does petition for certiorari. <i>Id., </i>at 27-28,36-38,4142. As <i>amicus </i>also recognizes, however, <i>id., </i>at 41, courts of appeals "have uniformly concluded that, if a prisoner petitions for certiorari, the contested conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either denies the writ or issues a decision on the merits," <i>United States </i>v. <i>Hicks, 283 </i>F. 3d 380, 387 (CADC 2002).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="530">530</a></p><p>a tighter time constraint than the petitioner governed by \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A). <i>Russello </i>concerned the meaning of a provision in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1961 <i>et seq., </i>that directed forfeiture to the United States of "any interest [a convicted defendant] has acquired ... in violation of [the Act]." \xc2\xa7 1963(a)(1). The petitioner in <i>Russello </i>urged a narrow construction of the unqualified words "any interest ... acquired." Rejecting that argument, we observed that a succeeding subsection, \xc2\xa7 1963(a)(2), reached "any interest in ... any enterprise" the defendant conducted in violation of RICO\'s proscriptions. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) At that point, we referred to the maxim invoked by <i>amicus. </i>See <i>supra, </i>at 528. The qualifying words "in ... any enterprise" narrowed \xc2\xa7 1963(a)(2), but in no way affected \xc2\xa7 1963(a)(1). The comparison of the two subsections, we said, "fortified" the broad construction we approved for the unmodified words "any interest ... acquired." <i>Russello, </i>464 U. S., at 22-23 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 23 ("Had Congress intended to restrict \xc2\xa7 1963(a)(1) to an interest in an enterprise, it presumably would have done so expressly as it did in the immediately following subsection (a)(2).").</p><p>Far from supporting the Seventh Circuit\'s constricted reading of \xc2\xa7 2255, ~ 6(1), <i>Russello\'s </i>reasoning tends in Clay\'s favor. An unqualified term-here "becomes final"-Rus<i>sello </i>indicates, calls for a reading surely no less broad than a pinpointed one-here, \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A)\'s specification "became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review."</p><p>Moreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief for Petitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 7-8, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of "final" in \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A) but not in \xc2\xa7 2255. Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners. In that context, a bare reference to "became final" might have suggested that finality assessments</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="531">531</a></p><p>should be made by reference to state-law rules that may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State. Cf. <i>Artuz </i>v. <i>Bennett, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/case.html">531 U. S. 4</a>, 8 (2000) (an application for state postconviction relief is <i>"properly </i>filed" for purposes of 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(2) "when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable [state] laws and rules governing filings"). The words "by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review" make it clear that finality for the purpose of \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A) is to be determined by reference to a uniform federal rule. Section 2255, however, governs only petitions by federal prisoners; within the federal system there is no comparable risk of varying rules to guard against.</p><p><i>Amicus </i>also submits that 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2263 "reinforces" the Seventh Circuit\'s understanding of \xc2\xa7 2255. DeBruin Brief 20; accord, <i>Torres, </i>211 F. 3d, at 840. Chapter 154 of Title 28 governs certain habeas petitions filed by deathsentenced state prisoners. Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from "final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review." That period is tolled, however, "from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review." \xc2\xa7 2263(b)(1).</p><p>We do not find in \xc2\xa7 2263 cause to alter our reading of \xc2\xa7 2255.</p><p>First, <i>amicus\' </i>reliance on \xc2\xa7 2263 encounters essentially the same problem as does his reliance on \xc2\xa7 2244(d)(1)(A): Section 2255, ~ 6(1), refers to <i>neither </i>of the two events that \xc2\xa7 2263(a) identifies as possible starting points for the limitation period-"affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review" and "the expiration of the time for seeking such review." Thus, reasoning by negative implication from \xc2\xa7 2263</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="532">532</a></p><p>does not justify the conclusion that \xc2\xa7 2255, ~ 6(1)\'s limitation period begins to run at one of those times rather than the other. Cf. <i>supra, </i>at 529-531. Second, \xc2\xa7 2263(a) ties the applicable limitation period to "affirmance of the conviction and sentence," while \xc2\xa7 2255, ~ 6(1), ties the limitation period to the date when "the judgment of conviction becomes final." See <i>Torres, </i>211 F. 3d, at 845 (Hamilton, J., dissenting). "The <i>Russello </i>presumption-that the presence of a phrase in one provision and its absence in another reveals Congress\' design-grows weaker with each difference in the formulation of the provisions under inspection." <i>Columbus </i>v. <i>Ours Garage </i>&amp; <i>Wrecker Service, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/536/424/case.html">536 U.

Under this rule, Clay\'s \xc2\xa7 2255 petition was timely filed.
