The <i>Martinez </i>Court did not purport to displace <i>Coleman </i>as the general rule governing procedural default.  Rather, it \xe2\x80\x9cqualifie[d] <i>Coleman</i> by recognizing a narrow exception,\xe2\x80\x9d 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 9, and made clear that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he rule of <i>Coleman </i>governs in all but th[ose] limited circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 16.  Applying <i>Martinez</i>\xe2\x80\x99s highly circumscribed, equitable exception to new categories of procedurally defaulted claims would do precisely what this Court disclaimed in that case<i>.</i>  P.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0<i>Martinez</i>\xe2\x80\x99s underlying rationale does not support extending its exception to appellate-ineffectiveness claims.  Petitioner argues that his situation is analogous to <i>Martinez, </i>where the Court expressed concern that trial-ineffectiveness claims might completely evade review.  The Court in <i>Martinez</i> made clear, however, that it exercised its equitable discretion in view of the unique importance of protecting a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s trial rights, particularly the right to effective assistance of trial counsel.  Declining to expand <i>Martinez</i> to the appellate-ineffectiveness context does no more than respect that judgment.  Nor is petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s rule required to ensure that meritorious claims of trial error receive review by at least one state or federal court\xe2\x80\x94<i>Martinez</i>\xe2\x80\x99s chief concern.  See 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 10, 12.  A claim of trial error, preserved by trial counsel but not raised by counsel on appeal, will have been addressed by the trial court.  If an unpreserved trial error was so obvious that appellate counsel was constitutionally required to raise it on appeal, then trial counsel likely provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise it at trial.  In that circumstance, the prisoner likely could invoke <i>Martinez </i>or <i>Coleman</i> to obtain review of trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to object.  Similarly, if the underlying, defaulted claim of trial error was ineffective assistance of trial counsel premised on something other than the failure to object, then <i>Martinez</i> and <i>Coleman</i> again already provide a vehicle for obtaining review of that error in most circumstances.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0The equitable concerns addressed in <i>Martinez</i> do not apply to appellate-ineffectiveness claims.  In <i>Martinez</i> and <i>Trevino</i>, the States deliberately chose to make postconviction process the only means for raising trial-ineffectiveness claims.  The Court determined that it would be inequitable to refuse to hear a defaulted claim when the State had channeled that claim to a forum where the prisoner might lack the assistance of counsel in raising it.  The States have not made a similar choice with respect to appellate-ineffectiveness claims\xe2\x80\x94nor could they, since such claims generally cannot be presented until after the termination of direct appeal.  The fact that appellate-ineffectiveness claims are considered in proceedings in which counsel is not constitutionally guaranteed is a function of the nature of the claim, not of the States\xe2\x80\x99 deliberate choices.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(4)\xc2\xa0The <i>Martinez</i> decision was also grounded in part on the belief that its narrow exception was unlikely to impose significant systemic costs.  See 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But adopting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed extension could flood the federal courts with defaulted appellate-ineffectiveness claims, and potentially serve as a gateway to federal review of a host of defaulted claims of trial error.  It would also aggravate the harm to federalism that federal habeas review of state convictions necessarily causes.  Not only would these burdens on the federal courts and federal system be severe, but the systemic benefit would be small, as claims heard in federal court solely by virtue of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule would likely be largely meritless.

A state prisoner may be able to overcome this bar, however, if he can establish \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d to excuse the procedural default and demonstrate that he suffered actual prejudice from the alleged error.  An attorney error does not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d to excuse a procedural default unless the error amounted to constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.  Because a prisoner does not have a constitutional right to counsel in state postconviction proceedings, ineffective assistance in those proceedings does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.

That exception treats ineffective assistance by a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s state postconviction counsel as cause to overcome the default of a single claim\xe2\x80\x94ineffective assistance of trial counsel\xe2\x80\x94in a single context\xe2\x80\x94where the State effectively requires a defendant to bring that claim in state postconviction proceedings rather than on direct appeal.

Petitioner conceded that he had failed to raise his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his state habeas petition, but argued that the failure was the result of his state habeas counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective assistance.  Petitioner invoked this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <i>Martinez </i>and <i>Trevino</i> to argue that his state habeas attorney\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective assistance provided cause to excuse the procedural default of his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa72254 petition.

First, a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies before presenting his claim to a federal habeas court.  \xc2\xa72254(b)(1)(A).  The exhaustion requirement is designed to avoid the \xe2\x80\x9cunseemly\xe2\x80\x9d result of a federal court \xe2\x80\x9cupset[ting] a state court conviction without\xe2\x80\x9d first according the state courts an \xe2\x80\x9copportunity to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. correct a constitutional violation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Rose </i>v. <i>Lundy</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 509,\n518 (1982)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, a federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state court\xe2\x80\x94that is, claims that the state court denied based on an adequate and independent state procedural rule.  <i>E.g., Beard </i>v. <i>Kindler</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 53,\n55 (2009)\n.  This is an important \xe2\x80\x9ccorollary\xe2\x80\x9d to the exhaustion requirement.  <i>Dretke </i>v. <i>Haley</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 386,\n392 (2004)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cJust as in those cases in which a state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State\xe2\x80\x99s procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address\xe2\x80\x9d the merits of \xe2\x80\x9cthose claims in the first instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Coleman</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 731\xe2\x80\x93732.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The procedural default doctrine thus advances the same comity, finality, and federalism interests advanced by the exhaustion doctrine.

See <i>Edwards </i>v. <i>Carpenter</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 446,\n451 (2000)\n.  An error amounting to constitutionally ineffective assistance is \xe2\x80\x9cimputed to the State\xe2\x80\x9d and is therefore external to the prisoner.  <i>Murray</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 488.

It follows, then, that in proceedings for which the Constitution does not guarantee the assistance of counsel at all, attorney error cannot provide cause to excuse a default.

We do not agree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The criminal trial enjoys pride of place in our criminal justice system in a way that an appeal from that trial does not.  The Constitution twice guarantees the right to a criminal trial, see Art. III, \xc2\xa72; Amdt. 6, but does not guarantee the right to an appeal at all, <i>Halbert </i>v. <i>Michigan</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 605,\n610 (2005)\n.  The trial \xe2\x80\x9cis the main event at which a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rights are to be determined,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>McFarland </i>v. <i>Scott</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 849,\n859 (1994)\n (internal quotation marks omitted), \xe2\x80\x9cand not simply a tryout on the road to appellate review,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Freytag </i>v. <i>Commissioner</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 868,\n895 (1991)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And it is where the stakes for the defendant are highest, not least because it is where a presumptively innocent defendant is adjudged guilty, see <i>Ross </i>v. <i>Moffitt</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600,\n610 (1974)\n; <i>Wainwright</i>, 433 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 90, and where the trial judge or jury makes factual findings that nearly always receive deference on appeal and collateral review, see <i>Jackson </i>v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n443 U.\xc2\xa0S. 307\n\xe2\x80\x93319 (1979); see also <i>Cavazos </i>v. <i>Smith</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n2 (2011)\n (<i>per curiam</i>) (under deferential standard of review, \xe2\x80\x9cjudges will sometimes encounter convictions that they believe to be mistaken, but that they must nevertheless uphold\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court in <i>Martinez </i>made clear that it exercised its equitable discretion in view of the unique importance of protecting a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s trial rights, particularly the right to effective assistance of trial counsel.  As the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe limited nature\xe2\x80\x9d of its holding \xe2\x80\x9creflect[ed] the importance of the right to the effective assistance of <i>trial</i> counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d which is \xe2\x80\x9ca bedrock principle in our justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 12, 16 (emphasis added).  In declining to expand the <i>Martinez </i>exception to the distinct context of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, we do no more than respect that judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s rule also is not required to ensure that meritorious claims of trial error receive review by at least one state or federal court\xe2\x80\x94the chief concern identified by this Court in <i>Martinez</i>.  See <i>id</i>., at 10, 12.  <i>Martinez</i> was concerned that a claim of trial error\xe2\x80\x94specifically, ineffective assistance of trial counsel\xe2\x80\x94might escape review in a State that required prisoners to bring the claim for the first time in state postconviction proceedings rather than on direct appeal.  Because it is difficult to assess a trial attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance until the trial has ended, a trial court ordinarily will not have the opportunity to rule on such a claim.  And when the State requires a prisoner to wait until postconviction proceedings to raise the claim, the appellate court on direct appeal also will not have the opportunity to review it.  If postconviction counsel then fails to raise the claim, no state court will ever review it.  Finally, because attorney error in a state postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse procedural default under <i>Coleman</i>, no federal court could consider the claim either.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, however, do not pose the same risk that a trial error\xe2\x80\x94of any kind\xe2\x80\x94will escape review altogether, at least in a way that could be remedied by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule.  This is true regardless of whether trial counsel preserved the alleged error at trial.  If trial counsel preserved the error by properly objecting, then that claim of trial error \xe2\x80\x9cwill have been addressed by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the trial court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Martinez</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 11.  A claim of appellate ineffectiveness premised on a preserved trial error thus does not present the same concern that animated the <i>Martinez</i> exception because at least \xe2\x80\x9cone court\xe2\x80\x9d will have considered the claim on the merits.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also <i>Coleman</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 755\xe2\x80\x93756.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If trial counsel failed to preserve the error at trial, then petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule ordinarily would not give the prisoner access to federal review of the error, anyway.  Effective appellate counsel should not raise every nonfrivolous argument on appeal, but rather only those arguments most likely to succeed.  <i>Smith </i>v.<i> Murray</i>,\n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 527,\n536 (1986)\n; <i>Jones </i>v.<i> Barnes</i>,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 745\n\xe2\x80\x93753 (1983).  Declining to raise a claim on appeal, therefore, is not deficient performance unless that claim was plainly stronger than those actually presented to the appellate court.  See <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Robbins</i>,\n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259,\n288 (2000)\n.  In most cases, an unpreserved trial error will not be a plainly stronger ground for appeal than preserved errors.  See 2 B. Means, Postconviction Remedies \xc2\xa735:19, p. 627, and n.\xc2\xa016 (2016).  Thus, in most instances in which the trial court did not rule on the alleged trial error (because it was not preserved), the prisoner could not make out a substantial claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and therefore could not avail himself of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s expanded <i>Martinez</i> exception.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Adopting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule<i> </i>would be unnecessary to ensure review of a claim of trial error even when a prisoner has a legitimate claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel based on something other than a preserved trial error.  If an unpreserved trial error was so obvious that appellate counsel was constitutionally required to raise it on appeal, then trial counsel likely provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to it in the first instance.  In that circumstance, the prisoner likely could invoke <i>Martinez</i> or <i>Coleman</i> to obtain review of trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to object.  Similarly, if the underlying, defaulted claim of trial error was ineffective assistance of trial counsel premised on something other than the failure to object, then <i>Martinez</i> and <i>Coleman </i>again<i> </i>already provide a vehicle for obtaining review of that error in most circumstances.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule is thus unnecessary for ensuring that trial errors are reviewed by at least one court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court in <i>Martinez </i>also<i> </i>was responding to an equitable consideration that is unique to claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and accordingly inapplicable to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  In <i>Martinez</i>, the State \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately cho[se] to move trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process, where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed,\xe2\x80\x9d into the postconviction review process, where we have never held that the Constitution guarantees a right to counsel.  566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 13; <i>id.,</i> at 9.  By doing so, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State significantly diminishe[d] prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 ability to file such claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 13.  Similarly, in <i>Trevino</i>,<i> </i>the State had chosen a procedural framework pursuant to which collateral review was, \xe2\x80\x9cas a practical matter, the onl[y] method for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although this Court acknowledged in <i>Martinez</i> that there was nothing inappropriate about the State\xe2\x80\x99s choice, it explained that the choice was \xe2\x80\x9cnot without consequences for the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to assert a procedural default\xe2\x80\x9d in subsequent federal habeas proceedings.  566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 13.  Specifically, the Court concluded that it would be inequitable to refuse to hear a defaulted claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel when the State had channeled that claim to a forum where the prisoner might lack the assistance of counsel in raising it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The States have not made a similar choice with respect to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\xe2\x80\x94nor could they.  By their very nature, such claims gener-ally cannot be presented until <i>after</i> the termination of direct appeal.  Put another way, they <i>necessarily</i> must be heard in collateral proceedings, where counsel is not constitutionally guaranteed.  The fact that claims of appellate ineffectiveness are considered in proceedings in which counsel is not constitutionally guaranteed is a function of the nature of the claim, not of the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberat[e] cho[ice] to move .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. claims outside of the direct-appeal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The equitable concerns raised in <i>Martinez </i>therefore do not apply.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, the Court in <i>Martinez</i> grounded its decision in part on the belief that its narrow exception was unlikely to impose significant systemic costs.  See <i>id.,</i> at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  The same cannot be said of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed extension.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Adopting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument could flood the federal courts with defaulted claims of appellate ineffectiveness.  For one thing, every prisoner in the country could bring these claims.  <i>Martinez</i> currently applies only to States that deliberately choose to channel claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel into collateral proceedings.  See, <i>e.g., Lee </i>v. <i>Corsini</i>, 777 F.\xc2\xa03d 46, 60\xe2\x80\x9361 (CA1 2015) (<i>Martinez</i> and <i>Trevino </i>do not apply to Massachusetts); <i>Henness </i>v. <i>Bagley</i>, 766 F.\xc2\xa03d 550, 557 (CA6 2014) (<i>Martinez</i> does not apply to Ohio).  If we applied <i>Martinez </i>to claims of appellate ineffectiveness, however, we would bring every State within <i>Martinez</i>\xe2\x80\x99s ambit, because claims of appellate ineffectiveness necessarily must be heard in collateral proceedings.  See <i>supra,</i> at 12.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Extending <i>Martinez </i>to defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel would be especially troublesome because those claims could serve as the gatewayto federal review of a host of trial errors, while <i>Martinez </i>covers only one trial error (ineffective assistance of trial counsel).  If a prisoner can establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel under <i>Martinez</i>, he ordinarily is entitled to a new trial.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Morrison</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 361\n\xe2\x80\x93365 (1981); see also <i>Hagens </i>v. <i>State</i>, 979 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 788, 792 (Tex. App. 1998).  But if he cannot, <i>Martinez </i>provides no avenue for litigating other defaulted trial errors.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An expanded <i>Martinez </i>exception, however, would mean that <i>any</i> defaulted trial error could result in a new trial.  In <i>Carpenter</i>, this Court held that, when a prisoner can show cause to excuse a defaulted claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, he can in turn rely on that claim as cause to litigate an underlying claim of trial error that was defaulted due to appellate counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness.  529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 453.  Expanding <i>Martinez</i> as petitioner suggests would thus produce a domino effect: Prisoners could assert their postconviction counsel\xe2\x80\x99s inadequacy as cause to excuse the default of their appellate ineffectiveness claims, and use those newly reviewable appellate ineffectiveness claims as cause to excuse the default of their underlying claims of trial error.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s rule thus could ultimately knock down the procedural barriers to federal habeas review of nearly any defaulted claim of trial error.  The scope of that review would exceed anything the <i>Martinez</i> Court envisioned when it established its narrow exception to <i>Coleman</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner insists that these concerns are overstated because many of the newly raised claims will be meritless.  See Brief for Petitioner 28.  But even if that were true, courts would still have to undertake the task of separating the wheat from the chaff.  And we are not reassured by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that extending <i>Martinez</i> would increase only the number of claims in each petition rather than the number of federal habeas petitions themselves.  Reply Brief 14.  Each additional claim would require the district court to review the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s trial record, appellate briefing, and state postconviction record to determine the claim\xe2\x80\x99s viability.  This effort could be repeated at each level of federal review.  We cannot \xe2\x80\x9cassume that these costs would be negligible,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Murray</i>, 477 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 487, and we are loath to further \xe2\x80\x9cburden .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. scarce federal judicial resources\xe2\x80\x9d in this way, <i>McCleskey</i>, 499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 491.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Expanding <i>Martinez</i> would not only impose significant costs on the federal courts, but would also aggravate the harm to federalism that federal habeas review necessarily causes.

That doctrine, like the federal habeas statute generally, is designed to ameliorate the injuries to state sovereignty that federal habeas review necessarily inflicts by giving state courts the first opportunity to address challenges to convictions in state court, thereby \xe2\x80\x9cpromoting comity, finality, and federalism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cullen </i>v. <i>Pinholster</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 170,\n185 (2011)\n; <i>McCleskey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 493.  Expanding the narrow exception announced in <i>Martinez</i> would unduly aggravate the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial costs on our federal system\xe2\x80\x9d that federal habeas review already imposes.  <i>Engle</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 128.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Not only would these burdens on the federal courts and our federal system be severe, but the benefit would\xe2\x80\x94as a systemic matter\xe2\x80\x94be small.  To be sure, permitting a state prisoner to bring a meritorious constitutional claim that could not otherwise be heard is beneficial to that prisoner.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel concedes, however, that relief is granted in, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f any, a very minute number\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cpost-conviction ineffective assistance of appellate counselcases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.

See <i>supra,</i> at 11.  Given that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule would likely generate high systemic costs and low systemic benefits, and that the unique concerns of <i>Martinez </i>are not implicated in cases like his, we do not think equity requires anexpansion of <i>Martinez</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit treats unexhausted claims as procedurally defaulted if \xe2\x80\x9cthe court to which the petitioner would be required to present his claims in order to meet the exhaustion requirement would now find the claims procedurally barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bagwell </i>v. <i>Dretke</i>, 372 F.\xc2\xa03d 748, 755 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. <i>Coleman</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 735, n.  Relying on this doctrine, the District Court concluded that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s federal claim was procedurally defaulted (even though a state court had never actually found it procedurally barred) because Texas law would likely bar a Texas court from deciding the claim on the merits if petitioner were to present it in a successive habeas petition.  <i>Davila </i>v. <i>Stephens</i>, 2015 WL 1808689, *19\xe2\x80\x93*20 (ND Tex., Apr. 21, 2015) (citing <i>Davila</i> v. <i>Stephens</i>, 2014 WL 5879879, *2 (ND Tex., Nov. 10, 2014)); see also <i>Davila </i>v. <i>Stephens</i>, 2014 WL 6057907, *2 (ND Tex., Nov. 10, 2014).

See <i>ante, </i>at 1 (the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise his federal claim at the initial-review state collateral proceeding amounts to an \xe2\x80\x9cadequate and independent state procedural ground\xe2\x80\x9d for denying habeas relief).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But there are equitable exceptions.  In <i>Martinez </i>v.<i> Ryan</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2012)\n, and later in <i>Trevino </i>v. <i>Thaler</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 413 (2013)\n, we held that, despite the presence of a procedural default, a federal court can nonetheless hear a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective, where (1) the framework of state procedural law \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 429; (2) in the state \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Martinez</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 17); and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cthe underlying ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say that the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has some merit,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i>at 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In my view, this same exception (with the same qualifications) should apply when a prisoner raises a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Evitts </i>v.<i> Lucey</i>,\n\n469 U.\xc2\xa0S. 387,\n396 (1985)\n (Constitution guarantees a defendant an effective appellate counsel, just as it guarantees a defendant an effective trial counsel).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Two simple examples help make clear why I believe <i>Martinez</i> and <i>Trevino</i> should govern the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Example One: Ineffective assistance of trial counsel</i>.  The prisoner claims that his trial lawyer was ineffective, say, because counsel failed to object to an obviously unfair jury selection, failed to point out that the prosecution had promised numerous benefits to its main witness in return for the witness\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, or failed to object to an erroneous jury instruction that made conviction and imposition of the death penalty far more likely.  Next suppose the prisoner appeals but, per state law, may not bring his ineffective-assistance claim until collateral review in state court (<i>i.e., </i>state habeas corpus), where the prisoner will have a better opportunity to develop his claim and the attorney will be better able to explain his (perhaps strategic) reasons for his actions at trial.  Suppose that, on collateral review, the prisoner fails to bring up his ineffective-assistance claim, perhaps because he is no longer represented by counsel or because his counsel there is ineffective.  Under these circumstances, if his ineffective-assistance claim is a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d one, <i>i.e., </i>it has \xe2\x80\x9csome merit,\xe2\x80\x9d then <i>Martinez</i> and <i>Trevino</i> hold that a federal court can hear the claim even though the state habeas court did not consider it.  See <i>Trevino</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 429; <i>Martinez</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 14.  The fact that the prisoner had no lawyer in the initial state habeas proceeding (or his lawyer in that proceeding was ineffective) constitutes grounds for excusing the procedural default.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Example Two: Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel</i>. Now suppose that a prisoner claims that the trial court made an important error of law, say, improperly instructing the jury, or that the prosecution engaged in misconduct.  He believes his lawyer on direct appeal should have raised those errors because they led to his conviction or (as here) a death sentence.  The appellate lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to do so, the prisoner might claim, amounts to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  The prisoner cannot make this argument on direct appeal, for the direct appeal is the very proceeding in which he is represented by the lawyer he says was ineffective.  Next suppose the prisoner fails to raise his appellate lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness at the initial state habeas proceeding, either because he was not represented by counsel in that proceeding or because his counsel there also was ineffective.  When he brings his case to the federal habeas court, the State contends that the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present his claim during the initial state habeas proceeding constitutes a procedural default that precludes federal review of his claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given <i>Martinez </i>and <i>Trevino</i>, the prisoner in the first example who complains about his trial counsel can overcome the procedural default but, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view today, the prisoner in the second example who complains about his appellate counsel cannot.  Why should the law treat the second prisoner differently?  Why should the Court not apply the rules of <i>Martinez</i> and <i>Trevino</i> to claims of ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel?</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As I have said, the Constitution applies similarly to both prisoners: It guarantees them effective assistance of counsel at both trial and during an initial appeal.  See <i>Strickland </i>v.<i> Washington</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668,\n686 (1984)\n (trial); <i>Evitts</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 396 (appeal).  Moreover, the reasoning of <i>Martinez</i> and <i>Trevino</i> applies similarly to both situations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Four features of the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel led the <i>Martinez</i> Court to its conclusion.  Each equally applies here.  First, the Court stressed the importance of the underlying constitutional right to effective assistance of trial counsel, describing it as \xe2\x80\x9ca bedrock principle in our justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  566 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 12.  Our cases make clear that the constitutional right to effective assistance of appellate counsel is also critically important.  The Court wrote in <i>Douglas </i>v.<i> California</i>,\n\n372 U.\xc2\xa0S. 353,\n357 (1963)\n, that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the merits of <i>the one and only appeal</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as of right are decided without benefit of counsel, we think an unconstitutional line has been drawn between rich and poor.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court held in <i>Evitts </i>that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] first appeal as of right .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not adjudicated in accord with due process of law if the appellant does not have the effective assistance of an attorney.\xe2\x80\x9d  469 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 396.  The Court added that \xe2\x80\x9cthe promise of <i>Gideon</i> [v. <i>Wainwright</i>,\n\n372 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335 (1963)\n,] that a criminal defendant has a right to counsel at trial .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would be a futile gesture unless it comprehended the right to the effective assistance of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 397.  And we stated in <i>Martinez</i> itself that \xe2\x80\x9cif the attorney appointed by the State to pursue the direct appeal is ineffective, the prisoner has been denied fair process.\xe2\x80\x9d  566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 11 (citing <i>Coleman </i>v. <i>Thompson</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722,\n754 (1991)\n; <i>Evitts</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 396; <i>Douglas</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 357\xe2\x80\x93358).  The fact that, according to Department of Justice statistics, nearly a third of convictions or sentences in capital cases are overturned at some stage of review suggests the practical importance of the appeal right, particularly in a capital case such as this one.  See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Capital Punishment, 2013\xe2\x80\x93Statistical Tables, p. 19, (rev. Dec. 2014) (Table 16); see also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, we pointed out in <i>Martinez</i> that the \xe2\x80\x9cinitial\xe2\x80\x9d state collateral review proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cis the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  566 U.\xc2\xa0S.,<i> </i>at 11.  We added that it \xe2\x80\x9cis in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s direct appeal as to the ineffective-assistance claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i> In <i>Trevino</i>, we applied <i>Martinez</i> despite the theoretical possibility that a prisoner might raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal.  We wrote that the State\xe2\x80\x99s procedural system denied prisoners a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d to bring ineffective-assistance claims on appeal; in effect, it required them to raise the claim for the first time in state collateral review proceedings.  569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 429.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This consideration applies <i>a fortiori</i> where the constitutional claim at issue is ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  The prisoner cannot raise that kind of claim in the very appeal in which he claims his counsel was ineffective.  See <i>Ha Van Nguyen </i>v.<i> Curry</i>, 736 F.\xc2\xa03d 1287, 1294\xe2\x80\x931295 (CA9 2013).  It makes no difference that the nature of the claim, rather than the State\xe2\x80\x99s express rule, makes that so.  See <i>Trevino</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 429 (extending <i>Martinez</i> where the \xe2\x80\x9cstate procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise\xe2\x80\x9d the claim on direct appeal); <i>Trevino, supra,</i> at 424 (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xc2\xa0<i>inherent nature</i> of most ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)); see also <i>Martinez</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, n.\xc2\xa01 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (There is no \xe2\x80\x9crelevant difference between cases in which the State <i>says</i> that certain claims can only be brought on collateral review and cases in which those claims <i>by their nature</i> can only be brought on collateral review\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, <i>Martinez</i> pointed out that, unless \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors in an initial-review collateral proceeding .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. establish cause to excuse the procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding, no court will review the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (majority opinion).  The same is true when the prisoner claims ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court argues to the contrary.  It says that at least one court\xe2\x80\x94namely, the trial court\xe2\x80\x94will have considered the underlying legal error.  <i>Ante, </i>at 11.  (If not, perhaps trial counsel was ineffective.)  But I believe the Court here misses the point.  The prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint is about the ineffectiveness of his appellate counsel.  That ineffectiveness could consist, for example, in counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to appeal 10 different erroneous decisions of the trial court.  The fact that the trial court made those decisions (assuming they are erroneous) does not help the prisoner.  To the contrary, it forms the basis of his ineffectiveness claim.  In the absence of a <i>Martinez</i>-like rule, the prisoner here (and prisoners in similar cases) would receive no review of their ineffective-assistance claims.  Moreover, there will be cases in which no court will consider the underlying trial error, either.  Suppose that, during the pendency of the appeal, appellate counsel learns of a <i>Brady </i>violation, juror misconduct, judicial bias, or some similar violation whose basis was not known during the trial.  See <i>Brady</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83 (1963)\n.  And suppose appellate counsel fails to pursue the claim in the manner prescribed by state law.  Without the exception petitioner here seeks, no court will hear either the appellate-ineffective-assistance claim or the underlying <i>Brady, </i>misconduct, or bias claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, the <i>Martinez</i> Court believed that its decision would \xe2\x80\x9cnot .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. put a significant strain on state resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 15.  That is because <i>Martinez</i> imposed limiting conditions: It excuses only those defaults that (1) occur at the initial-review collateral proceeding; (2) where prisoner had no counsel, or ineffective counsel, in that proceeding; and (3) where the underlying claim of ineffective assistance is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, has \xe2\x80\x9csome merit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 14\xe2\x80\x9316.  Moreover, as the Court pointed out, because many States provide prisoners with counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings (or at least when the prisoner seems to have a meritorious claim), it is unlikely that prisoners will default substantial ineffective-assistance claims.  See <i>id.,</i> at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (providing examples).  Finally, there is no evidence before us that <i>Martinez</i> has produced a greater-than-expected increase in courts\xe2\x80\x99 workload, even though <i>Martinez</i> applies, as Texas concedes, \xe2\x80\x9cin most States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It therefore seems unlikely that applying <i>Martinez</i> to ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims will \xe2\x80\x9cput a significant strain on\xe2\x80\x9d state or federal resources.  As I have said, the same limitations as the Court placed upon the assertion of a <i>Martinez </i>claim would apply here.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s fear of triggering federal second-guessing of many, if not all, trial errors is of no greater concern here than it was in <i>Martinez</i>, for both trial- and appellate-level ineffectiveness claims \xe2\x80\x9ccould serve as the gateway to federal review of a host of trial errors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 13.  Given a natural judicial hesitation to second-guess counsels\xe2\x80\x99 decisions, it is not surprising that we have no significant evidence of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance with \xe2\x80\x9csome merit\xe2\x80\x9d flooding the federal courts, either in respect to trial counsel (as in <i>Martinez</i>) or in respect to appellate counsel (as here).  See <i>Strickland</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 690\xe2\x80\x93691 (To prevail on an ineffective-assistance claim, the defendant must show that his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s actions \xe2\x80\x9cwere outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than strategic decisions to which the courtmust defer, and that those actions had an \xe2\x80\x9ceffect on the judgment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In fact, Texas has supplied some empirical evidence, but that evidence suggests that courts can manage a <i>Martinez </i>exception expanded to include claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  Texas says that in the Ninth Circuit, which has applied <i>Martinez</i> to ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims since late 2013, petitioners have used the expanded version of <i>Martinez</i> \xe2\x80\x9cin dozens\xe2\x80\x9d of federal habeas cases.  Brief for Respondent 37.  (Texas specifically refers to 10 cases, in only 1 of which the petitioner prevailed.  <i>Ibid.</i>, n.\xc2\xa013.)  During that period, state prisoners filed at least 7,500 federal habeas petitions in the Ninth Circuit.  See Ninth Circuit Ann. Rep. 71 (2015) (2,468 cases referred to magistrate judges in 2014; 2,693 in 2015).  Hence, Texas\xe2\x80\x99 estimate of added workload comes down to an increase of \xe2\x80\x9cdozens\xe2\x80\x9d of cases out of 7,500 cases in total.  That figure represents an increase, but not an increase significant enough to warrant depriving a prisoner of any forum to adjudicate a substantial claim that he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In my view, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s effort to distinguish <i>Martinez</i> comes down to the following points: (1) <i>Martinez</i> concerned only claims of ineffective trial counsel; (2) <i>Martinez</i> involved trial errors that, at least sometimes, would have escaped review, while here at least one court (the trial court) may have reviewed the underlying legal error; (3) <i>Martinez</i> involved cases in which the State itself pre-vented its appellate courts from reviewing the claim of trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness, whereas here it is the nature of the ineffectiveness claim that prevents the appellate courts from reviewing it; and (4) extending <i>Martinez</i> could flood the federal system with normally meritless claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I have explained why I believe the last mentioned empirical prediction does not distinguish <i>Martinez</i> and why, in any event, it is unlikely to prove correct.  See <i>supra</i>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  And I have explained why the second and third points do not successfully distinguish <i>Martinez</i>.  The second fails to focus on the relevant claim: ineffective assistance of counsel.  See <i>supra</i>, at 6.  And it fails to acknowledge that there may be cases in which the trial court will not have considered the legal error underlying the ineffective-assistance claim.  <i>Ibid.  </i>The third has little to do with the matter.  It overlooks the fact that there is no \xe2\x80\x9crelevant difference\xe2\x80\x9d between cases in which the State requires that certain claims be brought only on collateral review and \xe2\x80\x9ccases in which those claims <i>by their nature</i> can only be brought on collateral review,\xe2\x80\x9d such as claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  See <i>supra</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (quoting <i>Martinez</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S.,<i> </i>at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, n.\xc2\xa01 (Scalia, J., dissenting)).  In both cases, the State\xe2\x80\x99s scheme deprives a prisoner from having his substantial constitutional claim heard, through no fault of his own.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As to the first point, the Court is of course right.  <i>Martinez</i> had to do only with the ineffectiveness of trial counsel.  But our cases make clear that due process requires a criminal defendant to have effective assistance of appellate counsel as well.  See <i>supra</i>, at 4.  Indeed, effective trial counsel and appellate counsel are inextricably connected elements of a fair trial.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The basic legal principle that should determine the outcome of this case is the principle that requires courts to treat like cases alike.  To put the matter more familiarly, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  The dissent in <i>Martinez</i> wrote that there \xe2\x80\x9cis not a dime\xe2\x80\x99s worth of difference in principle between [ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel] cases and many other cases in which initial state habeas will be the first opportunity for a particular claim to be raised,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cclaims asserting ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 19 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  I agree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
