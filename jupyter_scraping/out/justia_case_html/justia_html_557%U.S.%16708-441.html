S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a).  At the close of trial, and over FBL\xe2\x80\x99s objections, the District Court instructed the jury to enter a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was demoted and his age was a motivating factor in the demotion decision, and told the jury that age was a motivating factor if it played a part in the demotion.  It also instructed the jury to return a verdict for FBL if it proved that it would have demoted Gross regardless of age.  The jury returned a verdict for Gross.  The Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly instructed under the standard established in <em>Price Waterhouse</em> v. <em>Hopkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/228/index.html">490 U. S. 228</a>, for cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse employment action because of both permissible and impermissible considerations\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed-motives\xe2\x80\x9d case.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A plaintiff bringing an ADEA disparate-treatment claim must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d cause of the challenged adverse employment action.  The burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because Title VII is materially different with respect to the relevant burden of persuasion, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as <em>Price Waterhouse</em> and<em> Desert Palace, Inc.</em> v. <em>Costa</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/90/index.html">539 U. S. 90</a>, 94\xe2\x80\x9395.  This Court has never applied Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s burden-shifting framework to ADEA claims and declines to do so now.  When conducting statutory interpretation, the Court \xe2\x80\x9cmust be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Federal Express Corp.</em> v. <em>Holowecki</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___.  Unlike Title VII, which has been amended to explicitly authorize discrimination claims where an improper consideration was \xe2\x80\x9ca motivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d for the adverse action, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) and 2000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(B), the ADEA does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor.  Moreover, Congress neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it added \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) and 2000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(B) to Title VII, even though it contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways.  When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally, see <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Arabian American Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/244/index.html">499 U. S. 244</a>, 256, and \xe2\x80\x9cnegative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\xe2\x80\x9d where the provisions were \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U.

The ordinary meaning of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that an employer took adverse action \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d age is that age was the \xe2\x80\x9creason\xe2\x80\x9d that the employer decided to act.  See <em>Hazen Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Biggins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/604/index.html">507 U. S. 604</a>, 610.  To establish a disparate-treatment claim under this plain language, a plaintiff must prove that age was the \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d cause of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s adverse decision.  See <em>Bridge</em> v. <em>Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co.</em>, 553 U. S. ___, ___.  It follows that under \xc2\xa7623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d cause.  This Court has previously held this to be the burden\xe2\x80\x99s proper allocation in ADEA cases, see, <em>e.g</em>.,<em> Kentucky Retirement Systems</em> v. <em>EEOC</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___, and nothing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text indicates that Congress has carved out an exception for a subset of ADEA cases.  Where a statute is \xe2\x80\x9csilent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe ordinary default rule [is] that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schaffer</em> v. <em>Weast</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/49/index.html">546 U. S. 49</a>, 56.  Hence, the burden of persuasion is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This Court rejects petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the proper interpretation of the ADEA is nonetheless controlled by <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, which initially established that the burden of persuasion shifted in alleged mixed-motives Title VII claims.  It is far from clear that the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question today in the first instance.  Whatever <em>Price Waterhouse</em>\xe2\x80\x99s deficiencies in retrospect, it has become evident in the years since that case was decided<em> </em>that its burden-shifting framework is difficult to apply.  The problems associated with its application have eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims.  Cf. <em>Continental T.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621 <em>et seq</em>.  Because we hold that such a jury instruction is never proper in an ADEA case, we vacate the decision below.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Jack Gross began working for respondent FBL Financial Group, Inc. (FBL), in 1971.  As of 2001, Gross held the position of claims administration director.  But in 2003, when he was 54 years old, Gross was reassigned to the position of claims project coordinator.  At that same time, FBL transferred many of Gross\xe2\x80\x99 job responsibilities to a newly created position\xe2\x80\x94claims administration manager.  That position was given to Lisa Kneeskern, who had previously been supervised by Gross and who was then in her early forties.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District Court opinion).  Although Gross (in his new position) and Kneeskern received the same compensation, Gross considered the reassignment a demotion because of FBL\xe2\x80\x99s reallocation of his former job responsibilities to Kneeskern.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 2004, Gross filed suit in District Court, alleging that his reassignment to the position of claims project coordinator violated the ADEA, which makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse action against an employee \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a).  The case proceeded to trial, where Gross introduced evidence suggesting that his reassignment was based at least in part on his age.  FBL defended its decision on the grounds that Gross\xe2\x80\x99 reassignment was part of a corporate restructuring and that Gross\xe2\x80\x99 new position was better suited to his skills.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District Court opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the close of trial, and over FBL\xe2\x80\x99s objections, the District Court instructed the jury that it must return a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that FBL \xe2\x80\x9cdemoted [him] to claims projec[t] coordinator\xe2\x80\x9d and that his \xe2\x80\x9cage was a motivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d in FBL\xe2\x80\x99s decision to demote him.  App. 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  The jury was further instructed that Gross\xe2\x80\x99 age would qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98motivating factor,\xe2\x80\x99 if [it] played a part or a role in [FBL]\xe2\x80\x99s decision to demote [him].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 10.  The jury was also instructed regarding FBL\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof.  According to the District Court, the \xe2\x80\x9cverdict must be for [FBL] \xe2\x80\xa6 if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that [FBL] would have demoted [Gross] regardless of his age.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The jury returned a verdict for Gross, awarding him $46,945 in lost compensation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FBL challenged the jury instructions on appeal.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly instructed under the standard established in <em>Price Waterhouse</em> v. <em>Hopkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/228/index.html">490 U. S. 228</a> (1989).  See 526 F.\xc2\xa03d 356, 358 (2008).  In <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, this Court addressed<em> </em>the proper allocation of the burden of persuasion in cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <em>et seq</em>., when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse employment action because of both permissible and impermissible considerations\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed-motives\xe2\x80\x9d case.  490 U. S., at 232, 244\xe2\x80\x93247 (plurality opinion).  The <em>Price Waterhouse </em>decision was splintered.  Four Justices joined a plurality opinion, see <em>id.</em>, at 231\xe2\x80\x93258, Justices White and O\xe2\x80\x99Connor separately concurred in the judgment, see <em>id.</em>, at 258\xe2\x80\x93261 (opinion of White, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 261\xe2\x80\x93279 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.), and three Justices dissented, see <em>id.</em>, at 279\xe2\x80\x93295 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  Six Justices ultimately agreed that if a Title VII plaintiff shows that discrimination was a \xe2\x80\x9cmotivating\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d factor in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s action, the burden of persuasion should shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the same action regardless of that impermissible consideration.  See <em>id.</em>, at 258 (plurality opinion); <em>id.</em>, at 259\xe2\x80\x93260 (opinion of White, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 276 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor further found that to shift the burden of persuasion to the employer, the employee must present \xe2\x80\x9cdirect evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [employment] decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 276.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In accordance with Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals identified Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion as controlling.  See 526 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 359 (citing <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Farmland Industries, Inc.</em>, 271 F.\xc2\xa03d 718, 724 (CA8 2001)).  Applying that standard, the Court of Appeals found that Gross needed to present \xe2\x80\x9c[d]irect evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.\xe2\x80\x9d  526 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, \xe2\x80\x9cdirect evidence\xe2\x80\x9d is only that evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cshow[s] a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Only upon a presentation of such evidence, the Court of Appeals held, should the burden shift to the employer \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to convince the trier of fact that it is more likely than not that the decision would have been the same absent consideration of the illegitimate factor.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 276 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals thus concluded that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jury instructions were flawed because they allowed the burden to shift to FBL upon a presentation of a preponderance of <em>any</em> category of evidence showing that age was a motivating factor\xe2\x80\x94not just \xe2\x80\x9cdirect evidence\xe2\x80\x9d related to FBL\xe2\x80\x99s alleged consideration of age.  See 526 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 360.  Because Gross conceded that he had not presented direct evidence of discrimination, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court should not have given the mixed-motives instruction.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Rather, Gross should have been held to the burden of persuasion applicable to typical, non-mixed-motives claims; the jury thus should have been instructed only to determine whether Gross had carried his burden of \xe2\x80\x9cprov[ing] that age was the determining factor in FBL\xe2\x80\x99s employment action.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties have asked us to decide whether a plaintiff must \xe2\x80\x9cpresent direct evidence of discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motive instruction in a non-Title VII discrimination case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  Before reaching this question, however, we must first determine whether the burden of persuasion ever shifts to the party defending an alleged mixed-motives discrimination claim brought under the ADEA.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner relies on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions construing Title VII for his interpretation of the ADEA.  Because Title VII is materially different with respect to the relevant burden of persuasion, however, these decisions do not control our construction of the ADEA.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Price Waterhouse</em>,<em> </em>a plurality of the Court and two Justices concurring in the judgment determined that once a \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff in a Title VII case proves that [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s membership in a protected class] played a motivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken [that factor] into account.\xe2\x80\x9d 490 U. S., at 258; see also <em>id.</em>, at 259\xe2\x80\x93260 (opinion of White, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 276 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  But as we explained in <em>Desert Palace, Inc.</em> v. <em>Costa</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/90/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/90/index.html">539 U. S. 90</a>, 94\xe2\x80\x9395 (2003), Congress has since amended Title VII by explicitly authorizing discrimination claims in which an improper consideration was \xe2\x80\x9ca motivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d for an adverse employment decision.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) (providing that \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was <em>a motivating factor</em> for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(B) (restricting the remedies available to plaintiffs proving violations of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has never held that this burden-shifting framework applies to ADEA claims.  And, we decline to do so now.   When conducting statutory interpretation, we \xe2\x80\x9cmust be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Federal Express Corp.</em> v. <em>Holowecki</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2).  Unlike Title VII, the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s text does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor.  Moreover, Congress neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it amended Title VII to add \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) and 2000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(B), even though it contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways, see Civil Rights Act of 1991, \xc2\xa7115, 105 Stat. 1079; <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7302, at 1088.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot ignore Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to amend Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the ADEA.  When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally.  See <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Arabian American Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/244/index.html">499 U. S. 244</a>, 256 (1991).  Furthermore, as the Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9cnegative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\xe2\x80\x9d when the provisions were \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 330 (1997).  As a result, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as <em>Desert Palace</em> and <em>Price Waterhouse</em>.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our inquiry therefore must focus on the text of the ADEA to decide whether it authorizes a mixed-motives age discrimination claim.  It does not.  \xe2\x80\x9cStatutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Engine Mfrs.

Thus, the ordinary meaning of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that an employer took adverse action \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d age is that age was the \xe2\x80\x9creason\xe2\x80\x9d that the employer decided to act.

For example, in cases tried to a jury, courts have found it particularly difficult to craft an instruction to explain its burden-shifting framework.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Tyler</em> v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp.</em>, 958 F.\xc2\xa02d 1176, 1179 (CA2 1992) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe murky water of shifting burdens in discrimination cases\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Visser</em> v. <em>Packer Engineering Associates, Inc.</em>, 924 F.\xc2\xa02d 655, 661 (CA7 1991) (en banc) (Flaum, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty judges have in formulating [burden-shifting] instructions and jurors have in applying them can be seen in the fact that jury verdicts in ADEA cases are supplanted by judgments notwithstanding the verdict or reversed on appeal more frequently than jury verdicts generally\xe2\x80\x9d).

The most natural reading of this statutory text prohibits adverse employment actions motivated in whole or in part by the age of the employee.

Not only did the Court reject the but-for standard in that case, but so too did Congress when it amended Title VII in 1991.  Given this unambiguous history, it is particularly inappropriate for the Court, on its own initiative, to adopt an interpretation of the causation requirement in the ADEA that differs from the established reading of Title VII.  I disagree not only with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute, but also with its decision to engage in unnecessary lawmaking.

In those non-mixed-motives ADEA cases, the Court followed the standards set forth in non-mixed-motives Title VII cases including <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/792/index.html">411 U.

This by no means indicates, as the majority reasons, that <em>mixed-motives</em> ADEA cases should follow those standards.  Rather, it underscores that ADEA standards are generally understood to conform to Title VII standards.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d an individual\xe2\x80\x99s age means that age was a motivating factor in an employment decision is bolstered by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 reaction to <em>Price Waterhouse</em> in the 1991 Civil Rights Act.  As part of its response to \xe2\x80\x9ca number of recent decisions by the United States Supreme Court that sharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness of [civil rights] laws,\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x9340, pt. 2, p.\xc2\xa02 (1991) (hereinafter H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.), Congress eliminated the affirmative defense to liability that <em>Price Waterhouse</em> had furnished employers and provided instead that an employer\xe2\x80\x99s same-decision showing would limit only a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s remedies.  See \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(B).  Importantly, however, Congress ratified <em>Price Waterhouse</em>\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof, rejecting the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion in that case that but-for causation was the proper standard.  See \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the 1991 Act amended only Title VII and not the ADEA with respect to mixed-motives claims, the Court reasonably declines to apply the amended provisions to the ADEA.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  But it proceeds to ignore the conclusion compelled by this interpretation of the Act: <em>Price Waterhouse</em>\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d remains the governing law for ADEA claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our recent decision in <em>Smith</em> v. <em>City of Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/228/index.html">544 U. S. 228</a>, 240 (2005), is precisely on point, as we considered in that case the effect of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to amend the disparate-impact provisions of the ADEA when it amended the corresponding Title VII provisions in the 1991 Act.  Noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII [but] did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d we held that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Wards Cove</em>\xe2\x80\x99s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.

S. 642</a> (1989)); see also <em>Meacham</em> v. <em>Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 15).  If the <em>Wards Cove </em>disparate-impact framework that Congress flatly repudiated in the Title VII context continues to apply to ADEA claims, the mixed-motives framework that Congress substantially endorsed surely applies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Curiously, the Court reaches the opposite conclusion, relying on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 partial ratification of <em>Price Waterhouse</em> to argue against that case\xe2\x80\x99s precedential value.  It reasons that if the 1991 amendments do not apply to the ADEA, <em>Price Waterhouse </em>likewise must not apply because Congress effectively codified <em>Price Waterhouse</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding in the amendments.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  This does not follow.  To the contrary, the fact that Congress endorsed this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d language in <em>Price Waterhouse</em> (even as it rejected the employer\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative defense to liability) provides all the more reason to adhere to that decision\xe2\x80\x99s motivating-factor test.  Indeed, Congress emphasized in passing the 1991 Act that the motivating-factor test was consistent with its original intent in enacting Title VII.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., pt. 2, at\xc2\xa017 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress made clear that it intended to prohibit all invidious consideration of sex, race, color, religion, or national origin in employment decisions\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 2 (stating that the Act \xe2\x80\x9creaffirm[ed] that any reliance on prejudice in making employment decisions is illegal\xe2\x80\x9d); see also H.\xc2\xa0R.

Because Congress has codified a mixed-motives framework for Title VII cases\xe2\x80\x94the vast majority of antidiscrimination lawsuits\xe2\x80\x94the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about that framework are of no moment.  Were the Court truly worried about difficulties faced by trial courts and juries, moreover, it would not reach today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, which will further complicate every case in which a plaintiff raises both ADEA and Title VII claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s resurrection of the but-for causation standard is unwarranted.  <em>Price Waterhouse </em>repudiated that standard 20 years ago, and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 response to our decision further militates against the crabbed interpretation the Court adopts today.<font b="1">  The answer to the question the Court has elected to take up\xe2\x80\x94whether a mixed-motives jury instruction is ever proper in an ADEA case\xe2\x80\x94is plainly yes.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court declines to address the question we granted certiorari to decide, I would answer that question by following our unanimous opinion in <em>Desert Palace, Inc.</em> v. <em>Costa</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/90/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/90/index.html">539 U.

Writing only for herself, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor argued that a plaintiff should be required to introduce \xe2\x80\x9cdirect evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that her sex motivated the decision before the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s mixed-motives framework would apply.  490 U.

S. 188</a>, 193 (1977), that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, \xe2\x80\x98the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike the cases <em>Marks</em> addressed, however, <em>Price Waterhouse </em>garnered five votes for a single rationale: Justice White agreed with the plurality as to the motivating-factor test, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, n. 3; he disagreed only as to the type of evidence an employer was required to submit to prove that the same result would have occurred absent the unlawful motivation.  Taking the plurality to demand objective evidence, he wrote separately to express his view that an employer\xe2\x80\x99s credible testimony could suffice.  490 U. S., at 261.

In construing the language of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), we reasoned that the statute did not mention, much less require, a heightened showing through direct evidence and that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has been unequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U.

Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, n.\xc2\xa04.  As with the 1991 amendments to Title VII, no language in the ADEA imposes a heightened direct evidence requirement, and we have specifically recognized the utility of circumstantial evidence in ADEA cases.  See <em>Reeves</em>, 530 U. S., at 147 (cited by <em>Desert Palace</em>, 539 U. S., at 99\xe2\x80\x93100).  Moreover, in <em>Hazen Paper Co.</em>, we held that an award of liquidated damages for a \xe2\x80\x9cwillful\xe2\x80\x9d violation of the ADEA did not require proof of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s motivation through direct evidence, 507 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Swierkiewicz</em> v. <em>Sorema N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/506/index.html">534 U.

FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.<br/>\n557 U.

And I join his opinion.  The Court rejects this conclusion on the ground that the words \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d require a plaintiff to prove that age was the \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d cause of his employer\xe2\x80\x99s adverse employment action.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  But the majority does not explain why this is so.  The words \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d do not inherently require a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d causation, and I see no reason to read them to require such a showing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is one thing to require a typical tort plaintiff to show \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d causation.  In that context, reasonably objective scientific or commonsense theories of physical causation make the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d causation comparatively easy to understand and relatively easy to apply.  But it is an entirely different matter to determine a \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d relation when we consider, not physical forces, but the mind-related characterizations that constitute motive.  Sometimes we speak of <em>determining</em> or <em>discovering </em>motives, but more often we <em>ascribe </em>motives, after an event, to an individual in light of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and other circumstances present at the time of decision.  In a case where we characterize an employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions as having been taken out of multiple motives, say, both because the employee was old and because he wore loud clothing, to apply \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d causation is to engage in a hypothetical inquiry about what would have happened if the employer\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and other circumstances had been different.  The answer to this hypothetical inquiry will often be far from obvious, and, since the employee likely knows less than does the employer about what the employer was thinking at the time, the employer will often be in a stronger position than the employee to provide the answer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All that a plaintiff can know for certain in such a context is that the forbidden motive did play a role in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  And the fact that a jury has found that age did play a role in the decision justifies the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cbecause,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e</em>., the employer dismissed the employee because of his age (and other things).  See <em>Price Waterhouse</em> v. <em>Hopkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/228/index.html">490 U. S. 228</a>, 239\xe2\x80\x93242 (1989) (plurality opinion).  I therefore would see nothing wrong in concluding that the plaintiff has established a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the law need not automatically assess liability in these circumstances.  In <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, the plurality recognized an affirmative defense where the defendant could show that the employee would have been dismissed regardless.  The law permits the employer this defense, not because the forbidden motive, age, had no role in the <em>actual </em>decision, but because the employer can show that he would have dismissed the employee anyway in the <em>hypothetical </em>circumstance in which his age-related motive was absent.  And it makes sense that this would be an affirmative defense, rather than part of the showing of a violation, precisely because the defendant is in a better position than the plaintiff to establish how he would have acted in this hypothetical situation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 242; cf. <em>ante</em>, at 6 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (describing the Title VII framework).  I can see nothing unfair or impractical about allocating the burdens of proof in this way.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The instruction that the District Court gave seems appropriate and lawful.
