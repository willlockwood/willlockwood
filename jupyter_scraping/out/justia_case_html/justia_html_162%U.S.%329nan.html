Trial by jury was waived, and the case tried by the court.  The material facts appeared by the record to have been as follows:</p>\n<p>The company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois in 1867.

On November 16, 1872, a decree was entered in that suit setting aside the contract between Reeve and the company, ordering an accounting between them, ordering the company to issue to the subscribers certificates for as may shares as they were entitled to by the money paid, directing the President and secretary to call a meeting of the company to choose a new board of directors, reserving leave to the plaintiffs at any time to apply for such further order or decree as should be necessary to carry out this decree or be necessary in the cause and ordering the individual defendants to pay the costs of the suit.</p>\n<p>On January 7, 1873, those costs were paid, and on January 29, 1873, a meeting of the company was held and a new board of directors chosen, and a certificate for twenty-seven and a half shares was issued to Purdy.</p>\n<p>The following proceedings were afterwards had in that cause:</p>\n<p>"On September 19, 1874, other stockholders, by leave of the court, intervened, and filed a \'supplemental bill\' against the company and its officers alleging mismanagement and fraud on the part of the new officers and the insolvency of the company and praying for the appointment of a receiver.

By that decree, all the objects of the suit were accomplished so far as Purdy was concerned, and he does not appear to have had any notice of, or part in, any further proceedings.  That bill did not ask for the appointment of a receiver or for any order of assessment upon stockholders.</p>\n<p>The subsequent proceeding, begun September 19, 1874, alleging mismanagement and fraud of the new officers and the insolvency of the company, was by other stockholders, and, although entitled a "supplemental bill," and permitted by the court to be filed in the former cause, was a distinct proceeding in which Purdy had and took no interest.  The orders of the court upon this proceeding, appointing on October </p><p><a class="page-number" name="336">Page 162 U. S. 336</a></p><p> 7, 1874, a receiver, and on July 10, 1886, making a "call or assessment" upon the stockholders of the company, were entered without any notice to him or consent on his part. He was not personally a party to this proceeding nor named therein.  The receiver was appointed almost two years, and the assessment ordered more than thirteen years, after Purdy had ceased to have any connection with the litigation.</p>\n<p>There can be no doubt that, as heretofore declared by this Court,</p>\n<p>"after a decree disposing of the issues and in accordance with the prayer of a bill has been made, it is the prayer of a bill has been made, it is not competent for one of the parties, without a service of new process or appearance, to institute further proceedings on new issues and for new objects, although connected with the subject matter of the original litigation, by merely giving the new proceedings the title of the original cause.  If his bill begins a new litigation, the parties against whom he seeks relief are entitled to notice thereof, and without it they will not be bound."</p>\n<p><em>Smith v. Woolfolk,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/115/143/case.html">115 U.

S. 148</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The question, therefore, is of the effect, as against Purdy, of the order for an assessment made by the Illinois court in a proceeding to which the corporation was a party, but to which he personally was not.</p>\n<p>The order of that court was, in effect, as it was in terms, simply a "call or assessment" upon all stockholders who had not paid for their shares in full.  It was such as the directors might have made before the appointment of a receiver, and in making it, the court, having by that appointment assumed the charge of the assets and affairs of the corporation, took the place and exercised the office of the directions.  <em>Scoville v.

Those founded on a judgment of a court of record, whether of this or of any other of the United States, or of the federal courts of the United States, within twenty years."</p>\n<p>Code Iowa, 1873, \xc2\xa7 2529.</p>\n<p>This action was not brought on a judgment, for there had been no judgment.  But it was brought on the defendant\'s written contract of subscription, and was therefore by the terms of the Iowa statute, barred in ten years after the cause of action accrued.  The action was brought more than ten years after the contract, but within ten years after the order of assessment.</p>\n<p>In many jurisdictions the cause of action, within the meaning of a statute of limitations, would be held to have accrued at the time of the order for an assessment, and not before.  It has been so held by the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois, where this company was incorporated, and the order of assessment made, as well as by this Court in cases coming up from circuit courts of the United States, and unaffected by decisions of the highest court of the state in which those courts were held.  <em>Great Western Tel. Co. v. Gray, Hawkins v. Glenn, Glenn v. Liggett,</em> and <em>Glenn v. Marbury,</em> above cited.</p>\n<p>But the Supreme Court of Iowa in the present case held that, as it rested with the directors of the corporation to make that order, the delay in making it could not suspend the operation of the statute of limitations, and that the case was within the rule, established by a series of decisions of that court, that when a plaintiff could at any time, by making a demand, or giving a notice, acquire a right to recover against the defendant, the statute of limitations began to run when he might have done so.  <em>Great Western Tel. Co. v. Purdy,</em> 83 Ia. 430, 433, and cases cited. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="339">Page 162 U. S. 339</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The limitation of actions is governed by the <em>lex fori,</em> and is controlled by the legislation of the state in which the action is brought, as construed by the highest court of that state, even if the legislative act or the judicial construction differs from that prevailing in other jurisdictions.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/312/case.html">McElmoyle v.
