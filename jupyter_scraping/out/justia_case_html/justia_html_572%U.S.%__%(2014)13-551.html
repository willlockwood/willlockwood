TOLAN v. JEFFREY WAYNE COTTON</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">No. 13\xe2\x80\x93551.\xe2\x80\x83Decided May 5, 2014</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Per Curiam.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        During the early morning hours of New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, 2008, police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at Robert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punctured Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s right lung.  At the time of the shooting, Tolan was unarmed on his parents\xe2\x80\x99 front porch about 15 to 20 feet away from Cotton.  Tolan sued, alleging that Cotton had exercised excessive force in violation of the\n \nFourth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate any clearly established right.  713 F. 3d 299 (2013).  In articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth Circuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 242,\n255 (1986)\n.  For that reason, we vacate its decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The following facts, which we view in the light most favorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and the opinions below.  At around 2:00 on the morning of December 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on patrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan sport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential street.  The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of the street in front of a house.  Two men exited: Tolan and his cousin, Anthony Cooper.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of the vehicle into a computer in his squad car.  But he keyed an incorrect character; instead of entering plate number 696BGK, he entered 695BGK.  That incorrect number matched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make.  This match caused the squad car\xe2\x80\x99s computer to send an automatic message to other police units, informing them that Edwards had found a stolen vehicle.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and ordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground.  He accused Tolan and Cooper of having stolen the car.  Cooper responded, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 1295.  And Tolan explained, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my car.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Tolan then complied with the officer\xe2\x80\x99s demand to lie face-down on the home\xe2\x80\x99s front porch.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home where Tolan lived with his parents.  Hearing the commotion, Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s parents exited the front door in their paja-mas.  In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from escalating into something more, Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s father instructed Cooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to say nothing.  Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Edwards told Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s parents that he believed Tolan and Cooper had stolen the vehicle.  In response, Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s father identified Tolan as his son, and Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother explained that the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime had been committed.  Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s father explained, with his hands in the air, \xe2\x80\x9c[T]his is my nephew.  This is my son.  We live here.  This is my house.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 2059.  Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother similarly offered, \xe2\x80\x9c[S]ir this is a big mistake.  This car is not stolen. .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. That\xe2\x80\x99s our car.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 2075.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground in silence, Edwards radioed for assistance.  Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and drew his pistol.  Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and Tolan had exited a stolen vehicle.  Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother reiter-ated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan had been driving and the home where these events were unfolding.  Cotton then ordered her to stand against the family\xe2\x80\x99s garage door.  In response to Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s order, Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother asked, \xe2\x80\x9c[A]re you kidding me?  We\xe2\x80\x99ve lived her[e] 15 years.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve never had anything like this happen before.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 2077; see also id., at 1465.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The parties disagree as to what happened next.  Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother and Cooper testified during Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s criminal trial[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] that Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the garage door with such force that she fell to the ground.  Id., at 2035, 2078\xe2\x80\x932080.  Tolan similarly testified that Cotton pushed his mother against the garage door.  Id., at 2479.  In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother and photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton used enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back that lasted for days.  Id., at 2078\xe2\x80\x932079, 2089\xe2\x80\x932091.  By contrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he was escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her arm up and told him to get his hands off her.  Id., at 1043.  He also testified that he did not know whether he left bruises but believed that he had not.  Id., at 1044.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan responded.  Tolan testified in his deposition and during the criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being pushed, id., at 1249, he rose to his knees, id., at 1928.  Edwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.  Id., at 1051\xe2\x80\x931052, 1121.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from roughly 15 to 20 feet away, 713 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 303, \xe2\x80\x9c[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 1928.  The parties also agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three shots at Tolan.  Tolan and his mother testified that these shots came with no verbal warning.  Id., at 2019, 2080.  One of the bullets entered Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s chest, collapsing his right lung and piercing his liver.  While Tolan survived, he suffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding professional baseball career and causes him to experience pain on a daily basis.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s parents filed this suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  Tolan claimed, among other things, that Cotton had used excessive force against him in violation of the\n \nFourth Amendment.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  After discovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment, arguing that the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the suit.  That doctrine immunizes government officials from damages suits unless their conduct has violated a clearly established right.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton.  854 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 444 (SD Tex. 2012).  It reasoned that Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s use of force was not unreasonable and therefore did not violate the\n \nFourth Amendment.  Id., at 477\xe2\x80\x93478.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, but on a different basis.  713 F.\xc2\xa03d 299.  It declined to decide whether Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s actions violated the\n \nFourth Amendment.  Instead, it held that even if Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s conduct did violate the\n \nFourth Amendment, Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate a clearly established right.  Id., at 306.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by noting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, \xe2\x80\x9cit was .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. clearly established that an officer had the right to use deadly force if that officer harbored an objective and reasonable belief that a suspect presented an \xe2\x80\x98immediate threat to [his] safety.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 306 (quoting Deville v. Marcantel, 567 F. 3d 156, 167 (CA5 2009)).  The Courtof Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome the qualified-immunity bar because \xe2\x80\x9can objectively-reasonable officer in Sergeant Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s position could have .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. believed\xe2\x80\x9d that Tolan \xe2\x80\x9cpresented an \xe2\x80\x98immediate threat to the safety of the officers.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  713 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 307.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  In support of this conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the front porch had been \xe2\x80\x9cdimly-lit\xe2\x80\x9d; Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother had \xe2\x80\x9crefus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm\xe2\x80\x9d; and Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s words had amounted to a \xe2\x80\x9cverba[l] threa[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Most critically, the court also relied on the purported fact that Tolan was \xe2\x80\x9cmoving to intervene in\xe2\x80\x9d Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s handling of his mother, id., at 305, and that Cotton therefore could reasonably have feared for his life, id., at 307.  Accord-ingly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly established law in shooting Tolan.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  538 Fed. Appx. 374 (2013).  Three judges voted to grant rehearing.  Judge Dennis filed a dissent, contending that the panel opinion \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] to address evidence that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, creates genuine issues of material fact as to whether an objective officer in Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s position could have reasonably and objectively believed that [Tolan] posed an immediate, significant threat of substantial injury to him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 377.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In resolving questions of qualified immunity at summary judgment, courts engage in a two-pronged inquiry.  The first asks whether the facts, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. show the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated a [federal] right[.]\xe2\x80\x9d  Saucier v. Katz,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194,\n201 (2001)\n.  When a plaintiff alleges excessive force during an investigation or arrest, the federal right at issue is the\n \nFourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures.  Graham v. Connor,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 386,\n394 (1989)\n.  The inquiry into whether this right was violated requires a balancing of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Tennessee v. Garner,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n8 (1985)\n; see Graham, supra, at 396.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis asks whether the right in question was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the violation.  Hope v. Pelzer,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 730,\n739 (2002)\n.  Governmental actors are \xe2\x80\x9cshielded from liability for civil damages if their actions did not violate \xe2\x80\x98clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he salient question .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is whether the state of the law\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of an incident provided \xe2\x80\x9cfair warning\xe2\x80\x9d to the defendants \xe2\x80\x9cthat their alleged [conduct] was unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 741.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n         Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to engage these two prongs.  Pearson v. Callahan,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223,\n236 (2009)\n.  But under either prong, courts may not resolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary judgment.  See Brosseau v. Haugen,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194,\n195, n.\n2 (2004)\n (per curiam); Saucier, supra, at 201; Hope, supra, at 733, n.\xc2\xa01.  This is not a rule specific to qualified immunity; it is simply an application of the more general rule that a \xe2\x80\x9cjudge\xe2\x80\x99s function\xe2\x80\x9d at summary judgment is not \xe2\x80\x9cto weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Anderson, 477 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 249.  Summary judgment is appropriate only if \xe2\x80\x9cthe movant shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a).  In making that determination, a court must view the evidence \xe2\x80\x9cin the light most favorable to the opposing party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co.,\n\n398 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144,\n157 (1970)\n; see also Anderson, supra, at 255.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our qualified-immunity cases illustrate the importance of drawing inferences in favor of the nonmovant, even when, as here, a court decides only the clearly-established prong of the standard.  In cases alleging unreasonable searches or seizures, we have instructed that courts should define the \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d right at issue on the basis of the \xe2\x80\x9cspecific context of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Saucier, supra, at 201; see also Anderson v. Creighton,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 635\n\xe2\x80\x93641 (1987).  Accordingly, courts must take care not to define a case\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontext\xe2\x80\x9d in a manner that imports genuinely disputed factual propositions.  See Brosseau, supra, at 195, 198 (inquiring as to whether conduct violated clearly established law \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in light of the specific contextof the case\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and construing \xe2\x80\x9cfacts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in a light most favorable to\xe2\x80\x9d the nonmovant).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In holding that Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s actions did not violate clearly established law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to Tolan with respect to the central facts of this case.  By failing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key factual conclusions, the court improperly \xe2\x80\x9cweigh[ed] the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d and resolved disputed issues in favor of the moving party, Anderson, 477 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 249.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the shooting, the Tolans\xe2\x80\x99 front porch was \xe2\x80\x9cdimly-lit.\xe2\x80\x9d  713 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 307.  The court appears to have drawn this assessment from Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s statements in a deposition that when he fired at Tolan, the porch was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fairly dark,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and lit by a gas lamp that was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98decorative.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 302.  In his own deposition, however, Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s father was asked whether the gas lamp was in fact \xe2\x80\x9cmore decorative than illuminating.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 1552.  He said that it was not.  Ibid.  Moreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two floodlights shone on the driveway during the incident, id.,at 2496, and Cotton acknowledged that there were two motion-activated lights in front of the house.  Id., at 1034.  And Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot in darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 2498\xe2\x80\x932499.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother \xe2\x80\x9crefus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby \xe2\x80\x9ccompound[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s belief that Tolan \xe2\x80\x9cpresented an immediate threat to the safety of the officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  713 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 307 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, too, the court did not credit directly contradictory evidence.  Al-though the parties agree that Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother repeatedly informed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in the home in front of which he had parked, and that the vehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her husband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this information.  Cotton stated during his deposition that Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother was \xe2\x80\x9cvery agitated\xe2\x80\x9d when she spoke to the officers.  Record 1032\xe2\x80\x931033.  By contrast, Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother testified at Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s criminal trial that she was neither \xe2\x80\x9caggravated\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cagitated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 2075, 2077.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was \xe2\x80\x9cshouting,\xe2\x80\x9d 713 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 306, 308, and \xe2\x80\x9cverbally threatening\xe2\x80\x9d the officer, id., at 307, in the moments before the shooting.  The court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton was grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton, \xe2\x80\x9c[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 1928.  But Tolan testified that he \xe2\x80\x9cwas not screaming.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 2544.  And a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in context, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict harm.  Cf. United States v. White, 258 F. 3d 374, 383 (CA5 2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cA threat imports \xe2\x80\x98[a] communicated intent to inflict physical or other harm\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990))); Morris v. Noe, 672 F.\xc2\xa03d 1185, 1196 (CA10 2012) (inferring that the words \xe2\x80\x9cWhy was you talking to Mama that way\xe2\x80\x9d did not constitute an \xe2\x80\x9covert threa[t]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s mother testified in Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s criminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door with enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days.  Record 2078\xe2\x80\x932079.  A jury could well have concluded that a reasonable officer would have heard Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s words not as a threat, but as a son\xe2\x80\x99s plea not to continue any assault of his mother.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was \xe2\x80\x9cmoving to intervene in Sergeant Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d interaction with his mother.  713 F.\xc2\xa03d, at305; see also id., at 308 (characterizing Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s behavioras \xe2\x80\x9cabruptly attempting to approach Sergeant Cotton,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby \xe2\x80\x9cinflam[ing] an already tense situation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The court appears to have credited Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 account that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a crouch\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9ccharging position\xe2\x80\x9d looking as if he was going to move forward.  Record 1121\xe2\x80\x931122.  Tolan testified at trial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot him, id., at 1928, a fact corroborated by his mother, id., at 2081.  Tolan also testified in his deposition that he \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 2502, and emphasized that he did not \xe2\x80\x9cjump up,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 2544.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that the court below credited the evidence of the party seeking summary judgment and failed properly to acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing that motion.  And while \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court is not equipped to correct every perceived error coming from the lower federal courts,\xe2\x80\x9d Boag v. MacDougall\n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364,\n366 (1982)\n (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring),  we intervene here because the opinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards in light of our precedents.  Cf. Brosseau, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 197\xe2\x80\x93198 (summarily reversing decision in a\n \nFourth Amendment excessive force case \xe2\x80\x9cto correct a clear misapprehension of the qualified immunity standard\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn.,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 147,\n150 (1981)\n (per curiam) (summarily reversing an opinion that could not \xe2\x80\x9cbe reconciled with the principles set out\xe2\x80\x9d in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity jurisprudence).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their own perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases.  It is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are generally resolved by juries in our adversarial system.  By weighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences contrary to Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s competent evidence, the court below neglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at the summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Applying that principle here, the court should have acknowledged and credited Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s evidence with regardto the lighting, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor, whether he shouted words that were an overt threat, and his positioningduring the shooting.  This is not to say, of course, that these are the only facts that the Fifth Circuit should consider, or that no other facts might contribute to the reasonableness of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s actions as a matter of law.  Nor do we express a view as to whether Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s actions vio-lated clearly established law.  We instead vacate the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment so that the court can determine whether, when Tolan\xe2\x80\x99s evidence is properly credited and factual inferences are reasonably drawn in his favor, Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s actions violated clearly established law.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The petition for certiorari and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund\xe2\x80\x99s motion to file an amicus curiae brief are granted.

It grants the petition for a writ of certiorari, and it summarily vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The granting of a petition for plenary review is not a decision from which Members of this Court have customarily registered dissents, and I do not do so here.  I note, however, that the granting of review in this case sets a precedent that, if followed in other cases, will very substantially alter the Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice.  See, e.g., this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cA petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted when the asserted error consists of erroneous factual findings or the misapplication of a properly stated rule of law\xe2\x80\x9d); S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E. Hartnett, &amp; D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice \xc2\xa75.12(c)(3), p. 352 (10th ed. 2013) (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]rror correction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is outside the mainstream of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s functions and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not among the \xe2\x80\x98compelling reasons\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that govern the grant of certiorari\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In my experience, a substantial percentage of the civil appeals heard each year by the courts of appeals present the question whether the evidence in the summary judgment record is just enough or not quite enough to support a grant of summary judgment.  The present case falls into that very large category.  There is no confusion in the courts of appeals about the standard to be applied in ruling on a summary judgment motion, and the Court of Appeals invoked the correct standard here.  See 713 F.\xc2\xa03d 299, 304 (CA5 2013).  Thus, the only issue is whether the relevant evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is sufficient to support a judgment for that party.  In the courts of appeals, cases presenting this question are utterly routine.  There is no question that this case is important for the parties, but the same is true for a great many other cases that fall into the same category.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On the merits of the case, while I do not necessarily agree in all respects with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the evidence, I agree that there are genuine issues of material fact and that this is a case in which summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I therefore concur in the judgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
