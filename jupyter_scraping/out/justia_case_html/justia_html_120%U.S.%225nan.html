The court below overruled a demurrer to the answer and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case was argued upon the question of limitation.  But we have no occasion to consider that question, for it does not appear that the circuit court had jurisdiction of the action.  Unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record, the presumption upon writ of error or appeal is that the court below was without jurisdiction.  <em>Robertson v. Cease,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/97/646/case.html">97 U. S. 646</a></span>; <em>Grace v. American Central Ins. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/109/278/case.html#283">109 U. S. 283</a></span>; <em>Boers v. Preston,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/252/case.html">111 U. S. 252</a></span>.  That the point as to jurisdiction was not made here by either party is immaterial, because, as said in <em>Mansfield &amp;c. Railway Co. v. Swan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/379/case.html#382">111 U. S. 382</a></span>,</p>\n<p>"The rule, springing from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the united states, is inflexible and without exception which requires this Court of its own motion to deny its own jurisdiction, and, in the exercise of its appellate power, that of all other courts of the United States in all cases where such jurisdiction does not affirmatively appear in the record on which, in the exercise of that power, it is called to act.  On every writ of error or appeal, the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction -- first of this Court and then of the court from which the record comes."</p>\n<p><em>See also Hancock v. Holbrook,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/112/229/case.html#231">112 U. S. 231</a></span>.  The Act of March 3, 1875, \xc2\xa7 1, excludes from the cognizance of a circuit or district court of the United States</p>\n<p>"any suit founded on contract in favor of an assignee unless a suit might </p><p><a class="page-number" name="227">Page 120 U. S. 227</a></p><p> have been prosecuted in such court to recover thereon if no assignment had been made, except in cases of promissory notes, negotiable by the law merchant, and bills of exchange."</p>\n<p>One of the warrants is payable to Z. King and the other to Z. King or order.  The latter is not endorsed by him in blank or to the order of the plaintiff.  Plainly, therefore, upon any view of the statute, the plaintiff, as the holder or owner of the warrants, could not maintain a suit in the court below unless King could have sued in that court had he not sold the warrants.  But it does not appear that King could have maintained the suit.  There is no averment as to his citizenship, nor does his citizenship otherwise appear from the record.  We must therefore presume, on this writ of error, that the circuit court was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>It will be for the court below to determine whether an amendment of the pleadings upon the point of jurisdiction will be proper.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff in error must pay the costs in this Court.  <em>Peper v. Fordyce,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/469/case.html">119 U. S. 469</a></span>\' <em>Everhart v.
