So far as the statute or the indictment requires, or the testimony shows, she was voluntarily living the life of a prostitute, and was only furnished a place by the defendants to follow her degraded life.  While the keeping of a house of ill fame is offensive to the moral sense, yet that fact must not close the eye to the question whether the power to punish therefor is delegated to Congress or is reserved to the state.  Jurisdiction over such an offense comes within the accepted definition of the police power.

By \xc2\xa7 2 of Article II of the Constitution, power is given to the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, but there is no suggestion in the record or in the briefs of a treaty with the King of Hungary under which this legislation can be supported.</p>\n<p>The general power which exists in the nation to control the coming in or removal of aliens is relied upon, the government stating in its brief these two propositions:</p>\n<p>"The clause in question should be held valid because it relates to and materially affects the conditions upon which an alien female may be permitted to remain in this country, and the grounds which warrant her exclusion."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The validity of the provision in question should be determined from its general effect upon the importation and exclusion of aliens."</p>\n<p>But it is sufficient to say that the act charged has no significance in either direction.</p>\n<p>As to the suggestion that Congress has power to punish one assisting in the importation of a prostitute, it is enough to say that the statute does not include such a charge; the indictment does not make it, and the testimony shows, without any contradiction, that the woman Irene Bodi came to this country in November, 1905; that she remained in New York until October, 1907; then came to Chicago, and went into the house of prostitution which the defendants purchased in November, 1907, finding the woman then in the house; that she had been in the business of a prostitute only about ten or eleven months prior to the trial of the case in October, 1908, and that the defendants did not know her until November, 1907.  In view of those facts, the question of the power of Congress to punish </p><p><a class="page-number" name="148">Page 213 U. S. 148</a></p><p> those who assist in the importation of a prostitute is entirely immaterial.</p>\n<p>The act charged is only one included in the great mass of personal dealings with aliens.  It is her own character and conduct which determine the question of exclusion or removal.  The acts of others may be evidence of her business and character.  But it does not follow that Congress has the power to punish those whose acts furnish evidence from which the government may determine the question of her expulsion.  Every possible dealing of any citizen with the alien may have more or less induced her coming.  But can it be within the power of Congress to control all the dealings of our citizens with resident aliens?  If that be possible, the door is open to the assumption by the national government of an almost unlimited body of legislation.  By the census of 1900 the population of the United States between the oceans was, in round numbers, 76,000,000.  Of these, 10,000,000 were of foreign birth, and 16,000,000 more were of foreign parentage.  Doubtless some have become citizens by naturalization, but certainly scattered through the country there are millions of aliens.  If the contention of the government be sound, whatever may have been done in the past, however little this field of legislation may have been entered upon, the power of Congress is broad enough to take cognizance of all dealings of citizens with aliens.  That there is a moral consideration in the special facts of this case, that the act charged is within the scope of the police power, is immaterial, for, as stated, there is in the Constitution no grant to Congress of the police power.  And the legislation must stand or fall according to the determination of the question of the power of Congress to control generally dealings of citizens with aliens.  In other words, an immense body of legislation, which heretofore has been recognized as peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the states, may be taken by Congress away from them.  Although Congress has not largely entered into this field of legislation, it may do so, if it has the power.  Then we should be brought face to face with such a change in the internal conditions of this country </p><p><a class="page-number" name="149">Page 213 U. S. 149</a></p><p> as was never dreamed of by the framers of the Constitution.  While the acts of Congress are to be liberally construed in order to enable it to carry into effect the powers conferred, it is equally true that prohibitions and limitations upon those powers should also be fairly and reasonably enforced.  <em>Fairbank v.

S. 452</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/452/case.html#454">211 U. S. 454</a></span>.  If a woman were found living in a house of prostitution within a week of her arrival, no one, I suppose, would doubt that it tended to show that she was in the business when she arrived.  But how far back such an inference shall reach is a question of degree, like most of the questions of life.  And while a period of three years seems to be long, I am not prepared to say, against the judgment of Congress, that it is too long.</p>\n<p>The statute does not state the legal theory upon which it was enacted.  If the ground is that which I have suggested, it is fair </p><p><a class="page-number" name="150">Page 213 U. S. 150</a></p><p> to observe that the presumption that it creates is not open to rebuttal.  I should be prepared to accept even that, however, in view of the difficulty of proof in such cases.  Statutes of which the justification must be the same are familiar in the states.  For instance, one creating the offense of being present when gaming implements are found, <em>Commonwealth v. Smith,</em> 166 Mass. 370, 375-376, or punishing the sale of intoxicating liquors without regard to knowledge of their intoxicating quality, <em>Commonwealth v. Hallett,</em> 103 Mass. 452, or throwing upon a seducer the risk of the woman turning out to be married or under a certain age, <em>Commonwealth v. Elwell,</em> 2 Met.190.  It is true that, in such instances, the legislature has power to change the substantive law of crimes, and it has been thought that, when it is said to create a conclusive presumption as to a really disputable fact, the proper mode of stating what it does at least, as a general rule, is to say that it has changed the substantive law.  2 Wigmore, Ev. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1353 <em>et seq.</em>  This may be admitted without denying that considerations of evidence are what lead to the change. And if it should be thought more philosophical to express this law in substantive terms, I think that Congress may require, as a condition of the right to remain, good behavior for a certain time in matters deemed by it important to the public welfare and of a kind that indicates a preexisting habit that would have excluded the party if it had been known.  Therefore I am of opinion that it is within the power of Congress to order the deportation of a woman found practicing prostitution within three years.</p>\n<p>If Congress can forbid the entry and order the subsequent deportation of professional prostitutes, it can punish those who cooperate in their fraudulent entry.  "If Congress has power to exclude such laborers . . . , it has the power to punish any who assist in their introduction."  That was a point decided in <em>Lees v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/150/476/case.html">150 U. S. 476</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/150/476/case.html#480">150 U. S. 480</a></span>.  The same power must exist as to cooperation in an equally unlawful stay.  The indictment sets forth the facts that constitute such cooperation, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="151">Page 213 U. S. 151</a></p><p> and need not allege the conclusion of law.  On the principle of the cases last cited, in order to make its prohibition effective, the law can throw the burden of finding out the fact and date of a prostitute\'s arrival from another country upon those who harbor her for a purpose that presumably they know, in any event, to be contrary to law.  Therefore, while I have admitted that the time fixed seems to me to be long, I can see no other constitutional objection to the act, and, as I have said, I think that that one ought not to prevail.</p>\n<p>MR.
