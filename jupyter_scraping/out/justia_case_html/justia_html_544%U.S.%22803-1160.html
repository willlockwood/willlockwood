CITY OF JACKSON<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">SMITH et al. <em>v.</em> CITY OF JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, et al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x931160.Argued November 3, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 30, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">In revising its employee pay plan, respondent City granted raises to all police officers and police dispatchers in an attempt to bring their starting salaries up to the regional average.  Officers with less than five years\xe2\x80\x99 service received proportionately greater raises than those with more seniority, and most officers over 40 had more than five years of service.  Petitioners, a group of older officers, filed suit under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their age.  The District Court granted the City summary judgment.  Affirming, the Fifth Circuit ruled that disparate-impact claims are categorically unavailable under the ADEA, but it assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under <em>Griggs</em> v. <em>Duke Power Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/424/index.html">401 U. S. 424</a>, which announced a disparate-impact theory of recovery for cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed. </p>\n<p align="left">351 F.\xc2\xa03d 183, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, concluding:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The ADEA authorizes recovery in disparate-impact cases comparable to <em>Griggs.</em>  Except for the substitution of \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\xe2\x80\x9d the language of ADEA \xc2\xa74(a)(2) and Title VII \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) is identical.  Unlike Title VII, however, ADEA \xc2\xa74(f)(1) significantly narrows its coverage by permitting any \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d action \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age\xe2\x80\x9d (hereinafter RFOA provision).  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Petitioners have not set forth a valid disparate-impact claim.  Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make clear that the disparate-impact theory\xe2\x80\x99s scope is narrower under the ADEA than under Title VII.  One is the RFOA provision.  The other is the amendment to Title VII in the Civil Right Act of 1991, which modified this Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Wards Cove Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Atonio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/index.html">490 U. S. 642</a>, holding that narrowly construed the scope of liability on a disparate-impact theory.  Because the relevant 1991 amendments expanded Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s coverage but did not amend the ADEA or speak to age discrimination, <em>Wards Cove</em>\xe2\x80\x99s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to limit the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s coverage by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s protected classifications, not uncommonly has relevance to an individual\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  Here, petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger ones.  They have not, as required by <em>Wards Cove,</em> identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers.  Further, the record makes clear that the City\xe2\x80\x99s plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for the differential between older and younger workers was its perceived need to make junior officers\xe2\x80\x99 salaries competitive with comparable positions in the market.  Thus, the disparate impact was attributable to the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give raises based on seniority and position.  Reliance on these factors is unquestionably reasonable given the City\xe2\x80\x99s goal.

Their suit raises the question whether the \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate-impact\xe2\x80\x9d theory of recovery announced in <em>Griggs</em> v. <em>Duke Power Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/424/index.html">401 U. S. 424</a> (1971), for cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, is cognizable under the ADEA.  Despite the age of the ADEA, it is a question that we have not yet addressed.  See <em>Hazen Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Biggins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/604/index.html"></a><a href="/us/507/604/index.html">507 U.

S. 945</a> (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 1, 1998, the City adopted a pay plan granting raises to all City employees.  The stated purpose of the plan was to \xe2\x80\x9cattract and retain qualified people, provide incentive for performance, maintain competitiveness with other public sector agencies and ensure equitable compensation to all employees regardless of age, sex, race and/or disability.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On May 1, 1999, a revision of the plan, which was motivated, at least in part, by the City\xe2\x80\x99s desire to bring the starting salaries of police officers up to the regional average, granted raises to all police officers and police dispatchers.  Those who had less than five years of tenure received proportionately greater raises when compared to their former pay than those with more seniority.  Although some officers over the age of 40 had less than five years of service, most of the older officers had more.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are a group of older officers who filed suit under the ADEA claiming both that the City deliberately discriminated against them because of their age (the \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate-treatment\xe2\x80\x9d claim) and that they were \xe2\x80\x9cadversely affected\xe2\x80\x9d by the plan because of their age (the \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate-impact\xe2\x80\x9d claim).  The District Court granted summary judgment to the City on both claims.  The Court of Appeals held that the ruling on the former claim was premature because petitioners were entitled to further discovery on the issue of intent, but it affirmed the dismissal of the disparate-impact claim.  351 F.\xc2\xa03d 183 (CA5 2003). Over one judge\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, the majority concluded that disparate-impact claims are categorically unavailable under the ADEA.  Both the majority and the dissent assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under the reasoning of <em>Griggs.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted the officers\xe2\x80\x99 petition for certiorari, 541 U. S. ___ (2004), and now hold that the ADEA does authorize recovery in \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate-impact\xe2\x80\x9d cases comparable to <em>Griggs</em>.  Because, however, we conclude that petitioners have not set forth a valid disparate-impact claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the deliberations that preceded the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress considered and rejected proposed amendments that would have included older workers among the classes protected from employment discrimination.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cline,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/581/index.html">540 U. S. 581</a>, 587 (2004).  Congress did, however, request the Secretary of Labor to \xe2\x80\x9cmake a full and complete study of the factors which might tend to result in discrimination in employment because of age and of the consequences of such discrimination on the economy and individuals affected.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7715, 78 Stat. 265.  The Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s report, submitted in response to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 request, noted that there was little discrimination arising from dislike or intolerance of older people, but that \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d discrimination did result from certain age limits.  Report of the Secretary of Labor, The Older American Worker: Age Discrimination in Employment 22 (June 1965), reprinted in U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Legislative History of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (1981) (hereinafter Wirtz Report).  Moreover, the report observed that discriminatory effects resulted from \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nstitutional arrangements that indirectly restrict the employment of older workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 15.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to that report Congress directed the Secretary to propose remedial legislation, see Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, Pub. L. 89\xe2\x80\x93601, \xc2\xa7606, 80 Stat. 845, and then acted favorably on his proposal.  As enacted in 1967, \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the ADEA, now codified as 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(2), provided that it shall be unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\x9cto limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any </p>\n<p align="left">way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  81 Stat. 603.  Except for substitution of the word \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d for the words \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\xe2\x80\x9d the language of that provision in the ADEA is identical to that found in \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).  Other provisions of the ADEA also parallel the earlier statute.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Unlike Title VII, however, \xc2\xa74(f)(1) of the ADEA, 81 Stat. 603, contains language that significantly narrows its coverage by permitting any \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d action \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age\xe2\x80\x9d (hereinafter RFOA provision).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In determining whether the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact claims, we begin with the premise that when Congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes, particularly when one is enacted shortly after the other, it is appropriate to presume that Congress intended that text to have the same meaning in both statutes.  <em>Northcross</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/427/index.html">412 U. S. 427</a>, 428 (1973) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  We have consistently applied that presumption to language in the ADEA that was \xe2\x80\x9cderived <em>in haec verba</em> from Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Lorillard</em> v. <em>Pons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U.

S., at 425\xe2\x80\x93426.  Accepting the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that the employer had adopted the diploma and test requirements without any intent to discriminate, we held that good faith \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as \xe2\x80\x98built-in headwinds\xe2\x80\x99 for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 432.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We explained that Congress had \xe2\x80\x9cdirected the thrust of the Act to the <em>consequences</em> of employment practices, not simply the motivation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We relied on the fact that history is \xe2\x80\x9cfilled with examples of men and women who rendered highly effective performance without the conventional badges of accomplishment in terms of certificates, diplomas, or degrees.  Diplomas and tests are useful servants, but Congress has mandated the commonsense proposition that they are not to become masters of reality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 433.  And we noted that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which had enforcement responsibility, had issued guidelines that accorded with our view.  <em>Id.</em>, at 433\xe2\x80\x93434.  We thus squarely held that \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) of Title VII did not require a showing of discriminatory intent.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While our opinion in <em>Griggs</em> relied primarily on the purposes of the Act, buttressed by the fact that the EEOC had endorsed the same view, we have subsequently noted that our holding represented the better reading of the statutory text as well.  See <em>Watson</em> v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/index.html">487 U. S. 977</a>, 991 (1988).  Neither \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) nor the comparable language in the ADEA simply prohibits actions that \xe2\x80\x9climit, segregate, or classify\xe2\x80\x9d persons; rather the language prohibits such actions that \xe2\x80\x9cdeprive any individual of employment opportunities or <em>otherwise adversely affect</em> his status as an employee, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d race or age.  <em>Ibid</em>. (explaining that in disparate-impact cases, \xe2\x80\x9cthe employer\xe2\x80\x99s practices may be said to \xe2\x80\x98adversely affect [an individual\xe2\x80\x99s status] as an employee\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (alteration in original) (quoting 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(2))).  Thus the text focuses on the <em>effects</em> of the action on the employee rather than the motivation for the action of the employer.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Griggs</em>, which interpreted the identical text at issue here, thus strongly suggests that a disparate-impact theory should be cognizable under the ADEA.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Indeed, for over two decades after our decision in <em>Griggs</em>, the Courts of Appeal uniformly interpreted the ADEA as authorizing recovery on a \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate-impact\xe2\x80\x9d theory in appropriate cases.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  It was only after our decision in <em>Hazen Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Biggins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/604/index.html"></a><a href="/us/507/604/index.html">507 U. S. 604</a> (1993), that some of those courts concluded that the ADEA did not authorize a disparate-impact theory of liability.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Our opinion in <em>Hazen Paper</em>, however, did not address or comment on the issue we decide today.  In that case, we held that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that he was discharged shortly before his pension would have vested did not state a cause of action under a <em>disparate-treatment</em> theory.  The motivating factor was not, we held, the employee\xe2\x80\x99s age, but rather his years of service, a factor that the ADEA did not prohibit an employer from considering when terminating an employee.  <em>Id</em>., at 612.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  While we noted that disparate-treatment \xe2\x80\x9ccaptures the essence of what Congress sought to prohibit in the ADEA,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> id.,</em> at 610, we were careful to explain that we were not deciding \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a disparate impact theory of liability is available under the ADEA\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In sum, there is nothing in our opinion in <em>Hazen Paper </em>that precludes an interpretation of the ADEA that parallels our holding in <em>Griggs.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 categorical rejection of disparate-impact liability, like Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s, rested primarily on the RFOA provision and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of legislative history.  As we have already explained, we think the history of the enactment of the ADEA, with particular reference to the Wirtz Report, supports the pre-<em>Hazen Paper</em> consensus concerning disparate-impact liability.  And <em>Hazen Paper</em> itself contains the response to the concern over the RFOA provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The RFOA provision provides that it shall not be unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\x9cto take any action otherwise prohibited under subsectio[n] (a) \xe2\x80\xa6 where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age discrimination\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  81 Stat. 603.  In most disparate-treatment cases, if an employer in fact acted on a factor other than age, the action would not be prohibited under subsection (a) in the first place.  See <em>Hazen Paper</em>, 507 U. S., at 609 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no disparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the employer is some feature other than the employee\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In those disparate-treatment cases, such as in <em>Hazen Paper</em> itself, the RFOA provision is simply unnecessary to avoid liability under the ADEA, since there was no prohibited action in the first place.  The RFOA provision is not, as Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor suggests, a \xe2\x80\x9csafe harbor from liability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 5 (emphasis deleted), since there would be no liability under \xc2\xa74(a).  See <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs</em> v. <em>Burdine,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/248/index.html">450 U. S. 248</a>, 254 (1981) (noting, in a Title VII case, that an employer can defeat liability by showing that the employee was rejected for \xe2\x80\x9ca legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\xe2\x80\x9d without reference to an RFOA provision).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In disparate-impact cases, however, the allegedly \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d activity is not based on age.  <em>Ibid</em>.

It is, accordingly, in cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather than support an argument that disparate impact is unavailable under the ADEA, the RFOA provision actually supports the contrary conclusion.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we note that both the Department of Labor, which initially drafted the legislation, and the EEOC, which is the agency charged by Congress with responsibility for implementing the statute, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7628, have consistently interpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory.  The initial regulations, while not </p>\n<p align="left">mentioning disparate impact by name, nevertheless permitted such claims if the employer relied on a factor that was not related to age.  29 CFR \xc2\xa7860.103(f)(1)(i) (1970) (barring physical fitness requirements that were not \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary for the specific work to be performed\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also \xc2\xa71625.7 (2004) (setting forth the standards for a disparate-impact claim).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text of the statute, as interpreted in <em>Griggs</em>, the RFOA provision, and the EEOC regulations all support petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view.  We therefore conclude that it was error for the Court of Appeals to hold that the disparate-impact theory of liability is categorically unavailable under the ADEA.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make it clear that even though both statutes authorize recovery on a disparate-impact theory, the scope of disparate-impact liability under ADEA is narrower than under Title VII.  The first is the RFOA provision, which we have already identified.  The second is the amendment to Title VII contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071.  One of the purposes of that amendment was to modify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Wards Cove Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Atonio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/index.html">490 U. S. 642</a> (1989), a case in which we narrowly construed the employer\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to liability on a disparate-impact theory.  See Civil Rights Act of 1991, \xc2\xa72, 105 Stat. 1071.  While the relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII, they did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination.  Hence, <em>Wards Cove\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to limit the coverage of the ADEA by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike race or other classifications protected by Title VII, not uncommonly has relevance to an individual\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  To be sure, Congress recognized that this is not always the case, and that society may perceive those differences to be larger or more consequential than they are in fact.  However, as Secretary Wirtz noted in his report, \xe2\x80\x9ccertain circumstances \xe2\x80\xa6 unquestionably affect older workers more strongly, as a group, than they do younger workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wirtz Report 28.  Thus, it is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.  Moreover, intentional discrimination on the basis of age has not occurred at the same levels as discrimination against those protected by Title VII.  While the ADEA reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to give older workers employment opportunities whenever possible, the RFOA provision reflects this historical difference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to the case before us, we initially note that petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers.  They have not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers.  As we held in <em>Wards Cove</em>, it is not enough to simply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.  Rather, the employee is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98responsible for isolating and identifying the <em>specific</em> employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  490 U. S., at 656 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Watson, </em>487 U. S., at 994).  Petitioners have failed to do so.  Their failure to identify the specific practice being challenged is the sort of omission that could \xe2\x80\x9cresult in employers being potentially liable for \xe2\x80\x98the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  490 U. S., at 657.  In this case not only did petitioners thus err by failing to identify the relevant practice, but it is also clear from the record that the City\xe2\x80\x99s plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plan divided each of five basic positions\xe2\x80\x94police officer, master police officer, police sergeant, police lieutenant, and deputy police chief\xe2\x80\x94into a series of steps and half-steps.  The wage for each range was based on a survey of comparable communities in the Southeast.  Employees were then assigned a step (or half-step) within their position that corresponded to the lowest step that would still give the individual a 2% raise.  Most of the officers were in the three lowest ranks; in each of those ranks there were officers under age 40 and officers over 40.  In none did their age affect their compensation.  The few officers in the two highest ranks are all over 40.  Their raises, though higher in dollar amount than the raises given to junior officers, represented a smaller percentage of their salaries, which of course are higher than the salaries paid to their juniors.  They are members of the class complaining of the \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d of the award.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 evidence established two principal facts: First, almost two-thirds (66.2%) of the officers under 40 received raises of more than 10% while less than half (45.3%) of those over 40 did.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Second, the average percentage increase for the entire class of officers with less than five years of tenure was somewhat higher than the percentage for those with more seniority.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Because older officers tended to occupy more senior positions, on average they received smaller increases when measured as a percentage of their salary.  The basic explanation for the differential was the City\xe2\x80\x99s perceived need to raise the salaries of junior officers to make them competitive with comparable positions in the market.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the disparate impact is attributable to the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give raises based on seniority and position.  Reliance on seniority and rank is unquestionably reasonable given the City\xe2\x80\x99s goal of raising employees\xe2\x80\x99 salaries to match those in surrounding communities.  In sum, we hold that the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision to grant a larger raise to lower echelon employees for the purpose of bringing salaries in line with that of surrounding police forces was a decision based on a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable factor other than age\xe2\x80\x9d that responded to the City\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate goal of retaining police officers.  Cf. <em>MacPherson</em> v. <em>University of Montevallo</em>, 922 F.\xc2\xa02d 766, 772 (CA11 1991).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While there may have been other reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals, the one selected was not unreasonable.  Unlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, while we do not agree with the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holding that that the disparate-impact theory of recovery is never available under the ADEA, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0App. 15.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See 110 Cong.

Just as the <em>Griggs </em>opinion ruled out discrimination based on racial animus as a problem in that case, the Wirtz Report concluded that there was no significant discrimination of that kind so far as older workers are concerned.  Wirtz Report 23.  And just as <em>Griggs</em> recognized that the high school diploma requirement, which was unrelated to job performance, had an unfair impact on African-Americans who had received inferior educational opportunities in segregated schools, 401 U. S., at 430, the Wirtz Report identified the identical obstacle to the employment of older workers.  \xe2\x80\x9cAny formal employment standard which requires, for example, a high school diploma will obviously work against the employment of many older workers\xe2\x80\x94unfairly if, despite his limited schooling, an older worker\xe2\x80\x99s years of experience have given him the relevant equivalent of a high school education.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wirtz Report 21.  Thus, just as the statutory text is identical, there is a remarkable similarity between the congressional goals we cited in <em>Griggs</em> and those present in the Wirtz Report.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In reaching a contrary conclusion, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor ignores key textual differences between \xc2\xa74(a)(1), which does not encompass-disparate-impact liability, and \xc2\xa74(a)(2).  Section (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\x9cto fail or refuse to hire \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>any individual </em>\xe2\x80\xa6 because of <em>such individual\xe2\x80\x99s</em> age.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The focus of the section is on the employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions with respect to the targeted individual.  Paragraph (a)(2), however, makes it unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\x9cto limit \xe2\x80\xa6 his <em>employees</em> in any way that would deprive or tend to deprive <em>any individual</em> of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect <em>his </em>status as an employee, because of <em>such individual\xe2\x80\x99s</em> age.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Unlike in paragraph (a)(2), there is thus an incongruity between the employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions\xe2\x80\x94which are focused on his employees generally\xe2\x80\x94and the individual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions.  Thus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employee\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x94the very definition of disparate impact.  Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor is therefore quite wrong to suggest that the textual differences between the two paragraphs are unimportant.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor reaches a contrary conclusion based on the text of the statute, the legislative history, and the structure of the statute.  As we explain above, n.\xc2\xa06, <em>supra</em>, her textual reasoning is not persuasive.  Further, while Congress may have intended to remedy disparate-impact type situations through \xe2\x80\x9cnoncoercive measures\xe2\x80\x9d in part, there is nothing to suggest that it intended such measures to be the sole method of achieving the desired result of remedying practices that had an adverse effect on older workers.  Finally, we agree that the differences between age and the classes protected in Title VII are relevant, and that Congress might well have intended to treat the two differently.  See <em>infra</em>, at 7 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).   However, Congress obviously considered those classes of individuals to be sufficiently similar to warrant enacting identical legislation, at least with respect to employment practices it sought to prohibit.  While those differences, <em>coupled with a difference in the text of the statue</em> such as the RFOA provision, may warrant addressing disparate-impact claims in the two statutes differently, see <em>infra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, it does not justify departing from the plain text and our settled interpretation of that text.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0B.

The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U.

Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC promulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46 Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a \xe2\x80\x98factor other than\xe2\x80\x99 age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa71625.7(d) (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s final interpretation of the ADEA said the following regarding this regulation: \xe2\x80\x9cParagraph (d) of \xc2\xa71625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employment criteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protected age group must be justified as a business necessity.  <em>See Laugesen </em>v. <em>Anaconda Corp.</em>, 510 F.\xc2\xa02d 307 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Duke Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/424/index.html">401 U.

The regulation affirmed, moreover, what had been the longstanding position of the Department of Labor, the agency that previously administered the ADEA, see <em>ante</em>, at 10; 29 CFR \xc2\xa7860.103(f)(1)(i) (1970).  And finally, the Commission has appeared in numerous cases in the lower courts, both as a party and as <em>amicus curiae</em>, to defend the position that the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact claims.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Even under the unduly constrained standards of agency deference recited in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U.

See <em>post</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9321 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The first claim cannot be squared with the text of the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s regulation, quoted above.  This cannot possibly be read as agnostic on the question whether the ADEA prohibits employer practices that have a disparate impact on the aged.  It provides that such practices \xe2\x80\x9ccan <em>only </em>be justified as a business necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d compelling the conclusion that, absent a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d such practices are prohibited.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor would not defer to the EEOC regulation, even if it read as it does, because, she says, the regulation \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not purport to interpret the language of \xc2\xa74(a) at all,\xe2\x80\x9d but is rather limited to an interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable factors other than age\xe2\x80\x9d (RFOA) clause of \xc2\xa74(f)(1) of the ADEA, which she says is not at issue.  <em>Post</em>, at 19.  This argument assumes, however, that the RFOA clause operates independently of the remainder of the ADEA.  It does not.  Section 4(f)(1) provides, in relevant part: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization \xe2\x80\xa6 to take any action <em>otherwise prohibited</em> under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section \xe2\x80\xa6 where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U.

And, of course, the only provision of the ADEA that could conceivably be interpreted to effect such a prohibition is \xc2\xa74(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x94the provision that Justice O\'Connor maintains the EEOC \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not purport to interpret \xe2\x80\xa6 at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 19.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lastly, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor argues that the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of what is \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d by the ADEA is not entitled to deference because the Court concludes that the same regulation\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of <em>another term\xe2\x80\x94</em>the term \xe2\x80\x9creasonable factors other than age,\xe2\x80\x9d which the regulation takes to include only \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is unreasonable.  <em>Post</em>, at 21.  Her logic seems to be that, because the two interpretations appear in the same paragraph, they should stand or fall together.  She cites no case for this proposition, and it makes little sense.  If the two simultaneously adopted interpretations were contained in <em>distinct</em> paragraphs, the invalidation of one would not, of course, render the other infirm.  (Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor does not mean to imply, I assume, that our rejection of the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s application of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9creasonable factors other than age\xe2\x80\x9d to disparate impact claims in paragraph (d) of \xc2\xa71625.7 relieves the lower courts of the obligation to defer to the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s other applications of the same phrase in paragraph (c) or (e)).

See <em>post</em>, at 20.  That is true enough.  But the question here is not whether disparate treatment claims (when they have a disparate impact) are <em>also</em> covered by the regulation; it is whether disparate impact claims of <em>all </em>sorts <em>are</em> covered; and there is no way to avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agency\xe2\x80\x99s actions over the years) that they are.  That is also a complete response to Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s point that the regulation could not refer to \xc2\xa74(a)(2) because it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under \xc2\xa74(a)(1).  Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agency\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate impact prohibition is mistaken.

S. 604</a>, 610 (1993).  In the nearly four decades since the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, however, we have never read the statute to impose liability upon an employer without proof of discriminatory intent.  See <em>ibid.; Markham</em> v. <em>Geller</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/945/index.html">451 U. S. 945</a> (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  I decline to join the Court in doing so today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would instead affirm the judgment below on the ground that disparate impact claims are not cognizable under the ADEA.  The ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s text, legislative history, and purposes together make clear that Congress did not intend the statute to authorize such claims.  Moreover, the significant differences between the ADEA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 counsel against transposing to the former our construction of the latter in <em>Griggs</em> v. <em>Duke Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/424/index.html">401 U. S. 424</a> (1971).  Finally, the agencies charged with administering the ADEA have never authoritatively construed the statute\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitory language to impose disparate impact liability.  Thus, on the precise question of statutory interpretation now before us, there is no reasoned agency reading of the text to which we might defer.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our starting point is the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Section 4(a) of the ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age; [or]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither petitioners nor the plurality contend that the first paragraph, \xc2\xa74(a)(1), authorizes disparate impact claims, and I think it obvious that it does not.  That provision plainly requires discriminatory intent, for to take an action against an individual \xe2\x80\x9c<em>because of</em> such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d is to do so \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9con account of\xe2\x80\x9d her age.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 194 (1961); see also <em>Teamsters</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/index.html">431 U. S. 324</a>, 335\xe2\x80\x93336, n.\xc2\xa015 (1977) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Disparate treatment\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 is the most easily understood type of discrimination.  The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others <em>because of </em>their [protected characteristic].  Proof of discriminatory motive is critical\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners look instead to the second paragraph, \xc2\xa74(a)(2), as the basis for their disparate impact claim.  But petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument founders on the plain language of the statute, the natural reading of which requires proof of discriminatory intent.  Section 4(a)(2) uses the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of \xe2\x80\xa6 age\xe2\x80\x9d in precisely the same manner as does the preceding paragraph\xe2\x80\x94to make plain that an employer is liable only if its adverse action against an individual is <em>motivated</em> <em>by</em> the individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) do differ in one informative respect.  The employer actions targeted by paragraph (a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, refusing to hire, discharging, or discriminating against\xe2\x80\x94are <em>inherently</em> <em>harmful</em> to the targeted individual.  The actions referred to in paragraph (a)(2), on the other hand\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, limiting, segregating, or classifying\xe2\x80\x94are <em>facially neutral</em>.  Accordingly, paragraph (a)(2) includes additional language which clarifies that, to give rise to liability, the employer\xe2\x80\x99s action must actually injure someone: The decision to limit, segregate, or classify employees must \xe2\x80\x9cdeprive or tend to deprive [an] individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  That distinction aside, the structures of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) are otherwise identical.  Each paragraph prohibits an employer from taking specified adverse actions against an individual \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality instead reads paragraph (a)(2) to prohibit employer actions that \xe2\x80\x9cadversely affect [an individual\xe2\x80\x99s] status as an employe[e] because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under this reading, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of \xe2\x80\xa6 age\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the <em>cause of the adverse</em> <em>effect</em> rather than the <em>motive</em> <em>for the employer\xe2\x80\x99s</em> <em>action</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  This reading is unpersuasive for two reasons.  First, it ignores the obvious parallel between paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) by giving the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d a different meaning in each of the two paragraphs.  And second, it ignores the drafters\xe2\x80\x99 use of a comma separating the \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of \xe2\x80\xa6 age\xe2\x80\x9d clause from the preceding language.  That comma makes plain that the \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of \xe2\x80\xa6 age\xe2\x80\x9d clause should not be read, as the plurality would have it, to modify only the \xe2\x80\x9cadversely affect\xe2\x80\x9d phrase.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises</em>, <em>Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/235/index.html">489 U. S. 235</a>, 241 (1989) (interpreting statute in light of the drafters\xe2\x80\x99 use of a comma to set aside a particular phrase from the following language); see also B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 101 (2d ed. 1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally, the word <em>because </em>should not follow a comma\xe2\x80\x9d). <em> </em>Rather, the \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of \xe2\x80\xa6 age\xe2\x80\x9d clause is set aside to make clear that it modifies the <em>entirety</em> of the preceding paragraph: An employer may not, because of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s age, limit, segregate, or classify his employees in a way that harms that individual.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality also argues that its reading is supported by the supposed \xe2\x80\x9cincongruity\xe2\x80\x9d between paragraph (a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the plural in referring to the employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions (\xe2\x80\x9climit, segregate, or classify his <em>employees</em>\xe2\x80\x9d) and its use of the singular in the \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such <em>individual\xe2\x80\x99s</em> age\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  (Emphases added.)  <em>Ante</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa06.  Not so.  For the reasons just stated, the \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of . . . age\xe2\x80\x9d clause modifies <em>all </em>of the preceding language of paragraph (a)(2).  That preceding language is phrased in <em>both </em>the plural (insofar as it refers to the employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions relating to <em>employees</em>) <em>and </em>the singular (insofar as it requires that such action actually harm <em>an individual</em>).  The use of the singular in the \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of . . . age\xe2\x80\x9d clause simply makes clear that paragraph (a)(2) forbids an employer to limit, segregate, or classify his employees if that decision is taken because of <em>even one </em>employee\xe2\x80\x99s age and <em>that individual </em>(alone or together with others) is harmed. </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the ADEA makes it unlawful to intentionally discriminate because of age, \xc2\xa74(f)(1) clarifies that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t shall not be unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\xa6 to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section \xe2\x80\xa6 where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(f)(1).  This \xe2\x80\x9creasonable factors other than age\xe2\x80\x9d (RFOA) provision \xe2\x80\x9cinsure[s] that employers [are] permitted to use neutral criteria\xe2\x80\x9d other than age, <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Wyoming</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/226/index.html">460 U. S. 226</a>, 232\xe2\x80\x93233 (1983), even if this results in a disparate adverse impact on older workers.  The provision therefore expresses Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clear intention that employers <em>not</em> be subject to liability absent proof of intentional age-based discrimination.  That policy, in my view, cannot easily be reconciled with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s expansive reading of \xc2\xa74(a)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality however, reasons that the RFOA provision\xe2\x80\x99s language instead confirms that \xc2\xa74(a) authorizes disparate impact claims.  If \xc2\xa74(a) prohibited only intentional discrimination, the argument goes, then the RFOA provision would have no effect because any action based on a factor other than age would not be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98otherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa74(a).  See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Moreover, the plurality says, the RFOA provision applies only to employer actions based on <em>reasonable</em> factors other than age\xe2\x80\x94so employers may still be held liable for actions based on <em>un</em>reasonable nonage factors.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument misconstrues the purpose and effect of the RFOA provision.  Discriminatory intent <em>is</em> required under \xc2\xa74(a), for the reasons discussed above.  The role of the RFOA provision is to afford employers an independent <em>safe harbor</em> from liability.  It provides that, where a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of intentional age discrimination under \xc2\xa74(a)\xe2\x80\x94thus \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[ing] a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs</em> v. <em>Burdine, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/248/index.html">450 U. S. 248</a>, 254 (1981)\xe2\x80\x94the employer can rebut this case by producing evidence that its action was based on a reasonable nonage factor.  Thus, the RFOA provision codifies a safe harbor analogous to the \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\xe2\x80\x9d (LNR) justification later recognized in Title VII suits.  <em>Ibid.; McDonnell Douglas Corp.</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/792/index.html">411 U. S. 792</a>, 802 (1973).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Assuming the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework applies to ADEA suits, see <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em> v. <em>Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/308/index.html">517 U. S. 308</a>, 311 (1996), this \xe2\x80\x9crebuttal\xe2\x80\x9d function of the RFOA provision is arguably redundant with the judicially established LNR justification.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But, at most, that merely demonstrates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 abundance of caution in codifying an <em>express statutory exemption</em> from liability in the absence of discriminatory intent.  See <em>Fort Stewart Schools</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/641/index.html">495 U. S. 641</a>, 646 (1990) (provisions that, although \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically unnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d are sometimes \xe2\x80\x9cinserted out of an abundance of caution\xe2\x80\x94a drafting imprecision venerable enough to have left its mark on legal Latin <em>(ex abundanti cautela)</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is noteworthy that even after <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>was decided, lower courts continued to rely on the RFOA exemption, in lieu of the LNR justification, as the basis for rebutting a prima facie case of age discrimination.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Krieg</em> v. <em>Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.</em>, 718 F.\xc2\xa02d 998, 999 (CA11 1983) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Schwager</em> v. <em>Sun Oil Co. of Pa.</em>, 591 F.\xc2\xa02d 58, 61 (CA10 1979); <em>Bittar</em> v. <em>Air Canada</em>, 512 F.\xc2\xa02d 582, 582\xe2\x80\x93583 (CA5 1975) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the RFOA provision also plays a distinct (and clearly nonredundant) role in \xe2\x80\x9cmixed-motive\xe2\x80\x9d cases.  In such cases, an adverse action taken in substantial part because of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s age may be \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d by \xc2\xa74(a).  See <em>Desert Palace, Inc.</em> v. <em>Costa</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/90/index.html">539 U. S. 90</a>, 93 (2003); <em>Price Waterhouse</em> v. <em>Hopkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/228/index.html">490 U. S. 228</a>, 262\xe2\x80\x93266 (1989) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  The RFOA exemption makes clear that such conduct is nevertheless lawful so long as it is \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d a reasonable factor other than age.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the RFOA provision\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d factors serves only to prevent the employer from gaining the benefit of the statutory safe harbor by offering an irrational justification.  Reliance on an unreasonable nonage factor would indicate that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s explanation is, in fact, no more than a pretext for <em>intentional</em> discrimination.

The drafters of the ADEA and the Congress that enacted it understood that age discrimination was qualitatively different from the kinds of discrimination addressed by Title VII, and that many legitimate employment practices would have a disparate impact on older workers.  Accordingly, Congress determined that the disparate impact problem would best be addressed through noncoercive measures, and that the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitory provisions should be reserved for combating intentional age-based discrimination.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although Congress rejected proposals to address age discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \xc2\xa7715 of that Act directed the Secretary of Labor to undertake a study of age discrimination in employment and to submit to Congress a report containing \xe2\x80\x9csuch recommendations for legislation to prevent arbitrary discrimination in employment because of age as he determines advisable,\xe2\x80\x9d 78 Stat. 265.

In response, Secretary Willard Wirtz submitted the report that provided the blueprint for the ADEA.  See Report of the Secretary of Labor, The Older American Worker: Age Discrimination in Employment (June 1965), reprinted in U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Legislative History of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act 83 (1981) (hereinafter Wirtz Report or Report).  Because the ADEA was modeled on the Wirtz Report\xe2\x80\x99s findings and recommendations, the Report provides critical insights into the statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  See generally Blumrosen, Interpreting the ADEA: Intent or Impact 14\xe2\x80\x9320, in Age Discrimination in Employment Act: A Compliance Manual for Lawyers and Personnel Practitioners 83\xe2\x80\x9389 (M.

First, the Report emphasized that age discrimination is qualitatively different from the types of discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (<em>i.e.</em>, race, color, religion, sex, and national origin discrimination).  Most importantly\xe2\x80\x94in stark contrast to the types of discrimination addressed by Title VII\xe2\x80\x94the Report found no evidence that age discrimination resulted from intolerance or animus towards older workers.  Rather, age discrimination was based primarily upon unfounded assumptions about the relationship between an individual\xe2\x80\x99s age and her ability to perform a job.  Wirtz Report 2.  In addition, whereas ability is nearly always completely unrelated to the characteristics protected by Title VII, the Report found that, in some cases, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is in fact a relationship between [an individual\xe2\x80\x99s] age and his ability to perform the job.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Wirtz Report drew a sharp distinction between \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98arbitrary discrimination\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (which the Report clearly equates with disparate treatment) and circumstances or practices having a disparate impact on older workers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 2, 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  The Report defined \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d discrimination as adverse treatment of older workers \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of assumptions about the effect of age on their ability to do a job <em>when there is in fact no basis for these assumptions</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 2 (emphasis in original).  While the \xe2\x80\x9cmost obvious kind\xe2\x80\x9d of arbitrary discrimination is the setting of unjustified maximum age limits for employment, <em>id.</em>, at 6, naturally the Report\xe2\x80\x99s definition encompasses a broad range of disparate treatment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Report distinguished such \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, intentional and unfounded) discrimination from two other phenomena.  One involves differentiation of employees based on a genuine relationship between age and ability to perform a job.  See <em>id.</em>, at 2.  In this connection, the Report examined \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances which unquestionably affect older workers more strongly, as a group, than they do younger workers,\xe2\x80\x9d including questions of health, educational attainment, and technological change.  <em>Id.</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9314.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In addition, the Report assessed \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94such as seniority rules, workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation laws, and pension plans\xe2\x80\x94which, though intended to benefit older workers, might actually make employers less likely to hire or retain them.  <em>Id.</em>, at 2, 15\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Report specifically recommended legislative action to prohibit \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, disparate treatment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  In sharp contrast, it recommended that the other two types of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94both involving factors or practices having a disparate impact on older workers\xe2\x80\x94be addressed through noncoercive measures: programs to increase the availability of employment; continuing education; and adjustment of pension systems, workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation, and other institutional arrangements.  <em>Id.</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9325.  These recommendations found direct expression in the ADEA, which was drafted at Congress\xe2\x80\x99 command that the Secretary of Labor make \xe2\x80\x9cspecific legislative recommendations for implementing the [Wirtz Report\xe2\x80\x99s] conclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, \xc2\xa7606, 80 Stat. 845.  See also <em>General Dynamics</em>, 540 U. S., at 589 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he ADEA \xe2\x80\xa6 begins with statements of purpose and findings that mirror the Wirtz Report\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s structure confirms Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination to prohibit only \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d discrimination (<em>i.e.</em>, disparate treatment based on unfounded assumptions), while addressing practices with a disparate adverse impact on older workers through noncoercive measures.  Section 2\xe2\x80\x94which sets forth the findings and purposes of the statute\xe2\x80\x94draws a clear distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cthe setting of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccertain otherwise desirable practices [that] may work to the disadvantage of older persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621(a)(2).  In response to these problems, \xc2\xa72 identifies three purposes of the ADEA: \xe2\x80\x9c[1] to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; [2] to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; [and 3] to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7621(b).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each of these three purposes corresponds to one of the three substantive statutory sections that follow.  Section 3 seeks to \xe2\x80\x9cpromote employment of older persons\xe2\x80\x9d by directing the Secretary of Labor to undertake a program of research and education related to \xe2\x80\x9cthe needs and abilities of older workers, and their potentials for continued employment and contribution to the economy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7622(a).  Section 4, which contains the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s core prohibitions, corresponds to the second purpose: to \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Finally, \xc2\xa75 addresses the third statutory purpose by requiring the Secretary of Labor to undertake a study of \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional and other arrangements giving rise to involuntary retirement\xe2\x80\x9d and to submit any resulting findings and legislative recommendations to Congress.  \xc2\xa7624(a)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 4\xe2\x80\x94including \xc2\xa74(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x94must be read in light of the express statutory purpose the provision was intended to effect: the prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary<em> </em>age discrimination in employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7621(b).  As the legislative history makes plain, \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d age discrimination had a very specific meaning for the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s drafters.  It meant disparate <em>treatment</em> of older workers, predominantly because of unfounded assumptions about the relationship between age and ability.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  Again, such intentional discrimination was clearly distinguished from circumstances and practices merely having a disparate impact on older workers, which\xe2\x80\x94as ADEA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72, 3, and 5 make clear\xe2\x80\x94Congress intended to address through research, education, and possible future legislative action.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to this affirmative evidence of congressional intent, I find it telling that the legislative history is devoid of any discussion of disparate impact claims or of the complicated issues such claims raise in the ADEA context.  See Gold, Disparate Impact Under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 25 Berkeley J. Emp. &amp; Lab. L. 1, 40 (2004).  At the time the ADEA was enacted, the predominant focus of antidiscrimination law was on intentional discrimination; the concept of disparate impact liability, by contrast, was quite novel.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Gold, <em>Griggs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 Folly: An Essay on the Theory, Problems, and Origin of the Adverse Impact Definition of Employment Discrimination and a Recommendation for Reform, 7 Indus. Rel. L.\xc2\xa0J. 429, 518\xe2\x80\x93520 (1985); Blumrosen, Strangers in Paradise: <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</em> and the Concept of Employment Discrimination, 71 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 59, 69\xe2\x80\x9371 (1972).  Had Congress intended to inaugurate disparate impact liability in the ADEA, one would expect to find some indication of that intent in the text and the legislative history.  There is none.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to authorize disparate impact claims is understandable in light of the questionable utility of such claims in the age-discrimination context.  No one would argue that older workers have suffered disadvantages as a result of entrenched historical patterns of discrimination, like racial minorities have.  See <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement</em> v. <em>Murgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/307/index.html">427 U. S. 307</a>, 313\xe2\x80\x93314 (1976) <em>(per curiam);</em> see also Wirtz Report 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Accordingly, disparate impact liability under the ADEA cannot be justified, and is not necessary, as a means of redressing the cumulative results of past discrimination.  Cf. <em>Griggs, </em>401 U. S., at 430 (reasoning that disparate impact liability is necessary under Title VII to prevent perpetuation of the results of past racial discrimination).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the Wirtz Report correctly concluded that\xe2\x80\x94unlike the classifications protected by Title VII\xe2\x80\x94there often <em>is</em> a correlation between an individual\xe2\x80\x99s age and her ability to perform a job.  Wirtz Report 2, 11\xe2\x80\x9315.  That is to be expected, for \xe2\x80\x9cphysical ability generally declines with age,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Murgia</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 315, and in some cases, so does mental capacity, see <em>Gregory</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/452/index.html">501 U. S. 452</a>, 472 (1991).  Perhaps more importantly, advances in technology and increasing access to formal education often leave older workers at a competitive disadvantage vis-\xc5\x95-vis younger workers.  Wirtz Report 11\xe2\x80\x9315.  Beyond these performance-affecting factors, there is also the fact that many employment benefits, such as salary, vacation time, and so forth, increase as an employee gains experience and seniority.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Finnegan</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, 967 F.\xc2\xa02d 1161, 1164 (CA7 1992) (\xe2\x80\x9c[V]irtually all elements of a standard compensation package are positively correlated with age\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, many employer decisions that are intended to cut costs or respond to market forces will likely have a disproportionate effect on older workers.  Given the myriad ways in which legitimate business practices can have a disparate impact on older workers, it is hardly surprising that Congress declined to subject employers to civil liability based solely on such effects.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality and Justice Scalia offer two principal arguments in favor of their reading of the statute: that the relevant provision of the ADEA should be read <em>in pari materia</em> with the parallel provision of Title VII, and that we should give interpretive weight or deference to agency statements relating to disparate impact liability.  I find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The language of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitory provisions was modeled on, and is nearly identical to, parallel provisions in Title VII.  See <em>McKennon</em> v. <em>Nashville Banner Publishing Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/352/index.html">513 U. S. 352</a>, 357 (1995); <em>Lorillard</em> v. <em>Pons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U. S. 575</a>, 584 (1978).  Because <em>Griggs</em>, <em>supra, </em>held that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7703(a)(2) permits disparate impact claims, the plurality concludes that we should read \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the ADEA similarly.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obviously, this argument would be a great deal more convincing had <em>Griggs </em>been decided <em>before </em>the ADEA was enacted.  In that case, we could safely assume that Congress had notice (and therefore intended) that the language at issue here would be read to authorize disparate impact claims.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, <em>Department of Energy</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/607/index.html">503 U. S. 607</a>, 626 (1992); <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/258/index.html">503 U. S. 258</a>, 268 (1992). <em> </em>But <em>Griggs</em> was decided four years <em>after</em> the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, and there is no reason to suppose that Congress in 1967 could have foreseen the interpretation of Title VII that was to come.  See <em>Fogerty</em> v. <em>Fantasy, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/517/index.html">510 U. S. 517</a>, 523, n.\xc2\xa09 (1994); see also <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311<font b="1"> (discussing novelty of disparate impact theory at the time of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, where two statutes use similar language we generally take this as \xe2\x80\x9ca strong indication that [they] should be interpreted <em>pari passu</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Northcross</em> v. <em>Board of Ed.</em> <em>of Memphis City Schools, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/427/index.html">412 U. S. 427</a>, 428 (1973) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  But this is not a rigid or absolute rule, and it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98readily yields\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to other indicia of congressional intent.  <em>General Dynamics</em>, 540 U. S., at 595 (quoting <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/427/index.html">286 U. S. 427</a>, 433 (1932)).  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the meaning [of the same words] well may vary to meet the purposes of the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/200/index.html">532 U. S. 200</a>, 213 (2001) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 433).  Accordingly, we have not hesitated to give a different reading to the same language\xe2\x80\x94whether appearing in separate statutes or in separate provisions of the same statute\xe2\x80\x94if there is strong evidence that Congress did not intend the language to be used uniformly.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>General Dynamics</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 595\xe2\x80\x93597 (\xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d has different meaning where used in different parts of the ADEA); <em>Cleveland Indians</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 213 (\xe2\x80\x9cwages paid\xe2\x80\x9d has different meanings in different provisions of Title 26 U.

Such is the case here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, there are significant textual differences between Title VII and the ADEA that indicate differences in congressional intent.  Most importantly, whereas the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s RFOA provision protects employers from liability for any actions not motivated by age, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x937, Title VII lacks any similar provision.  In addition, the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s structure demonstrates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to combat intentional discrimination through \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions while addressing employment practices having a disparate impact on older workers through independent noncoercive mechanisms.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  There is no analogy in the structure of Title VII.  Furthermore, as the Congresses that adopted <em>both</em> Title VII <em>and</em> the ADEA clearly recognized, the two statutes were intended to address qualitatively different kinds of discrimination.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Disparate impact liability may have a legitimate role in combating the types of discrimination addressed by Title VII, but the nature of aging and of age discrimination makes such liability inappropriate for the ADEA.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Griggs </em>itself provides any reason to extend its holding to the ADEA.  As the plurality tacitly acknowledges, <em>ante</em>, at 6, the decision in <em>Griggs</em> was not based on any analysis of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s actual language.  Rather, the <em>ratio decidendi</em> was the statute\xe2\x80\x99s perceived <em>purpose</em>,<em> i.e.</em>,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cto achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees.  Under the Act, practices, procedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they operate to \xe2\x80\x98freeze\xe2\x80\x99 the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  401 U. S., at 429\xe2\x80\x93430.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn other words, the Court in <em>Griggs </em>reasoned that disparate impact liability was necessary to achieve Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s ostensible goal of eliminating the cumulative effects of historical racial discrimination.  However, that rationale finds no parallel in the ADEA context, see <em>Murgia</em>, 427 U. S., at 313\xe2\x80\x93314, and it therefore should not control our decision here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even venerable canons of construction must bow, in an appropriate case, to compelling evidence of congressional intent.  In my judgment, the significant differences between Title VII and the ADEA are more than sufficient to overcome the default presumption that similar language\nis to be read similarly.  See <em>Fogerty</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 523\xe2\x80\x93524\n(concluding that the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal indication\xe2\x80\x9d that similar language should be read similarly is \xe2\x80\x9coverborne\xe2\x80\x9d by differences between the legislative history and purposes of two statutes).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality asserts that the agencies charged with the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s administration \xe2\x80\x9chave consistently interpreted the [statute] to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  In support of this claim, the plurality describes a 1968 interpretive bulletin issued by the Department of Labor as \xe2\x80\x9cpermitt[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d disparate impact claims.  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing 29 CFR \xc2\xa7860.103(f)(1)(i) (1970)).  And the plurality cites, without comment, an Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) policy statement construing the RFOA provision.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (citing 29 CFR \xc2\xa71625.7 (2004))<em>.</em>  It is unclear what interpretive value the plurality means to assign to these agency statements.

In discussing the RFOA provision, the bulletin states that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical fitness requirements\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[e]valuation factors such as quantity or quality of production, or educational level\xe2\x80\x9d can qualify as reasonable nonage factors, so long as they have a valid relationship to job qualifications and are uniformly applied.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7860.103(f)(1), (2).  But the bulletin does not construe the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s <em>prohibitory </em>provisions, nor does it state or imply that \xc2\xa74(a) authorizes disparate impact claims.  Rather, it establishes \xe2\x80\x9ca nonexclusive objective test for employers to use in determining whether they could be certain of qualifying for the\xe2\x80\x9d RFOA exemption.  <em>Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio</em> v. <em>Betts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/158/index.html">492 U. S. 158</a>, 172 (1989) (discussing 1968 bulletin\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the \xc2\xa74(f)(2) exemption).  Moreover, the very same bulletin states unequivocally that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he clear purpose [of the ADEA] is to insure that age, within the limits prescribed by the Act, is not <em>a determining factor in making any decision</em> regarding the hiring, dismissal, promotion or any other term condition or privilege of employment of an individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7860.103(c) (emphasis added).  That language is all about discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The EEOC statement cited by the plurality and relied upon by Justice Scalia is equally unhelpful.  This \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretative rule or policy statement,\xe2\x80\x9d promulgated in 1981, superseded the 1968 Labor Department bulletin after responsibility for enforcing the ADEA was transferred from Labor to the EEOC.  See 46 Fed. Reg. 47724 (1981).  It states, in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a \xe2\x80\x98factor other than\xe2\x80\x99 age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa71625.7(d) (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">\nLike the 1968 bulletin it replaces, this statement merely spells out the agency\xe2\x80\x99s view, for purposes of its enforcement policy, of what an employer must do to be certain of gaining the safety of the RFOA haven.  It says nothing about whether disparate impact claims are authorized by the ADEA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For Justice Scalia, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his is an absolutely classic case for deference to agency interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  I disagree.  Under <em>Chevron</em>, we will defer<em> </em>to a reasonable agency interpretation of ambiguous statutory language, see 467 U. S., at 843\xe2\x80\x93844, provided that the interpretation has the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cforce of law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Christensen</em> v. <em>Harris County</em>, 529 U. S.576, 587 (2000).  The rationale for such deference is that Congress has explicitly or implicitly delegated to the agency responsible for administering a statute the authority to choose among permissible constructions of ambiguous statutory text.  See <em>Chevron</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 844.  The question now before us is not what it takes to qualify for the RFOA exemption, but rather whether \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the ADEA authorizes disparate impact claims.  But the EEOC statement does not purport to interpret the language of \xc2\xa74(a) at all.  Quite simply, the agency has not actually exercised its delegated authority to resolve any ambiguity in the relevant provision\xe2\x80\x99s text, much less done so in a reasonable or persuasive manner.  As to the specific question presented, therefore, the regulation is not entitled to any deference.  See <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Harris Trust and Sav. Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/86/index.html">510 U.

Because the RFOA provision is \xe2\x80\x9crelevant <em>only</em> as a response to employer actions \xe2\x80\x98otherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x99 by the ADEA,\xe2\x80\x9d he reasons, the \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of the EEOC statement is that the agency \xe2\x80\x9cinterprets the ADEA to prohibit employer actions that have an \xe2\x80\x98adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting 29 CFR \xc2\xa71625.7(d) (2004)).  But, of course, <em>disparate</em> <em>treatment</em> clearly has an \xe2\x80\x9cadverse impact on individuals within the protected age group,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s rule is hardly \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  The regulation says only that if an employer wants to rely on a practice\xe2\x80\x94say, a physical fitness test\xe2\x80\x94as the basis for an exemption from liability, and that test adversely affects older workers, the employer can be sure of qualifying for the exemption only if the test is sufficiently job related.  Such a limitation makes sense in disparate treatment cases.  A test that harms older workers and is unrelated to the job may be a pretext for\xe2\x80\x94or even a means of effectuating\xe2\x80\x94intentional discrimination.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Justice Scalia completes his analytical chain by inferring that the EEOC regulation <em>must</em> be read to interpret <em>\xc2\xa74(a)(2)</em> to allow disparate impact claims because that is the only provision of the ADEA that could \xe2\x80\x9cconceivably\xe2\x80\x9d be so interpreted.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (opinion concurring in part and concurring judgment).  But the support for that inference is doubtful, to say the least.  The regulation specifically refers to employment practices claimed as a basis for \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent treatment of employees <em>or applicants for employment</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 CFR \xc2\xa71625.7(d) (2004) (emphasis added).  Section 4(a)(2), of course, does not apply to \xe2\x80\x9capplicants for employment\xe2\x80\x9d at all\xe2\x80\x94it is only \xc2\xa74(a)(1) that protects this group.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a).  That suggests that the EEOC must have read the RFOA to provide a defense against claims under \xc2\xa74(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94which unquestionably permits only disparate treatment claims, see <em>supra</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This discussion serves to illustrate why it makes little sense to attribute to the agency a construction of the relevant statutory text that the agency itself has not actually articulated so that we can then \xe2\x80\x9cdefer\xe2\x80\x9d to that reading.  Such an approach is particularly troubling where applied to a question as weighty as whether a statute does or does not subject employers to liability absent discriminatory intent.  This is not, in my view, what <em>Chevron </em>contemplated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an interpretation of the <em>RFOA provision</em>, moreover, the EEOC regulation is both unreasonable on its face and directly at odds with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in today\xe2\x80\x99s case.  It says that the RFOA exemption is available only if the employer\xe2\x80\x99s practice is justified by a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the Court has rejected that reading of the RFOA provision, and rightly so: There may be many \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d means by which an employer can advance its goals, and a given nonage factor can certainly be \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d without being necessary.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14; see also <em>Western Air Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Criswell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/400/index.html">472 U. S. 400</a>, 419 (1985) (distinguishing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable necessity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d standard from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonableness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Of course, it is elementary that \xe2\x80\x9cno deference is due to agency interpretations at odds with the plain language of the statute itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Betts</em>, 492 U. S., at 171.  The agency clearly misread the RFOA provision it was attempting to construe.  That error is not necessarily dispositive of the disparate impact question.  But I think it highlights the improvidence of giving weight (let alone deferring) to the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s <em>purported assumption</em> that an <em>entirely different provision </em>of the statute, which is not even the subject of the regulation, authorizes disparate impact claims.  In my view, we should simply acknowledge that this regulation is of no help in answering the question presented.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I would not read the ADEA to authorize disparate impact claims, I agree with the Court that, if such claims are allowed, they are strictly circumscribed by the RFOA exemption.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  That exemption requires only that the challenged employment practice be based on a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d nonage factor\xe2\x80\x94that is, one that is rationally related to some legitimate business objective.  I also agree with the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 11, that, if disparate impact claims are to be permitted under the ADEA, they are governed by the standards set forth in our decision in <em>Wards Cove Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Atonio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/index.html">490 U. S. 642</a> (1989).  That means, as the Court holds, <em>ante</em>, at 12, that \xe2\x80\x9ca plaintiff must demonstrate that it is the application of a <em>specific or particular</em> <em>employment practice</em> that has <em>created</em> the disparate impact under attack,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wards Cove</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 657 (emphasis added); see also <em>Watson</em> v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/index.html">487 U. S. 977</a>, 994 (1988) (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  It also means that once the employer has produced evidence that its action was based on a reasonable nonage factor, the plaintiff bears the burden of disproving this assertion.  See <em>Wards Cove</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 659\xe2\x80\x93660; see also <em>Watson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 997 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  Even if petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 disparate impact claim were cognizable under the ADEA, that claim clearly would fail in light of these requirements.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is in this connection that the Report refers to formal employment standards requiring a high school diploma.  See Wirtz Report 3.  The Wirtz Report did say that such a requirement would be \xe2\x80\x9cunfair\xe2\x80\x9d if an older worker\xe2\x80\x99s years of experience had given him an equivalent education.  <em>Ibid.  </em>But the plurality is mistaken to find in this statement a congressional \xe2\x80\x9cgoal\xe2\x80\x9d of eliminating job requirements with a disparate impact on older workers.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa05.
