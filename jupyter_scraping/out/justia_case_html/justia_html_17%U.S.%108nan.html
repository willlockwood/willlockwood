From this decree the present appeal was taken. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 17 U. S. 114</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The bill in this case was filed by the United States in the Circuit Court of the District of Massachusetts to recover from the defendants a sum of money in their hands alleged to be the money of Jacob Shoemaker and Charles R. Travers, merchants and partners, who are stated to be insolvents and to be indebted to the United States for duties.</p>\n<p>It appears that Shoemaker &amp; Travers, on 6 December, 1806, executed an indenture in which, reciting that they are justly indebted to divers persons whose names are expressed in a list thereto annexed and are unable at present to pay the said debts, they assign to trustees therein mentioned all and singular the estate and effects contained in a schedule annexed, in trust to pay the debt due to the enumerated creditors, and first that due to the United States.  The schedule contains many items of property, and among others the proceeds of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 17 U. S. 115</a></p><p> cargo of the <em>Deborah,</em> then at sea.  The <em>Deborah</em> was the property of Howland &amp; Allen, and on her coming into port, her master delivered to her owners a sum of money which he had received at Guadeloupe for Shoemaker &amp; Travers, and which is in the schedule annexed to the deed of assignment already mentioned.  At the hearing, the circuit court dismissed the bill on the opinion that it was not sustainable.  From this decree, the United States has appealed to this Court, and now insists 1. that it is a case in which a court of equity has jurisdiction; 2. that the United States is entitled to priority, this being a case within the provisions of the act of Congress.</p>\n<p>On the first point, no difficulty would be found had the proper parties been before the court.  A trust exists, and an account would be proper to ascertain the sum due from Howland &amp; Allen to Shoemaker &amp; Travers.  The case, even independent of these circumstances, would be proper for a court of chancery but for the act of Massachusetts which allows a creditor to sue the debtor of his debtor.  Still the remedy in chancery, where all parties may be brought before the court, is more complete and adequate, as the sum actually due may be, there in such cases ascertained with more certainty and facility, and as the courts of the Union have a chancery jurisdiction in every state, and the Judiciary Act confers the same chancery powers on all and gives the same rule of decision, its jurisdiction in Massachusetts must be the same as in other states. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 17 U. S. 116</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This being a case of which a court of chancery may take jurisdiction, we are next to inquire whether it is one in which the United States is entitled to priority.  This depends on the fact whether the deed of assignment executed by Shoemaker &amp; Travers was a conveyance of all their property.  The words of the deed, after reciting the motives which led to it and the consideration, are "have granted, &amp;c., and by these presents, do grant," "all and singular the estate and effects which is contained in the schedule hereunto annexed, marked A."  The caption of the schedule is, "Schedule of property assigned by Shoemaker &amp; Travers, and Jacob Shoemaker to the creditors of Shoemaker &amp; Travers."  The deed, then, conveys only the property contained in the schedule, and the schedule does not purport to contain all the property of the parties who made it.  In such a case, the presumption must be that there is property not contained in the deed, unless the contrary appears.  The <em>onus probandi</em> is thrown on the United States.</p>\n<p>It is contended for the United States that the clause which gives the power to sell, by using the words "all the property of them, the said Shoemaker &amp; Travers, and Jacob Shoemaker," indicates clearly that this deed does convey all their property.  But these words are explained and limited by those which follow so as to show that the word "all" is used in reference to the schedule, and means all the property in the schedule.  The depositions do not aid the deed.  The question whether the whole </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 17 U. S. 117</a></p><p> property is assigned is still left to conjecture, and this, being the fact on which the preference of the United States is founded, ought to be proved.  Not being proved, the Court is of opinion this is not a case in which it can be claimed.</p>\n<p>But the United States is the creditor of Shoemaker &amp; Travers, and has a right, as creditor, to proceed against their property in the hands of Howland &amp; Allen.  It has a right to so much of that property as remains after the debt due to Howland &amp; Allen shall be satisfied.  But to ascertain this amount, an account between Holland &amp; Allen and the debtors to the United States should be taken, and the persons against whom the account is to be taken should be parties to the suit.  Although if they cannot be found within the district of Massachusetts, the process of the court cannot reach them, still they may appear without coercion.  At any rate, an account ought to be taken, since the matter controverted between the parties is more proper to be stated by a master than to be decided in court without such report.</p>\n<p>The decree is to be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to allow the plaintiffs to amend the bill and make new parties.  The United States, will, of course, be at liberty to take testimony showing the assignment to be of all the property of the parties who made it.</p>\n<p>DECREE. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts, and was argued by counsel, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 17 U. S. 118</a></p><p> on consideration whereof this Court is of opinion that the circuit court erred in dismissing the bill of the plaintiffs and that its decree ought to be reversed, and it is hereby reversed and annulled, and it is further ordered that the said cause be remanded to the said circuit court with directions to allow the plaintiffs to amend their bill and make new parties.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
