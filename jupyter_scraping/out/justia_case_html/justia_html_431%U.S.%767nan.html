JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The principal issue in this case is the validity of the Illinois obscenity statute, considered in light of <em>Miller v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html">413 U. S. 15</a></span> (1973).  There we reaffirmed numerous prior decisions declaring that "obscene material is unprotected by the First Amendment," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#23">413 U. S. 23</a></span>, but, acknowledging "the inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expression," <em>ibid.,</em> we recognized that official regulation must be limited to "works which depict or describe sexual conduct," and that such conduct "must be specifically defined by the applicable state law, as written or authoritatively construed."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#24">413 U. S. 24</a></span>.  Basic guidelines for the trier of fact, along with more specific suggestions, were then offered:</p>\n<p>"The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be:  (a) whether \'the average person, applying contemporary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="769">Page 431 U. S. 769</a></p><p> community standards\' would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/408/229/case.html">Kois v. Wisconsin,</a></span></em> [408 U.S. 229,]  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/408/229/case.html#230">408 U.

S. 489</a></span> [(1957)]; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.  We do not adopt as a constitutional standard the \'utterly without redeeming social value\' test of <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts,</em> 383 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/383/413/case.html#419">383 U. S. 419</a></span>; that concept has never commanded the adherence of more than three Justices at one time.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/413/15/case.html#21">413 U. S. 21</a></span>.  If a state law that regulates obscene material is thus limited, as written or construed, the First Amendment values applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment are adequately protected by the ultimate power of appellate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims when necessary.  <em>See Kois v. Wisconsin, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/408/229/case.html#232">408 U. S. 232</a></span>; <em>Memoirs v.

That must await their concrete legislative efforts.  It is possible, however, to give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation under part (b) of the standard announced in this opinion, <em>supra:</em>"</p>\n<p>"(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated."</p>\n<p>"(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="770">Page 431 U.

S. 24</a></span>-25. (Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p>Illinois Rev.Stat., c. 38, \xc2\xa7 11-20(a)(1) (1975), forbids the sale of obscene matter.  Section 11-20(b) defines "obscene" as follows:</p>\n<p>"A thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters.  A thing is obscene even though the obscenity is latent, as in the case of undeveloped photographs. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>In October, 1971, appellant Ward was charged in the State of Illinois with having sold two obscene publications in violation of \xc2\xa7 11-20(a)(1).  A jury was waived.  At the bench trial, the State\'s evidence consisted solely of the two publications -- "Bizarre World" and "Illustrated Case Histories, a Study of Sado-Masochism" -- and the testimony of the police officer who purchased them in Ward\'s store.  Ward was found guilty, and in April, 1972, he was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $200.  His conviction was affirmed in the state appellate courts after this Court\'s decision in <em>Miller.</em>  The Illinois Supreme Court expressly rejected his challenge to the constitutionality of the Illinois obscenity statute for failure to conform to the standards of <em>Miller,</em> as well as a claim that the two publications were not obscene.  63 Ill.2d 437, 349 N.E.2d 47 (1976).  Ward appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction, 429 U.S. 1037 (1977), to resolve a conflict with a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="771">Page 431 U. S. 771</a></p><p> decision of a three-judge District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  <em>Eagle Books, Inc. v. Reinhard,</em> 418 F.Supp. 345 (1976), <em>appeal docketed,</em> No. 76-366.  We affirm.</p>\n<p>As we read the questions presented by Ward, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] they fairly subsume four issues.  First, is the claim that Illinois has failed to comply with <em>Miller\'s</em> requirement that the sexual conduct that may not be depicted in a patently offensive way must be "specifically defined by the applicable state law as written or authoritatively construed," <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/767/case.html#768">431 U. S. 768</a></span>, and that, absent such compliance, the Illinois law is unconstitutionally vague because it failed to give him notice that materials dealing with the kind of sexual conduct involved here could not legally be sold in the State.  This claim is wholly without merit.  As we shall see below, the State has complied with <em>Miller,</em> but even if this were not the case, appellant had ample guidance from the Illinois Supreme Court that his conduct did not conform to the Illinois law.  Materials such as these, which, by title or content, may fairly be described as sado-masochistic, had been expressly held to violate the Illinois statute long before <em>Miller</em> and prior to the sales for which Ward was prosecuted.</p>\n<p>In <em>People v. Sikora,</em> 32 Ill.2d 260, 267-268, 204 N.E.2d 768, 772-773 (1965), there are detailed recitations of the kind of sexual conduct depicted in the materials found to be obscene under the Illinois statute.  These recitations included "sadism and masochism." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>See also People v. DeVilbiss,</em> 41 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="772">Page 431 U. S. 772</a></p><p> Ill.2d 135, 142, 242 N.E.2d 761, 765 (1968); [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] <em>cf. Chicago v. Geraci,</em> 46 Ill.2d 576, 582-53, 264 N E.2d 153, 157 (1970). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The construction of the statute in <em>Sikora</em> gives detailed meaning to the Illinois law, is binding on us, and makes plain that \xc2\xa7 11-20 reaches the kind of sexual materials which we now </p><p><a class="page-number" name="773">Page 431 U. S. 773</a></p><p> have before us.  If Ward cannot be convicted for selling these materials, it is for other reasons, and not because the Illinois statute is vague and gave him no notice that the statute purports to ban the kind of materials he sold.  The statute is not vague as applied to Ward\'s conduct.</p>\n<p>Second, Ward appears to assert that sado-masochistic materials may not be constitutionally proscribed because they are not expressly included within the examples of the kinds of sexually explicit representations that <em>Miller</em> used to explicate the aspect of its obscenity definition dealing with patently offensive depictions of specifically defined sexual conduct.  But those specifics were offered merely as "examples," 413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#25">413 U. S. 25</a></span>; and, as later pointed out in <em>Hamling v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html">418 U. S. 87</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html#114">418 U. S. 114</a></span> (1974), they "were not intended to be exhaustive."  Furthermore, there was no suggestion in <em>Miller</em> that we intended to extend constitutional protection to the kind of flagellatory materials that were among those held obscene in <em>Mishkin v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/502/case.html">383 U. S. 502</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/502/case.html#505">383 U. S. 505</a></span>-510 (1966).  If the <em>Mishkin</em> publications remain unprotected, surely those before us today deal with a category of sexual conduct which, if obscenely described, may be proscribed by state law.</p>\n<p>The third claim is simply that these materials are not obscene when examined under the three-part test of <em>Miller.</em>  This argument is also foreclosed by <em>Mishkin v. New York, supra,</em> which came down the same day as <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/413/case.html">383 U. S. 413</a></span> (1966), and which employed the obscenity criteria announced by the latter case.  <em>See Marks v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/case.html">430 U. S. 188</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/188/case.html#194">430 U. S. 194</a></span> (1977).  The courts below examined the materials and found them obscene under the Illinois statute, which, as we shall see, <em>infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/767/case.html#774">431 U. S. 774</a></span>-776, conforms to the standards set out in <em>Miller,</em> except that it retains the stricter <em>Memoirs</em> formulation of the "redeeming social value" factor.  We have found no reason to differ with the Illinois courts.</p>\n<p>Fourth, even assuming that the Illinois statute had been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="774">Page 431 U. S. 774</a></p><p> construed to overcome the vagueness challenge in this case and even assuming that the materials at issue here are not protected under <em>Miller,</em> there remains the claim that Illinois has failed to conform to the <em>Miller</em> requirement that a state obscenity law, as written or authoritatively construed, must state specifically the kinds of sexual conduct the description or representation of which the State intends to proscribe by its obscenity law.  If Illinois has not complied with this requirement, its statute is arguably overbroad, unconstitutional on its face, and an invalid predicate for Ward\'s conviction.</p>\n<p>As we see it, Illinois has not failed to comply with <em>Miller,</em> and its statute is not overbroad.  <em>People v. Ridens,</em> 51 Ill.2d 410, 282 N.E.2d 691 (1972), <em>vacated and remanded,</em> 413 U.S. 912 (1973), involved a conviction under this same Illinois obscenity law.  It was pending on our docket when our judgment and opinion in <em>Miller</em> issued.  We vacated the <em>Ridens</em> judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in the light of <em>Miller.</em>  On remand, the Illinois Supreme Court explained that, originally, \xc2\xa7 1 1-20 had provided the tests for obscenity found in <em>Roth v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U. S. 476</a></span> (1957), and that it subsequently had been construed to incorporate the tripartite standard found in <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts, supra,</em> including the requirement that the materials prohibited be "utterly without redeeming social value."  <em>People v. Ridens,</em> 59 Ill.2d 362, 321 N.E.2d 264 (1974).  The Illinois court then proceeded to "construe section 11-20 of the Criminal Code . . . to incorporate parts (a) and (b) of the <em>Miller</em> standards," <em>id.</em> at 373, 321 N.E.2d at 270, but to retain the "utterly without redeeming social value" standard of <em>Memoirs</em> in preference to the more relaxed criterion contained in part (c) of the <em>Miller</em> guidelines.  <em>Ridens\'</em> conviction was affirmed, and we denied certiorari. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/993/case.html">421 U. S. 993</a></span> (1975). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="775">Page 431 U. S. 775</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Because the Illinois court did not go further and expressly describe the kinds of sexual conduct intended to be referred to under part (b) of the <em>Miller</em> guidelines, the issue is whether the Illinois obscenity law is open-ended and overbroad.  As we understand the Illinois Supreme Court, however, the statute is not vulnerable in this respect.  That court expressly incorporated into the statute part (b) of the guidelines, which requires inquiry "whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law."  413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#24">413 U. S. 24</a></span>.  The Illinois court thus must have been aware of the need for specificity and of the <em>Miller</em> Court\'s examples explaining the reach of part (b).  <em>See id.</em> at 25.  The Illinois court plainly intended to conform the Illinois law to part (b) of <em>Miller,</em> and there is no reason to doubt that, in incorporating the guideline as part of the law, the Illinois court intended as well to adopt the <em>Miller</em> examples, which gave substantive meaning to part (b) by indicating the kinds of materials within its reach.  The alternative reading of the decision would lead us to the untenable conclusion that the Illinois Supreme Court chose to create a fatal flaw in its statute by refusing to take cognizance of the specificity requirement set down in <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p>Furthermore, in a later case, <em>People v. Gould,</em> 60 Ill.2d 159, 324 N.E.2d 412 (1975), the Illinois Supreme Court quoted at length from <em>Miller v. California,</em> including the entire passage set out at the beginning of this opinion, <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/767/case.html#768">431 U. S. 768</a></span>-770 -- a passage that contains the explanatory examples as well as the guidelines.  It then stated that <em>Ridens</em> had construed the Illinois statute to include parts (a) and (b) of the <em>Miller</em> guidelines, and it expressly referred to the standards set out in the immediately preceding quotation from <em>Miller.</em>  60 Ill.2d at 164-165, 324 N.E.2d at 415.  Because the quotation contained not only part (b) but the examples given to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="776">Page 431 U. S. 776</a></p><p> explain that part, it would be a needlessly technical and wholly unwarranted reading of the Illinois opinions to conclude that the state court did not adopt these explanatory examples as well as the guidelines themselves.</p>\n<p>It might be argued that, whether or not the Illinois court adopted the <em>Miller</em> examples as part of its law, \xc2\xa7 11-20 nevertheless remains overbroad because the State has not provided an exhaustive list of the sexual conduct the patently offensive description of which may be held obscene under the statute.  We agree with the Illinois Supreme Court, however, that,</p>\n<p>"in order that a statute be held overbroad, the overbreadth \'must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\'s plainly legitimate sweep.\'  (<em>Broadrick v.

Since it is plain enough from its prior cases and from its response to <em>Miller</em> that the Illinois court recognizes the limitations on the kinds of sexual conduct which may not be represented or depicted under the obscenity laws, we cannot hold the Illinois statute to be unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p>Given that Illinois has adopted <em>Miller\'s</em> explanatory examples, what the State has done in attempting to bring its statute in conformity with <em>Miller</em> is surely as much as this Court did in its post-<em>Miller</em> construction of federal obscenity statutes.

Schauer, The Law of Obscenity 167 (1976).  Like most pre-<em>Miller</em> obscenity statutes, the Illinois statute contained open-ended terms broad enough to prohibit the distribution of any material making an "appeal . . . to prurient interest." [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  In its post-<em>Miller</em> opinions, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="779">Page 431 U.

S. 780</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this Court affirms the conviction in this Illinois case on two theories.  The first is that this particular defendant had notice that the State considered these materials obscene, because prior Illinois cases had upheld obscenity convictions concerning similar material.  But, if such notice is all that is required, it is difficult to understand why the <em>Miller</em> case itself was remanded for consideration of the specificity issue, <em>see</em> 413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#37">413 U. S. 37</a></span>.  For the description of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 431 U. S. 781</a></p><p> the materials involved in <em>Miller</em> leaves no room for doubt that they were similar to materials which had often been the subject of prosecutions in the past; [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] there clearly was no question of fair notice. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s second theory is that, in any event, the Illinois statute is sufficiently specific to satisfy <em>Miller.</em>  Although the statute does not contain an "exhaustive list" of specific examples, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/767/case.html#776">431 U. S. 776</a></span>, it passes muster because it contains a generic reference to "the <em>kinds</em> of sexual conduct which may not be represented or depicted under the obscenity laws. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in original).  To hold that the list need not be exhaustive is to hold that a person can be prosecuted although the materials he sells are not specifically described in the list.  Only five years ago, the Court promised that "no one" could be so prosecuted, <em>Miller,</em> 413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#27">413 U. S. 27</a></span>.  And if the statute need only describe the "kinds" of proscribed sexual conduct, it adds no protection to what the Constitution itself creates.  For in <em>Jenkins v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/153/case.html">418 U. S. 153</a></span>, this Court held that the Constitution protected all expression which is not "within either of the two examples given in <em>Miller</em>" or "sufficiently similar to such material to justify similar treatment."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/153/case.html#161">418 U. S. 161</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 431 U. S. 782</a></p><p></p>\n<p>One of the strongest arguments against regulating obscenity through criminal law is the inherent vagueness of the obscenity concept.  The specificity requirement as described in <em>Miller</em> held out the promise of a principled effort to respond to that argument.  By abandoning that effort today, the Court withdraws the cornerstone of the <em>Miller</em> structure and, undoubtedly, hastens its ultimate downfall. Although the decision is therefore a mixed blessing, I nevertheless respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"That conduct must be specifically defined by the applicable state law, as written or authoritatively construed. . . ."</p>\n<p>"The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be:  . . .

S. 114</a></span>.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>In a well reasoned opinion, a three-Judge District Court for the Northern District of Illinois carefully reviewed the Illinois authorities and concluded that Illinois has failed to meet the specificity requirement of <em>Miller.</em> <em>Eagle Books, Inc. v. Reinhard,</em> 418 F.Supp. 345 (ND Ill.1976).  This conclusion is well founded.</p>\n<p>The Illinois statute defines obscenity in these terms:</p>\n<p>"A thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters."</p>\n<p>Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 38, \xc2\xa7 11-20(b) (1975).  Nothing in this definition or the rest of the statute "specifically defines" what depiction of hard-core sexual conduct is prohibited.</p>\n<p>The Illinois Supreme Court has not remedied this deficiency by supplying a limiting construction.  In its primary discussion of the State\'s obscenity statute in relation to the <em>Miller</em> specificity requirement, <em>People v. Ridens,</em> 59 Ill.2d 362, 321 N.E.2d 264 (1974) (<em>Ridens II</em>), the Illinois Supreme Court relied on two cases to uphold the statute.  In the first case, <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/case.html">408 U. S. 104</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/case.html#110">408 U. S. 110</a></span>, this Court noted in language quoted by the Illinois court that "[t]he words of the Rockford ordinance are marked by <em>flexibility and reasonable breadth, rather than meticulous specificity. . . . \'"  The second case which the <em>Ridens II</em> court relied upon was its own decision in <em>People v. Raby,</em> 40 Ill.2d 392, 240 N.E.2d 595 (1968).  That case concerned the alleged vagueness of a statute designed to prohibit public disorder.  The Illinois court quoted the following language from <em>Raby,</em> and in the next sentence relied upon that decision and <em>Grayned</em> in upholding the statute\'s specificity:\n</em></p>\n<p>"It is true that section 26-I(a) does not attempt to particularize all of the myriad kinds of conduct that may fall within the statute.  The legislature deliberately chose to frame the provision in general terms, prompted by the futility of an effort to anticipate and enumerate all of the methods of disrupting public order that fertile minds might devise."</p>\n<p>40 Ill.2d at 396, 240 N.E.2d at 598.  Neither of these decisions requires conduct to be specifically defined; indeed, <em>Raby</em> notes that, to survive a vagueness attack, a statute need not "attempt to particularize all of the myriad kinds of conduct" within its bounds.  This may be true for other vagueness attacks, but does not square with the special <em>Miller</em> requirement that conduct be specifically defined.  Nowhere else in the <em>Ridens II</em> opinion does the Illinois Supreme Court limit the reach of the obscenity statute.</p>\n<p>In the present case, the Illinois Supreme Court again considered the specificity problem, and again refused to narrow the statute:</p>\n<p>"It was held in <em>Ridens II</em> that the obscenity statute was sufficiently clear and that it adequately informed the public of the conduct whose depiction is proscribed.  We noted that the statutory definition of obscenity includes within the scope of the \'prurient interest\' a \'shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion.\'  The defendant argues that we erred in <em>Ridens II</em> in our interpretation of <em>Miller,</em> and that <em>Miller</em> requires obscenity statutes to be much more specific in defining the type of material which will be considered obscene.  We see no reason to reconsider our decision in <em>Ridens II.</em>  It is extremely difficult to define the term \'obscenity\' with a fine degree of precision.  We again express our opinion that Illinois\' statutory definition is sufficiently clear to withstand constitutional objections."</p>\n<p>63 Ill.2d 437, 441, 349 N.E.2d 47, 49 (1976).</p>\n<p>Thus, there does not appear to be anything in the Illinois decisions that would preclude the State from prosecuting forms of obscenity not "specifically defined" in prior decisions.  And, as noted above, the statute provides no specific definition in this area.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The materials are described as follows in the opinion:</p>\n<p>"While the brochures contain some descriptive printed material, primarily they consist of pictures and drawings very explicitly depicting men and women in groups of two or more engaging in a variety of sexual activities, with genitals often prominently displayed."</p>\n<p>413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#18">413 U.
